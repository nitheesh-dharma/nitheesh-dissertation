</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Neonatal seizures are a common problem and most neonates with seizures are treated with anticonvulsants. There is wide variation in clinical practice in both diagnosis and treatment of such seizures and this reflects the lack of clear evidence of the relative benefit and harm of the anticonvulsants used. The routine use of anticonvulsants to treat seizures in neonates needs to be evaluated.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess and compare (with respect to benefits and harm) different anticonvulsants administered to neonates for the <I>treatment </I>of established seizures.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Relevant randomised controlled trials were identified using a combination of electronic database searches (MEDLINE 1966 - March 2004, EMBASE 1980 - March 2004), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2004) and hand searches. Identification of ongoing or unpublished trials was attempted by contacting prominent authors in the field and searching electronic registers of ongoing trials.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All randomised or quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials with reported data comparing the following outcomes: mortality, neurodevelopmental disability, need for additional anticonvulsants, need for maintenance anticonvulsants at discharge and adverse events (hypotension requiring volume or inotropic support, arrhythmia, respiratory depression, hepatotoxicity) in neonates treated for seizures with systemic anticonvulsants compared to placebo, no drug or alternative anticonvulsants.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Methodological quality and validity were assessed without consideration of the results. The first reviewer screened the title and abstracts of studies identified by the above search strategy. Full text versions of studies of potential relevance were re-screened by both reviewers. Studies meeting the pre-specified inclusion criteria were included. Relevant data were extracted and analysed separately and any disagreements were resolved by discussion.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Only two randomised controlled trials published in full could be identified. Painter 1999 showed that both of the two most commonly used anticonvulsants (phenobarbital and phenytoin) were similarly effective (RR 1.03 95% CI 0.96 to 1.62), controlling seizures in less than fifty percent of infants. Painter 1999 did not report mortality or neurodevelopmental outcome. Boylan 2004 randomised infants who failed to respond to phenobarbital to receive either lidocaine or midazolam as second-line agents. There was a trend for lidocaine to be more effective in reducing seizure burden (RR 0.40 95% CI 0.14 to 1.17) but both groups had similarly poor long term outcomes assessed at one year.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>At present there is little evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the use of any of the anticonvulsants currently used in the neonatal period. In the literature, there remains a body of opinion that seizures should be treated because of the concern that seizures in themselves may be harmful, although this is only supported by relatively low grade evidence (Levene 2002; Massingale 1993).</P>
<P>Development of safe and effective treatment strategies relies on future studies of high quality (randomised controlled trials with methodology that assures validity) and of sufficient size to have the power to detect clinically important reductions in mortality and severe neurodevelopmental disability in addition to any short term reduction in seizure burden. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-10-16 10:12:54 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Neonatal seizures are common: estimates of the incidence of clinical seizures in term infants range from 0.7 to 2.7 per 1000 live births and from 57.5 to 132 per 1000 live births in premature infants (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 1998</LINK>). The incidence of clinically silent (electrographic) seizures is unknown. Seizures represent a manifestation of neuronal compromise from a wide variety of etiologies. Seizures can substantially increase CNS metabolic demand (<LINK REF="REF-Younkin-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Younkin 1986</LINK>), cause the release of excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate (<LINK REF="REF-McDonald-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 1990</LINK>), lead to fluctuations in systemic arterial pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Clozel-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clozel 1985</LINK>) and result in hypoxia and hypercapnia. Thus seizures might themselves cause further neuronal injury although the effects of seizures on brain development are difficult to differentiate from the effects of the brain lesions causing the seizures. The prognosis following neonatal seizures is therefore varied. Mortality rates of 21% - 58% have been reported following neonatal seizures (<LINK REF="REF-Andre-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andre 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scher-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scher 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Watkins-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watkins 1988</LINK>). There is also evidence that neonatal seizures have an adverse effect on neurodevelopmental progression and may predispose to cognitive, behavioural or epileptic complications later in life (<LINK REF="REF-Temple-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Temple 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Levene-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levene 2002</LINK>). The natural history of neonatal seizures is unknown but observations suggest that they may abate regardless of intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Painter-1999b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Painter 1999b</LINK>). However, there is general consensus that neonatal seizures should be treated, particularly if they are frequent or prolonged.</P>
<P>The treatment of neonatal seizures has changed little over the last 50 years. Most neonates who have seizures are treated and the most common treatments are either phenobarbital or phenytoin. The efficacy of phenobarbital is unproven and is often ineffective as a first line anticonvulsant in neonates (<LINK REF="REF-Boylan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boylan 2002</LINK>). There is no evidence that administering anticonvulsants to prevent seizures following hypoxic-ischaemic injury in term newborns is beneficial (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Anticonvulsants may produce side effects (<LINK REF="REF-Wallace-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wallace 1996</LINK>). Most anticonvulsants, in particular benzodiazepines, will cause sedation and if given in sufficient dose, they will reduce respiratory effort and the infant may require ventilatory support (<LINK REF="REF-Ng-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ng 2002</LINK>). Phenytoin, lidocaine and, to some extent, phenobarbital impair myocardial function and can cause hypotension or arrhythmia. A well recognised side effect of sodium valproate is its hepatotoxicity (<LINK REF="REF-Painter-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Painter 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>When undertaking a review on the treatment of seizures, two major problems exist. The first is the definition of what constitutes a seizure requiring treatment and the second is the heterogeneity of etiology. There is poor concordance between clinical and electrical (EEG) evidence of seizure activity (<LINK REF="REF-Mizrahi-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mizrahi 1987</LINK>). Many studies use different methods of seizure recognition (e.g. clinical surveillance, EEG detection following initial clinical suspicion, continuous EEG monitoring). This leads to heterogeneity of seizure definition and a difference in severity of treated seizures between studies. Secondly, the etiology of the seizure, rather than anticonvulsant therapy, may have the greater bearing upon the outcome.</P>
<P>In this review we have adopted an inclusive approach to the definition and etiology of seizures. We will include neonates with either clinical or electrographic seizures, or both. We will attempt, where possible, to categorise the results according to seizure aetiology.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>Primary objectives:</P>
<UL>
<LI>In neonates suffering from seizures, does anticonvulsant therapy (compared to placebo or no anticonvulsant therapy) reduce neonatal mortality and long-term neurodevelopmental disability?</LI>
<LI>In neonates suffering from seizures, does one particular anticonvulsant (compared to an alternative anticonvulsant) reduce neonatal mortality and long-term neurodevelopmental disability?</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>Secondary objectives include need for additional anticonvulsants to gain seizure control during the neonatal period, proportion of infants discharged home on maintenance anticonvulsants, and an assessment of the adverse effects of anticonvulsants (see outcome criteria below).</P>
<P>Subgroup analyses are planned on the basis of:</P>
<P>(a) Gestation (preterm &lt;37 weeks, term &gt;=37 weeks)<BR/>(b) Method of seizure detection (clinical alone, EEG alone, clinical and EEG)<BR/>(c) Etiology of seizure (hypoxia-ischaemia, infective, metabolic, malformation)<BR/>(d) Class of anticonvulsant (barbiturate, benzodiazepines, other).</P>

</CRIT_OUTCOMES>
</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>The standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used. This included electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2004), MEDLINE (1966-March 2004) and EMBASE (1980-March 2004). No language restriction was applied.</P>
<P>The electronic search strategy involved the following keywords, using the search fields of abstract, MeSH subject heading, exploded subject heading, subject heading word, text word and title: explode "Infant-Newborn/ all subheadings" OR Neonat* AND explode "Seizures"/ all subheadings OR Convuls* OR Seizur* AND explode "Anticonvulsants"/ all subheadings OR Anticonvul* OR [MeSH term for the particular anticonvulsant (exploded)] OR [textword terms for particular anticonvulsant]. The MEDLINE and EMBASE searches were assessed with and without combination with the search filter for randomised controlled trials (see Appendix 5c of the Cochrane Handbook).</P>

<P>4. International registers of ongoing clinical trials: internet-based trials registers were searched for ongoing trials. The registers searched were:<BR/>Trials Central (www.trialscentral.org) which is a database of clinical trials registers that gives access to Current Controlled Trials, made up of two registers, ISRCTN (a database of randomised controlled trials with an international randomised controlled trial number) and mRCT (metaRegister of controlled trials), a database combining registers of ongoing randomised controlled trials in all areas of healthcare. Trials Central also links to the Australasian Perinatal Trials Registry.<BR/>These registers were searched using keywords neonatal, perinatal, seizure and anticonvulsant.</P>
<P>5. Personal communication with authors of identified trials was undertaken in order to identify any trials, ongoing or unpublished that may not have been identified by the outlined search strategies.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>The first reviewer screened the title and abstract of studies identified by the above search strategy. Both reviewers re-screened the full text of the report of each study identified as of potential relevance. Studies meeting any of the pre-specified inclusion criteria were included.</P>
<P>The criteria and standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group were used to assess the methodological quality of the included trials. Quality of the trials included was evaluated in terms of allocation concealment, blinding of intervention, completeness of assessment in all randomised individuals and blinding of outcome assessment. The methodological quality of these components of the study design were scored as follows: </P>
<P>Selection bias (Allocation concealment - Section 6 of the Cochrane Handbook):<BR/>A = adequate, B = can't tell / unclear, C = not used / inadequate.</P>
<P>Performance bias (blinding of caretakers to the intervention):<BR/>Adequate; Can't tell / unclear; not used / inadequate.</P>
<P>Attrition bias (post-randomisation exclusions and loss to follow-up):<BR/>Where possible, the number of losses will be expressed as a percentage of the number assigned to each group</P>
<P>Detection bias (blinding of outcome assessment):<BR/>Adequate (where the outcome assessor was unaware, or was unlikely to correctly identify, treatment allocation); Can't tell / unclear; Not used / inadequate (includes studies where effects, or side effects, of treatment meant that it was likely that the treatment allocation could be correctly identified in a significant proportion (&gt;20%) of participants).</P>
<P>A data collection form was used to aid extraction of the relevant information and data. Each reviewer extracted the data separately, compared data and resolved differences by consensus after discussion.</P>
<P>The treatment effects of individual trials were examined by comparing groups allocated to the treatment under study (anticonvulsant therapy versus placebo or no anticonvulsant or therapy with alternative anticonvulsant(s)). Data relating to the primary and secondary outcomes (described above) were compared. Where relevant and if possible, relative risk (RR) and risk difference (RD) were calculated for dichotomous data and weighted mean difference (WMD) for continuous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for all analyses. The number needed to treat (NNT) and associated 95% CI were determined for a statistically significant reduction in the RD. Analysis of outcome data was by intention to treat. Where relevant, meta-analyses was performed using the fixed effects model. Where relevant and if possible, heterogeneity between trial results was examined using the <I>I</I>
<I>
<SUP>2 </SUP>
</I>test for dichotomous outcomes and ANOVA for continuous outcomes. <BR/>

<LINK REF="REF-Painter-1999b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Painter 1999b</LINK> compared phenobarbital with phenytoin for the treatment of neonatal seizures. Infants on the neonatal unit with one or more risk factors for seizures were enrolled and subsequently screened by electroencephalography. If screening met specific criteria for epileptiform activity, the infants were randomly assigned to receive either phenobarbital or phenytoin. Infants with clinical seizures only (without electroencephalographic evidence of epileptiform activity) were not randomised. 30 infants were assigned to phenobarbital and 29 to phenytoin. In both treatment groups, one third were premature infants and two thirds were term infants. The primary endpoint was complete control of seizures, determined electroencephalographically, during treatment with one drug or after addition of the second drug. Treatment failure was defined as the occurrence of any electrical seizure after target plasma concentrations of free drug had been achieved. Crossover to the second drug was initiated if continuous seizure activity occurred for greater than 2.5 minutes or if there was 2.5 minutes of seizure activity within any 5 minute period. No adverse events were noted with either anticonvulsant.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Boylan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Boylan 2004</LINK> compared benzodiazepines and lidocaine for second-line treatment of neonatal seizures in a video-EEG monitoring study. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive either midazolam (3 infants) or lidocaine (5 infants) after treatment failure with phenobarbitone. Failure to control seizures within 12 hours of second line treatment was followed by an increase in the dose of the allocated drug. The primary endpoint was control of electroencephalographic seizures (either complete absence or 80% reduction of pre-treatment burden). Neurodevelopmental outcome was assessed at 1 year. No adverse events were reported during treatment with any anticonvulsant.<BR/>

<I>Selection</I>
</P>
<P>The study by <LINK REF="REF-Painter-1999b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Painter 1999b</LINK> ensured balanced treatment assignment over time by stratifying subjects with respect to race and gestational age prior to randomisation within strata. Physicians, hospital staff and EEG technicians were aware of treatment assignments but it is unclear whether allocation concealment occurred.</P>
<P>The study by <LINK REF="STD-Boylan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Boylan 2004</LINK> treated all infants with EEG confirmed seizures with phenobarbitone; if this failed to abolish seizures within 12 hours, the infants were randomised to receive either midazolam or lidocaine as a second line anticonvulsant. Consent was requested before randomisation to second-line anticonvulsant. Concealment of allocation to treatment is unclear.<BR/>If parents were not willing to allow treatment based on a random choice of drug, clonazepam was used instead of either of the trial drugs and these infants were not included in the analysis.</P>

<P>In <LINK REF="REF-Painter-1999b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Painter 1999b</LINK>, treatment failure with either phenobarbital or phenytoin as first-line anticonvulsant led to use of the other anticonvulsant (as add-on therapy) as part of the study protocol. As such, treatment failure occurred in 17 of the 30 infants initially treated with phenobarbital and 15 of these 17 went on to add-on treatment with phenytoin. Of the 29 randomly assigned to phenytoin, treatment failure occurred in 16 and 13 of these 16 had add-on treatment with phenobarbital.

<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Painter-1999b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Painter 1999b</LINK> defined seizure control as complete control of seizures as determined electroencephalographically. An 80% reduction in the severity of seizures (calculated as mean severity per hour) as compared to seizure severity in the period prior to initial drug administration, was arbitrarily defined as 'successful treatment'. Phenobarbital controlled seizures in 13 of 30 neonates (43%). Phenytoin controlled seizures in 13 of 29 neonates (45%). RR for failure of seizure control (phenobarbital v phenytoin) 1.03 (95% CI 0.65-1.62).</P>
<P>Subsequent administration of phenytoin to the phenobarbital non-responders resulted in seizure control in an additional 4 subjects. Administration of phenobarbital to the phenytoin non-responders resulted in seizure control in an additional 5 subjects.<BR/>In addition to complete seizure control, the authors describe successful treatment (80% reduction in seizure activity) in a further 7 infants initially assigned to phenobarbital and in a further 3 infants initially assigned to phenytoin.</P>
<P>The authors report that the electroencephalographically assessed severity of seizure activity prior to treatment was strongly inversely related to the successful control of seizures. Severity was measured in channel-seconds per hour; 3000 or less was defined as mild, 20000 or more as severe and between these two as moderate. 10% of infants with a severe seizure burden responded to treatment, whereas 88% with mild burden responded. The initial drug treatment did not affect this association.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-10-16 10:12:54 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The heterogeneity of seizure definition, the differences in severity of treated seizures between studies and the fact that the etiology of the seizure, rather than anticonvulsant therapy, may have a greater bearing upon the eventual outcome, all contribute to the difficulties in assessing studies of the treatment of neonatal seizures.</P>
<P>Despite an inclusive approach to definitions and etiology, we found no data available from randomised controlled trials comparing anticonvulsant to placebo or no treatment that address the important question of whether attempting to control neonatal seizures with any anticonvulsant has any measurable impact on the most important outcomes, namely mortality or neurodevelopmental impairment.<BR/>
<BR/>From studies comparing anticonvulsants, there are insufficient data available to support the use of one anticonvulsant over another.</P>
<P>In the literature, there remains a body of opinion that seizures should be treated because of the concern that seizures in themselves may be harmful, although this is only supported by relatively low-grade evidence (<LINK REF="REF-Levene-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levene 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Massingale-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Massingale 1993</LINK>).</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is no evidence from randomised controlled trials that either supports or fails to support the use of anticonvulsant therapy for the treatment of seizures in neonates. Data from randomised controlled trials to support the choice of anticonvulsant are limited, and no definite recommendations based on available data can be made.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The majority of neonatal seizures in neonates occur against a background of pre-existing brain damage. The question of whether seizures per se are harmful to the developing brain is an extremely important question that remains largely unanswered.<BR/> <BR/>It is possible that, against the background of pre-existing brain damage, the additional adverse effects of seizures on the important outcomes of death and neurodevelopmental impairment will be small. Therefore, the question of whether treatment of such seizures confers benefit will require further randomised controlled trials <I>of sufficient size </I>to have the power to detect changes in the rates of clinically important outcomes, such as mortality and severe neurodevelopmental disability.</P>
<P>The two studies assessed here use specific electroencephalographic (EEG) criteria in defining seizures; future studies must use EEG or at the very least amplitude-integrated EEG criteria and should not rely on clinical seizure detection alone. The heterogeneity of seizure aetiology in this population should be addressed in study design since treatment effects for one aetiological group cannot be assumed to be applicable to other groups.</P>
<P>It would be preferable to stratify randomization by seizure etiology (although this is difficult, as many etiologies are not apparent at the time of randomization). Nevertheless, we suggest that infants should be stratified according to gestation (preterm versus term) and where an hypoxic-ischaemic etiology is suspected.<BR/> <BR/>We feel that the lack of evidence with regard to seizure treatment justifies future study using placebo comparison. If investigators do not find this approach ethically acceptable, alternatives may be to use high treatment threshold versus low treatment thresholds or high dose versus low dose anticonvulsant strategies.</P>
<P>The issue of adverse effects of drug treatments should be given prominence in future studies, with adverse effects clearly defined at the outset and clearly stated in the published reports.</P>

However, the group of infants with seizures were not randomised or reported separately from the group of subjects as a whole. As such, extraction of data relating only to infants with seizures was not possible. In addition, the treatment (magnesium sulphate) was not part of the a priori list of anticonvulsants studied in this review.</P>
