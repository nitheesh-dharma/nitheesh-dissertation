<DESCRIPTION>
<P>This review has been updated in the following ways:<BR/>
<BR/>1. A new literature search was run covering trials published up to October 2006.<BR/>2. One new trial has been published since the previous version of the review.<BR/>3. This trial was included in the analysis. The results from this trial confirmed that low tidal volumes improve survival in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).<BR/>4. The title of the review has changed from "Ventilation with lower tidal volumes versus traditional tidal volumes in adults for acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome" to "Lung protective ventilation strategy for the acute respiratory distress syndrome". This is because it emerged from the updating that additional (but subordinate) factors other than low tidal volume are involved. The favourable outcome depends on low volume AND low pressure. Positive end expiration pressure (PEEP) is not a determinant of outcome. Thus, as it is a strategy rather than a single intervention the title has been changed to a more general one.</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-12-27 23:51:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Critically ill people affected by severe, acute respiratory failure need air to be pumped into their lungs (mechanical ventilation) to survive. Mechanical support buys time for the lungs to heal. Nevertheless, 35% to 65% still die. Several studies have suggested that mechanical breathing can also cause lung damage and bleeding. A new lung protective way of mechanical ventilation was tested in large studies. In this third update of the Cochrane review we searched the databases until September 2012 but we did not find any new study which was eligible for inclusion. The total number of studies remained unchanged, six trials involving 1297 people. This systematic review shows that a gentler form of mechanical breathing (so-called protective ventilation) can decrease deaths in the short term, by 26% on average, but the effects in the long term are uncertain or unknown.</P>

<P>Patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute lung injury require mechanical ventilatory support. Acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute lung injury are further complicated by ventilator-induced lung injury. Lung protective ventilation strategies may lead to improved survival. This systematic review is an update of a Cochrane review originally published in 2003 and updated in 2007.</P>

<P>To assess the effects of ventilation with lower tidal volume on morbidity and mortality in patients aged 16 years or older affected by acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute lung injury.

<P>In our previous 2007 updated review, we searched databases from inception until 2006. In this third updated review, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and the Web of Science from 2006 to September 2012. We also updated our search of databases of ongoing research and of reference lists from 2006 to September 2012.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-12-27 21:07:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomized controlled trials comparing ventilation using either a lower tidal volume (Vt) or low airway driving pressure (plateau pressure 30 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O or less), resulting in a tidal volume of 7 ml/kg or less, versus ventilation that used Vt in the range of 10 to 15 ml/kg in adults (16 years old or older) with acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute lung injury.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-12-27 21:14:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We did not find any new study which were eligible for inclusion in this update. The total number of studies remained unchanged, six trials involving 1297 patients. Five trials had a low risk of bias. One trial had an unclear risk of bias. Mortality at day 28 was significantly reduced by lung-protective ventilation with a relative risk (RR) of 0.74 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61 to 0.88); hospital mortality was reduced with a RR of 0.80 (95% CI 0.69 to 0.92). Overall mortality was not significantly different if a plateau pressure less than or equal to 31 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O in the control group was used (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.45). There was insufficient evidence for morbidity and long-term outcomes.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-12-27 21:16:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Clinical heterogeneity, such as different lengths of follow up and higher plateau pressure in control arms in two trials, makes the interpretation of the combined results difficult. Mortality was significantly reduced at day 28 and at the end of the hospital stay. The effects on long-term mortality are unknown, although the possibility of a clinically relevant benefit cannot be excluded. Ventilation with lower tidal volumes is becoming a routine strategy of treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute lung injury, stopping investigators from carrying out additional trials.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-01-02 18:13:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common, devastating clinical syndrome of acute lung injury that affects both medical and surgical patients. It is clinically characterized by severe hypoxaemia, radiographic evidence of bilateral pulmonary infiltration and absence of left heart failure. Acute lung injury (ALI) is a subset of ARDS with less severe impairment in oxygenation. A recent study has estimated the incidence of this disease to be between 15 and 34 cases per 100,000 inhabitants per year (<LINK REF="REF-Frutos_x002d_Vivar-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frutos-Vivar 2004</LINK>). According to a prospective cohort study, the prevalence of ARDS and ALI was about 9% amongst intensive care patients, and 39.6% amongst ventilated patients (<LINK REF="REF-Roupie-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roupie 1999</LINK>). The mortality rate from ARDS and ALI is approximately 35% to 65% (<LINK REF="REF-Esteban-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esteban 2008</LINK>). There is also short- and long-term morbidity associated with these syndromes. Short-term morbidity leads to a prolonged stay in the intensive care unit and prolonged ventilator dependence (<LINK REF="REF-Davidson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davidson 1999</LINK>). Those who survive the illness have a reduced health-related quality of life as well as cognitive impairment and high rates of disability (<LINK REF="REF-Dowdy-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dowdy 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Recently, a new definition of ARDS, based on the degree of hypoxaemia, was proposed (<LINK REF="REF-Ranieri-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ranieri 2012</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-12-27 21:27:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Mechanical ventilation (MV) represents the main therapeutic support to maintain acceptable pulmonary gas exchange whilst treating the underlying disease. ARDS is associated with a reduction in static compliance (<LINK REF="REF-Marini-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marini 1990</LINK>). As a result of this low compliance, high pressures are needed to obtain a sufficient tidal volume. The larger the tidal volume the higher the pressure required, which may lead to barotrauma, that is, alveolar rupture and radiological evidence of extra-alveolar air. In such patients, mechanical ventilation could lead to injury due to over-distension. This results from the distribution of the increased tidal volume to the high-compliance regions causing stretching and sheer forces on the alveolar wall (volutrauma) (<LINK REF="REF-Dreyfuss-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dreyfuss 1998</LINK>). Plateau pressure, defined as airway pressure during the end-expiratory pause, roughly reflects the level of alveolar over-distension. Finally, parts of the lung are consolidated and are thus not recruitable. This leads to fewer alveoli truly being ventilated; hence a 'normal' tidal volume may not be appropriate for those remaining alveoli. Damage caused by MV to the lungs has been termed ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-12-27 23:52:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Better understanding of the pathophysiology of ARDS and of VILI have led to the proposal that airway pressure and tidal volume should be limited in managing the ventilation of ARDS patients (<LINK REF="REF-Artigas-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Artigas 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hickling-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hickling 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hickling-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hickling 1994</LINK>). This entails accepting a rise in the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide. In addition, cyclic inflation-deflation of injured lung units or alveoli can exacerbate lung injury (<LINK REF="REF-Dreyfuss-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dreyfuss 1998</LINK>), and medium to high levels of positive end-expiration pressure (PEEP) should be used to keep alveoli open throughout the ventilatory cycle. Overall, this type of approach has been termed a lung protective ventilation strategy (<LINK REF="REF-Artigas-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Artigas 1998</LINK>). Ventilation with lower tidal volumes was also associated with lower levels of systemic inflammatory mediators (<LINK REF="STD-Ranieri-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ranieri 1999</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-12-27 21:31:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Lowering the tidal volume is possibly not without hazards (<LINK REF="REF-Roupie-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roupie 1999</LINK>). Severe hypercapnia and acidosis can have adverse effects, including increased intracranial pressure, depressed myocardial contractility, pulmonary hypertension and depressed renal blood flow (<LINK REF="REF-Feihl-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feihl 1994</LINK>). The view that these risks are preferable to the higher plateau pressure required to achieve normocapnia has represented a substantial shift in ventilatory management.</P>

</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2012-12-27 23:53:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The objective of this systematic review was to compare ventilation with a lower tidal volume, with lower or higher PEEP, and ventilation with conventional tidal volume, with lower or higher PEEP, to determine whether such a lung protective ventilation strategy (LPVS) reduced morbidity and mortality in critically ill adults affected by ALI or ARDS.</P>

<P>A protective ventilation strategy that used lower tidal volume or low airway driving pressure (plateau 30 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O or less), or a combination of the two, which resulted in a tidal volume of 7 ml/kg or less versus conventional mechanical ventilation that used a tidal volume in the range of 10 to 15 ml/kg. Protective ventilation or conventional ventilation may include lower or higher levels of PEEP. Regardless of the strategy used to deliver the interventions, the two study groups had to differ only in the tidal volume and not for other elements of the associated ventilatory strategy. Hypercapnia (as an unavoidable part of the protective ventilation intervention) was accepted as long as the resulting acidosis was controlled and kept within acceptable ranges and those ranges were clearly stated.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2012-12-27 22:05:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>We judged the quality of each trial by whether or not the study design had minimized bias within the scope of the clinical context.

<P>We defined high-quality trials as: controlled, appropriately randomized, having adequate concealment of allocation, and completeness of follow up according to an intention-to-treat analysis. We judged the concealment of allocation as adequate if the trials took adequate measures to conceal allocation through central randomization, such as serially numbered opaque envelopes or a table of random numbers. We judged the generation of allocation sequence as adequate where trials were deemed to have a satisfactory sequence generation (random numbers generated by computers, drawing of lots of envelopes).</P>
<P>For the individual trial results, we calculated relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) and number needed to treat (NNT) for categorical outcomes. We reported mean differences (MDs) (and 95% CIs) for continuous variables, if appropriate.</P>

This measure describes the proportion of total variation in study estimates that is due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error. We used the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic as an interpretation of the extent of heterogeneity. Values of I<SUP>2</SUP> less than 56% and higher than 31% account for 'moderate' heterogeneity.

<P>We did not find any studies, in addition to our previous six trials (<LINK REF="STD-Amato-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Amato 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ARDS-Network-2000" TYPE="STUDY">ARDS Network 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brochard-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Brochard 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brower-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Brower 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stewart-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Villar-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Villar 2006</LINK>), that were assessed for methodological quality (<I>see</I> <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table). All of the included studies were multi-centre trials.</P>
<P>The total number of patients randomized in each study varied from 52 (<LINK REF="STD-Brower-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Brower 1999</LINK>) to 861 (<LINK REF="STD-ARDS-Network-2000" TYPE="STUDY">ARDS Network 2000</LINK>). All studies included ARDS patients but some investigations tended to use the LISS definition (<LINK REF="STD-Amato-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Amato 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brochard-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Brochard 1998</LINK>) and some the NAECC definition of ARDS (<LINK REF="STD-ARDS-Network-2000" TYPE="STUDY">ARDS Network 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brower-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Brower 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Villar-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Villar 2006</LINK>). The average age at randomization with standard deviation (SD) varied from 33 ± 13 (<LINK REF="STD-Amato-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Amato 1998</LINK>) to 59 ± 17 (<LINK REF="STD-Stewart-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 1998</LINK>). The European study (<LINK REF="STD-Brochard-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Brochard 1998</LINK>) was unique in the inclusion of patients with single organ failure (lung injury) only. The time that had elapsed from eligibility to randomization ranged from one hour to 36 hours. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Villar-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Villar 2006</LINK>), only patients who demonstrated persistent ARDS 24 hours after initially meeting the ARDS criteria were enrolled.</P>
<P>All the trials assessed the baseline risk by combining several prognostic variables into a severity score (APACHE II or APACHE III score), which provides initial risk stratification for severely ill, hospitalized patients and a risk estimate for hospital mortality for individual intensive care unit (ICU) patients (<LINK REF="REF-Knaus-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knaus 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Knaus-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knaus 1991</LINK>). The higher the score the higher is the relative risk of hospital death. The APACHE II score at baseline was in the range of 17 ± 8 SD (<LINK REF="STD-Brochard-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Brochard 1998</LINK>) to 28 ± 7 SD (<LINK REF="STD-Amato-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Amato 1998</LINK>). Two trials used the APACHE III score (<LINK REF="STD-ARDS-Network-2000" TYPE="STUDY">ARDS Network 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brower-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Brower 1999</LINK>). The APACHE III score ranged from 81 ± 28 SD (<LINK REF="STD-ARDS-Network-2000" TYPE="STUDY">ARDS Network 2000</LINK>) to 90 ± 26 SD (<LINK REF="STD-Brower-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Brower 1999</LINK>). The severity of impairment of lung function was reported according to the partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (PaO<SUB>2</SUB>:FiO<SUB>2</SUB>) (<I>see</I> 'Characteristics of included studies' table). Patients with less severe hypoxaemia (as defined by a PaO<SUB>2</SUB>: FiO<SUB>2</SUB> of 300 or less) are considered to have ALI, and those with more severe hypoxaemia (as defined by a ratio of 200 or less) are considered to have ARDS (ARDS Conference 1977).</P>
<P>Delivery of the interventions for each trial varied. Five trials (<LINK REF="STD-ARDS-Network-2000" TYPE="STUDY">ARDS Network 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brochard-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Brochard 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brower-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Brower 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stewart-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Villar-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Villar 2006</LINK>) set the tidal volume based on body weight, without the use of a pressure-volume (PV) curve. However, in the ARDS Network, Brower, Stewart and Villar trials the tidal volume was set according to predicted (or ideal) body weight (IBW), which was calculated according to the gender and height of the patient. IBW is, on average, 20% less than measured body weight. When transformed to ml/kg of measured body weight the mean tidal volume in the ARDS Network trial ranged from 9.4 to 9.9 ml/kg in the control group, which was quite similar to values used in the other trials, and 5.2 ml/kg in the low tidal volume group, which was lower than in other trials. Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Amato-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Amato 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Villar-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Villar 2006</LINK>) compared the effect of a combined strategy composed of a low tidal volume and relatively high PEEP titrated according to the PV curve. Amato added an intermittent recruitment manoeuvre, and used in the control group a ventilatory strategy aimed at normalizing the partial pressure of carbon dioxide, without any limitation in peak inspiratory pressure. Based on aggregate data, all patients in the lung protective ventilation groups received tidal volumes significantly lower than those in the conventional ventilation groups. Limits of airway plateau pressure ranged from 22 to 30 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O in the protective arms and from 31 to 37 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O in the conventional arms. Most studies focused on plateau airway pressure, whereas one study focused on peak inspiratory airway pressure (<LINK REF="STD-Brochard-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Brochard 1998</LINK>). Protocols for the management of acidosis using bicarbonate infusions were developed in all trials, although there were some differences. The ARDS Network investigators (<LINK REF="STD-ARDS-Network-2000" TYPE="STUDY">ARDS Network 2000</LINK>) were most aggressive in attempting to keep the pH greater than 7.30 for all patients and allowed violations of the tidal volume and airway pressure limits when the pH fell below 7.15. In contrast, another study (<LINK REF="STD-Stewart-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 1998</LINK>) did not dictate volume and pressure violations until the pH fell to 7.00. Co-interventions were not detailed in the studies. Only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Amato-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Amato 1998</LINK>) reported treatments other than ventilation. None of the studies reported use of prone positioning or surfactant. Nitric oxide was used in one trial only (<LINK REF="STD-Brochard-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Brochard 1998</LINK>) and did not appear to be an important feature that imbalanced the trial as it was used in about one-fifth of patients in both groups.</P>
<P>The studies did not report all the considered outcomes. The definition of overall mortality differed between studies. Mortality was measured at a cut-off point of day 60 in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Brochard-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Brochard 1998</LINK>), day 180 in one study (<LINK REF="STD-ARDS-Network-2000" TYPE="STUDY">ARDS Network 2000</LINK>) and at hospital discharge in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Brower-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Brower 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stewart-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 1998</LINK>). In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Amato-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Amato 1998</LINK>) both mortality at day 28 and at hospital discharge were reported. ICU and hospital mortality were reported in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Villar-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Villar 2006</LINK>). Importantly, in <LINK REF="STD-ARDS-Network-2000" TYPE="STUDY">ARDS Network 2000</LINK> patients were followed until discharged home or for 180 days, whichever occurred first. This may be considered equivalent to hospital mortality. Among the secondary outcome measures considered for this review, only three trials reported the duration of mechanical ventilation (<LINK REF="STD-Brochard-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Brochard 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brower-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Brower 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stewart-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 1998</LINK>). In the ARDS Network study, this outcome was reported as the median number of days, without further description. However, the absence of a strict protocol for weaning in all the trials, apart from the ARDS Network study (<LINK REF="STD-ARDS-Network-2000" TYPE="STUDY">ARDS Network 2000</LINK>), makes this outcome difficult to evaluate objectively, although important for clinical and economic implications. Similarly, organ failures were reported using different measures. Two trials did not report this outcome at all (<LINK REF="STD-Amato-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Amato 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brower-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Brower 1999</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Brochard-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Brochard 1998</LINK> reported that 24 patients in each group suffered from organ failures without further details, whereas <LINK REF="STD-Stewart-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 1998</LINK> reported a mean value of two organ failures per patient in each group. <LINK REF="STD-ARDS-Network-2000" TYPE="STUDY">ARDS Network 2000</LINK> reported the number of days without non-pulmonary organ failure at day 28. Other secondary outcomes considered relevant for this review were not reported in the studies.</P>

With the exception of the Amato trial, which reached the target sample (53 patients), the other four studies were stopped early. <LINK REF="STD-Brochard-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Brochard 1998</LINK> based the calculation on a 30% to 40% reduction of hospital mortality. They estimated a sample of 240 patients and the trial was stopped at 116 because protective ventilation was clearly detrimental (RR = 1.23). <LINK REF="STD-Brower-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Brower 1999</LINK> used an estimation of treatment effect based on reversal of respiratory failure as the target outcome for the calculation of sample size. The study was designed to detect a 30% reduction in respiratory failure. They estimated a sample of 130 patients, but the trial was stopped at 52 because the second interim analysis showed that it was unlikely that beneficial treatment effects on reversal of respiratory failure could be demonstrated if the trial was to continue. In <LINK REF="STD-ARDS-Network-2000" TYPE="STUDY">ARDS Network 2000</LINK>, the calculation of sample size was based on a 10% reduction in cumulative mortality at day 180. The estimated sample consisted of 1000 patients and the trial was stopped after enrolling 861 patients because the interim analysis demonstrated that lower tidal volume ventilation was beneficial. The ARDS Network trial, in its design, tried to detect the smallest difference in mortality between groups. <LINK REF="STD-Villar-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Villar 2006</LINK> calculated sample size based on a 20% reduction in absolute mortality. The trial was stopped after enrolling 103 patients due to the benefits of low tidal volume ventilation. None of the trials reported a long-term follow up.</P>

<P>The ARDS Network trial coordinator and the corresponding author of the Brochard study were requested to supply further data on mortality at day 28. Unfortunately this information has not been made available. Therefore, we extracted the numerical data from figure 1 and figure 5 as presented in the original publications (<LINK REF="STD-ARDS-Network-2000" TYPE="STUDY">ARDS Network 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brochard-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Brochard 1998</LINK>). The total number of randomized patients was 1297. Globally, when considering mortality at the end of the follow-up period, as reported by the trialists, the results from the trials clustered between a RR of 0.6 and 1.23, with overlapping CIs (<I>see </I>Additional <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). Overall, the test for heterogeneity yielded a borderline result (P = 0.10; 5 degrees of freedom). The I<SUP>2</SUP> was above the established threshold for combining the data but within the range of 'moderate heterogeneity' (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 45.9%); therefore, random-effects models were applied for calculating an overall estimate (<I>see</I> 'Comparisons and data' table).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Primary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Overall mortality at the end of the follow-up period for each trial showed a trend toward a reduction but it did not reach statistical significance. Using a random-effects model, the RR was 0.86 (95% CI 0.69 to 1.06), absolute risk difference of -6% (95% CI -16% to 3%) with moderate heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 45.9%) (<I>see</I> 'Comparison and data 01'). The different duration of follow up used in each trial for outcome assessment, one trial followed patients up to 180 days, one trial had 60 days follow up, one trial used 28 days and the remaining trials used 'in-hospital' mortality, should suggest caution when interpreting this overall estimate of effect. The legend to <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK> of the ARDS Network trial stated that 31 patients were censored from the count. Assuming that the 31 patients were approximately evenly distributed, then the actual number of patients reported was: treatment 416 (432 less 16) and control 414 (429 less 15). The calculated deaths were: treatment 129 and control 165. Without further explanation from the authors, this was a conservative approach to getting an estimate of the counts actually used in their analysis. Comparisons 11 and 12 showed that the best-worse analysis did not show any significant effect of the 31 censored patients on the overall results.</P>
<P>We stratified the trials based on comparable outcomes. Using hospital mortality (<LINK REF="STD-Amato-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Amato 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ARDS-Network-2000" TYPE="STUDY">ARDS Network 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brower-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Brower 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stewart-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Villar-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Villar 2006</LINK>) in 1181 patients, the point estimate was in favour of the low tidal volume ventilation with both the fixed-effect and random-effects models: RR 0.80 (95% CI 0.69 to 0.92), absolute RD -8% (95% CI -13% to -2%); and RR 0.81 (95% CI 0.66 to 0.98), absolute risk reduction -9% (95% CI -18% to 0.0%), respectively. The I<SUP>2</SUP> was 30.8% (<I>see</I> 'Comparison and data<B> </B>03').</P>
<P>Mortality at day 28 (<LINK REF="STD-Amato-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Amato 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ARDS-Network-2000" TYPE="STUDY">ARDS Network 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brochard-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Brochard 1998</LINK>) in 1030 patients was significantly lower in the patients with the lung protective ventilation strategy, fixed-effect model RR of 0.74 (95% CI 0.61 to 0.88); the absolute risk difference was -10% (95% CI -15% to -4%). When applying a random-effects model the RR of 0.73 was largely unchanged (95% CI 0.61 to 0.87) but the upper limit of the 95% CI of the RD approached unity (absolute RD -12%, 95% CI -23% to 0%). The test for heterogeneity gave a P value of 0.22 (df = 3), I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 31.8% and a P value of 0.41 (df = 2), I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%<B> </B>for hospital mortality and mortality at day 28, respectively, thus confirming more homogeneous data (<I>see</I> 'Comparisons and data 02').</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Secondary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Amongst the secondary outcomes, there were only sufficient data to assess the association between the lung protective ventilation strategy and the duration of mechanical ventilation (<I>see</I> Additional <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). Three trials looked at this endpoint (<LINK REF="STD-Brochard-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Brochard 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brower-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Brower 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stewart-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 1998</LINK>) and enrolled a total of<B> </B>288 patients. No additional data were requested from the authors. There was a trend toward a lower duration of mechanical ventilation in patients with the protective ventilation strategy, but this reduction was not statistically significant (fixed-effect model WMD -0.83, 95% CI -1.92 to 0.27, random-effects model WMD 0.38, 95% CI -3.06 to 3.82; test for heterogeneity P = 0.22, df = 3, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 33.1%).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analyses</HEADING>
<P>We found insufficient data in the trials to perform subgroup analyses assessing the effects of age, severity of disease, and aetiology of ARDS and ALI. Similarly, the studies did not report enough data to perform a subgroup analysis based on concomitant treatments. Subgroup analysis based on the severity of the disease also was not feasible because all the studies included patients with more severe impairment of lung function (PaO<SUB>2</SUB>:FiO<SUB>2</SUB> 200 mm Hg or less). <LINK REF="STD-ARDS-Network-2000" TYPE="STUDY">ARDS Network 2000</LINK> included patients with less severe impairment (PaO<SUB>2</SUB>:FiO<SUB>2</SUB> between 200 and 300 mm Hg) but these patients accounted for only 15% to 18% of the total sample. Finally, subgroup analysis based on the underlying risk factor was not practicable because each trial included ARDS and ALI from any cause, and in all the studies the authors reported only aggregate data.</P>
<P>We performed subgroup analysis based on the delivery of the interventions and comparing the overall estimate of effect of treatment on all-cause mortality at the end of the follow-up period between the trials with a 'low pressure' control group (mean plateau pressure 31 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O or less) (<LINK REF="STD-Brochard-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Brochard 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brower-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Brower 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stewart-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 1998</LINK>) in 288 patients with the effect of treatment in trials with a 'high pressure' control group (plateau pressure greater than 31 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O mean value) (<LINK REF="STD-Amato-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Amato 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ARDS-Network-2000" TYPE="STUDY">ARDS Network 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Villar-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Villar 2006</LINK>) in 1009 patients. Overall mortality was significantly lower in the lung protective ventilation group when a 'higher' plateau pressure in the control arm was applied (fixed-effect model RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.87, absolute risk reduction -11%, 95% CI -17% to -5%) and not significantly different with a 'lower' plateau pressure in the control arm (fixed-effect model RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.45, absolute risk reduction 6%, 95% CI -6% to 17%). The test for heterogeneity yielded I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0% for the 'low' and 'high' plateau pressure groups (<I>see</I> 'Comparisons and data 05').</P>

<P>Although publication bias is not the only cause of an asymmetrical plot, the symmetrical shape of the funnel plot of precision by effect size showed that the overall effect of meta-analysis in this review was not affected by publication bias or biased inclusion criteria.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analysis</HEADING>
<P>We excluded one trial that was clearly unblinded and that used a different method to deliver the intervention in the treatment group (<LINK REF="STD-Amato-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Amato 1998</LINK>) in 53 patients. The test for heterogeneity changed slightly (P = 0.13, df = 3). Overall mortality at the end of the follow-up periods was also changed slightly (fixed-effect model RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.01, absolute RD -5%, 95% CI -11% to 0%; random-effects model RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.24, absolute RD -2%, 95% CI -11% to 8%). We evaluated the impact of the largest study (<LINK REF="STD-ARDS-Network-2000" TYPE="STUDY">ARDS Network 2000</LINK>) in 861 patients by excluding it from the analysis. The effect of lung protective and conventional treatment strategies on all-cause mortality disappeared (fixed-effect model RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.12; random-effects model RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.15).</P>
<P>The ARDS Network investigators reported that nine patients (hospital mortality unknown) and 22 additional patients (still hospitalized when the trial was stopped) were censored<B> </B>in the survival plot (Legend, <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>) (<LINK REF="STD-ARDS-Network-2000" TYPE="STUDY">ARDS Network 2000</LINK>). There was no later information about the eventual outcome of those patients. We performed a sensitivity analysis imputing values for the 31 dropouts according to 'best-worse' case analysis (<I>see</I> 'Comparisons and data' 11 and 12). For the best-case analysis, the 16 and 15 patients were added back and all added control patients were assumed to have died with no additional deaths in the treatment group. Thus the counts were: treatment (129 plus 0)/(416 plus 16) = 129/432; and control (165 plus 15)/(414 plus 15) = 180/429. The test for heterogeneity was P = 0.04, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 59.1%. Therefore, we applied the random-effects model with a RR of 0.89 (95% CI 0.68 to 1.16). For the worst-case analysis, the 16 and 15 patients were added back and all added treatment patients were assumed to have died with no additional deaths in the control group. Thus the counts were: treatment (129 plus 16)/(416 plus 16) = 145/432 and control (165 plus 0)/(414 plus 15) = 165/429. The test for heterogeneity was P- = 0.25, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 25.7%. Therefore, we applied the fixed-effects model: RR 0.92 (95% CI 0.80 to 1.06). In both cases, the CIs reached the no-difference line; the shift of events from one case to the other did not change the statistical significance.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Other secondary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Although there is evidence that the cause of death in ARDS is the development of organ failure (<LINK REF="REF-Monchi-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Monchi 1998</LINK>), only three studies reported that outcome, each of them using different criteria to define organ failure thus preventing us from combining the results in a summary estimate. In only two studies (<LINK REF="STD-ARDS-Network-2000" TYPE="STUDY">ARDS Network 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Villar-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Villar 2006</LINK>) the ventilatory strategy affected the development of organ failure, reduced in the protective arm, whereas in the 'non-beneficial' studies (<LINK REF="STD-Brochard-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Brochard 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stewart-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 1998</LINK>) the occurrence of MOF was similar in both groups.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-12-28 11:48:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Can we attribute all the differences between the two groups to differences in the tidal volumes used? This is a controversial issue. A study by the ARDS Network (<LINK REF="STD-Brower-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Brower 1999</LINK>) (the so-called ALVEOLI study) reported no difference in outcome when ARDS patients were ventilated with low tidal volume and high or low PEEP. That means that PEEP is not as important as tidal volume in changing outcomes. <LINK REF="STD-Villar-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Villar 2006</LINK> confirms this finding as when a high-low PEEP and large tidal volume difference was used between groups the difference in outcomes appeared again. Therefore, the tidal volume difference clearly had an impact on mortality. Two recent trials (<LINK REF="STD-Meade-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Meade 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mercat-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mercat 2008</LINK>) compared ventilation with lower or higher PEEP in patients ventilated with the routine use of low tidal volumes, finding no difference in mortality. This finding confirms that tidal volume is the major determinant of outcome.</P>
<P>Meta-analysis performed by stratifying trials according to 'high plateau pressure' and 'low plateau pressure' in the control group confirmed that when delivery of conventional tidal volume was associated with a plateau pressure of 31 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O or less there was no evidence of decreased mortality from protective ventilation. The large difference in sample size of the two groups (288 versus 1009) calls for cautious interpretation.</P>
<P>Plateau pressure reflects both pulmonary and chest compliance and, therefore, the same limit of pressure may reflect lower tidal volumes if the chest is stiff, and vice versa. Patients with potentially altered chest compliance were excluded in all the studies. Nevertheless, in some patients with ARDS flattening of the pressure-volume (PV) curve may be due to an increase in chest wall elastance related to abdominal distension (<LINK REF="REF-Ranieri-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ranieri 1997</LINK>). Intra-abdominal pressure (a possible confounding factor) was not accounted for or controlled in the selected studies. Although abdominal pressure, a sort of baseline variable, should be distributed evenly between the groups, intra-abdominal pressure should be measured in each ARDS patient to establish whether plateau pressure actually reflects pulmonary pressure rather than a decrease in chest wall compliance.<B>

</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-12-28 11:42:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>In our previous updated review we found evidence that a ventilation strategy using a tidal volume equal or less than 7 ml/kg of measured body weight and plateau pressure less than 31 mm H<SUB>2</SUB>O reduced mortality at day 28. In recent trials, ventilation with higher tidal volumes has not been used any more, confirming that the so-called lung protective ventilation strategy gained enough evidence to be considered effective in reducing mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Esteban-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esteban 2008</LINK>). When meta-analysis was repeated using a homogeneous outcome (mortality at day 28), it showed a relevant, stable benefit from the protective ventilatory approach (relative risk reduction = 26%). The benefit from low tidal volume ventilation was maintained, although reduced, when considering hospital mortality as the endpoint. The effect of lower tidal volumes on the development of organ failure (the main determinant of long-term outcome) is uncertain. Conversely, lower tidal volumes are effective on a short-term endpoint, protecting aerated lung parenchyma, leading to lung recovery. The quantitative summary estimate did not show a statistically significant effect of protective ventilation on the duration of mechanical ventilation. Two studies reporting follow up at one to two years were unable to demonstrate that a limited ventilation strategy improves either long-term function or quality of life in survivors of ARDS and ALI (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Orme-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orme 2003</LINK>). Health-related quality of life and the long-term cognitive outcome were not considered in the trials selected for this review.</P>
<P>In all the selected studies, although the primary purpose of the investigators was to compare two different tidal volumes other elements of the ventilatory strategy were associated with it. The experimental intervention included permissive hypercapnia, variable levels of PEEP and low plateau airway pressure. The traditional intervention consisted of higher tidal volume, normocapnia, lower levels of PEEP and potentially higher plateau pressures. Some of these co-interventions were unavoidable and consequent to the nature of the main intervention. Therefore, the studies performed a comparison of two approaches rather than two single interventions and caution is required in interpreting these results, especially when analyses have been inspired by looking at the available aggregate data, which makes it difficult to assess the respective importance of each factor.</P>
<P>A possible interpretation of the discordant results, as proposed by Gattinoni (<LINK REF="REF-Gattinoni-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gattinoni 2002</LINK>), could involve variations of trans-pulmonary pressure, which is the distending force of the lung, in the individual patient. The high volume might induce lung damage when the resulting trans-pulmonary pressure is high. Conversely, when trans-pulmonary and airway pressure are within the safe limits high or intermediate tidal ventilation (8 to 10 ml/kg) could be used thus avoiding potentially deleterious effects of low tidal volume, Thus, when chest wall compliance is low a higher plateau pressure may be necessary to reach the same trans-pulmonary pressure, without an increase in tidal volume.</P>
<P>Some questions still remain open. The treatment may be effective only in a subgroup of patients. The lower tidal volume ventilation may be clinically worthwhile only in the more severely ill patients.<BR/>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-12-28 11:43:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>The issue of adverse effects of a lower tidal volume was not tackled in the studies. Specifically, the impact of acidosis and hypercapnia on the development of organ failure was not clear.</P>
<P>Ventilation with lower tidal volume can be very effective for short-term lung recovery but its impact on the development of organ failure and long-term recovery is still uncertain or unknown.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2012-12-28 11:47:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>The statistic I<SUP>2</SUP> (45.9%) showed that an important percentage of variability in point estimates is due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error. That value is sufficiently high to justify using a random-effects model. Although the point estimate is similar to that given by the fixed-effect model, the random-effects confidence intervals are wider, the treatment effect is non-significant, and this result is more conservative. The discordant figures also reflect an unstable conclusion (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2001</LINK>). Several hypotheses can explain and interpret these data. These are as follows.</P>
<P>There is a 'hidden' source of heterogeneity. Although statistical tests of heterogeneity were not significant, we showed that studies were clinically different in some points. Furthermore, most of the trials did not report protocols of concomitant treatments and associated diseases (that is ventilator-associated pneumonia).</P>
<P>There is a subgroup of patients that can be ventilated with lower tidal volumes or volumes in the conventional range, as long as the plateau pressure is kept below 31 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O, without differences in mortality. Because alveolar recruitment occurs during tidal inflation (<LINK REF="REF-Gattinoni-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gattinoni 1995</LINK>), a reduction of tidal volume may prove beneficial when it prevents hyperinflation and over-distention but it could be harmful if it is unable to recruit previously collapsed or compressed alveoli. In this situation, individual titration of ventilation is crucial.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2012-12-28 11:48:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>A previous meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Eichacker-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eichacker 2002</LINK>) investigated whether differences in treatment effect could be explained by differences in plateau pressure associated with either the control or low tidal volumes. The authors concluded that treatment in controls differed from current practice in terms of too-high tidal volumes and plateau pressure, and this difference may have influenced the outcomes in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Amato-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Amato 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ARDS-Network-2000" TYPE="STUDY">ARDS Network 2000</LINK>). Although the method applied in the work by Eichacker has been questioned (<LINK REF="REF-Petrucci-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petrucci 2003</LINK>), his study suggests that as long as tidal volumes produce airway pressures considered safe (31 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O or less), there is no benefit from using lower tidal volumes.</P>

<P>Overall, the relative risk of death at day 28 is reduced by using ventilation with a lower tidal volume. Hospital mortality is also beneficially affected but there is insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions about morbidity and long-term outcomes. Ventilation with a higher tidal volume and higher plateau pressure is associated with increased risk of death, but the independent contribution of higher tidal volume (over-distension) or higher plateau pressure (barotrauma) cannot be identified. Lower tidal volume ventilation may be preferable when lung recovery is a priority.</P>
