<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-11-28 09:35:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>The aim of this review was to compare the tranquillising (calming) or sedative (sleepiness) effects of benzodiazepines, given alone or combined with other drugs compared with the effect of placebo (a pretend treatment), other drugs or non-drug treatments for people who are aggressive or agitated because they are experiencing psychoses.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Acute psychosis is a rapid worsening of a person&#8217;s mental state where touch with reality is often lost. People may experience frightening delusions or hallucinations which are distressing and may cause agitated or aggressive behaviour. In urgent cases, this agitation or aggression may cause harm to the person experiencing the psychoses or others around them. To avoid such harm, rapid tranquillisation or sedation with medicines may be required. The most common medicines used to achieve a state of calmness or sedation are benzodiazepines and these can be given either alone or in combination with antipsychotics.</P>
<P>
<B>Searching</B>
</P>
<P>The original search for this review was carried out in January 2012 and subsequently two further update searches were run in August 2015 and August 2016. In total, these searches found 2497 records, which the review authors checked for inclusion or exclusion from the review. Authors included records only if they were randomised trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that allocated people with acute psychosis who presented with agitation, violence aggressive behaviour (or a combination of these) to receive benzodiazepines either given alone or combined with any antipsychotics, versus placebo, antipsychotics alone or in combination with other antipsychotics/benzodiazepines/antihistamines or non-drug treatments.</P>
<P>
<B>Evidence found</B>
</P>
<P>In total, 20 trials were included. Overall, the quality of evidence was low or very low due to serious risk of bias and very small size of included trials. There was no clear difference in improvement between benzodiazepines and placebo, benzodiazepines and antipsychotics or benzodiazepines plus antipsychotics and benzodiazepines alone or antipsychotic alone. When benzodiazepines were compared with combined antipsychotics/antihistamines, there was a higher risk of no improvement in people receiving benzodiazepine alone but the evidence was of low quality. Only one study showed lower effect of combined benzodiazepines/antipsychotics versus combined antihistamines/antipsychotics. However, the evidence was of very low quality. In terms of side effects, people receiving benzodiazepines compared to antipsychotics had lower risk of presenting with symptoms such as shaking, tremors and slurred speech whereas the results for the sedation caused were unclear.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusions</B>
</P>
<P>The existing trials are not informative enough to support or refute the use of benzodiazepines alone or in additional to other medicines when urgent tranquillisation or sedation with medicines is required. Although benzodiazepines alone may cause fewer side effects compared to older antipsychotics, when they are added on to other medicines this may lead to unnecessary side effects. Further studies are needed to provide good-quality evidence with robust conclusions to inform clinical practice and policies around rapid tranquillisation for people with psychoses who are aggressive or agitated.</P>

<P>Acute psychotic illness, especially when associated with agitated or violent behaviour, can require urgent pharmacological tranquillisation or sedation. In several countries, clinicians often use benzodiazepines (either alone or in combination with antipsychotics) for this outcome.</P>

<P>To examine whether benzodiazepines, alone or in combination with other pharmacological agents, is an effective treatment for psychosis-induced aggression or agitation when compared with placebo, other pharmacological agents (alone or in combination) or non-pharmacological approaches.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-11-24 14:36:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's register (January 2012, 20 August 2015 and 3 August 2016), inspected reference lists of included and excluded studies, and contacted authors of relevant studies.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-11-24 14:36:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing benzodiazepines alone or in combination with any antipsychotics, versus antipsychotics alone or in combination with any other antipsychotics, benzodiazepines or antihistamines, for people who were aggressive or agitated due to psychosis.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-11-24 14:36:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We reliably selected studies, quality assessed them and extracted data. For binary outcomes, we calculated standard estimates of risk ratio (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a fixed-effect model. For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean difference (MD) between groups. If there was heterogeneity, this was explored using a random-effects model. We assessed risk of bias and created a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-11-24 14:36:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Twenty trials including 695 participants are now included in the review. The trials compared benzodiazepines or benzodiazepines plus an antipsychotic with placebo, antipsychotics, antihistamines, or a combination of these. The quality of evidence for the main outcomes was low or very low due to very small sample size of included studies and serious risk of bias (randomisation, allocation concealment and blinding were not well conducted in the included trials, 30% of trials (six out of 20) were supported by pharmaceutical institutes). There was no clear effect for most outcomes.</P>
<P>Benzodiazepines versus placebo</P>
<P>One trial compared benzodiazepines with placebo. There was no difference in the number of participants sedated at 24 hours (<I>very low quality evidence</I>). However, for the outcome of global state, clearly more people receiving placebo showed no improvement in the medium term (one to 48 hours) (n = 102, 1 RCT, RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.97, <I>very low quality evidence</I>).<BR/>
<BR/>Benzodiazepines versus antipsychotics</P>
<P>When compared with haloperidol, there was no observed effect for benzodiazepines for sedation by 16 hours (n = 434, 8 RCTs, RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.54, low quality evidence). There was no difference in the number of participants who had not improved in the medium term (n = 188, 5 RCTs, RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.11, <I>low quality evidence</I>). However, one small study found fewer participants improved when receiving benzodiazepines compared with olanzapine (n = 150, 1 RCT, RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.06 to 3.18, <I>very low quality evidence</I>). People receiving benzodiazepines were less likely to experience extrapyramidal effects in the medium term compared to people receiving haloperidol (n = 233, 6 RCTs, RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.41<I>, low quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>Benzodiazepines versus combined antipsychotics/antihistamines</P>
<P>When benzodiazepine was compared with combined antipsychotics/antihistamines (haloperidol plus promethazine), there was a higher risk of no improvement in people receiving benzodiazepines in the medium term (n = 200, 1 RCT, RR 2.17, 95% CI 1.16 to 4.05, <I>low quality evidence</I>). However, for sedation, the results were controversial between two groups: lorazepam may lead to lower risk of sedation than combined antipsychotics/antihistamines (n = 200, 1 RCT, RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.98, <I>low quality evidence</I>); while, midazolam may lead to higher risk of sedation than combined antipsychotics/antihistamines (n = 200, 1 RCT, RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.23, <I>low quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>Other combinations</P>
<P>Data comparing benzodiazepines plus antipsychotics versus benzodiazepines alone did not yield any results with clear differences; all were very low quality evidence. When comparing combined benzodiazepines/antipsychotics (all studies compared haloperidol) with the same antipsychotics alone (haloperidol), there was no difference between groups in improvement in the medium term (n = 185, 4 RCTs, RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.46, <I>low quality evidence</I>), but sedation was more likely in people who received the combination therapy (n = 172, 3 RCTs, RR 1.75, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.67,<I> very low quality evidence</I>). Only one study compared combined benzodiazepine/antipsychotics with antipsychotics; however, this study did not report our primary outcomes. One small study compared combined benzodiazepines/antipsychotics with combined antihistamines/antipsychotics. Results showed a higher risk of no clinical improvement (n = 60, 1 RCT, RR 25.00, 95% CI 1.55 to 403.99, <I>very low quality evidence</I>) and sedation status (n = 60, 1 RCT, RR 12.00, 95% CI 1.66 to 86.59, <I>very low quality evidence)</I> in the combined benzodiazepines/antipsychotics group.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-11-24 14:36:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The evidence from RCTs for the use of benzodiazepines alone is not good. There were relatively few good data. Most trials were too small to highlight differences in either positive or negative effects. Adding a benzodiazepine to other drugs does not seem to confer clear advantage and has potential for adding unnecessary adverse effects. Sole use of older antipsychotics unaccompanied by anticholinergic drugs seems difficult to justify. Much more high-quality research is still needed in this area.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-11-24 14:36:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Acutely psychotic people may exhibit agitated and aggressive behaviour that can present a danger to themselves or others. To ensure a safe and therapeutic environment where the patients have their dignity and privacy respected, de-escalation techniques should be used to calm the patient (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rocca-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rocca 2006</LINK>). Frequently, however, the behaviour may be too disturbed or agitated for these methods to be effective, and it might prove imperative that further action in the form of rapid tranquillisation is given usually as a last resort because the risk to the person or other people is too high (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rocca-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rocca 2006</LINK>). The aim of rapid tranquillisation is to achieve a state of calm that is sufficient to minimise risk of harm to the agitated person themselves, or to others around them, and allow treatment of the underlying condition (<LINK REF="REF-Battaglia-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Battaglia 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2015</LINK>). Rapid tranquillisation may serve as primary therapy in such instances but may also be used in conjunction with other de-escalation methods (<LINK REF="REF-Marder-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marder 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2015</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-11-24 14:36:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Rapid tranquillisation is commonly used in emergency settings in general and psychiatric hospitals worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Goedhard-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goedhard 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marder-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marder 2006</LINK>). Three major classes of drugs are used to achieve rapid tranquillisation: typical antipsychotics, benzodiazepines and, more recently, atypical antipsychotics (<LINK REF="REF-Marder-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marder 2006</LINK>). Intramuscular (IM) injections of typical antipsychotics and benzodiazepines, alone or in combination, have been the treatment of choice for several decades. One review of the research literature reported that the typical antipsychotic, haloperidol, and the benzodiazepine, lorazepam, were the most widely used drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Battaglia-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Battaglia 2005</LINK>). However, the drugs used for rapid tranquillisation may vary widely in different countries. One survey in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, showed that a haloperidol/promethazine mixture was commonly used (<LINK REF="REF-Huf-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huf 2002</LINK>), while one survey of African psychiatrists found that chlorpromazine and diazepam were most commonly prescribed, although the choice of drug tended to be governed by availability rather than preference (<LINK REF="REF-James-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">James 2011</LINK>). With the introduction of parenteral forms of the atypical antipsychotics, these are also gaining in popularity as the first-line treatment for agitation in the psychiatric emergency setting (<LINK REF="REF-Marder-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marder 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mintzer-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mintzer 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The benzodiazepine family is large (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>), and with different characteristics of metabolism (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>).</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-11-24 14:36:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Among other actions, benzodiazepines enhance the effect of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which results in sleep inducing, sedative, antianxiety, muscle relaxant and amnesic effects. First discovered in 1955, through long experience, it is clear that these drugs are effective for managing aggression, but it is unclear just how effective and, if they are better or worse than other compounds or combinations of compounds.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-11-24 14:36:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Guidance suggests benzodiazepines are at least as effective as antipsychotics in controlling severely agitated behaviour (<LINK REF="REF-Allen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rocca-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rocca 2006</LINK>), and indeed this was the finding of the original Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Gillies-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillies 2005</LINK>). Some authors suggest that the combination of antipsychotics with benzodiazepines may be more advantageous than either drug alone (<LINK REF="REF-Rocca-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rocca 2006</LINK>), but there was inadequate evidence of this in the original Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Gillies-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillies 2005</LINK>). This update includes all new trials comparing benzodiazepines (alone or combined with antipsychotics) with antipsychotics (alone or in combination with benzodiazepines). In addition, in this update, we included trials that compared benzodiazepines alone or in combination with antipsychotics, compared to other antipsychotics, benzodiazepines or antihistamines.</P>
<P>While there is evidence that both benzodiazepines and antipsychotics are effective in decreasing agitation, both can cause undesirable adverse effects. Acute phase treatment with typical antipsychotic drugs may result in debilitating extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) including Parkinson's-like symptoms, hypotension, lowering of the seizure threshold, cardiac arrhythmia and neuroleptic malignant syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Battaglia-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Battaglia 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rocca-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rocca 2006</LINK>). Benzodiazepines produce EPS less frequently, but can cause respiratory depression, ataxia, excessive sedation, memory impairment and paradoxical disinhibition (<LINK REF="REF-Battaglia-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Battaglia 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marder-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marder 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rocca-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rocca 2006</LINK>). The adverse effect profile of combined therapy with benzodiazepines and antipsychotics is as yet unclear (<LINK REF="REF-Gillies-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillies 2005</LINK>), although it has been suggested that combination therapy may decrease the incidence of adverse effects (<LINK REF="REF-Battaglia-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Battaglia 2005</LINK>). It is also thought that the broader activity profile of atypical antipsychotics may mean they are less likely to produce the EPS adverse effects of the typical antipsychotics (<LINK REF="REF-Duggan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duggan 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Essali-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Essali 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Silveira-da-Mota-Neto-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silveira da Mota Neto 2002</LINK>), but there have been reports of severe adverse events associated with the IM administration of these drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Battaglia-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Battaglia 2005</LINK>).</P>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.2. Scale-derived data</HEADING>
<P>We included continuous data from rating scales only if:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the psychometric properties of the measuring instrument were described in a peer-reviewed journal (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>); and</LI>
<LI>the measuring instrument had not been written or modified by one of the trialists for that particular trial.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Ideally, the measuring instrument was a self-report or was completed by an independent rater or relative (not the therapist). We realise that this is not often reported clearly; in <LINK TAG="STUDY_DESCRIPTION" TYPE="SECTION">Description of studies</LINK>, we noted if this was the case or not.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.3. Endpoint versus change data</HEADING>
<P>There are advantages of both endpoint and change data. Change data can remove a component of between-person variability from the analysis. However, calculation of change needs two assessments (baseline and endpoint), which can be difficult in unstable and difficult-to-measure conditions such as schizophrenia. We decided primarily to use endpoint data, and only use change data if endpoint data were not available. Because endpoint and change data are combined in the analysis, we used mean differences (MD) rather than standardised mean differences (SMD) throughout (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.4. Skewed data</HEADING>
<P>Continuous data on clinical and social outcomes are often not normally distributed. To avoid the problem of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data, we aimed to apply the following standards to all data before inclusion:</P>
<UL>
<LI>standard deviations (SDs) and means were reported in the paper or obtainable from the authors;</LI>
<LI>when a scale starts from the finite number zero, the SD is more than the mean, this is considered strong evidence of skew (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>if a scale started from a positive value (such as the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) which can have values from 30 to 210), we modified the calculation described above to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases, skew is present if SD &gt; (S - S<SUB>min</SUB>), where S is the mean score and S<SUB>min</SUB> is the minimum score. Where skewed data were present, we presented results in a separate table.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Skewed endpoint data from trials of fewer than 200 participants were entered in additional tables rather than into an analysis. Skewed endpoint data pose less of a problem when looking at means if the sample size is large (over 200 participants) and these were entered into syntheses.</P>
<P>When continuous data are presented on a scale that includes the possibility of negative values (such as change data), it is difficult to determine whether data are skewed or not; we entered change data from both large and small trials.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.5. Common measure</HEADING>
<P>To facilitate comparison between trials, we intended to convert variables that could be reported in different metrics, such as days in hospital (mean days per year, per week or per month) to a common metric (e.g. mean days per month) if necessary.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.6. Direction of graphs</HEADING>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2017-11-24 14:36:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors (HZ and JX) independently assessed risk of bias using criteria described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systemic reviews of Interventions</I> to assess trial quality (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). This set of criteria is based on evidence of associations between overestimate of effect and high risk of bias of the article such as sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data and selective reporting.</P>
<P>Where the raters disagreed, the final rating was made by consensus, with the involvement of another member of the review group.

<P>For binary outcomes, we calculated a standard estimation of the risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). It has been shown that RR is more intuitive (<LINK REF="REF-Boissel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boissel 1999</LINK>) than odds ratios and that odds ratios tend to be interpreted as RR by clinicians (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2000</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Continuous data</HEADING>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Cluster trials</HEADING>
<P>Studies increasingly employ cluster randomisation (such as randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. First, authors often fail to account for intraclass correlation in clustered trials, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) whereby P values are spuriously low, CIs unduly narrow and statistically significant difference overestimated. This causes type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>None of the present included trials used cluster randomisation. For the purposes of future updates of this review, where clustering is not accounted for in primary studies, we will present data in a table, with an * symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review, we will seek to contact first authors of trials to obtain intraclass correlation coefficients for their clustered data and to adjust for this by using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Where clustering may be incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we will present these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjust for the clustering effect.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Cross-over trials</HEADING>
<P>None of the present included trials employed a cross-over trial design; for the purposes of future updates of this review, a major concern of cross-over trials is the carry-over effect. It occurs if an effect (e.g. pharmacological, physiological or psychological) of the treatment in the first phase is carried over to the second phase. As a consequence, on entry to the second phase the participants can differ systematically from their initial state despite a washout phase. For the same reason, cross-over trials are not appropriate if the condition of interest is unstable (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). As both effects are very likely in severe mental illness, we will only use data of the first phase of cross-over trials.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Studies with multiple treatment groups</HEADING>
<P>Where a study involved more than two treatment arms, if two or more of the interventions were similar, we pooled data. If data were binary, these were simply added. If data were continuous, we combined data following the formula in Section 7.7.3.8 (Combining groups) of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systemic reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Where the additional treatment arms were not relevant, we did not use these data.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">3.2. Standard deviations</HEADING>
<P>If SDs were not reported, we first tried to obtain the missing values from the authors. If not available, where there were missing measures of variance for continuous data, but an exact standard error (SE) and CIs available for group means, and either P value or t value available for differences in mean, we could calculate them according to the rules described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systemic reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). When only the SE was reported, SDs were calculated by the formula SD = SE × square root (n). Sections 7.7.3 and 16.1.3 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systemic reviews of Interventions</I> present detailed formulae for estimating SDs from P values, t or F values; CIs; ranges or other statistics (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). If these formulae did not apply, we calculated the SDs according to a validated imputation method, which is based on the SDs of the other included trials (<LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2006</LINK>). Although some of these imputation strategies can introduce error, the alternative would be to exclude a given study's outcome and thus to lose information. Where the only variance given was range (<LINK REF="STD-Diazepam-1979_x002c_-IL" TYPE="STUDY">Diazepam 1979, IL</LINK>), SDs were also estimated from the difference between the upper and lower value divided by four.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">3.3. Last observation carried forward</HEADING>
<P>We anticipated that some trials would employ the method of last observation carried forward (LOCF) within the study report. As with all methods of imputation to deal with missing data, LOCF introduces uncertainty about the reliability of the results (<LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2007</LINK>). Therefore, where LOCF data were used in the trial, if less than 50% of the data had been assumed, we would have presented and used these data and indicated that they were the product of LOCF assumptions. Where LOCF were not used, data were analysed as they were presented in the original publications.</P>

The importance of the observed value of I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic depends on the magnitude and direction of effects and the strength of evidence for heterogeneity (e.g. P value from the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test, or a CI for the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic). An I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic estimate of 50% or greater accompanied by a statistically significant Chi<SUP>2</SUP> statistic is interpreted as evidence of substantial levels of heterogeneity (Section 9.5.2; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).

We are aware that funnel plots may be useful in investigating reporting biases but are of limited power to detect small-study effects. We did not use funnel plots for outcomes where there were 10 or fewer trials, or where all trials were of similar sizes. In other cases, where funnel plots were possible, we sought statistical advice in their interpretation. Because there were more data available for the secondary outcome of sedation, we completed a funnel plot analysis for this outcome (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>).</P>

<P>We understand that there is no closed argument for preference for use of fixed-effect or random-effects models. The random-effects method incorporates an assumption that the different trials are estimating different, yet related, intervention effects. This often seems to be true to us and the random-effects model takes into account differences between trials even if there is no statistically significant heterogeneity. However, there is a disadvantage to the random-effects model as it puts added weight onto small trials, which often are the most biased ones. Depending on the direction of effect, these trials can either inflate or deflate the effect size. We chose a fixed-effect model for all analyses, and if heterogeneity was identified, we used a random-effects model.</P>
<P>As this is a review of the effects on acute psychosis, we included only those outcomes up to and including 48 hours after the initial dose of medication.

<P>See <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table for descriptions of each study. This updated review adopted a different means of presenting included studies. We decided to present included studies in such a way as to describe the type of benzodiazepine employed in the study, as well as the year and country in which the study was undertaken. For example, in the study that was referenced in the previous review as '<U>Qu 1999</U>', participants received either clonazepam 2 mg or haloperidol 10 mg and the study was undertaken in China in 1999; therefore, it is now presented as <LINK REF="STD-Clonazepam-1999_x002c_-CHN" TYPE="STUDY">Clonazepam 1999, CHN</LINK>. We felt that this method, although unconventional, would be most suitable way to present the findings in a logical and concise manner, as results are clustered in graphs for ease of understanding.</P>
<P>The review included 20 trials. This is the total of the 17 trials from the previous review and three after the latest search (<LINK REF="STD-Clonazepam-2007a_x002c_-CHN" TYPE="STUDY">Clonazepam 2007a, CHN</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lorazepam-2009_x002c_-SK" TYPE="STUDY">Lorazepam 2009, SK</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lorazepam-2010_x002c_-IN" TYPE="STUDY">Lorazepam 2010, IN</LINK>). In this 2016 update, we changed the inclusion criteria to include the comparison of antihistamines/anticholinergics in combination with antipsychotics, as we considered that a review of the effect of benzodiazepines for psychosis-induced aggression should take into account the potential use of antihistamines for the treatment of psychosis-induced aggression due to its potential sedative and anticholinergic properties and the widespread use of this combination. The inclusion criteria were clarified to specify the inclusion of benzodiazepines either alone or in combination with any other antipsychotic drug, versus placebo, non-pharmacological approaches, other benzodiazepines or antipsychotics alone, or combined with any other antipsychotic, antihistaminic/anticholinergic drugs or other benzodiazepine<I>. </I>The inclusion criteria were further refined to ensure that the benzodiazepine was the same in the intervention and comparator arm of the trials where benzodiazepine alone was compared to benzodiazepine combined with antipsychotic. This enabled us to detect whether the apparent effect was due to combination with an antipsychotic. Where a combination of benzodiazepine with an antipsychotic was compared to another benzodiazepine combined with an antipsychotic, it was ensured that the antipsychotic was the same in both the intervention and the comparator arm. This allowed us to detect whether the apparent effect was due to the superiority of one benzodiazepine over another. Moreover, this had the result of permitting the exclusion of previously included studies, which were excluded due to comparing benzodiazepines plus antipsychotics versus different antipsychotics (<LINK REF="STD-Han-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Han 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2007</LINK>).</P>

It originally consisted of 39 items, but was subsequently reduced to 14 items following validation and includes a range of agitated behaviour, such as short attention span, impulsiveness, violence/threatening violence, unco-operativeness, restlessness and repetitive behaviour. The 14-item ratings range on a scale of one to four, with one indicating the absence of agitated behaviour, and four indicating the extreme presence of agitated behaviour. <LINK REF="STD-Lorazepam-2001_x002c_-RO-and-USA" TYPE="STUDY">Lorazepam 2001, RO and USA</LINK> used this scale. <LINK REF="STD-Lorazepam-1997a_x002c_-USA" TYPE="STUDY">Lorazepam 1997a, USA</LINK> also used this scale, but presented skewed data (see <LINK TAG="ANALYSES_AND_DATA" TYPE="SECTION">Data and analyses</LINK>).</P>

<P>The BPRS lists a range of psychiatric symptoms generally associated with the domains of anxiety and depression, hostility and suspiciousness, thought disturbance and withdrawal/motor retardation. The original scale has 16 items, but a revised 18-item scale is commonly used. Each item is rated on a 7-point scale varying from 'not present' to 'extremely severe.' <LINK REF="STD-Alprazolam-1992_x002c_-USA" TYPE="STUDY">Alprazolam 1992, USA</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Clonazepam-1999_x002c_-CHN" TYPE="STUDY">Clonazepam 1999, CHN</LINK>; and <LINK REF="STD-Lorazepam-1997b_x002c_-USA" TYPE="STUDY">Lorazepam 1997b, USA</LINK> reported data from this scale. <LINK REF="STD-Alprazolam-1992_x002c_-USA" TYPE="STUDY">Alprazolam 1992, USA</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Lorazepam-1997a_x002c_-USA" TYPE="STUDY">Lorazepam 1997a, USA</LINK> also reported data using the 11 psychosis-anxiety items from the BPRS, classified as the BPRS-psychosis subscale (<LINK REF="REF-Faustman-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faustman 1989</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Lorazepam-2006_x002c_-USA" TYPE="STUDY">Lorazepam 2006, USA</LINK> reported skew data from this scale.</P>

<P>The IMPS measures psychotic symptom scales in psychiatric inpatients. It originally consisted of 75 items and 10 domains. The addition of another 15 items resulted in 12 domains: excitement, hostile belligerence, grandiose expansiveness, paranoid projection, perceptual distortions, anxious depression, retardation and apathy, conceptual disorganisation, motor disturbances, disoriented behaviour, impaired functioning and obsessive-phobic. The IMPS was used by <LINK REF="STD-Clonazepam-1993_x002c_-CA" TYPE="STUDY">Clonazepam 1993, CA</LINK> who reported a reduction of at least 50% as improvement.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 1: Benzodiazepines versus placebo</HEADING>
<P>See <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>. There was some evidence that lorazepam was superior to placebo in terms of improvement and behaviour in the medium but not short term, although these data came from a single small study with very serious risk of bias and were, therefore, graded as very low quality evidence. There was no clear evidence of a difference between groups in tranquillisation, mental state, adverse events or leaving the study early.</P>
<P>It is understandable that placebo-controlled trials in this area are uncommon as withholding treatment from people in such a distressed state can be considered unethical. Therefore, evidence from RCTs that benzodiazepines are superior to placebo is insufficient.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 2: Benzodiazepines versus antipsychotics</HEADING>
<P>See <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>. Overall, there was very low- to low-quality evidence of no difference between benzodiazepines and antipsychotics in terms of global state (e.g. clinical improvement or need for additional medication) or sedation, or both. However, there as low-quality evidence from single small studies showing a clear difference between groups, One small study found that olanzapine was superior to lorazepam in terms of clinical improvement (n = 150, <LINK REF="STD-Lorazepam-2001_x002c_-RO-and-USA" TYPE="STUDY">Lorazepam 2001, RO and USA</LINK>). One small study with high attrition rates found that midazolam can achieve higher rates of sedation than droperidol (n = 163, <LINK REF="STD-Midazolam-2006_x002c_-AU" TYPE="STUDY">Midazolam 2006, AU</LINK>). On esmall study found lorazepam can reduce the severity of symptoms compared with haloperidol when measured by CGI (n = 37, <LINK REF="STD-Lorazepam-1997b_x002c_-USA" TYPE="STUDY">Lorazepam 1997b, USA</LINK>). Due to the high levels of heterogeneity between studies and the very low quality of evidence, it was difficult to make any conclusions from the results on the need of additional medication comparing benzodiazepines and antipsychotics. Moreover, there was no evidence available looking at the short-term effect of benzodiazepines and haloperidol on various outcomes such as sedation, improvement in global state, adverse effects and need for additional medication.</P>
<P>In addition, low-quality evidence showed that EPS were considerably lower in people receiving benzodiazepines. The data suggest EPS were significantly higher in people receiving antipsychotics and this should be considered in choosing the correct treatment in an emergency situation. In clinical practice, antipsychotics and mainly typical antipsychotics are often accompanied by anticholinergic treatment that may substantially decrease the incidence of EPS particularly in non-organic psychosis. Therefore, the use of atypical antipsychotics based on the reduced EPS profile may be a suitable potential treatment option. Typical antipsychotics such as haloperidol without accompanying anticholinergics does not seem acceptable and this is consistent with outcomes of other relevant reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Huf-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huf 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was no difference between groups for mental state and other adverse events. Considering the above findings, due to the very low or low quality of evidence, the difference between benzodiazepine and antipsychotics for acute agitation remain uncertain.</P>

Results for improvement and global state scores favoured the use of combined haloperidol/promethazine over lorazepam but all these data came from <LINK REF="STD-Lorazepam-2004_x002c_-IN" TYPE="STUDY">Lorazepam 2004, IN</LINK>; sedation was reported in both <LINK REF="STD-Midazolam-2003_x002c_-BZ" TYPE="STUDY">Midazolam 2003, BZ</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Lorazepam-2004_x002c_-IN" TYPE="STUDY">Lorazepam 2004, IN</LINK> trials, but data could not be pooled because of substantial heterogeneity between the two trials. People receiving midazolam were more likely to become sedated compared with combined haloperidol/promethazine in <LINK REF="STD-Midazolam-2003_x002c_-BZ" TYPE="STUDY">Midazolam 2003, BZ</LINK>, unlike <LINK REF="STD-Lorazepam-2004_x002c_-IN" TYPE="STUDY">Lorazepam 2004, IN</LINK> where people receiving combined haloperidol/promethazine were more likely to become sedated. Possible reasons for this dramatic heterogeneity was discussed in depth in another review (<LINK REF="REF-Huf-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huf 2009</LINK>), but the most likely reason is midazolam is a faster-acting and more potent benzodiazepine than lorazepam (<LINK REF="REF-Larson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Larson 1994</LINK>). Clinically, sedation caused by combined haloperidol/promethazine was dose related.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Lorazepam-2004_x002c_-IN" TYPE="STUDY">Lorazepam 2004, IN</LINK> reported the use of physical restraints. Throughout the course of the trial, people receiving lorazepam alone were more likely to be mechanically restrained than people who received combined haloperidol/promethazine. Although restraint was not a stated outcome in our protocol and may be of more relevance to clinicians in countries where the use of mechanical restraints is employed, we feel that it is an important outcome and should be considered in future reviews and trials.</P>
<P>In these larger and better-reported trials, adverse effects were infrequent but important, and included respiratory depression, nausea and seizure. Respiratory depression is a very serious potential adverse effect of all benzodiazepines, and occurred in both trials. One participant in <LINK REF="STD-Midazolam-2003_x002c_-BZ" TYPE="STUDY">Midazolam 2003, BZ</LINK> watdmitted with cocaine-induced aggression, a potential mitigating factor.</P>
<P>The above findings were based on low-quality evidence, and results from future studies are likely to change the findings.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 4: Benzodiazepines plus antipsychotics versus same benzodiazepines</HEADING>
<P>See <LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>. There was little difference between combined benzodiazepines/antipsychotics compared with benzodiazepines alone but the quality of these data was low. The only significant difference was that sedation was more likely in people receiving the combination in the short term, although these data were from one small trial. Ratings of global state, mental state, behaviour and adverse effects were all equivocal between groups - as could be expected in such low power. A real and important difference could exist, but larger trials are needed before any confident conclusions can be drawn.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 5: Benzodiazepines plus antipsychotics versus same antipsychotics</HEADING>
<P>See <LINK REF="SOF-05" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 5</LINK>. There were no apparent advantages in using combined benzodiazepines/antipsychotics compared with antipsychotics alone in terms of our primary outcome of no improvement but there were relatively few data with considerable heterogeneity. In addition, as each of the included trials defined 'improvement' differently, it was difficult to interpret how meaningful these data were.</P>
<P>Sedation rates were significantly higher in the combined benzodiazepines/haloperidol group compared with haloperidol alone in the short and medium term although the medium-term data were heterogeneous. There were no differences between groups in the incidence of EPS or other adverse effects but these were rated as low-quality evidence.</P>
<P>Behaviour scores did seem to favour haloperidol when compared with combined midazolam/haloperidol but these data came from one small trial (n = 60). This finding may be changed by further trials.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 6: Benzodiazepines plus antipsychotics versus antipsychotics plus antipsychotics</HEADING>
<P>See <LINK REF="SOF-06" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 6</LINK>. The only trial to report data for this comparison provided few data (<LINK REF="STD-Lorazepam-1998_x002c_-SA" TYPE="STUDY">Lorazepam 1998, SA</LINK>), with no documented instances of people leaving the study early, and no difference in aggression ratings. Therefore, it is difficult to draw any meaningful conclusions from this comparison; larger, more informative trials with clearly defined outcomes are needed before any conclusions can be made.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 7: Benzodiazepines plus antipsychotics versus antipsychotics plus antihistamines</HEADING>
<P>See <LINK REF="SOF-07" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 7</LINK>. Only one trial reported two relevant arms (total n = 60), and the quality of evidence was very low (<LINK REF="STD-Midazolam-2011_x002c_-BZ" TYPE="STUDY">Midazolam 2011, BZ</LINK>). There was very low quality evidence that combined haloperidol/promethazine was significantly better than combined midazolam/haloperidol in terms of improvement, need for additional medication, sedation and behaviour. However, as the quality of the evidence was very low, it was difficult to draw any meaningful conclusions.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analysis</HEADING>
<P>Although sensitivity analyses were conducted for the 'Risk of bias' criteria, sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinded outcome measurement and incomplete data, there were few differences between trials at high, low and unclear risk of bias. Trials at low risk of bias for sequence generation, allocation concealment and blinded outcome measurement were more likely to favour benzodiazepines over antipsychotics in terms of sedation and lowering the risk of EPS. However, these findings were based on relatively few data and should at this stage be interpreted with caution.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.1. Power</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">1.1.1. Limited power</HEADING>
<P>We only found one trial (n = 102) comparing benzodiazepines with placebo. Although data were incomplete, we know enough to suggest that randomisation of benzodiazepine versus placebo to be ethical only in the most constrained services of such limited supply that anything but randomisation would be inequitable.</P>
<P>Eleven trials compared benzodiazepines directly with antipsychotics, and most of trials had small sample sizes. When a benzodiazepine was compared with combined benzodiazepine/antipsychotic, the five trials had a mean of 50 participants. Even if the outcome reporting had been comprehensive (taking into account views of clinicians and participants as well as researchers), the depth and strength of evidence in this area is very far from complete. Despite an increasing trend to consider atypical antipsychotics as more suitable for rapid tranquillisation than the older antipsychotics, there were inadequate data to compare atypical antipsychotics with benzodiazepines. Such promotion of the antipsychotics is based more on well-meaning faith combined with an understandable lack of resistance from industry rather than good evidence.</P>
<P>The two TREC trials (Tranquilização Rápida-Ensaio Clínico (Rapid Tranquillisation-Clinical Trial)) that compared benzodiazepines with combined haloperidol/promethazine were large (n = 200 and 301), high-powered trials, recognised for high methodological quality in this area of research (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2015</LINK>). These trials did not have an emphasis on recording scale-derived data but did provide useful binary outcomes.</P>
<P>The comparison for combined benzodiazepines/haloperidol versus combined haloperidol/promethazine was very limited (1 RCT, n = 60) with few data from a single trial with multiple treatment arms. All outcomes need to be interpreted with great caution.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">1.1.2. No power</HEADING>
<P>The trial search did not identify trials that compared specific benzodiazepines at a high versus low dose; oral versus IM/intravenous; or low frequency versus high frequency (as defined by each study). Future research could examine these comparisons to highlight any potential benefits/efficacy of specifically named benzodiazepines in the management of psychosis-induced aggression/agitation.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.2. Outcome measurement</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">1.2.1. Measures</HEADING>
<P>A major difficulty in synthesising data from trials in this review was the considerable variability in what and how outcomes were measured. Several trials reported outcomes that were not within the specified time period and therefore could not be used.</P>
<P>Given the potential for adverse events with benzodiazepines and antipsychotics, future trials should ensure that these data are collected and reported. In addition, as most trials allow for 'as-needed' repeat doses of these drugs, the number of additional doses or mean dosage is also an important outcome in these trials.</P>
<P>The trials used a range of modified versions of validated measures or domain scores, thus, these data could not be synthesised in this review. If scales are to be used, it is important that they, and the individual subscales, are validated. Consistent use of measures of agreed importance is important.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">1.2.2. Sedation</HEADING>
<P>There is a need to achieve behavioural control without sedation (<LINK REF="REF-Rocca-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rocca 2006</LINK>). This perspective is reflected by sedation being reported as a positive outcome in earlier trials but as negative in more recent trials. However, sedation remains important and should be recorded and value judgements can be made by those who wish to use the evidence. In future trials, other outcomes such as improvement should be reported, as consensus guidelines have emphasised that calming an agitated/aggressive person is the key goal in an acute setting as opposed to rapid tranquillisation (<LINK REF="REF-Allen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allen 2005</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Applicability</HEADING>
<P>Despite a relatively broad range of inclusion criteria in regard to participants and settings, results were quite homogenous. Largely, participants, interventions and situations of administration were familiar to the average clinical setting and the data seem to be applicable. Benzodiazepines and antipsychotics were used quite consistently across trials. The majority used lorazepam or haloperidol in consistent clinically applicable doses. Only six trials used atypical antipsychotics.</P>
<P>The major sources of heterogeneity were CGI scores when lorazepam and diazepam were compared with haloperidol (<LINK REF="CMP-002.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.6</LINK>), OASS scores when combined midazolam/haloperidol was compared with olanzapine and ziprasidone (<LINK REF="CMP-005.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.6</LINK>), and sedation when lorazepam and midazolam were compared with combined haloperidol/promethazine (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>). There were several potential reasons for this heterogeneity. The most identifiable of these were differences in the types and doses of benzodiazepines and antipsychotics that were used.</P>

<P>Overall, most quality criteria were poorly reported in the trials included in this review. Large, well-designed, clinically relevant and clearly reported trials are clearly possible (<LINK REF="STD-Lorazepam-2004_x002c_-IN" TYPE="STUDY">Lorazepam 2004, IN</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Midazolam-2003_x002c_-BZ" TYPE="STUDY">Midazolam 2003, BZ</LINK>), but these are very much the exceptions to the rule. The randomisation methods and allocation concealment were poorly reported in the included trials. Most trials did not state whether they had concealed the group allocation regimen. Some trials used a double-blind design, however, did not state who was blinded (e.g. participants, outcome assessor, data analyser). About 30% of trials were supported by pharmaceutical institutes.</P>
<P>The quality of evidence was low to very low, the main reasons for downgrading the evidence were very small sample size and serious risk of bias across included studies.</P>

<P>The findings of this review agree with other narrative syntheses of the literature that have concluded that benzodiazepines are at least as effective as antipsychotics in controlling severely agitated behaviour (<A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=63012133905858853540120326233832&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Allen-2000">Allen 2000</A>; <A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=63012133905858853540120326233832&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-NICE-2005">NICE 2005</A>; <A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=63012133905858853540120326233832&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Rocca-2006">Rocca 2006</A>); however, because benzodiazepines have the potential to cause respiratory depression, their use should be carefully monitored in an environment suited to manage such cases. The findings are also consistent with other similar and overlapping reviews (see <LINK TAG="IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE" TYPE="SECTION">Implications for practice</LINK>: 3. for managers and policy-makers).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. For people with agitation/aggression due to schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like illnesses</HEADING>
<P>The intervention selected must be a reasonable and proportionate response to the risk posed by the person at that particular time. The aim of rapid tranquillisation is to achieve a state of calm sufficient to minimise the risk posed to patients or others. To achieve this state of calmness, various interventions can be used ranging from de-escalation to pharmacological. Benzodiazepines are a viable option for care in acute aggression though secondary to psychotic illness, but much of the data on which practice is based are poor (although there are exceptions). Many recommendations for treatment are based on clinician's experience, expert consensus or local prescribing practice rather than data from high-quality trials or well-considered consumer feedback. We think that the situation is changing but certainly more well-designed, conducted and reported trials are needed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. For clinicians</HEADING>
<P>The data suggest that there is no difference between benzodiazepines and antipsychotics in particular relation to sedation but data are limited and not of high quality. Moreover, low-quality evidence of differences between benzodiazepine and olanzapine exists even if not for every outcome. Using a combined benzodiazepine/antipsychotic does not seem to confer any advantage over use of either drug alone. There is some evidence that newer antipsychotics may be more beneficial than benzodiazepines but data are very limited.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. For managers or policy-makers</HEADING>
<P>Lack of high-quality evidence leaves managers and policy makers with difficult decisions to make. There is currently insufficient clinical evidence to suggest that the benzodiazepine group of drugs (alone or in combination with antipsychotics) is clearly superior to antipsychotics in reducing acute psychotic behaviour.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. General</HEADING>
<P>Adherence to the <A HREF="http://www.consortstatement.org">CONSORT</A> statement would probably have resulted in this review being more conclusive (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>). Clear descriptions of randomisation would have reassured users of these trials that selection bias had been minimised and well-described and blinded outcome measurement could have encouraged greater confidence in the control of performance and detection bias. The use of validated binary outcomes should take preference over continuous results because they are easier to interpret and better reporting of validated rating scales would have provided more usable data. The reporting of outcomes with their means and standard deviations, again, would have provided more usable data and facilitated synthesis of findings. When presenting data in a graph, the exact numbers and standard deviations should also be reported.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Specific</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.1. Reviews</HEADING>
<P>Although our original protocol specified a focus on rapid tranquillisation for acute psychosis, but by restricting our analyses up to 48 hours, other potential serious adverse effects may have been overlooked. For further reviews on this topic, or the update of this review in the future, we recommend a less rigid time restriction on long-term effects of benzodiazepines to attain a more accurate consideration of the outcomes and other adverse effects (see <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.2. Research</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">2.2.1. Methods</HEADING>
<P>There is a need for better evidence regarding the relative effectiveness of benzodiazepines and antipsychotics, particularly regarding the reporting of both short-term and long-term adverse effects. We did identify large, well-designed and clearly reported trials in this area (<LINK REF="REF-TREC-Vellore" TYPE="REFERENCE">TREC Vellore</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-TREC_x002d_II-Brazil" TYPE="REFERENCE">TREC-II Brazil</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">2.2.2. Interventions</HEADING>
<P>More trials comparing the atypical antipsychotics, such as IM clozapine or olanzapine, with benzodiazepines are needed. Additional trials that compare combined benzodiazepines/antipsychotics with either drug alone are still needed, particularly where the newer antipsychotics are used. Because dosages could be adjusted on an as-needed basis in the majority of trials, it is difficult to make conclusions about what doses of which drugs are most suitable for managing psychosis-induced aggression or agitation. As the ability to adjust doses would seem to be the only ethical option in longer-term trials, these data also need to be reported in future trials.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">2.2.3. Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Standardised, validated scales that are acceptable to recipients of this care, clinicians working in the field, researchers and people working with regulatory authorities are needed to measure outcomes in future trials. Possible outcome measures should include measures of violence, degree of sedation, acceptability of the medication and adverse effects, all recorded over a suitable timescale to match the pharmacokinetic properties of the drugs. This will mean selective reporting biases are more likely to be eliminated and better-quality meta-analyses possible. One way to address this fundamental issue would be to develop and employ a standardised set of outcome measurements, or 'core outcome sets.' This may be achieved through the COMET (Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials; <A HREF="http://www.comet-initiative.org/">www.comet-initiative.org/</A>) Initiative that seeks to identify a standardised set of outcomes, with consensus on how these are to be defined and measured.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">2.2.4. Suggested design of trial</HEADING>
<P>We realise that design of suitable trials takes time and a great deal of care but we have spent some considerable period studying the relevant existing trials and, therefore, suggest an outline of a suitable trial design (<LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>).<BR/>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Benzodiazepines alone or in combination with antipsychotic drugs for acute psychosis</HEADING>
<P>People with mental health problems may exhibit agitated, violent and aggressive behaviour which can be a danger to themselves or others. Usually, de-escalation techniques such as talking to the patient are used to calm down the situation. However, people's behaviour may be too disturbed, violent or agitated. In these circumstances, rapid tranquillisation is given to achieve a state of calm. Three major classes of drugs are used to achieve rapid tranquillisation: typical antipsychotics; benzodiazepines; and more recently atypical antipsychotics. The review included 20 studies involving 1695 people. The aim was to explore the tranquillising effects of benzodiazepines (alone or in combination with antipsychotics; placebo; and antihistamines). Overall, there is insufficient information in these 20 studies to support or refute the use of benzodiazepines (alone or in combination with other drugs, where emergency drugs are needed). The majority of studies are too small, so that larger and more informative studies are required before definite conclusions can be drawn as to the effectiveness of benzodiazepines. However, there was low quality evidence to suggest that benzodiazepines are at least as effective as antipsychotics in reducing the agitation associated with mental illness. Side effects such as weight gain, shaking, tremors and slurred speech were significantly higher in people who received antipsychotics. Therefore, if antipsychotics are used for rapid tranquillisation, they should be given with other calming drugs (anticholinergic medication) which can prevent side effects.<BR/>
<BR/>In summary, there is no strong information from these studies to support or refute the use of benzodiazepines (with or without antipsychotics or in combination with other drugs) if the situation has deteriorated to such an extent that emergency drugs are needed. However, the lower rates of side effects in people receiving benzodiazepines may be a reason to choose benzodiazepines over older antipsychotics. Lack of good quality evidence leaves managers, clinicians, psychiatrists and policy makers with difficult decisions to make. There is currently limited evidence to suggest that benzodiazepines (alone or in combination with antipsychotics) are clearly superior to antipsychotics (alone or in combination with antihistamines) in reducing acute psychotic behaviour, such as aggression or agitation.</P>
