<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Intravitreal steroids for macular edema in people with diabetes</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Macular edema, swelling of the center of the retina (the part of the eye responsible for our sharpest vision), is an important cause of poor vision in patients with diabetes. New forms of therapy are desirable because the current treatment including laser photocoagulation does not control all cases of diabetic macular edema (DME) and because laser therapy may destroy normal retinal tissue. Intraocular steroids in the form of intravitreal triamcinolone acetate injection (IVTA) and surgical implantation of fluocinolone acetonide (FAI) or dexamethasone drug delivery system (DDS) are promising new therapies. This systematic review included seven randomized clinical trials involving 632 eyes from five countries evaluating the effectiveness and safety of intravitreal steroids for treating DME. Two trials were at low risk of bias, one was at median risk of bias, two were at high risk of bias, and the remaining two had an unclear risk of bias. In this systematic review, the preponderance of data suggest a beneficial effect from IVTA. The average improvement in visual acuity was 7.5 letters more (-0.15 LogMAR; 95% CI -0.21 to -0.09) in the IVTA treated eyes than in those treated with other therapies at three months (based on three trials), 11.5 letters more (-0.23 LogMAR; 95% CI -0.33 to -0.13) at six months (two trials), 14.5 letters more (-0.29 LogMAR; 95% CI -0.47 to -0.11) at nine months (one trial), and 5.7 letters more (-0.11 LogMAR; 95% CI -0.20 to -0.03) at 24 months (one trial). Improved clinical outcomes were also reported in FAI and dexamethasone DDS trials. Elevation of intraocular pressure and cataract progression occur in both IVTA and implants treated eyes but appear manageable. </P>

<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Macular edema is secondary to leakage from diseased retinal capillaries and is an important cause of poor central visual acuity in patients with diabetic retinopathy. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>This review evaluated the effectiveness and safety of intraocular steroids in treating diabetic macular edema (DME). </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE in June 2007, reference lists, Science Citation Index and conference proceedings. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We included randomized clinical trials (RCTs) evaluating any form of intravitreal steroids for treating DME. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors independently assessed eligibility, methodological quality and extracted data. We performed meta-analyses when appropriate.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Seven studies, involving 632 DME eyes were included. Four examined the effectiveness of intravitreal triamcinolone acetate injection (IVTA), three examined intravitreal steroids implantation (fluocinolone acetonide implant (FAI) or dexamethasone drug delivery system (DDS)). Two trials were at low risk of bias, one was at median risk of bias, two were at high risk of bias and the remaining two were at unclear risk of bias. <BR/>The preponderance of data suggest a beneficial effect from IVTA. Comparing IVTA with controls, the mean difference in visual acuity was -0.15 LogMAR (95% CI -0.21 to -0.09) at 3 months (based on three trials), -0.23 LogMAR (95% CI -0.33 to -0.13) at 6 months (two trials), -0.29 LogMAR (95% CI -0.47 to -0.11) at 9 months (one trial), and -0.11 LogMAR (95% CI -0.20 to -0.03) at 24 months (one trial), all in favor of IVTA. The relative risk (RR) for one or more lines improvement in visual acuity was 2.85 (95% CI 1.59 to 5.10) at 3 months (two trials), 1.25 (95% CI 0.66 to 2.38) at 6 months (one trial), and 2.17 (95% CI 1.15 to 4.11) at 24 months (one trial), all in favor of IVTA. We did not find evidence for three or more lines improvement in visual acuity. The mean difference in retinal thickness was -131.97 um (95% CI -169.08 to -94.86) at 3 months (two trials), -135.00 um (95% CI -194.50 to -75.50) at 6 months (one trial), -133.00 um (95% CI -199.86 to -66.14) at 9 months (one trial), and -59.00 um (95% CI -103.50 to -14.50) at 24 months (one trial), all in favor of IVTA. The RR for at least one grade macular edema resolution was 5.15 (95% CI 2.23 to 11.88) at 3 months in favor of IVTA (one trial).<BR/>Two trials reported improved clinical outcome when FAI was compared to standard of care. Beneficial effect was also observed in one dexamethasone DDS trial. <BR/>Increased intraocular pressure and cataract formation were side effects requiring monitoring and management. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>RCTs included in this review suggest that steroids placed inside the eye by either intravitreal injection or surgical implantation may improve visual outcomes in eyes with persistent or refractory DME. Since the studies in our report focused on chronic or refractory DME, the question arises whether intravitreal steroids therapy could be of value in other stages of DME, especially the earlier stages either as standalone therapy or in combination with other therapies, such as laser photocoagulation. </P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Introduction</HEADING>
<P>Diabetic macular edema (DME) is the result of retinal microvascular changes that present in both type I and type II diabetes mellitus. It is the most common cause of visual loss in type II diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Tranos-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tranos 2004</LINK>). It can be defined as macular retinal thickening caused by diabetic retinopathy. Since diabetic retinopathy can exist without macular edema the mere presence of diabetic retinopathy does not, by itself, confirm the diagnosis of DME. Other possible causes of macular edema exist and more than one etiology may play a role in the retinal thickening. Diabetic macular edema must, therefore, be distinguished from other possible independent or contributory causes of the macular edema.</P>
<P>Two types of macular edema have been described: focal and diffuse. Focal macular edema derives from individual microaneurysms or small clusters of microaneurysms and dilated capillaries (<LINK REF="REF-Cunha_x002d_Vaz-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cunha-Vaz 1998</LINK>). Diffuse macular edema is characterized by diffuse leakage from extensive areas of the posterior retinal capillary bed and a generalized breakdown of the inner blood-retinal barrier (<LINK REF="REF-Aroca-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aroca 2004</LINK>). The excessive vascular permeability, resulting in the leakage of fluid, lipoproteins, and other plasma constituents into the retina, leads to thickening of the retina (<LINK REF="STD-Verma-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Verma 2004</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Epidemiology</HEADING>
<P>The published data regarding the epidemiology of DME are dominated by a few large studies. The Wisconsin Epidemiologic Study of Diabetic Retinopathy (WESDR) (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2004</LINK>) enrolled 919 type I and 1121 type II patients. Within five years of diagnosis, 0% of type I patients showed evidence of DME compared with 29% after 20 years (<LINK REF="REF-Klein-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 1984</LINK>). Similarly, within five years of diagnosis only 3% of type II patients had DME compared with 28% after 20 years. In this Wisconsin population the four-year incidence of clinically significant DME was 4.3%, 5.1%, and 1.3% respectively in three patient groups (type I, insulin-treated type II, and non-insulin-treated type II) (<LINK REF="REF-Klein-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 1984</LINK>). The 10-year incidence was 20.1%, 25.4%, and 13.9% respectively in these groups (<LINK REF="REF-Klein-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 1984</LINK>). Similar prevalence and incidence data have been reported in other studies that cover a wide range of countries (European, American, African, Asian, Australasian) and population groups (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The presence of macular edema was associated with longer duration of diabetes, higher systolic blood pressure, insulin use, diuretic use, male gender, higher glycosylated hemoglobin, and the presence of proteinuria (<LINK REF="REF-Klein-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 1984</LINK>).</P>
<P>In developed countries, DME is recognized as the main cause of blindness in the working-age population (20 to 74 years old) and is responsible for 12% of new cases of blindness each year (<LINK REF="REF-CDCP-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDCP 1996</LINK>). We are unaware of any data that describe the predilection of one racial group developing DME over another group.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Clinical presentation and diagnosis</HEADING>
<P>The most common presenting clinical symptom of DME is blurred vision. However, a patient can have clinically significant macular edema, as defined by the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS), with no symptomatic loss of central visual acuity. Other presenting symptoms can include metamorphopsia (distortion of visual image), floaters, change in contrast sensitivity, photophobia (visual intolerance to light), changes in color vision, and scotomas (localized defects of visual field).</P>
<P>The diagnosis is made by finding macular edema due to diabetes on the clinical examination. Generally this requires direct visualization of the macular edema that uses a high magnification stereoscopic lens system designed to view the ocular fundus. A fundus contact lens is probably the most common instrument for this purpose, but other non-contact lenses can also be used. If the thickening is sufficiently severe it can be seen with an indirect ophthalmoscope. Chronic DME can be associated with cystic degeneration of the macular retina called cystoid macular edema (CME). If CME is present it might be visible with a handheld non-stereoscopic direct ophthalmoscope. Although stereoscopic observation of the fundus is considered the most accepted way to diagnose DME, there is an increased use of other diagnostic tools such as stereo fundus photography, fluorescein angiography, and more recently, ocular coherence tomography.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Treatment options</HEADING>
<P>In addition to glycemic control, the treatment options for DME include laser photocoagulation, intravitreal steroids, and vitrectomy. Laser photocoagulation is a therapeutic technique that uses a strong light-source to coagulate tissue. The ETDRS study recommends direct focal photocoagulation for focal macular edema and grid photocoagulation for diffuse macular edema (<LINK REF="REF-ETDRS-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">ETDRS 1985</LINK>). Focal photocoagulation aims to close or obliterate the microaneurysms to help maintain current vision and reduce progressive visual loss. The laser light is absorbed by the blood inside the microaneurysms. Grid photocoagulation for diffuse DME aims to produce a mild to moderately intense retinal burn that may reduce leakage attributable to permeability abnormalities within dilated macular capillaries, with a positive effect on visual acuity and fluorescein leakage (<LINK REF="REF-Tranos-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tranos 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Steroids represent the traditional treatment of inflammatory eye disease because of their ability to diminish neutrophil transmigration, limit access to sites of inflammation, and decrease cytokine production. Recently the use of steroids has expanded into posterior segment disorders such as DME for its angiostatic and anti-permeability properties. For DME, intravitreal delivery techniques (intravitreal injection and steroids implant) allow for sufficiently high local concentrations of steroids to maximize their anti-inflammatory, angiostatic and anti-permeability effects in treating DME while minimizing systemic toxicity (<LINK REF="REF-Ciulla-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ciulla 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Vitrectomy is considered in patients with progression in visual loss, despite treatment with laser photocoagulation and in patients with DME associated with a thickened, taut, posterior hyaloid.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Rationale for a systematic review</HEADING>
<P>Several randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that traditional laser photocoagulation can reduce the risk of visual loss by 50% in patients with focal DME (<LINK REF="REF-DCCT-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">DCCT 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-DRS-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">DRS 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ETDRS-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">ETDRS 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-UKPDS-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">UKPDS 1998</LINK>). However, this treatment has had limited results for diffuse DME (<LINK REF="REF-Ciulla-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ciulla 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ETDRS-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">ETDRS 1985</LINK>). Laser photocoagulation is a late, destructive treatment that does not specifically address the underlying cause of diabetic retinopathy. Intravitreal injection or implantation of steroids has been reported to be effective and promising in improving visual acuity in DME (<LINK REF="REF-Ciulla-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ciulla 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jonas-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jonas 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Karacorlu-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karacorlu 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kuppermann-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kuppermann 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Massin-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Massin 2004</LINK>). Steroids administered intravitreally bypass the blood-ocular barrier to achieve therapeutic levels in the eye while minimizing systemic side effects and are thought to decrease vascular permeability during inflammation (<LINK REF="REF-Ciulla-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ciulla 2004</LINK>). The short-term success must be balanced by the long-term efficacy and safety. A systematic review is therefore needed to examine the evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of intravitreal steroids compared to other treatments in treating DME.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Assessment of search results</HEADING>
<P>Three authors independently assessed the titles and abstracts resulting from the electronic and manual searches to ascertain relevant studies for inclusion. We obtained full copies of all potentially or definitely relevant articles and all authors worked independently to determine the final eligibility. We resolved discrepancies by discussion. Whenever needed, we consulted an independent methodologist. We documented the excluded studies and reasons for exclusion (<I>see</I> table, 'Characteristics of excluded studies').</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Assessment of methodological quality</HEADING>
<P>Two authors independently assessed the included studies for sources of systematic bias according to the guidelines in Section 6 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2006</LINK>). We considered four parameters of quality: selection bias (allocation concealment), performance bias (masking of participants); detection bias (masking of outcome assessment), and attrition bias (completeness of follow up and intention-to-treat analysis). Masking of care providers who performed a surgical procedure would not be feasible in these trials and hence not used as a measure of quality.</P>
<P>We graded each parameter of trial methodological quality as: A (adequate) or B (unclear or not reported) or C (inadequate). We resolved disagreements between the authors by discussion and/or additional methodologist adjudication. We contacted trial investigators to clarify methodological details for trials that had quality parameter grading as unclear or not reported.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Data collection</HEADING>
<P>Two authors independently extracted data onto data extraction forms developed by the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group. We extracted the following study characteristics: study design, participants characteristics, intervention, the primary and secondary outcomes, adverse events and other relevant information. We resolved discrepancies between review authors by discussion. We contacted the study investigators for missing data. One author entered all data into Review Manager (RevMan 4.2) and this was verified using a double data-entry facility.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Data synthesis</HEADING>
<P>We followed the guidelines in Section 8 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2006</LINK>) for data analysis. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated a summary relative risk. For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean difference. Trials included in this review comprised a mixture of change from baseline and final value scores. We decided to combine trials with change from baseline outcomes in a meta-analysis with final measurement outcomes. In a randomized trial, the difference in mean final values would on average be the same as the difference in mean change scores (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Before combining the data, we qualitatively assessed heterogeneity by examining the characteristics of each study. We further examined statistical heterogeneity and inconsistency between studies using the forest plots, the results of the chi-square test and the value of I-squared statistics. If no substantial clinical or statistical heterogeneity was detected, we combined the results in a meta-analysis using a fixed-effect model. If there was heterogeneity that could not readily be explained, we incorporated the heterogeneity into a random-effects model. If substantial heterogeneity was observed, we presented the results in a tabulated summary.</P>
<P>We did not perform subgroup analyses according to characteristics such as dose of triamcinolone, types of diabetes, types of macular edema, duration of diabetes (less than five years, five to 30 years, more than 30 years), insulin use, baseline visual acuity and route of steroid administration because of insufficient data on these characteristics.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Types of participants</HEADING>
<P>We included seven studies from five countries (Australia, France, Germany, Italy, and the United States) with a total of 632 DME eyes in the review. The trials varied in size with five enrolling 30 to 80 DME eyes and the largest two enrolling 172 and 197 DME eyes. Participants were male and female adults. We found clinical heterogeneity in several areas. <LINK REF="STD-Jonas-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jonas 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kuppermann-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kuppermann 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pearson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pearson 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sutter-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sutter 2004</LINK> included patients with persistent DME for at least three months after adequate laser photocoagulation treatment; <LINK REF="STD-Avitabile-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Avitabile 2005</LINK> included patients without prior laser procedure. Participants varied in types of DME. Avitabile's study was on CME, generally considered to be a more severe and more chronic form of edema, and included patients with DME, branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO), and central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). Since the results were tabulated for each disease entity separately, the results for DME eyes could be singled out for use in our analysis. Kuppermann's study also enrolled participants with DME, BRVO, CRVO, uveitis and Irvine-Gass syndrome. We extracted DME results for analysis. The other studies did not specifically address the presence or absence of CME, but generally defined the edema as diffuse or focal, and as persistent or refractory. It is possible that some of these patients may also have had CME. The duration of diabetes, duration of DME, baseline macular edema, baseline retinal thickness and baseline IOP were not explicitly reported in most studies. Of the two studies reporting baseline retinal thickness (<LINK REF="STD-Avitabile-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Avitabile 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sutter-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sutter 2004</LINK>), the baseline values were comparable between treatment arms. Four studies reported comparable baseline visual acuity (<LINK REF="STD-Avitabile-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Avitabile 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jonas-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jonas 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kuppermann-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kuppermann 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sutter-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sutter 2004</LINK>). Two trials were reported in abstracts only (<LINK REF="STD-Pearson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pearson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pearson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Pearson 2005</LINK>) and no detailed information could be extracted. <LINK REF="STD-Audren-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Audren 2006</LINK> consisted of randomized and non-randomized participants.

Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Pearson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pearson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pearson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Pearson 2005</LINK>) compared intravitreal fluocinolone acetonide implantation of different dosage with standard of care (MLG or observation). The remaining one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kuppermann-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kuppermann 2007</LINK>) compared dexamethasone DDS, 350 or 700 ug to observation. <LINK REF="STD-Avitabile-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Avitabile 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Pearson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pearson 2002</LINK> also included a third treatment arm but this was not evaluated in the review.</P>

<B>Change in visual acuity (LogMAR) (</B>

<BR/>Two studies reported mean change in visual acuity from baseline (<LINK REF="STD-Jonas-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jonas 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sutter-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sutter 2004</LINK>). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Avitabile-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Avitabile 2005</LINK>) reported the final value. Since participants in both groups in a randomized trial are comparable at baseline due to randomization, comparison of the final mean visual acuity estimates the same treatment effects as comparison of mean change from baseline values. Sixty per cent of participants (26/43) in <LINK REF="STD-Sutter-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sutter 2004</LINK> had both eyes randomized. The authors applied statistical methods (generalized estimating equations (GEE)) to allow for correlations between paired eyes. We procured from the investigators the effect estimates and their standard errors and meta-analyzed them with other studies using the generic inverse variance method in RevMan. Seven per cent (2/38) of participants had both eyes randomized in <LINK REF="STD-Jonas-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jonas 2006</LINK>. The authors failed to account for the correlation statistically; however the influence would be minimal. The unit of randomization was unclear in <LINK REF="STD-Avitabile-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Avitabile 2005</LINK>. Studies reported various units for visual acuity measurement (letters, lines and LogMAR). We converted them into LogMAR for analysis.</P>
<P>At three months, the mean difference in visual acuity (change in mean visual acuity in the IVTA arm minus change in mean visual acuity in the comparison arm) in a fixed-effect model meta-analysis with three trials was -0.15 LogMAR (95% CI -0.21 to -0.09) in favor of IVTA. The chi-square test (6.93, df = 2; P = 0.03) and I-square value (71.1%) suggested statistical heterogeneity. Using the random-effects model, the mean difference in visual acuity was -0.20 LogMAR (95%CI -0.34 to -0.06) in favor of IVTA . Because the random-effects model suggested a stronger effect and because the number of trials was small, we preferred results based on the fixed-effect model.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-10-20 20:57:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Macular edema is an important cause of poor vision in diabetes, and consequently substantial research has been performed to devise ways to stabilize, improve, or prevent DME. One recent intervention for the presence of DME has been the use of intravitreal steroids in the form of triamcinolone acetate injections, or as an implant of fluocinolone acetonide or dexamethasone DDS. Intravitreal steroids have been used in a varying dose range, given once or in repeat doses, as a standalone therapy, in conjunction with laser therapy, or as follow-up therapy when standard laser therapy has failed. There have been many short-term trials on the treatment of DME using intraocular steroids, many uncontrolled, with varying results from which varying conclusions can be inferred (<LINK REF="STD-Avitabile-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Avitabile 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jonas-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jonas 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jonas-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jonas 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Massin-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Massin 2004</LINK>). Consequently, this review is an attempt to analyze the available randomized clinical trials to determine the effectiveness and safety of intraocular steroids in treating DME.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Summary of main results</HEADING>
<P>In this systematic review of randomized clinical trials, evidence suggests a beneficial effect from IVTA and dexamethasone DDS. There might be evidence of benefit with the use of FAI. However, this conclusion is limited by the ways that the trial results have been reported.</P>
<P>With respect to IVTA, evidence suggests a treatment effect in favor of IVTA at three, six, nine and 24 months follow up measured by improvement in LogMAR visual acuity (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). Meta-analysis of two studies (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>) at three months showed a one line visual improvement favoring IVTA. However, at six months there was no statistically significant difference (<LINK REF="STD-Jonas-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jonas 2006</LINK>), but again at 24 months the results were statistically significant for an IVTA treatment effect (<LINK REF="STD-Sutter-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sutter 2004</LINK>). Since Jonas only gave a single injection of 20 mg IVTA, the drug may have gradually disappeared from the eye leading to a drop off in effect, while Sutter's patients could receive a reinjection of IVTA if there was a five letter or greater decline in vision. Thus the retreatment can be viewed as promoting a more sustained effect. Since no quality of life or economic data are available in any of these studies, it is difficult to assign meaning to a one line change in vision. However, it is a trend in favor of IVTA use. Two sets of data for a three line improvement in vision were available (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). We did not find evidence of a three line or more improvement comparing IVTA to a sham injection at three months. Similarly at 24 months data from one trial also failed to show a statistically significant effect. The small number of events makes meaningful analysis limited.</P>
<P>Reduction in retinal thickness is considered a mechanism for visual improvement in the treatment of macular edema. Therefore a corresponding reduction in thickness would be expected if there was a trend toward visual improvement. At three months, the meta-analysis of two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Avitabile-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Avitabile 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sutter-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sutter 2004</LINK>) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>) showed a reduction in retinal thickness of the IVTA arm compared to controls. The relative reduction appeared to be sustained at six, nine and 24 months. Also <LINK REF="STD-Sutter-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sutter 2004</LINK> demonstrated a resolution of one grade of macular edema in favor of IVTA (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>).</P>
<P>Since current therapy is directed primarily at stabilizing or reducing the loss of vision, it is important to know if intraocular steroids might, as a side effect, promote the loss of vision. In <LINK REF="STD-Jonas-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jonas 2006</LINK> at six months only 2 of 23 IVTA eyes experienced decreased visual acuity compared to 2 of 9 (22%) controls (RR = 0.39; 95% CI 0.06 to 2.37). In <LINK REF="STD-Sutter-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sutter 2004</LINK> at two years 6 of 34 IVTA eyes had decreased visual acuity compared to 13 of 35 control eyes (RR = 0.48; 95% 0.20 to 1.11). These results suggest that IVTA does not materially contribute to an increased risk of visual loss.</P>
<P>With regard to intravitreal steroid implants, two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Pearson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pearson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pearson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Pearson 2005</LINK>) evaluated the efficacy of FAI implants versus the standard of care (observation or MGL), and one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kuppermann-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kuppermann 2007</LINK>) evaluated dexamethasone DDS, 350 or 700 ug versus observation. Of two FAI trials, data were reported only in abstract form, and specific details regarding patient characteristics, trial design, and complete results were not available. At 12 months the implant eyes in the first study (<LINK REF="STD-Pearson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pearson 2002</LINK>) showed a reduction in macular edema, but no measurable improvement in visual acuity compared to the controls since the RR covered the null value (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). However, at the 24-month follow up the mean change in visual acuity was a gain of 0.190.29 LogMAR while the controls lost 0.040.30 LogMAR (<LINK REF="STD-Pearson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pearson 2002</LINK>). The delayed visual improvement in the FAI group may be principally attributed to masking by the cataract with vision showing improvement compared to baseline once the cataract was removed. In the second study (<LINK REF="STD-Pearson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Pearson 2005</LINK>), a marginal statistically significant effect on a three line improvement in visual acuity was reported at 36 months (<I>Analysis 02.01</I>), while a three line loss was found in 19% (24/127) of the implant eyes and 16% (11/70) of the control eyes (RR = 1.2; 95% CI 0.63 to 2.31). Also 58% (74/127) of implant eyes showed no evidence of edema compared to 30% (21/70) of control eyes at 12 months (RR = 1.94; 95% CI 1.32 to 2.86). The dexamethasone DDS trial enrolled participants with various underlying causes of macular edema. For all participants, dexamethasone DDS was associated with improved visual acuity, reduced central retinal thickness, and improved fluorescein leakage at three months. In the subgroup affected by DME, 58% (33/57) in the DDS 700 ug group showed a two-line improvement in vision compared to 21% (12/57) in the observation group (RR = 2.75; 95% CI 1.59 to 4.76).</P>
<P>Elevation of IOP and cataract progression occur in both IVTA and implants treated eyes but appear manageable.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Strengths of the review</HEADING>
<P>To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis on the topic of intravitreal steroids for macular edema in diabetes. It attempts to offer an up-to-date and complete overview of randomized trials concerning this subject.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Quality of the evidence and limitations</HEADING>
<P>Limitations to our systematic review mainly stem from the inherent clinical heterogeneity in the included trials. The differences in the types of DME, background disease profile, previous DME treatment and different comparison interventions made it difficult to pool the data in an accurate manner. Furthermore, since the exact definition and measurement of outcomes, such as visual acuity and retinal thickness vary among studies, our pooled results may be biased due to misclassification. In addition, we obtained limited data and methodological details for the two FAI trials. Such methodologic limitations made it difficult to quantify the magnitude of effect of FAI and establish firm conclusions.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Our analysis suggests that intravitreal steroid injections and implants may have some treatment effect for some cases of persistent or refractory DME in situations where the current standard of care was insufficient, but because of the varied treatment protocols, our analysis failed to identify any specific practice algorithms. Because of the relatively short half-life of IVTA, repeat injections may be required to maintain or obtain the desired effect which might increase the risk of injection-related complications such as infectious endophthalmitis, retinal tears, retinal detachment, retinal holes and vitreous hemorrhage. Intravitreal steroid implants help circumvent the complications of repeat injections and may have a more sustained effect, but they may also have a greater risk of elevated IOP requiring medical and surgical intervention and a greater risk of cataract progression requiring surgery. Finally, these studies do not readily address the treatment effect of intravitreal steroids on other stages of DME, especially the earlier stage either as standalone therapy or in combination with other therapies, such as laser photocoagulation. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The seven studies (three IVTA studies and four intravitreal steroid implantation studies) in our report dealt primarily with persistent or refractory DME and raise important issues including the role of injections versus implantation, dosage, timing of the intervention, type of edema to be treated (chronic versus acute, diffuse versus focal versus cystoid) and the role of steroids in relationship to other forms of treatment such as laser therapy. The question arises whether the treatment should be reserved for chronic refractory edema or if it may be useful in the earlier stages of DME. Economic and quality of life data also need to be considered as well as the rate and severity of complications, how best to manage them, and the overall effect of these complications on the ultimate value of the treatment. One ongoing trial has been organized to address some of these issues (Ip 2004). The trial is investigating whether IVTA at a dose of 1 mg versus a dose of 4 mg produce greater benefit, with an acceptable safety profile, compared to macular laser photocoagulation in the treatment of DME (planned to enroll 795 patients; primary outcome at three years). We will update the review with data from this study as it becomes available. </P>
