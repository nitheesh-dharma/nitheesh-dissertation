<P>Intrauterine insemination (IUI) is a recommended treatment for women with unexplained subfertility. In an IUI cycle, sperm are processed in the laboratory and placed directly in the womb at the time of ovulation with a catheter. Recent research suggested that the type of catheter used in in vitro fertilisation (IVF) may have had an influence on the pregnancy outcomes, but the effect of catheters on IUI had been poorly investigated. We reviewed studies that compared different catheters in IUI procedures, but the effect of catheter choice on the pregnancy outcomes still remains unknown.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2010-09-16 13:59:07 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the following databases (inception to July 2010) with no language restrictions: Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL (<I>The Cochrane Library</I>), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS and OpenSigle. We also searched the conference abstracts in the ISI Web of Knowledge and Google, and conference abstracts and citation lists of relevant publications, reviews and included studies.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2010-09-13 09:47:35 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included only truly randomised controlled studies of women who underwent IUI using either soft or firm catheter types and reporting data on rates of live birth, clinical pregnancy, multiple pregnancy, miscarriage, ease of introduction of the catheter, occurrence of trauma, or woman's discomfort.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2010-09-13 09:47:35 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors screened the titles and abstracts of 78 potentially eligible studies and excluded 66 of these. We critically appraised the full texts of twelve studies and excluded three studies. Nine publications of six studies were remaining. We extracted data from the six remaining studies and there were no disagreements. We assessed risk of bias and pooled dichotomous data and presented the Peto odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-10-07 13:21:27 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There was no evidence of a significant effect difference regarding the choice of catheter type for any of the outcomes. Three studies reported live birth rates (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.35) with a translated OR percentages (1.3, 95% CI 0.56 to 3.1) while six studies reported clinical pregnancy rates (OR 1.0, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.35 ). Two studies were pooled for the analysis of miscarriages (OR 1.25, 95% CI 0.49 to 3.22). Results of other adverse outcomes were reported per cycle and were therefore not pooled.</P>

<P>On the basis of the evidence available in this review, no specific conclusion can be made regarding the superiority of one catheter class over another.

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-09-13 09:44:07 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-09-13 09:44:03 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>At present, 16% of prospective parents seek advice for subfertility. No cause can be identified in 8% to 28% of all couples presenting with fertility problems (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2004</LINK>). Some of these couples will undergo intrauterine insemination (IUI) or artificial insemination (AI). These methods of assisted reproductive technology are indicated in cases of cervical subfertility, relative male factor subfertility, anovulation, endometriosis with a healthy fallopian tube and unexplained subfertility (<LINK REF="REF-Merviel-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merviel 2010</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-09-13 09:44:05 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In spite of the success with newer and more sophisticated assisted reproductive techniques (ART) (<LINK REF="REF-Verhulst-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verhulst 2009</LINK>), IUI remains the recommended treatment for couples with unexplained subfertility. The rationale for this is that IUI is a successful low cost alternative when compared to the more advanced fertility treatments such as in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) (<LINK REF="REF-Iberico-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iberico 2004</LINK>).The costs of IUI are considerably lower, the pregnancy rates are similar and the procedure is less stressful and invasive compared to IVF and ICSI (<LINK REF="REF-Cohlen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohlen 2005</LINK>). Intrauterine insemination is recommended for women with unexplained subfertility as the success rates are similar to those achieved with IVF/ ICSI in this population (<LINK REF="REF-Pandian-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pandian 2009</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-09-13 09:44:07 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Evidence regarding the pregnancy rate per cycle of IUI has shown marked variability, which range between 8% and 26% (<LINK REF="REF-Cohlen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohlen 2005</LINK>). This great variation in pregnancy rates might be due to female characteristics (cause and duration of subfertility and age), male characteristics (sperm count and motility) and technical aspects (<LINK REF="REF-Iberico-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iberico 2004</LINK>). Technical aspects that can possibly affect pregnancy outcomes for IUI include ovulation induction protocols, timing of insemination, number of performed cycles and catheter type (<LINK REF="REF-Merviel-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merviel 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>In an IUI cycle, spermatozoa are processed and placed directly in the uterus at the time of ovulation with a catheter. Bypassing the cervix, which also acts as a reservoir and a barrier for sperm, the spermatozoa are close to the released oocyte (<LINK REF="REF-Verhulst-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verhulst 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Higher pregnancy rates can further be achieved if IUI is performed with additional ovarian hyperstimulation (OH). The two most commonly used drugs for ovarian hyperstimulation in IUI cycles are clomiphene citrate (CC), which is an oral treatment; and gonadotropins, administered by subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. The aim of OH is to increase the number of oocytes available for fertilisation and to enhance accurate timing for the IUI procedure (<LINK REF="REF-Verhulst-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verhulst 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>In a systematic review of embryo transfer (ET) catheters, the softness of the ET catheter was found to be a determining factor in the success of ET procedures (<LINK REF="REF-Abou_x002d_Setta-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abou-Setta 2005</LINK>). The explanation for this is still unclear but it is presumed to be associated with reduced traumatic effects of the softer catheter during introduction of the embryo into the uterine cavity, more significant myometrium contractions with the firmer catheters, or a combination of effects (<LINK REF="REF-Kovacs-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kovacs 1999</LINK>). The authors also evaluated the number of cycles in which blood on the catheter tip is present to examine if there is a difference in traumatic effects among soft and firm catheters.</P>
<P>Various types of IUI catheters are commercially available, varying in length, calibre and location of the distal port (end or side dispersion systems). They also differ in the degree of firmness and rigidity. Some technical aspects are similar for all catheters. First of all, they need to be firm enough to negotiate the cervix, but soft enough to avoid any trauma to the endocervix and/or endometrium as it finds its way into the uterine cavity. Furthermore, it is preferable that the intrauterine tip of the catheter occupies a small volume, in order to minimise reflux of the inserted materials (<LINK REF="REF-Lavie-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lavie 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Commercially available IUI catheters can be categorised into two groups, soft or firm <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2010-07-23 13:22:56 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="nicolien van der  Poel">
<P>In contrast to the ET catheter, the impact of the choice of IUI catheter on the treatment outcome has been poorly investigated and data comparing different types of IUI catheters are limited. Several reports have noted differences in pregnancy rates for soft and semirigid catheter types for embryo transfer during IVF, but few reports exist for IUI (<LINK REF="REF-Proctor-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Proctor 2007</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Lavie-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lavie 1997</LINK> found that a soft catheter is significantly less damaging for the endometrium than a rigid one, but they did not find a statistically significant difference in pregnancy rate.</P>
<P>Currently rigid catheters are more commonly used for IUI (<LINK REF="REF-Proctor-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Proctor 2007</LINK>). The aim of this review is to evaluate the impact of the choice of catheter used for IUI.</P>

<P>NP and LB screened for inclusion all identified citations for the a priori criteria and removed those citations that were clearly irrelevant. We retrieved the full-text manuscripts for all studies that were potentially eligible for inclusion. Trials that met the inclusion criteria were further identified for data extraction and assessment of their inherent risk of bias.</P>
</STUDY_SELECTION>
<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2010-09-13 09:45:12 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>NP and LB independently extracted data from eligible studies using a data extraction form (<LINK REF="APP-07" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 7</LINK>). Where possible, we extracted data to allow for an intention-to-treat analysis defined as including all randomised participants in the denominator. Review authors corresponded with study investigators in order to resolve any data queries as required. We included the data following the guidance of The Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>). We managed and analysed the data using Review Manager (RevMan) 5.</P>

<P>NP and LB independently assessed risk of bias, using the pro forma <LINK REF="APP-07" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 7</LINK>. We present this information in risk of bias figures, <I>see</I> <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK> and <LINK TAG="STUDY_QUALITY" TYPE="SECTION">Risk of bias in included studies</LINK>.</P>
<P>Each risk of bias domain was classified yes, no, or unclear. The domains of bias considered included the following:</P>
<P>1) Sequence generation. Was the allocation sequence adequately generated? For example, a low risk of bias was allocated when the investigators described a random component in the sequence generation process.</P>
<P>2) Allocation concealment. Was allocation adequately concealed? For example, a low risk of bias was allocated if the participants and investigators could not foresee assignment.</P>
<P>3) Blinding. Was knowledge of the allocated interventions adequately prevented during the study? Since the clinicians performing the intrauterine insemination were aware of which type of catheter they were using, they could not have been blinded. We considered blinding of participants, outcome assessors and clinicians but we were aware from the fact that blinding of the clinicians was not possible.</P>
<P>4) Incomplete outcome data. Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed? For example, a low risk of bias was allocated if there were no missing outcome data or the missing outcome data balanced in numbers across intervention groups, with similar reasons for missing data across groups.</P>
<P>5) Selective outcome reporting: Are the reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting? For example, a low risk of bias was allocated if the study protocol was available and all of the study's pre-specified outcomes that were of interest in the review had been reported in the pre-specified way.</P>
<P>6) Other sources of bias. We considered other sources of bias including study funding and sponsorship and significant differences between baseline characteristics.</P>

<P>We performed statistical analysis in accordance with the guidelines developed by The Cochrane Collaboration. Heterogeneity was investigated by:</P>
<P>1) Visual inspection of the overlap of the confidence intervals. Poor overlap of the confidence intervals indicated heterogeneity. In the analysis of the pregnancy rate, in which all our included studies were present, all confidence intervals showed overlap with each other.<BR/>2) Using the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test for heterogeneity with a 10% level of statistical significance. A low P value (or large Chi<SUP>2</SUP> statistic relative to its degree of freedom) provides evidence of heterogeneity of intervention effects.<BR/>3) Interpreting the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic in these broad terms:<BR/>1. 0% to 40%: might not be important;<BR/>2. 30% to 60%: may represent moderate heterogeneity;<BR/>3. 50% to 90%: may represent substantial heterogeneity;<BR/>4. 75% to 100%: considerable heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>)*</P>

<P>We attempted to reduce publication and other reporting biases through the use of alternative robust search strategies including: searching the Internet (for example Google scholar), completing a comprehensive search of the grey literature and seeking alternative sources of data or synthesised evidence.</P>
<P>In this review, as the number of included studies was less than ten, we did not produce a funnel plot. A visual inspection of the plot could have been used to confirm the presence and magnitude of publication and related bias (PRB). In future updates of this review, more studies might have been published about this topic. We might be able to construct a funnel plot in future updates to detect publication bias.</P>
<P>We explored within study reporting biases by asking the authors for availability of study protocols, but no studies published protocols so assessment was not possible.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Study design characteristics</HEADING>
<P>The studies were all published in English and conducted in single centres in the following countries: Belgium (<LINK REF="STD-Evenepoel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Evenepoel 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vermeylen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Vermeylen 2006</LINK>), Hungary (<LINK REF="STD-Fancsovits-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Fancsovits 2005</LINK>), USA (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Segal-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Segal 1998</LINK>), Thailand (<LINK REF="STD-Vutyavanich-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Vutyavanich 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>One study was a cross over study (<LINK REF="STD-Evenepoel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Evenepoel 2007</LINK>), the rest of the studies were parallel, randomised controlled studies.</P>
<P>The durations of the studies varied from the minimum of four and a half months (<LINK REF="STD-Evenepoel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Evenepoel 2007</LINK>) to 40 months (<LINK REF="STD-Fancsovits-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Fancsovits 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The sample size of the included studies ranged in size from 51 (<LINK REF="STD-Segal-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Segal 1998</LINK>) women to 251 women (<LINK REF="STD-Fancsovits-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Fancsovits 2005</LINK>). The number of cycles performed in each study varied from 51 (<LINK REF="STD-Segal-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Segal 1998</LINK>) to 747 (<LINK REF="STD-Fancsovits-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Fancsovits 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>We asked the authors of all included studies if they performed a power calculation. Four of them replied that they did not perform a power calculation. <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2005</LINK> performed a power calculation. This showed that with a sample size of 50 for each treatment group and an &#945; of 0.05, the study had a power of only 12% to detect a 6% difference (16% versus 22%) in pregnancy rate, therefore making this study underpowered. <LINK REF="STD-Vermeylen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Vermeylen 2006</LINK> performed a power calculation, which estimated that a sample size of 270 patients per group was needed to show a 10% difference in pregnancy rate.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Baseline characteristics of participants</HEADING>
<P>All studies included subfertile women who met inclusion criteria for IUI. Inclusion criteria for IUI were considered to be male factor, unexplained, cervical, ovarian and tubal subfertility, as well as combinations of those. Various causes of subfertility were stated in the studies. In two studies, the cause of subfertility was stated per woman (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vutyavanich-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Vutyavanich 2003</LINK>). The most common causes of subfertility stated in those studies were ovarian and unexplained subfertility.</P>
<P>Inclusion criteria differed amongst the studies. A minimum duration of subfertility of one year was considered as an inclusion criterion in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Fancsovits-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Fancsovits 2005</LINK>). A maximum duration of subfertility of two years was considered as an inclusion criterion in another study (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2005</LINK>). At least one open fallopian tube was an inclusion criterion in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Fancsovits-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Fancsovits 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vutyavanich-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Vutyavanich 2003</LINK>). Three studies considered general criteria for undergoing IUI as an inclusion criterion for the study participants (<LINK REF="STD-Evenepoel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Evenepoel 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Segal-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Segal 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vermeylen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Vermeylen 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Exclusion criteria were severe male factor (sperm count of less than 10 million per ml) or bilateral tubal obstruction (<LINK REF="STD-Fancsovits-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Fancsovits 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vutyavanich-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Vutyavanich 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The ages varied from an average (SD) of 30.9 (3.7) to 33.1 (5.3) but the ages did not vary much between study groups within studies. Age was considered as an exclusion criterion in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Evenepoel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Evenepoel 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vutyavanich-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Vutyavanich 2003</LINK>), where women were excluded if they were over 38 and 42 years, respectively.</P>

<P>The ovarian stimulation protocols varied among the studies. In our included studies, participants were treated with ovarian stimulation methods using clomiphene citrate, gonadotropins, a combination of both, or underwent a natural cycle. In two studies, the stimulation method was stated per woman (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vutyavanich-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Vutyavanich 2003</LINK>). In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Fancsovits-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Fancsovits 2005</LINK>), all women received a combination of clomiphene citrate and gonadotropins. In two studies, the stimulation methods used were described as natural, clomiphene citrate or gonadotropins (<LINK REF="STD-Evenepoel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Evenepoel 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Segal-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Segal 1998</LINK>). They also explained that there was no significant difference in the stimulation protocols amongst the groups studied, but no details were stated per randomised woman. In <LINK REF="STD-Vermeylen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Vermeylen 2006</LINK>, some women (18%) received a clomiphene citrate stimulation protocol and most women (82%) received a gonadotropin stimulation protocol.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes studied</HEADING>
<P>Live birth rate per woman was a reported outcome for two of our included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Evenepoel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Evenepoel 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fancsovits-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Fancsovits 2005</LINK>). Data about the live birth rate per woman from <LINK REF="STD-Fancsovits-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Fancsovits 2005</LINK> were found in a review about IUI (<LINK REF="REF-Abou_x002d_Setta-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abou-Setta 2006</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Vermeylen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Vermeylen 2006</LINK> reported live birth rate per cycle and not per woman.</P>
<P>Pregnancy rate per woman was reported as an outcome in five included studies, but the definition of pregnancies varied among the studies. Four studies reported clinical pregnancy rate, defined as the presence of an intrauterine gestational sac on endovaginal sonogram between 6 and 7 weeks' gestational age (<LINK REF="STD-Evenepoel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Evenepoel 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Segal-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Segal 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vutyavanich-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Vutyavanich 2003</LINK>). One study reported biochemical pregnancy rates and used an urinary pregnancy test to confirm pregnancy (<LINK REF="STD-Fancsovits-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Fancsovits 2005</LINK>). We used the live birth data in our analysis, in order not to overestimate the effect.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Vermeylen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Vermeylen 2006</LINK> reported biochemical pregnancy rates per cycle and not per woman. We asked the authors whether they reported clinical pregnancies and they explained how we could calculate them. We used the pregnancy rates stated in the paper, and subtracted the numbers of biochemical pregnancies and miscarriages reported in the paper to get the clinical pregnancy rates.</P>
<P>The following outcomes were reported per cycle and not per woman. Reporting of outcomes per woman is preferable, because the use of multiple observations (cycles) per woman leads to unpredictable bias in the estimate of treatment difference (<LINK REF="REF-Vail-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vail 2003</LINK>). The studies did not report these outcomes per woman.</P>

<P>In this review, we evaluated the influence of the type of insemination catheter, soft versus firm, on the efficacy of the IUI treatment. We found no evidence of a significant difference in pregnancy outcomes in favour of soft or firm catheters.

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2010-09-13 09:46:37 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Women undergoing IUI are interested in the likelihood of success, meaning giving birth to at least one healthy child (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2009</LINK>). Therefore, studies reporting the incidence of live births are preferred over other pregnancy related outcomes. Live birth was reported as an outcome by three of the six included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Evenepoel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Evenepoel 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fancsovits-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Fancsovits 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vermeylen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Vermeylen 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>We found limited data on additional pregnancy-related and adverse outcomes. A common surrogate for the live birth rate is the clinical pregnancy rate. There was some heterogeneity among the included studies on how they defined this outcome with four studies using an ultrasound to confirm pregnancy at seven weeks, and two studies using a urinary pregnancy test. The use of biochemical pregnancy rates which are measured by a urinary pregnancy test alone can overestimate the true effect and is therefore unfavourable.</P>
<P>The incidence of miscarriage, an outcome that is very important to women undergoing IUI, was not well reported in the included studies. One study reported miscarriage in the published report (<LINK REF="STD-Vermeylen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Vermeylen 2006</LINK>), while one other study provided data after contact with the trial authors (<LINK REF="STD-Evenepoel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Evenepoel 2007</LINK>). One study only reported on miscarriage as a proportion of the total number of pregnancies, but not per woman (<LINK REF="STD-Vutyavanich-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Vutyavanich 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Another outcome important for women undergoing IUI is the occurrence of discomfort or pain during or after the procedure. This outcome was not well reported with only three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Evenepoel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Evenepoel 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Segal-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Segal 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vutyavanich-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Vutyavanich 2003</LINK>) reporting on this outcome. However, we were not able to pool the results of this outcome because they all reported different types of data, e.g. binary, ordinal and numeric.</P>
<P>We planned to conduct subgroup analyses on different stimulation protocols and different causes of infertility. Since too few data were available, we were not able to perform these subgroup analyses.</P>
<P>Cost factors associated with soft versus firm catheters were not investigated in any of the included studies.<BR/>
</P>
<P>We did not limit our search to a specific cause of subfertility, therefore our review evaluated IUI procedures for all kinds of causes of subfertility. We did not limit our search to specific IUI catheters either, also including studies comparing IVF catheters with IUI catheters as long as they compared soft and firm catheters used during an IUI procedure.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2010-09-13 09:46:41 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Overall the quality of the evidence was poor because of methodological limitations, <I>see</I> Risk of bias figures (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>, <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>Four of our studies did not perform a power calculation to evaluate whether the number of women included in the study was adequate. Two studies performed a power calculation (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vermeylen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Vermeylen 2006</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2005</LINK> found it had lack of power to detect a significant difference in pregnancy rate.</P>
<P>In the included studies of our review, the reasons for and number of dropouts and withdrawals were not clearly stated. Therefore, we could not confirm if an intention to treat analysis was really performed or whether authors just did not report on withdrawals and drop-outs. This may have led to exaggerated estimates of treatment effect.</P>
<P>The clinical procedures and protocols used for the IUI procedure varied among the studies and there is also variability in skills between physicians performing the inseminations. It is unreasonable to expect absolute experimental uniformity among the centres and different centres inevitably display some variations in the application of assisted reproduction techniques.</P>
<P>Many of our studies reported their outcomes per cycle, when it was women or couples who were randomised. This is referred to as the &#8217;unit-of-analysis error&#8217; (<LINK REF="REF-Vail-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vail 2003</LINK>). It is methodologically incorrect to report data per cycle, because many of the randomised women will undergo more than one treatment cycle and it is also methodologically incorrect to pool such results. Use of multiple observations per woman leads to unpredictable bias in the estimate of treatment difference and exaggerates the sample size. This exaggeration may lead to spuriously narrow confidence intervals and low P values (<LINK REF="REF-Vail-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vail 2003</LINK>). A better approach is to report cumulative pregnancy rates where a woman is randomised to three cycles of the same intervention.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2010-09-13 09:46:43 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The review authors attempted to reduce publication and other reporting biases through the use of alternative robust search strategies including: handsearching using the Internet (for example Google scholar), completing a comprehensive search of the grey literature and seeking alternative sources of data or synthesised evidence.</P>
<P>In this review, as the number of included studies was fewer than ten, a funnel plot was not constructed for investigation of possible publication bias. Visual inspection of the plot could have been used to confirm the presence and magnitude of publication and related bias (PRB). In future updates of this review, more studies might have been published allowing for further investigation of the possibility of publication bias.</P>
<P>Inclusion of one study (<LINK REF="STD-Vermeylen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Vermeylen 2006</LINK>) that randomised cycles and not women might have introduced unintended bias into this review. We performed sensitivity analyses to determine the effect of inclusion of this study for the outcomes live birth, pregnancy and miscarriage rates.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2010-09-13 09:46:50 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In our review, there was no evidence of a difference in pregnancy outcomes for soft or firm catheters. Similar studies comparing embryo transfer catheters showed that the choice of catheter might affect the success of IVF cycles because soft catheters might be less traumatic to the endometrium (<LINK REF="REF-Abou_x002d_Setta-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abou-Setta 2005</LINK>). There are several confounders to consider for explaining this difference.</P>
<P>1. Sperm regurgitation. The embryo transfer procedure is a very critical one compared to IUI. During embryo transfer, only a limited number of embryos (usually one or two) are deposited into the uterine cavity, and any initiation of uterine contractions or regurgitation of the inserted volume may result in the expulsion of the embryos and failure of the whole procedure. In the IUI procedure on the other hand, a large volume of sperm (usually over 10 million) gets inserted into the uterine cavity. If a small amount of the inserted volume gets regurgitated (because of uterine contractions or because of differences in catheter design), the procedure may still be successful (<LINK REF="REF-Abou_x002d_Setta-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abou-Setta 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>2. Trauma to the cervix and endometrium. There is a difference between the location and timing of events surrounding fertilisation and implantation in embryo transfer after IVF and IUI. The effect of the catheter tip on uterine contractility and trauma to the endometrium could be more important at or around the time of implantation (embryo transfer) than at the time of ovulation (IUI). After IUI, embryo implantation in the uterus occurs only about seven days after fertilisation. In contrast, after embryo transfer, embryo attachment will occur within days after transfer. Therefore, the implantation rate per embryo may be reduced if the embryo transfer catheter causes direct damage to the endometrium (<LINK REF="REF-Schoolcraft-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schoolcraft 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vermeylen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Vermeylen 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>3. Publication bias. Only limited data are available regarding the effect of the catheter during insemination on pregnancy and live births. A robust search of the literature brought us only six randomised controlled studies evaluating different catheters for IUI. The most obvious explanation for the small number of studies is that they are not required for marketing purposes.</P>
<P>We found two large retrospective studies and one systematic review of the literature about the effect of catheter types on the pregnancy outcomes for IUI. <LINK REF="REF-Iberico-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iberico 2004</LINK> reviewed data from 1010 IUI cycles performed on 470 women, in one Infertility centre between 2000 and 2002. Information concerning pregnancy, multiple pregnancy or miscarriage was extracted from the patients' files. They selected various variables for the analysis, one of which was catheter type and found that catheter type was not associated to the pregnancy rate.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Merviel-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merviel 2010</LINK> did a retrospective study on 1038 IUI cycles to determine the predictive factors for successful pregnancy and birth. They found that the type of catheter used was correlated with differing pregnancy rates, 15.3% per cycle for a soft catheter versus 7% for a hard catheter (P &lt; .02).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Abou_x002d_Setta-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abou-Setta 2005</LINK> performed a systematic review of randomised trials comparing different classes of catheters used during IUI, and found that there is a lack of evidence to suggest that one type of catheters is superior to another one during IUI procedures.</P>
<P>The results of these studies are therefore inconsistent and a possible explanation could be that the retrospective studies (<LINK REF="REF-Merviel-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merviel 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Iberico-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iberico 2004</LINK>
<U>)</U> may be confounded.</P>
<P>We found one paper that investigated the cost aspects of soft versus firm catheters (<LINK REF="REF-Proctor-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Proctor 2007</LINK>). The study concluded that the flexible catheter is a better choice for the IUI procedure. Although the flexible catheter costs more than the rigid catheter, this paper claimed that it is associated with a higher pregnancy rate, which decreases costs of IUI treatment because fewer cycles are needed. This conclusion is not in complete agreement with the conclusions we drew in this review, because we did not find enough evidence to conclude that soft or flexible catheters have a significantly higher pregnancy rate than rigid or firm catheters.</P>

<P>There is no evidence of a significant difference between soft and firm catheters for IUI for pregnancy outcomes or adverse events.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Clinicians should base their choice on availability, cost, and personal preferences.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-09-13 09:46:59 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>If further studies are undertaken then the primary outcome should be the number of live births per woman. Other important outcomes are adverse events such as miscarriage and procedural adverse effects such as pain and difficulties using the catheters. The unit-of-analysis used for randomisation and analysis should be per woman and not per cycle.</P>
<P>Treatment protocols, methods of sperm preparation, number of embryos transferred, inclusion and exclusion criteria should be clearly stated. The participant characteristics should be clear (age, duration of infertility, parity, infertility investigations and previous therapy).</P>
<P>Future studies should use adequate methods of randomisation and the number and reason for dropouts and withdrawals should be clearly stated. Allocation concealment should be adequate and an intention-to-treat analysis performed.</P>
<P>As some of the interventions are more expensive than others, a cost analysis of the treatments studied is needed.</P>

<P>The authorship has changes between the protocol and the review. In 2006, the protocol was first published by the team of AM Abou-Setta. In 2010, the protocol was changed and published by the team of NA van der Poel.</P>
<P>The title has changed in the new protocol. In the publication of 2006 the title was 'Technical aspects of intrauterine insemination, soft versus firm catheter types'. In the new version, published in 2010, the title changed in to 'Soft versus firm catheters for intrauterine insemination'.</P>
<P>After publication of the protocol, we changed the criteria for inclusion of studies. We included a study that randomised per cycle and not per woman but we calculated that only 20% of the women had more than one cycle. We performed sensitivity analyses to determine whether conclusions would have differed if this study were excluded.</P>

<OL>
<LI>The Wallace<SUP>tm</SUP> IUI catheter (Smiths Medical) is a soft, flexible, double-lumen catheter, utilising a co-axial system. The inner catheter is 18 cm long, with a rounded tip, and utilizes a bilateral side dispersion design to help prevent contamination and blockage of the catheter during insertion. Its outer sheath is flexible, but with memory, which can be pre-shaped to aid insertion.</LI>
<LI>The Cook<SUP>tm</SUP> Soft-Pass IUI Catheter (Cook Women's Health, Spencer, USA) is also a soft, flexible, double-lumen, co-axial catheter system. The inner catheter is 19 cm long with a rounded tip. Its outer guide catheter is similar to the outer sheath of the Wallace IUI catheter.</LI>
<LI>The Gynetics<SUP>tm</SUP> IUI catheter (Gynetics Medical Products, Hamon-Achel, Belgium) is a soft, flexible, double-lumen, co-axial catheter system. It is 20.6 cm in length with a rounded tip. In addition, similar to the Wallace IUI catheter, it uses two lateral ports at the distal end for intrauterine sperm distribution. It also comes with a solid, thicker outer catheter for bypassing the difficult cervix.</LI>
<LI>The K-soft<SUP>tm</SUP> 1000 catheter (Cook Women's Health, Spencer, USA) is a new soft catheter combined with a firm outer catheter. The soft, flexible catheter is designed to facilitate catheter placement. The soft tip is 4.7 cm long, and the catheter length is 22.1 cm.</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Firm IUI catheters</HEADING>
<OL>
<LI>The Tomcat<SUP>tm</SUP> IUI catheter (Kendall Sovereign, Mansfield, MA, USA) is a firm, semi-rigid, single-lumen catheter. it is 11.4 cm long and with an open-end design. Originally, it was designed for draining the bladders of male cats, hence its name. It is designed with a semi-rigid but flexible body which enables the catheter to be moulded to the curvature of the uterus.</LI>
<LI>The Makler<SUP>tm</SUP> IUI Cannula and Insemination Device (Sefi-Medical Instrument, Haifa, Israel) is composed of two main parts: (i) a cannula that can be fitted to the tip of 1.0 ml tuberculin syringe and (ii) a carrier to hold the syringe. The Makler IUI catheter is a firm, semi-rigid, single-lumen catheter with a rounded tip. It has a flared-base shape, which serves to seal the cervix at the time of insemination to help prevent the backflow of the injected contents.</LI>
<LI>The Frydman<SUP>tm</SUP> catheter (C.C.D. laboratories, France) is a polyethylene open ended catheter with a length of 18 cm and an external diameter of 1.6 mm. The length of the flexible tip is 4.5 cm. It has a strengthened proximal section for better handling.</LI>
