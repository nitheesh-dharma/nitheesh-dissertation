<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-01-22 11:34:30 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Review question:</P>
<P>How many embryos should be transferred in couples undergoing ART?</P>
<P>Background:</P>
<P>Multiple pregnancy creates serious health risks for the mother (such as premature labour, diabetes and high blood pressure) and for the babies, who are at much higher risk than single babies of problems including premature birth, low birth weight, cerebral palsy and perinatal death. Single embryo transfer is now being seriously considered in order to reduce multiple pregnancies but this needs to be balanced against the risk of lowering the overall live birth rate. Researchers in The Cochrane Collaboration reviewed the evidence about the number of embryos transferred in women undergoing ART. The search is current to July 2013.</P>
<P>Study characteristics:</P>
<P>We found 14 randomised controlled trials with a total of 2165 participants. Most were not commercially funded.</P>
<P>Key findings:</P>
<P>
<I>Double versus repeated single embryo transfer</I>
</P>
<P>Based on low quality evidence, there was no indication that overall live birth rates differed substantially when <I>repeated</I> single embryo transfer (either two cycles of single embryo transfer or one cycle of single embryo transfer followed by transfer of a single frozen embryo in a natural or hormone-stimulated cycle) was compared with double embryo transfer. The evidence suggested that for a woman with a 42% chance of live birth following a single cycle of double embryo transfer, the chance following repeated single embryo transfer would be between 31% and 44%. The risk of multiple birth was very much lower in the single embryo transfer group: for a woman with a 13% risk of multiple pregnancy following a single cycle of double embryo transfer, the estimated risk following a repeated single transfer was between 0% and 2%.</P>
<P>
<I>Double versus single embryo transfer</I>
</P>
<P>We found high quality evidence that the chances of live birth were lower after one cycle of fresh single embryo transfer than after one cycle of fresh double embryo transfer. For a woman with a 45% chance of live birth following a single cycle of double embryo transfer, the chance following a single cycle of single embryo transfer was between 24% and 33%. However, the risk of twins was about seven times higher after double embryo transfer.</P>
<P>Conclusion:</P>
<P>Repeated single embryo transfer appears the best option for most women undergoing ART. Most of the evidence currently available concerns younger women with a good prognosis.</P>

<P>To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of different policies for the number of embryos transferred in couples who undergo assisted reproductive technology (ART).</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-07-19 12:32:10 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE, from inception to July 2013. We handsearched reference lists of articles, trial registers and relevant conference proceedings and contacted researchers in the field.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-06-14 13:12:13 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different policies for the number of embryos transferred following IVF or intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) in subfertile women. Studies of fresh or frozen and thawed transfer of one, two, three or four embryos at cleavage or blastocyst stage were eligible.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-02-14 15:55:41 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias and extracted the data. The overall quality of the evidence was graded in a summary of findings table.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-03-19 10:24:24 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Fourteen RCTs were included in the review (2165 women). Thirteen compared cleavage-stage transfers (2017 women) and two compared blastocyst transfers (148 women): one study compared both. No studies compared repeated single versus repeated multiple embryo transfer (SET).</P>
<P>
<I>Repeated SET versus DET</I>
</P>
<P>Repeated SET was compared with DET in three studies of cleavage-stage transfer. In these studies the SET group received either two cycles of fresh SET (one study) or one cycle of fresh SET followed by one frozen SET in a natural or hormone-stimulated cycle (two studies). When these three studies were pooled, the cumulative live birth rate after repeated SET was not significantly different from the rate after one cycle of DET (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.09, three studies, n=811, I<SUP>2</SUP>=0%, low quality evidence). This suggests that for a woman with a 42% chance of live birth following a single cycle of DET, the chance following repeated SET would be between 31% and 44%. The multiple pregnancy rate was significantly lower in the SET group (OR 0.03, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.13, three RCTs, n = 811, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 23%, low quality evidence), suggesting that for a woman with a 13% risk of multiple pregnancy following a single cycle of DET, the risk following repeated SET would be between 0% and 2%.</P>
<P>
<I>Single-cycle SET versus single-cycle DET</I>
</P>
<P>A single cycle of SET was compared with a single cycle of DET in 10 studies, nine comparing cleavage-stage transfers and two comparing blastocyst-stage transfers. When studies were pooled the live birth rate was significantly lower in the SET group (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.60, nine studies, n = 1564, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%, high quality evidence). This suggests that for a woman with a 45% chance of live birth following a single cycle of DET, the chance following a single cycle of SET would be between 24% and 33%. The multiple pregnancy rate was also significantly lower in the SET group (OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.20, 10 studies, n = 1612, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 45%, high quality evidence), suggesting that for a woman with a 14% risk of multiple pregnancy following a single cycle of DET, the risk following a single cycle of SET would be between 1% and 3%. The heterogeneity for this analysis was attributable to a study with a high rate of cross-over between treatment arms.</P>
<P>
<I>Other comparisons</I>
</P>
<P>Other comparisons were evaluated in four studies which compared DET versus transfer of three or four embryos. Live birth rates did not differ significantly between the groups for any comparison, but there was a significantly lower multiple pregnancy rate in the DET group than in the three embryo transfer (TET) group (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.99, two studies, n = 343, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-06-15 11:43:32 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In a single fresh IVF cycle, single embryo transfer is associated with a lower live birth rate than double embryo transfer. However, there is no evidence of a significant difference in the cumulative live birth rate when a single cycle of double embryo transfer is compared with repeated SET (either two cycles of fresh SET or one cycle of fresh SET followed by one frozen SET in a natural or hormone-stimulated cycle). Single embryo transfer is associated with much lower rates of multiple pregnancy than other embryo transfer policies. A policy of repeated SET may minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy in couples undergoing ART without substantially reducing the likelihood of achieving a live birth. Most of the evidence currently available concerns younger women with a good prognosis.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2014-03-19 13:07:04 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-01-22 12:27:21 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-02-22 20:04:49 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Historically, in an effort to achieve 'acceptable' pregnancy rates, most women undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF) have received transfer of multiple embryos. However, this practice is being reassessed due to the high rates of multiple pregnancy that result from multiple embryo transfer and which commonly lead to poor clinical outcomes for the mother or her children, or both (<LINK REF="REF-ASRM-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">ASRM 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the 1990s it was calculated that women undergoing IVF had an approximately 20-fold increased risk of twins and 400-fold increased risk of higher order pregnancies (<LINK REF="REF-Martin-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin 1998</LINK>). In 2006, twins accounted for nearly 20% of all live births resulting from IVF in Europe (<LINK REF="REF-De-Mouzon-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Mouzon 2010</LINK>). Widespread concern about the medical, social and economic consequences of multiple pregnancy has prompted the development of strategies aimed at promoting birth of a single healthy baby following IVF.</P>
<P>Compared with singleton births, twins have a four-fold increased risk of mortality, and for triplets the risk is increased six-fold (<LINK REF="REF-ESHRE-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESHRE 2000</LINK>). A recent study (<LINK REF="REF-ESHRE-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESHRE 2012</LINK>) of 50,258 births following IVF and intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) pregnancies reported that twins accounted for half the total neonatal deaths and one-third of the perinatal deaths. Twins had a significantly higher perinatal mortality rate than singletons (27.8 per 1000 births and 12.4 per 1000 births, respectively). The relatively high congenital malformation rates observed in babies born after IVF and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) are attributed to the high proportion of multiple births in this population compared to the general population (<LINK REF="REF-Sebire-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sebire 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wennerholm-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wennerholm 2000</LINK>). In babies with very low birth weight, twin gestation is an independent risk factor for neurodevelopmental impairment including cerebral palsy, severe bilateral hearing loss and bilateral blindness (<LINK REF="REF-Wadhawan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wadhawan 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Twin pregnancy also increases the risk of obstetric complications, with a high incidence of miscarriage, pregnancy-induced hypertension, gestational diabetes, premature labour and abnormal delivery (<LINK REF="REF-FIVNAT-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">FIVNAT 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ESHRE-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESHRE 2000</LINK>). After the initial sense of achievement of parenthood, the care of children from a multiple gestation is often associated with practical difficulties and high stress levels (<LINK REF="REF-Garel-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garel 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Doyle-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyle 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Garel-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garel 1997</LINK>). More hours per week are required to care for six-month old triplets and to carry out the necessary household tasks. Even in families with material resources and plenty of help, emotional stress is not uncommon and may necessitate psychiatric help (<LINK REF="REF-Garel-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garel 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>The economic impact of multiple pregnancies on health services is another consideration. In an Australian study, the average cost of an ART twin delivery was almost three times as high as for an ART singleton, while for higher order multiple births the cost was up to 11 times greater (<LINK REF="REF-Chambers-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chambers 2007</LINK>). It has been suggested that redeployment of money saved by reduction of multiple pregnancies could allow for increased provision of IVF treatment in the UK at no extra cost (<LINK REF="REF-Ledger-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ledger 2006</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-02-14 16:28:58 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>IVF or ICSI is followed by the transfer of one, two, three or four fresh or frozen and thawed embryos. Unused embryos can be frozen and transferred in a subsequent natural or hormone stimulated transfer cycle. Reduction of the number of embryos transferred is a strategy used to reduce rates of multiple pregnancy associated with ART.</P>
<P>There is a worldwide trend for an increase in the rates of elective single embryo transfer, defined as the transfer of a single embryo at cleavage or blastocyst stage, which is chosen from a larger number of available embryos. In Europe, in 2005, about 20% of all embryo transfers were of single embryos but much higher rates are reported in some countries (69% in Sweden in 2005, and 57% in Australia and New Zealand in 2006) (<LINK REF="REF-ASRM-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">ASRM 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Embryos are often transferred after culture for two or three days, when they comprise two to eight cells (cleavage stage). The rationale for cleavage-stage transfer is that the uterus is the best environment for the survival of the embryo (<LINK REF="REF-Laverge-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laverge 2001</LINK>). Over the past decade there has been a steady shift in practice to the transfer of embryos on day five or six, when they have developed into blastocysts with 64 cells. Blastocyst transfer has been shown to be successful (<LINK REF="REF-Papanikolaou-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papanikolaou 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Khalaf-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khalaf 2008</LINK>) but requires laboratory expertise and experience in extended embryo culture. An advantage of blastocyst transfer is that embryos surviving five days are more likely to be viable than embryos at two or three days, and so the likelihood of implantation is higher. Disadvantages of blastocyst transfer include a higher risk of cycles being cancelled (<LINK REF="REF-Marek-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marek 1999</LINK>) and fewer embryos being available for cryopreservation due to failed embryo development.</P>
<P>A Cochrane review comparing cleavage-stage versus blastocyst transfer (<LINK REF="REF-Glujovsky-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glujovsky 2012</LINK>) had mixed findings. There was evidence that blastocyst transfer was associated with a small but significant benefit in the live birth rate per couple but that cleavage-stage transfers were associated with higher cumulative clinical pregnancy rates. This finding was attributed to higher rates of frozen embryos and lower failure-to-transfer rates obtained from cleavage-stage protocols. Multiple birth rates did not differ between the two groups.</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-02-14 16:35:00 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A strategy of reducing the risk of multiple pregnancy by limiting the number of embryos transferred needs to be balanced against the risk of jeopardising the overall pregnancy rate. An obvious solution is to consider an individualised embryo transfer policy based on identification of key clinical and laboratory parameters associated with a higher implantation rate. The above-mentioned ESHRE study (<LINK REF="REF-ESHRE-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESHRE 2012</LINK>) of 50,258 births following IVF and ICSI pregnancies reported that double embryo transfer was associated with a 53% higher risk of perinatal mortality than single embryo transfer (19 per 1000 births compared with 13 per 1000 births). This difference was especially apparent when fresh (unfrozen) embryos were used. Births following the transfer of two fresh embryos had a 74% higher risk of perinatal mortality than those following fresh single embryo transfer.</P>
<P>Use of elective single embryo transfer<B> </B>at the cleavage stage (day two or three) has been limited in clinical practice for fear that the overall success rates of IVF would decline. This assumption has been supported by the published results of single embryo transfer where only one embryo was available. Because no opportunity for selection of more suitable embryos exists, the implantation potential of the only available embryo is usually poor, with clinical pregnancy rates of around 10% (<LINK REF="REF-FIVNAT-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">FIVNAT 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Giorgetti-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giorgetti 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Preutthipan-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Preutthipan 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yaron-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yaron 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lieberman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lieberman 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Westergaard-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Westergaard 2000</LINK>). In a situation where the transferred embryos are the only available embryos, pregnancy rates are unfavourable even for multiple embryo transfer (<LINK REF="REF-Ludwig-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ludwig 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>A study from Finland reported a 20.2% pregnancy rate in 94 women who had only one embryo available for transfer compared with a rate of 29.7% in women who had multiple embryos available and from which a single high quality embryo was selected for transfer. The cumulative pregnancy rate after frozen and thawed embryo transfers in the elective single embryo transfer group was 47.3% per oocyte retrieval. By comparison, the pregnancy rate for double embryo transfers was 29.4% per transfer, of which 23.9% were twin pregnancies (<LINK REF="REF-Vilska-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vilska 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Another strategy for reducing multiple pregnancy is multifetal pregnancy reduction. However, this procedure is invasive, can have long term adverse psychological consequences for the potential parents (<LINK REF="REF-Berkowits-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berkowits 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McKinney-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKinney 1996</LINK>) and may be unacceptable to some couples given the attendant ethical and legal issues. Clinicians in Europe have generally accepted the desirability of reducing multiple births by limiting the number of embryos transferred, especially if this can be achieved without unduly reducing live birth rates (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2011</LINK>).</P>

<P>The authors considered whether the clinical and methodological characteristics of the included studies were sufficiently similar for meta-analysis to provide a meaningful summary. Clinical heterogeneity in subfertility (such as variations in entry criteria, subtle differences in the treatment used and that are important from a clinical aspect) cannot be avoided because most centres use their own protocols which can vary in some aspects. When trials met the inclusion criteria and had performed the same intervention we considered it appropriate to pool their results. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed by inspecting the scatter in the data points and the overlap in their CIs and, more formally by checking the results of the I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic. An I<SUP>2</SUP> measurement greater than 50% was taken to indicate substantial heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). If substantial heterogeneity was detected, possible explanations were explored in sensitivity analyses.

<P>Study inclusion criteria differed with regard to participant age. Most studies had a maximum age threshold. This varied across studies and included 34 years (<LINK REF="STD-Gerris-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gerris 1999</LINK>), 35 years (<LINK REF="STD-Vauthier_x002d_Brouzes-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Vauthier-Brouzes 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lukassen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lukassen 2005</LINK>), 36 years (<LINK REF="STD-Thurin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Thurin 2004</LINK>), 38 years (<LINK REF="STD-ECOSSE--2006" TYPE="STUDY">ECOSSE 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fernandez_x002d_Sanchez-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Fernandez-Sanchez 2012</LINK>), and 40 years (<LINK REF="STD-ASSETT-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ASSETT 2003</LINK>).

<LI>one fresh cycle of DET compared with one fresh cycle of triple embryo transfer (TET) (<LINK REF="STD-Heijnen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Heijnen 2006</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>fresh or frozen DET compared with fresh or frozen TET, multiple cycles (<LINK REF="STD-Komori-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Komori 2004</LINK>)</LI>

<LI>one fresh cycle of DET compared with one fresh cycle of four embryo transfer (FET) (<LINK REF="STD-Vauthier_x002d_Brouzes-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Vauthier-Brouzes 1994</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Komori-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Komori 2004</LINK>) reported only per-cycle data. There a large disparity between the number of women (169) and the number of cycles (212), and it was unclear how many women were included in each group. The data from this study were therefore unusable.</P>
<P>Four studies that randomised women to more than one embryo transfer cycle reported interim data after the first fresh cycle of SET versus DET (<LINK REF="STD-Thurin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Thurin 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thurin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Thurin 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lukassen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lukassen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ECOSSE--2006" TYPE="STUDY">ECOSSE 2006</LINK>). In the case of <LINK REF="STD-ECOSSE--2006" TYPE="STUDY">ECOSSE 2006</LINK>, these were the only data available, as the trial was stopped due to poor recruitment and data were only available for the first cycle (i.e. fresh DET versus fresh SET).</P>
<P>Protocols for ovarian stimulation, oocyte recovery and embryo transfer were clearly described in nine studies (<LINK REF="STD-Vauthier_x002d_Brouzes-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Vauthier-Brouzes 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gerris-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gerris 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martikainen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Martikainen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thurin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Thurin 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lukassen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lukassen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thurin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Thurin 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heijnen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Heijnen 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Montfoort-2006" TYPE="STUDY">van Montfoort 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fernandez_x002d_Sanchez-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Fernandez-Sanchez 2012</LINK>). Good quality embryos were transferred in all studies, usually at cleavage stage. However, in four studies all or some women had embryos transferred at blastocyst rather than cleavage stage; this applied to a small number of women in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Thurin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Thurin 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thurin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Thurin 2005</LINK>), half the women in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Fernandez_x002d_Sanchez-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Fernandez-Sanchez 2012</LINK>) and all women in another study (<LINK REF="STD-Gardner-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gardner 2004</LINK>).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-01-22 11:40:39 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our findings indicate, as one would expect, that live birth and pregnancy rates following single embryo transfer (SET) are lower than those following double embryo transfer (DET) in a single fresh IVF cycle but that the risk of multiple pregnancy is much higher in the DET group. However, pooling of three studies of cleavage-stage transfer found no evidence of a significant difference in the cumulative live birth rate when a single cycle of DET was compared with repeated SET (either SET followed by transfer of a single frozen embryo in a natural or hormone-stimulated cycle (<LINK REF="STD-Thurin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Thurin 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thurin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Thurin 2005</LINK>), or two fresh cycles of SET (<LINK REF="STD-Lukassen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lukassen 2005</LINK>)). Confidence intervals for this finding were wide, and suggested that for a woman with a 42% chance of live birth following a single cycle of DET, the chance following repeated SET would be between 31% and 44%.</P>
<P>Thus, although DET achieves higher live birth rates per fresh cycle, the evidence suggests that the difference in effectiveness may be substantially offset when elective SET is followed by a further single fresh or frozen cycle, at least among women with a good prognosis.</P>
<P>Eleven studies compared one fresh cycle of SET versus one fresh cycle of DET. The live birth rate was 60% higher in the DET group but the risk of multiple pregnancy was eight times as high. One of this group of studies included a high proportion of women who chose not to comply with their randomised treatment, and inclusion of this study was associated with substantial heterogeneity for the outcome of multiple pregnancy. Otherwise there was little evidence of statistical heterogeneity in the review, suggesting that clinical differences between studies had little effect on overall findings.</P>
<P>Three studies of cleavage-stage transfer tested fresh cycle comparisons of DET versus transfer of three or four embryos. Live birth rates did not differ significantly, but there was a significantly lower multiple pregnancy rate in the DET group than in the three embryo transfer (TET) group.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-01-16 14:58:28 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>No studies compared repeated single versus repeated multiple embryo transfer within the same IVF cycle. This comparison was planned in one study (<LINK REF="STD-ECOSSE--2006" TYPE="STUDY">ECOSSE 2006</LINK>) but the study was closed due to poor enrolment, with only 23 participants. This comparison would be a useful way to structure future trials in order to determine the safety and effectiveness of different embryo transfer policies<I>, </I>given that a number of embryos have been produced. Policy in this context means the strategy for using up the available embryos until success is achieved or the supply of embryos is exhausted. A comparison of repeated multiple versus repeated single embryo transfer would address the policy question by determining &#8216;cumulative&#8217; success rates.</P>
<P>The vast majority of participants in the included studies had a good prognosis (aged under 36 years and with sufficient good quality embryos). Only two small studies (<LINK REF="STD-Thurin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Thurin 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heijnen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Heijnen 2006</LINK>) focused on older women. As one of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Gardner-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gardner 2004</LINK>) noted, there was a strong potential for self-selection bias, as only a small proportion of eligible women volunteered for the trial, probably due to the belief that single ET could result in lower pregnancy rates and that twin pregnancy is a desirable outcome: they commented that most volunteers were younger women. Future studies should include older women and those with previously failed IVF cycles or lack of good quality embryos</P>
<P>Per cycle, DET appears to be more expensive than SET (<LINK REF="REF-Tiitinen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tiitinen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gerris-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerris 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thurin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thurin 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chambers-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chambers 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fiddelers-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fiddelers 2007</LINK>). The higher cost is mainly due to the increased rate of multiple births and premature births in the DET group, and fewer pregnancies in the SET group. Long term costs related to multiple births and prematurity in the DET group have not yet been adequately assessed. However the additional costs of cryopreservation with SET + 1 FZET have not been evaluated. In order to implement a policy of multiple single embryo transfers per woman, providers require either an efficient cryopreservation service or the ability to provide multiple fresh IVF cycles. The former is likely to be a safer and less invasive option for the women concerned.</P>

<P>Many of the included studies were small, with half enrolling fewer than 60 participants.

<P>A project commissioned by the UK National Institutes of Health Research Health Technology Assessment Programme (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2011</LINK>) used statistical modelling, analysis of registry and cohort data, and exploration of consumer perspectives to explore options for increasing SET and reducing the incidence of multiple births. The analysis concluded that couples have approximately one-third less chance of a live birth if they have one fresh cycle of SET rather than DET, but that use of repeat cycles using cryopreservation might compensate for the lost potential in each individual transfer while reducing the likelihood of multiple births. However, the authors recognised that a policy of repeat SET (with use of cryopreserved eggs) would involve challenges including appropriate patient selection, optimisation of freezing techniques, and the emotional, financial and physical burden associated with additional treatment cycles.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-06-15 11:45:18 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review indicates that in a single fresh IVF cycle, single embryo transfer is associated with a lower live birth rate than double embryo transfer. However, there is no evidence of a significant difference in the cumulative live birth rate when a single cycle of double embryo transfer is compared with repeated SET (either two cycles of fresh SET or one cycle of fresh SET followed by one cycle of frozen SET in a natural or hormone-stimulated cycle). Single embryo transfer is associated with much lower rates of multiple pregnancy than other embryo transfer policies. A policy of repeated SET may minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy in couples undergoing ART, without substantially reducing the likelihood of achieving a live birth. Most of the evidence currently available concerns younger women with a good prognosis.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-06-15 12:19:07 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>More evidence is needed on policies for repeated embryo transfer, including the most safe and effective way to use available embryos within a single IVF cycle until success is achieved or the supply of embryos is exhausted. More research is needed to determine what characteristics of women and embryos are associated with multiple pregnancy and which, if present, should identify a need for single embryo transfer. As studies to date have been conducted largely among women with a good prognosis undergoing ART, future studies should include older women (above 36 years) and those with previously failed IVF cycles or lack of good quality embryos. Longer term cost-effectiveness analyses are also needed, which should take into account costs related to multiple births and also costs of cryopreservation in the various strategies. Finally, it is important to explore patient perspectives on multiple pregnancy and to increase consumer awareness that single embryo transfer is the best option for most women having IVF.</P>
