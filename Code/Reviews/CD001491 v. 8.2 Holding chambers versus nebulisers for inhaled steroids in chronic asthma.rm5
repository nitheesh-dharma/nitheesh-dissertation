<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>In an asthma attack, the airways (passages to the lungs) narrow from muscle spasms, and from swelling (inflammation). Inhaling corticosteroid drugs can relieve this swelling, and so ease asthma. These drugs have usually been inhaled through inhalers with a holding chamber (spacer) that delivers a metered-dose, but can now also be inhaled through a wet nebuliser. The nebuliser is considerably more expensive. The review of trials found no convincing evidence that nebulisers for corticosteroids offer any improvement over inhaled steroids delivered through a holding chamber. </P>

<P>Two studies were selected for inclusion (63 subjects), both concerned adults. An additional small study including 14 children was identified for the 2005 update. Methodological quality was variable. Due to design differences it was not appropriate to pool the studies. The single high quality study compared budesonide 2000-8000 mcg delivered via Pari Inhalier Boy jet nebuliser with inspiration-only inhalation to budesonide 1600 mcg via large volume spacer. The nebuliser delivery led to higher morning peak expiratory flow values (25 L/min p&lt;0.01), higher evening values (30L/min, p&lt;0.01), lower rescue beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist use and symptom scores compared to the holding chamber delivery.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Budesonide in high dose delivered by the particular nebuliser used in the only double-blinded study that could be included in this review was more effective than budesonide 1600 mcg via a large volume spacer. However, it is not clear whether this was an effect of nominal dose delivered or delivery system. Cost, compliance and patient preference are important determinants of clinical effectiveness that still require further assessment. Future studies are needed to evaluate the relative effectiveness of inhaled corticosteroids delivered by different combinations of nebuliser/compressor compared to holding chamber. Moreover, further studies assessing these delivery methods are needed in infants and pre-school children, as these are groups that are likely to be considered for treatment with nebulised corticosteroids.</P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-07-31 10:14:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Asthma is a common disease affecting infants, children and adults and appears to be increasing in incidence worldwide. Avoidance of inhaled allergens or irritants precipitating symptoms and exacerbations may help some patients. However such factors cannot always be identified and avoidance may be impractical or impossible. Consequently treatment of airway inflammation with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) serves as the cornerstone of prophylactic therapy for most asthmatics. ICS's are recommended for all but minimally symptomatic patients by existing guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-GINA-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-NHLBI-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHLBI 1997</LINK>). </P>
<P>Delivery systems available include pressurised aerosol metered dose inhalers (MDI) with or without holding chamber and a range of dry powder delivery devices (DPI). In the majority of children and adults at least one delivery device can be identified which the patient finds comfortable to use and can be used proficiently. </P>
<P>In recent years corticosteroids preparations have become available in the form of inhalation suspensions for nebulisation, including budesonide (BUD) and fluticasone (FP). Beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) as nebulised suspension is no longer licensed in the UK but is still available in other areas of the world. </P>
<P>The place of nebulised ICS therapy is currently unclear. Nebulisation is a delivery method that has less dependence on patient co-ordination or co-operation compared to other methods. In theory a group of asthmatics who could preferentially benefit using this delivery method are the very young: pre-school children and infants for whom the use of other delivery methods can in practice be difficult (<LINK REF="REF-Szefler-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Szefler 1999</LINK>). However, other methods could also be useful in these patients including the combination of large volume chamber with attached facemask administered with the help of a parent. </P>
<P>There is some evidence that ICS's delivered in nebulised suspension produce a beneficial oral steroid sparing effect in adults with severe asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Otulana-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Otulana 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Higenbottam-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Higenbottam 1994</LINK>). However these were uncontrolled studies, and did not include comparison with other delivery systems. </P>
<P>This review aims to critically appraise the current evidence concerning the relative efficacy, safety, tolerability and cost effectiveness of ICS delivered via a nebuliser delivery system versus holding chamber in the treatment of chronic asthma.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To quantitatively assess efficacy and safety outcomes in studies which have compared the use of nebuliser to MDI with holding chamber for the delivery of ICS in the treatment of chronic asthma.</P>

<P>Treatment effects from individual trials have been displayed using the Cochrane statistical package Review Manager. We planned a priori to pool treatment effects from similar studies by calculating a weighted mean difference (WMD) for continuous outcomes and odds ratios (OR) for dichotomous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). However only two studies met the inclusion criteria for this review, and could not be combined. However, treatment effects from individual studies have been expressed using the same statistics. For the same reason tests for heterogeneity in effect size between studies was not appropriate. Planned sensitivity analyses based on methodological quality and subgroup analyses based upon age and asthma severity were not appropriate and not undertaken.</P>

<P>Two studies were selected for inclusion in the review. Both studies were undertaken in adult patients. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Bisgaard-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bisgaard 1998</LINK> was conducted in Denmark in a hospital outpatient clinic setting whilst <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Reilly-1998" TYPE="STUDY">O'Reilly 1998</LINK> recruited patients from both primary and secondary care in the UK.

<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Bisgaard-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bisgaard 1998</LINK> study patients who were receiving regular oral corticosteroid (OCS) treatment were specifically excluded. However an inclusion criterion for this study was that patients had been receiving regular ICS therapy, 400-1000 mcg/d. Despite this asthma was sub-optimally controlled as indicated by mean FEV1 of 63 (%predicted), and 'persistence of symptoms' although the frequency of symptoms (days or nights/week) was unclear. In the study conducted by <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Reilly-1998" TYPE="STUDY">O'Reilly 1998</LINK> 38% of patients were receiving regular oral steroid therapy at the time of enrolment. An inclusion criterion was that patients had to be receiving BUD 2000-4000 mcg/d via nebuliser. The level of baseline asthma control was unclear however: mean FEV1 (% predicted) and/or an indication of the frequency of asthma symptoms experienced was not given.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>In both studies patients were randomised to receive an inhaled steroid via either a large volume polycarbonate chamber (Nebuhaler or Volumatic) or nebuliser. However significant differences existed in the treatment regimens in other respects. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Bisgaard-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bisgaard 1998</LINK>) patients received either BUD 1600 mcg/d via chamber or BUD 2000 or 8000 mcg/d via a jet nebuliser (Pari Inhalier Boy) driven by an air compressor with a dynamic flow of 8 L/min. Patients were instructed to activate the nebuliser during inspiration only using a finger-operated interrupt valve. However, in the second study (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Reilly-1998" TYPE="STUDY">O'Reilly 1998</LINK>), patients received either a standard nominal dose of FP 2000 mcg/d via chamber or BUD via nebuliser. The patients used the nebuliser equipment that they had prior to study entry, and the same pre-study nominal dose of BUD: either 2000 or 4000 mcg/d. No information regarding the nebuliser/compressor combinations used by patients was presented.</P>

<P>The two included studies had significant design differences and reported different outcome measures. It was not therefore appropriate to aggregate results. However where available, study results have been entered into the results table to provide the reader with a visual impression of effect size for each outcome. It should be noted that discrepancy exists between the results of significance testing as assessed by analyses in the individual studies and that obtained when the estimated numerical results have been analysed using MetaView. Specifically investigators have reported significant differences between treatments for certain outcomes that are not apparent when the same data are analysed using MetaView. This discrepancy is accounted for by the fact that more powerful ANOVA/ANCOVA models were used in the analyses presented in the primary papers to control for between patients differences. Meta-analysis is a weaker method for assessing the results for individual studies, being analogous to unpaired t-tests in the context of individual studies. The reader is advised to ignore the confidence intervals around the effect size for outcomes plotted in MetaView and instead refer to the description below as to whether statistically significant differences in treatment exist.</P>

Similarly, a significant but small advantage of BUD 8000 mcg/d-nebuliser was apparent over BUD-chamber in terms of evening PEFR (30L/min, p&lt;0.01). No difference between the BUD 2000 mcg/d-nebuliser group and BUD chamber group was demonstrated for morning PEFR but a small treatment advantage of nebuliser over chamber was apparent when considering evening PEFR (25 L/min, p&lt;0.01).</P>
<P>BUD 8000 mcg/d-nebuliser resulted in significantly lower daily rescue beta2 agonist use compared to BUD-chamber (2 puffs/day p&lt;0.05); however no difference in beta2 agonist use was apparent between BUD 2000 mcg/d-nebuliser and BUD-chamber groups.</P>
<P>BUD-nebuliser (both 2000 and 8000 mcg/d) resulted in significantly lower breathlessness and wheeze scores compared to BUD-chamber. BUD 8000 mcg/d-nebuliser also resulted in a significantly lower nighttime symptom score compared to BUD-chamber.

<HEADING LEVEL="5">SAFETY RELATED OUTCOMES</HEADING>
<P>In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Bisgaard-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bisgaard 1998</LINK>) BUD 8000 mcg/d-nebuliser resulted in a significantly lower morning plasma cortisol compared to BUD chamber (difference=115 nmol/L, p&lt;0.05). However mean plasma cortisol levels in both treatment groups were well above the lower limit of the normal range (approximately. 140 nmol/L). No differences in morning plasma cortisol levels were apparent comparing BUD 2000 mcg/d-nebuliser and BUD-chamber.</P>
<P>Withdrawals due to asthma exacerbation were reported in both studies. However because a crossover design was used in both cases it is very difficult judge how these may have been related to treatment. This is because patient withdrawals in the first period of a crossover study are not available to enter the second period, making estimations of patient numbers (dropouts and totals for each intervention) very difficult.<BR/>The incidence of oral Candidiasis was reported in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Bisgaard-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bisgaard 1998</LINK>), however again the way in which treatment influences the likelihood of this outcome is very difficult to assess because it is not clear in which periods patients were affected, and whether or not it had resolved prior to crossing over to the second treatment period.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Iqbal-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Iqbal 2004</LINK> assessed 12 children for delivered dose of Budesonide, compliance, adherence and parent preference. The median delivered dose was 36mcg (range 31-45 mcg) for the HaloLite Paediatric Nebuliser (HPN) and 53mcg (range 17-85mcg) for the MDI and aerochamber. The true adherence (measured as the product of the % of prescribed treatments started and the % of started treatments given correctly) was 23% for the HPN (range 0 to 96%) and 36% for the aerochamber (range 0 to 74%). The shape size and weight of the spacer were preferred by parents, as was the ease of cleaning. Of the parents who were willing to change device, nearly twice as many would switch to the Aerochamber as the the HPN.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Reilly-1998" TYPE="STUDY">O'Reilly 1998</LINK> found clear preference for FP-chamber was expressed by both patients and physicians when specifically considering ease of administration, although there were no significant differences in the number of patients who expressed an overall preference for each device. A cost analysis based on UK 1995 pound sterling prices was undertaken. Considering study drug costs alone investigators calculated that nebulised BUD cost 1.7 or 3.5 fold more than FP via chamber at the nominal doses used in the study.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-07-28 10:19:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>The effect of orally inhaled drugs is determined by a) the nominal dose of drug administered; b) the potency of the drug, c) the lung deposition profile for the drug using a given delivery system for a given nominal dose administered. Particular difficulty is encountered when assessing the impact of treatments delivered by nebuliser. A wide range of chambers and compressors combinations are available, which have different performance characteristics in terms of the distribution of aerosol particle sizes produced (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Callaghan-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Callaghan 1997</LINK>). Particle size distribution determines the lung distribution characteristics of the aerosolised drug. In other words the relative effect of a given nominal dose of ICS may vary substantially depending on the precise combination of chamber, compressor, chamber fill volume, flow rate, nebulisation time and inhalation method (continuous or inspiration only) used. This creates difficulties when assessing the results of trials comparing chamber to nebuliser if different nebuliser systems have been used. A further problem arises if the two drugs used have different potencies as is the case with <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Reilly-1998" TYPE="STUDY">O'Reilly 1998</LINK>. Fluticasone is generally regarded to have twice the potency of budesonide, although a precise clinical potency ratio is yet to be fully established. For all of these reasons we have considered the two included studies separately.</P>
<P>The findings from this review require cautious interpretation. Only three studies were identified which met inclusion criteria, and all were relatively small. Although they fulfilled the inclusion criteria for review, different treatment regimens were used, and studies differed significantly in terms of their methodological quality. Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Bisgaard-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bisgaard 1998</LINK>) was of high quality, with a Jadad score of 4. The findings from this study are therefore less likely to be subject to bias. Adult patients with sub-optimally controlled asthma were enrolled. It is important to appreciate that a standardised nebuliser delivery system was adopted in this study: the Pari Inhalier Boy jet nebuliser, fitted with a mouthpiece, driven by a Medic-Aid CR60 air compressor at 8 L/min flow rate with patients specifically instructed to only activate the nebuliser during inspiration. It is not clear whether the small advantages demonstrated in morning and evening PEFR for treatment with BUD-nebuliser are clinically significant. Both nominal doses of nebulised BUD (2000 or 8000 mcg/d) led to improvement in at least one aspect of symptom control. However the value of these changes is difficult to translate to clinical practice because the symptom scales used have not been subject to formal validation procedures to define the threshold for clinically meaningful change in response to treatment. HRQOL and cost were not assessed. Neither were the very important endpoints of exacerbation frequency and hospital admission.</P>
<P>The second study (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Reilly-1998" TYPE="STUDY">O'Reilly 1998</LINK>) was of poorer methodological quality (Jadad score 2), primarily determined by the fact that an open, non-blinded design was used. Although not specifically hypothesised by the investigators, the introduction to the study report gives the impression that the FP-chamber combination was anticipated to perform at least as well as the BUD-nebuliser combination and hence with an open design the results were more likely to be biased in favour of the FP-chamber combination. For this reason the stated preferences for the FP-chamber combination must be treated with some caution. Adult patients only were studied. A pragmatic design approach was used in that patients were randomised to receive either FP-chamber or their own nebuliser equipment. However the range of nebuliser /compressor combinations is not stated, and for the reasons outlined above it cannot be determined if patients were receiving comparable treatment whilst using the nebuliser delivery system. The small advantage of FP-chamber over BUD-nebuliser is terms of morning PEFR and reduction in diurnal variability in PEFR in of unknown clinical importance.</P>
<P>Not enough data exists to draw conclusions about the relative safety of the treatments compared. Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Bisgaard-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bisgaard 1998</LINK>) assessed aspects of HPA axis function. Although a significantly lower morning plasma cortisol was demonstrated with the BUD 8000-nebuliser combination compared to BUD 1600-chamber, any associated risk of clinically apparent adrenal suppression in the future is unknown.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">METHODOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS</HEADING>
<P>There is a possibility that further studies relevant to the review were missed. However because a comprehensive search strategy was used, including contact with a number of the pharmaceutical companies who develop and market the ICS's, this seems unlikely.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-07-28 10:19:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>In the one well controlled study that we could find, budesonide 2000-8000 mcg/day delivered by a Pari Inhalier Boy jet nebuliser using inspiration only activation produced a small but significant improvement in PEFR compared to BUD 1600 mcg/d via large volume holding chamber.</P>
<P>The delivery of nebulised drugs may be influenced by factors such as choice of nebuliser, flow rate, chamber fill volume, nebulisation time and inhalation method. Since the individual patient response to inhaled steroids by either delivery method is not predictable in advance the dose should be titrated for each patient to the minimum which achieves good symptom control.</P>
<P>One study comparing nebuliser system to chamber has now been identified in infants or children and suggests that some of the parents of the 12 children involved preferred the chamber, but the HPN nebuliser showed less variability in the dose delivered. The clinical importance of this is unknown as the study did not include asthma related outcomes.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>1. Further studies assessing the relative efficacy and safety of ICS delivered via nebuliser or chamber are needed in infants and children. These are the groups of patients in which increased difficulty with use of conventional delivery devices is most likely to be a present. <BR/>2. Further studies in adult patients are needed to confirm the finding of the single high quality study. <BR/>3. Because the drug output characteristics of individual nebuliser/compressor combinations are likely to vary widely, future studies need to clearly define the system(s) used in order that meaningful comparisons can be made.<BR/>4. Longer term, parallel design studies would be better suited to assessing safety outcomes including the likelihood of asthma exacerbation, hospital admission rates, and effects on HPA axis function when comparing nebuliser systems and chamber delivery devices.<BR/>5. The use of asthma specific HRQOL instruments with defined thresholds for clinically meaningful change would add considerably to the assessment of different delivery devices in future studies.<BR/>6. As nebuliser and compressor equipment is generally very expensive relative to other delivery devices future studies should include cost effectiveness as an outcome measure.</P>
