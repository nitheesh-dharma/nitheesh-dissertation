<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-11-07 19:01:23 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Lupus nephritis is an inflammatory condition affecting the kidneys which is caused by systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an autoimmune disease that is more common among women. About half of all people with SLE develop lupus nephritis, and of these about 1/10 experience chronic kidney disease or kidney failure. Treatment aims to delay disease progression and achieve remission by stabilising and improving kidney function and minimising side effects. For about the past 30 years, standard treatment for lupus nephritis has focused on a combination of cyclophosphamide (an alkylating agent) and corticosteroids.</P>
<P>We found that the drug mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) was as effective as cyclophosphamide in combination with corticosteroids in achieving remission in people with lupus nephritis. MMF has fewer harmful effects including ovarian failure, decreased ability to fight infections (leucopenia) and hair loss (alopecia). MMF was superior to azathioprine (an immunosuppressive drug) in combination with corticosteroids at preventing renal relapse when used as maintenance therapy.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-11-07 16:21:47 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cyclophosphamide, in combination with corticosteroids has been used to induce remission in proliferative lupus nephritis, the most common kidney manifestation of the multisystem disease, systemic lupus erythematosus. Cyclophosphamide therapy has reduced mortality from over 70% in the 1950s and 1960s to less than 10% in recent years. Cyclophosphamide combined with corticosteroids preserves kidney function but is only partially effective and may cause ovarian failure, infection and bladder toxicity. Several new agents, including mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), suggest reduced toxicity with equivalent rates of remission. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2004.</P>

<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing any treatments for biopsy-proven lupus nephritis in both adult and paediatric patients with class III, IV, V +III and V +IV lupus nephritis were included. All immunosuppressive treatments were considered.</P>

<P>Data were abstracted and quality assessed independently by two authors, with differences resolved by discussion. Dichotomous outcomes were reported as risk ratio (RR) and measurements on continuous scales reported as mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-11-07 22:16:25 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified 50 RCTs involving 2846 participants. Of these, 45 studies (2559 participants) investigated induction therapy, and six studies (514 participants), considered maintenance therapy.</P>
<P>Compared with intravenous (IV) cyclophosphamide, MMF was as effective in achieving stable kidney function (5 studies, 523 participants: RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.18) and complete remission of proteinuria (6 studies, 686 participants: RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.58). No differences in mortality (7 studies, 710 participants: RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.98) or major infection (6 studies, 683 participants: RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.68) were observed. A significant reduction in ovarian failure (2 studies, 498 participants: RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.80) and alopecia (2 studies, 522 participants: RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.86) was observed with MMF. In maintenance therapy, the risk of renal relapse (3 studies, 371 participants: RR 1.83, 95% CI 1.24 to 2.71) was significantly higher with azathioprine compared with MMF. Multiple other interventions were compared but outcome data were relatively sparse. Overall study quality was variable. The internal validity of the design, conduct and analysis of the included RCTs was difficult to assess in some studies because of the omission of important methodological details. No study adequately reported all domains of the risk of bias assessment so that elements of internal bias may be present.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-11-07 16:23:54 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>MMF is as effective as cyclophosphamide in inducing remission in lupus nephritis, but is safer with a lower risk of ovarian failure. MMF is more effective than azathioprine in maintenance therapy for preventing relapse with no increase in clinically important side effects. Adequately powered trials with long term follow-up are required to more accurately define the risks and eventual harms of specific treatment regimens.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2012-11-14 11:34:10 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-11-07 18:58:40 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Lupus nephritis occurs in about half of all people with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), leading to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in 5% to 10% of patients at 10 years (<LINK REF="REF-Houssiau-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Houssiau 2010</LINK>). Predominantly affecting young women, lupus nephritis is also more common in certain racial groups, particularly African-Americans who may also have a more aggressive and less treatment-responsive form of the disease. </P>
<P>Kidney involvement ranges from mild subclinical disease, which is associated with a low chance of progression and favourable outcome, to full blown nephritic and/or nephrotic syndrome with kidney impairment and greater risk of progression to ESKD. In Australia, approximately 1% of patients commencing dialysis had ESKD as a consequence of lupus nephritis (<LINK REF="REF-ANZDATA-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">ANZDATA 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Renal biopsy is required for the precise diagnosis and classification of lupus nephritis. Histological classification was introduced by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1982 and revised in 2003 by the International Society of Nephrology (ISN) and the Renal Pathology Society (RPS). ISN/RPS 2003 class I and II lesions have a good prognosis and are generally not an indication for specific therapy. Proliferative disease (WHO class III, IV, V + III and V + IV) is more fulminant and requires aggressive treatment to induce remission and prevent significant kidney injury and premature death. WHO class IV lupus nephritis is the most aggressive form of the condition, and has the worst prognosis without intensive immunosuppressive treatment. Without intensive immunosuppressive treatment, five-year survival has been reported at 17% (<LINK REF="REF-Cameron-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cameron 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Cyclophosphamide-containing regimens were established as first-line therapy for inducing remission based on studies undertaken at the National Institutes of Health in the 1970s and 1980s. Therapy increased survival to 82% by the early 1990s, and is now greater than 90% (<LINK REF="REF-Houssiau-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Houssiau 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mok-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mok 2002</LINK>). Response to treatment is often slow, and although remission is induced in a significant proportion of patients, the risk or relapse or flare remains considerable; variably has been reported at between 18% and 46% (<LINK REF="REF-Ponticelli-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ponticelli 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>We conducted a systematic review of immunosuppressive treatment of proliferative lupus nephritis in 2004. Our 2004 review identified 25 RCTs that enrolled a total of 915 participants were included for analysis. Our conclusion was that cyclophosphamide combined with steroids was the preferred option to preserve kidney function in people with proliferative lupus nephritis (<LINK REF="REF-Flanc-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flanc 2004b</LINK>). In the past five years, numerous trials evaluating newer agents (MMF, tacrolimus and rituximab) have been published, all of which have been proposed as alternative, potentially less toxic, and more effective therapies.The aim of our updated review was to evaluate the relative effects of all available immunosuppressive therapies for the induction and maintenance treatment of lupus nephritis.</P>

<P>The maintenance phase of one study (<LINK REF="STD-Chan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2000</LINK>) underwent a significant post-randomisation protocol adjustment originally randomised to induction with MMF. The MMF induction arm originally switched to maintenance azathioprine at one year, but the protocol changed mid-trial to continue MMF for two years. This was prompted by an unexpectedly high rate of renal relapse in the azathioprine maintenance group. Data for those participants on the original protocol were not reported separately from the adjusted protocol, so accordingly, only the induction phase data of this study could be included in our synthesis.</P>

<P>Oral cyclophosphamide had similar effects to MMF on mortality (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>.1), incidence of ESKD (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>.1) and doubling of serum creatinine (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>.5).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-11-08 16:26:45 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The management of lupus nephritis has become complex and difficult to navigate and interpret because of the recent proliferation new interventions and studies, which have been compared in numerous combination regimens.</P>
<P>In the 1970s it was demonstrated that compared with corticosteroids alone, the combined use of cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids induced remission, reduced ESKD and mortality, resulting in use of this regimen as first-line therapy for over 30 years.</P>
<P>Our earlier systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Flanc-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flanc 2004a</LINK>) of immunosuppressive treatment of proliferative lupus nephritis found that adding cyclophosphamide or azathioprine to steroids improved or preserved kidney function when compared to steroids alone, and that plasma exchange conferred no additional benefit. Data regarding newer agents such as MMF and tacrolimus were insufficient to permit any meaningful conclusions at time of publication.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-11-08 16:26:45 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As shown by nine studies involving over 800 participants with proliferative lupus nephritis in our recent analysis for this updated review, MMF dosed at 2 g to 3 g daily is as effective as cyclophosphamide in preventing death, inducing complete remission in proteinuria, and achieving stable kidney function at six months, with reduced risk of ovarian failure, alopecia and leucopenia but with increased risk of diarrhoea. With comparable benefit and overall reduced adverse events, these data suggest that MMF may be the preferred first-line agent in proliferative lupus nephritis.</P>
<P>For maintenance therapy, MMF was more effective than azathioprine at preventing renal relapse with less leucopenia. Mortality, doubling of serum creatinine and other adverse effects including major infection were no different between the therapies.</P>
<P>Many other interventions, including rituximab (an agent increasingly used in clinical practice), tacrolimus and cyclosporin, have only been trialed in small studies with inconsistent outcome reporting, thereby precluding their inclusion in data synthesis. The clinical role for these therapies therefore remains unclear and warrants caution. Only one study compared standard versus reduced steroid dosing (<LINK REF="STD-MyLupus-Study-2010" TYPE="STUDY">MyLupus Study 2010</LINK>). No other studies addressed dosing and duration of steroid therapy. In contrast to recent evidence supporting the beneficial effects of plasma exchange in the treatment of vasculitis, our original review found plasma exchange conferred no benefit.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Strengths and limitations</HEADING>
<P>In contrast to previous meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Mak-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mak 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2006</LINK>), we re-organised interventions according to treatments for induction of disease remission or maintenance therapy, which better reflects clinical practice. Broad inclusion criteria also helped explore the totality of evidence available, rather than limiting meta-analysis by specific immunosuppression regimens as have previously published systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Kamanamool-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kamanamool 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lee-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mak-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mak 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Radhakrishnan-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Radhakrishnan 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Touma-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Touma 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walsh-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhu-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhu 2007</LINK>). Unpublished data from conference abstracts were included in the meta-analysis to minimise publication bias. In the update, 52 new reports came from hand-searching conference proceedings in addition to those already searched by the Cochrane Renal Group. To our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive evidence summary on this topic.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, there are some potential limitations in our study. Considerable clinical heterogeneity in interventions, definitions of remission, and outcome reporting among studies hampered interpretation and presentation of important outcomes in this review. For example, comparing MMF with cyclophosphamide, there was variability among studies in therapeutic dosing, route of administration and co-interventions. While some studies had moderate periods of follow-up over one to two years, others were much shorter and inadequately powered to detect events in the clinically important outcomes. The average time to remission with cyclophosphamide is about 10 months (<LINK REF="REF-Ioannidis-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ioannidis 2000</LINK>); however, the follow-up in 10 induction therapy studies was six months. Furthermore, the risk of adverse events such as ovarian failure increases after six months, so the power of existing studies, even when combined, to detect significant differences among interventions is limited. Lack of long-term follow-up data in some studies is particularly relevant to the outcome of ESKD, where a difference between groups may not become apparent for several years. Incomplete reporting of outcomes also increases uncertainty. For example, although 10 studies with 953 participants compared MMF with cyclophosphamide, only four reported on ovarian failure and two on doubling of serum creatinine.</P>

<P>The disease spectrum and the proportion of patients within each class of lupus nephritis differed among studies. Furthermore, patient demographics differed among studies where environmental, socioeconomic, as well as clinical and genetic factors have been thought to play an important role explaining ethnic differences in the outcome of lupus nephritis. Comparing MMF with cyclophosphamide, three studies included primarily Asian patients (<LINK REF="STD-Bao--2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bao 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ong-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ong 2005</LINK>) and two of the largest studies comparing MMF with cyclophosphamide included higher proportions of African-American and Hispanic patients (<LINK REF="STD-Appel-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Appel 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ginzler--2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ginzler 2005</LINK>). Non-Caucasian populations have higher risk of relapse, death and CKD compared with Caucasian populations (<LINK REF="REF-Contreras-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Contreras 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Korbet-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Korbet 2007</LINK>) and often fail to respond to cyclophosphamide (<LINK REF="REF-Adler-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adler 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Contreras-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Contreras 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dooley-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dooley 1997</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Ginzler--2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ginzler 2005</LINK> included the largest percentage of black patients, where 56% of patients were of African-American origin. This was the only study that showed a clear benefit in favour of MMF over IV cyclophosphamide for induction of remission and reduction in daily proteinuria (<LINK REF="STD-Ginzler--2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ginzler 2005</LINK>). The Aspreva Lupus Management Study (ALMS) data which included 12% African-American and 35% Hispanic patients, suggested interactions between group interventions and race that were not explained by differences in disease characteristics (<LINK REF="STD-Appel-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Appel 2009</LINK>). ALMS was the only study to provide stratified results according to ethnicity and class of lupus in the update, and no studies provided stratified results according to severity of renal impairment reducing the power to examine potential differences between these groups. Despite lack of result stratification, variation among studies could be considered a strength. Of 10 studies comparing MMF with cyclophosphamide, seven included either Asian and/or African American patients, and all studies included patients with the more severe histological classification of class IV lupus nephritis. Despite clinical differences in population and histological classification, uniformity of effect demonstrated in the meta analysis suggest that results were valid across race and class of lupus nephritis.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-11-07 18:58:42 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this review we found similar effects for induction of remission of proliferative lupus nephritis comparing MMF with cyclophosphamide. A significant reduction in toxic effects (ovarian failure, alopecia and leucopenia) was observed with MMF, though with a significant increase in diarrhoea which may limit its widespread tolerability. Particularly for women of child-bearing age, the equivalent remission rates combined with a more favourable side-effect profile would support MMF as being superior to cyclophosphamide as induction therapy for lupus nephritis. Recently published American College of Rheumatology Guidelines concur with our findings, recommending MMF (2 to 3 g daily) or IV cyclophosphamide with corticosteroids for induction therapy in patients with ISN class III/IV lupus nephritis (<LINK REF="REF-Hahn-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hahn 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although there are few study data on maintenance therapy, meta-analyses from two recent large RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Appel-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Appel 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MAINTAIN-Nephritis-Study" TYPE="STUDY">MAINTAIN Nephritis Study</LINK>) showed that MMF is superior to azathioprine in preventing renal relapse with no difference between the therapies in doubling of serum creatinine, mortality, major infection, gastrointestinal disturbance and leucopenia. There were very limited data for newer agents such as rituximab (two studies investigating different treatment comparisons, with a total of 159 patients), so no conclusions about the relative benefit and harms of this agent could be made. Until further research becomes available, the lack of data on other agents and heterogeneity of dosing schedules make it difficult to offer recommendations about other agents and to be more specific about optimal dosing schedules.<BR/>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-11-07 18:26:21 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are two main implications for future research: firstly to make better use of existing data, and secondly to strategically plan any new studies. Given the overall inconsistency of outcomes that were reported, and timing of outcome measurement, access to study outcome data sets of existing studies may permit a more informative analysis. Although there have been several multicentre studies since the original review was published in 2004, diversity in interventions has continued to hamper informative synthesis and cross-comparison. Lupus nephritis is uncommon, requiring multicentre collaboration for any study to have an adequate sample size. The importance of follow-up prolonged beyond six months is vital to clarify risks and eventual harms of specific treatment regimens. There is also a paucity of data for patient subgroups who may carry greater disease burden, such as African-Americans and Asians, and patients presenting with advanced renal impairment.</P>
