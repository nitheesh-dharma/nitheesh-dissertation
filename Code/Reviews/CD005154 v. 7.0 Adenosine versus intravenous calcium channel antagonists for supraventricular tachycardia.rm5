<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-09-23 12:29:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Samer Alabed">
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is a common abnormal rhythm of the heart that results in a very rapid heartbeat. This rhythm problem usually occurs in otherwise healthy people, and common symptoms include palpitations, light-headedness, and chest pain. Occasionally, SVT may also cause confusion or loss of consciousness. SVT can sometimes be treated with simple physical manoeuvres such as forced breath holding. When simple manoeuvres fail, SVT can be treated in the emergency department with a variety of drugs. The two most commonly used drug types are adenosine and calcium channel antagonists (CCAs) (verapamil is the most frequently used drug in this class).</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>This review compares effectiveness and side effects of adenosine and CCAs in terminating SVT episodes. We included in the review seven trials involving 622 patients. Evidence is current to July 2017.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Combined analysis of these trials showed no differences between adenosine and CCAs in successfully treating SVT. This finding is based on moderate-quality evidence. A temporary drop in blood pressure that did not require treatment was reported in only one of 152 study participants treated with CCAs, and low-quality evidence suggests that no patients treated with adenosine experienced low blood pressure. We have no data on length of stay in hospital nor on patient satisfaction.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusions</B>
</P>
<P>Moderate-quality evidence shows no differences in effects of adenosine and calcium channel antagonists for treatment of SVT on reverting to sinus rhythm, and low-quality evidence suggests no differences in cases of hypotension. None of these trials examined patient preferences, which is an important factor in deciding which drug is the 'best' treatment.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-09-29 14:28:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Samer Alabed">
<P>People with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) frequently are symptomatic and present to the emergency department for treatment. Although vagal manoeuvres may terminate SVT, they often fail, and subsequently adenosine or calcium channel antagonists (CCAs) are administered. Both are known to be effective, but both have a significant side effect profile. This is an update of a Cochrane review previously published in 2006.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-09-29 14:29:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Samer Alabed">
<P>To review all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compare effects of adenosine versus CCAs in terminating SVT.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-09-23 11:13:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Samer Alabed">
<P>We identified studies by searching CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two trial registers in July 2017. We checked bibliographies of identified studies and applied no language restrictions. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-09-23 11:14:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Samer Alabed">
<P>We planned to include all RCTs that compare adenosine versus a CCA for patients of any age presenting with SVT.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-09-23 11:15:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Samer Alabed">
<P>We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently checked results of searches to identify relevant studies and resolved differences by discussion with a third review author. At least two review authors independently assessed each included study and extracted study data. We entered extracted data into Review Manager 5. Primary outcomes were rate of reversion to sinus rhythm and major adverse effects of adenosine and CCAs. Secondary outcomes were rate of recurrence, time to reversion, and minor adverse outcomes. We measured outcomes by calculating odds ratios (ORs) and assessed the quality of primary outcomes using the GRADE approach through the GRADEproGDT website.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-09-29 14:29:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Samer Alabed">
<P>We identified two new studies for inclusion in the review update; the review now includes seven trials with 622 participants who presented to an emergency department with SVT. All included studies were RCTs, but only three described the randomisation process, and none had blinded participants, personnel, or outcome assessors to the intervention given. Moderate-quality evidence shows no differences in the number of people reverting to sinus rhythm who were treated with adenosine or CCA (89.7% vs 92.9%; OR 1.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85 to 2.68; participants = 622; studies = 7; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 36%). Low-quality evidence suggests no appreciable differences in major adverse event rates between CCAs and adenosine. Researchers reported only one case of hypotension in the CCA group and none in the adenosine group (0.66% vs 0%; OR 3.09, 95% CI 0.12 to 76.71; participants = 306; studies = 3; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%). Included trials did not report length of stay in hospital nor patient satisfaction.<BR/>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-09-23 11:17:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Samer Alabed">
<P>Moderate-quality evidence shows no differences in effects of adenosine and calcium channel antagonists for treatment of SVT on reverting to sinus rhythm, and low-quality evidence suggests no appreciable differences in the incidence of hypotension. A study comparing patient experiences and prospectively studied adverse events would provide evidence on which treatment is preferable for management of SVT.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Definitions</HEADING>
<P>Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) includes all tachyarrhythmias that originate in supraventricular tissue or incorporate supraventricular tissue in the re-entrant circuit and have sudden onset and termination. Atrioventricular nodal re-entrant tachycardia (AVNRT) and atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia (AVRT) (such as Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome) are two major types of SVT; other types include atrial tachycardia, paroxysmal atrial flutter, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (<LINK REF="REF-Jayam-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jayam 2004</LINK>). Most patients with SVT due to AVNRT or AVRT do not have associated structural heart disease (<LINK REF="REF-Ferguson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferguson 2003</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Epidemiology</HEADING>
<P>SVT is a common arrhythmia with a prevalence of 2 per 1000 adults. The incidence of SVT is 36 per 100,000 people per year, and women have twice the risk of developing SVT compared with men (<LINK REF="REF-Orejarena-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orejarena 1998</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Clinical presentation and diagnosis</HEADING>
<P>SVTs are often recurrent and occasionally persistent, and are a frequent cause of visits to emergency departments and primary care physicians' offices. Common symptoms of SVT include palpitations, anxiety, light-headedness, chest pain, neck pounding, and dyspnoea (<LINK REF="REF-Delacr_x00e9_taz-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delacrétaz 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Medi-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Medi 2009</LINK>). For patients presenting with SVT, a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) that shows a narrow complex tachycardia is essential for making the diagnosis and may reveal the mechanism of the arrhythmia.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Treatment</HEADING>
<P>Treatment in stable, symptomatic patients is aimed at terminating the rhythm by decreasing conduction through the atrioventricular (AV) node. Increasing vagal tone by the Valsalva manoeuvre or by carotid sinus massage will effectively revert up to 53% of patients to sinus rhythm (<LINK REF="REF-Wen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wen 1998</LINK>). A modified Valsalva manoeuvre with leg elevation and supine positioning can further improve success (<LINK REF="REF-Appelboam-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Appelboam 2015</LINK>). A recent Cochrane review assessed effectiveness of the Valsalva manoeuvre in terminating SVT and showed a reversion success rate between 19.4% and 54.3% in two studies. However, evidence was insufficient overall to support its effectiveness in terminating SVT (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2015</LINK>). For patients in whom vagal manoeuvres are not effective, calcium channel antagonists (CCAs), adenosine, sotalol, beta-blockers, and magnesium sulphate have been shown to be more effective than placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Dougherty-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dougherty 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gupta-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jordaens-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jordaens 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Joshi-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joshi 1995</LINK>). However, for acute management, adenosine and non-dihydropyridine CCAs - verapamil and diltiazem - are the intravenous drugs of choice for termination of SVT (<LINK REF="REF-Mangrum-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mangrum 2002</LINK>). The 2015 American Heart Association (AHA) Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and the 2015 European Resuscitation Council (ERC) Guidelines for Resuscitation for regular narrow complex SVT recommend use of adenosine if vagal manoeuvres have failed to terminate the SVT. CCAs are recommended as a second-line drug if adenosine is contraindicated or fails to terminate the SVT (<LINK REF="REF-Page-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Page 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soar-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soar 2015</LINK>). The decision as to which agent should be used is generally determined by clinician preference, personal experience, and institutional culture.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-09-23 12:29:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Samer Alabed">
<P>Adenosine and CCAs have been widely used in SVT with similar efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-Bolton-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bolton 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Delaney-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delaney 2011</LINK>). Moreover, the previous version of this Cochrane review, which compared these agents, showed no significant differences in reversion rate between the two drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Holdgate-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holdgate 2006</LINK>). However, adenosine is significantly more costly than most intravenous (IV) CCAs.</P>
<P>Adenosine has a half-life of less than a minute, and reversion to sinus rhythm may be short-lived, as a subsequent ectopic beat may reinitiate SVT. Many patients experience short-lived but unpleasant side effects following administration of adenosine, including dyspnoea, flushing, and, perhaps most dreadfully, a sense of impending death or doom that can be very frightening (<LINK REF="REF-Bolton-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bolton 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Katzung-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katzung 1995</LINK>). The recommended adult dosage of adenosine for peripheral infusion is 6 mg, followed by a 12-mg dose if needed. Because of the ultrashort duration of action, cumulative effects of sequential doses are not seen (<LINK REF="REF-Ferguson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferguson 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>On the other hand, CCAs have been used in SVT for many years and are effective in up to 90% of patients (<LINK REF="REF-Bolton-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bolton 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Delaney-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delaney 2011</LINK>). Calcium channel blockade causes negative inotropy and peripheral vasodilation, which may result in hypotension, particularly among patients with impaired left ventricular function. CCAs have a relatively long half-life of three to six hours, thus adverse effects may be prolonged. They are relatively contraindicated in patients who are already taking beta-blockers, as the combined effect may lead to significant bradycardia (<LINK REF="REF-Katzung-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katzung 1995</LINK>). The recommended dosage of verapamil is 5 mg IV over 2 minutes, followed in 5 to 10 minutes by a second dose of 5 to 7.5 mg. The recommended dosage of diltiazem is 20 mg, followed, if necessary, by a second dose of 25 to 35 mg; SVT termination should occur within 5 minutes of infusion completion (<LINK REF="REF-Ferguson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferguson 2003</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-09-23 12:33:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Samer Alabed">
<P>Both adenosine and CCAs inhibit conduction through the AV node, which facilitates termination of SVT. Adenosine is an endogenous nucleoside that acts by inhibiting cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-mediated calcium influx and enhancing potassium conduction. This leads to inhibition of AV nodal conduction and expansion of the AV nodal refractory period. In contrast, CCAs act by blocking voltage-dependent calcium channels, thus reducing intracellular calcium and leading to blockade of calcium-dependent conduction through the AV node (<LINK REF="REF-Katzung-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katzung 1995</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-09-23 12:41:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Samer Alabed">
<P>The previous version of this review showed that adenosine and CCAs are reasonably effective but have a significant side effect profile (<LINK REF="REF-Holdgate-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holdgate 2006</LINK>). This review update looks at new studies conducted over the past 10 years and aims to further explore uncertainty while helping clinicians and decision makers to regulate the choice between adenosine and CCAs. Recent American and British guidelines recommend adenosine as first pharmacological treatment for stable patients with SVT after vagal manoeuvres are attempted (<LINK REF="REF-Blomstrom_x002d_Lundqvist-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blomstrom-Lundqvist 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Page-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Page 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Resuscitation-Council-_x0028_UK_x0029_-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Resuscitation Council (UK) 2015</LINK>).</P>

<BLINDING MODIFIED="2017-09-24 10:00:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Samer Alabed">
<P>We rated blinding as introducing high risk of bias in all included studies, as none reported blinding of participants, caregivers, outcome assessors, or investigators. As these two drugs are usually given by different methods (adenosine as a rapid bolus, and CCAs as a slower IV infusion), it would be possible to achieve blinding only by using a double-dummy method, which would require substantial resources. However, no investigators discussed this issue. </P>

Each study showed a statistically significantly shorter time to reversion with adenosine than with verapamil. Average time to reversion in all studies combined was 44 seconds for adenosine and 394 seconds for CCAs. Very high heterogeneity between studies made pooling of results inappropriate. This heterogeneity may be due to differences in timing and dosing protocols between trials. <LINK REF="STD-Cheng-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cheng 2003</LINK> reported 'average time after dose'; trialists did not report how time to reversion was estimated in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Lim-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lim 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vranic-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Vranic 2006</LINK>).<BR/>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adenosine and CCA efficiency</HEADING>
<P>Our review aimed to examine the relative efficacy and safety of adenosine and calcium channel antagonists (CCAs) for patients presenting with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). We included seven trials with 622 participants.</P>
<P>We used three outcomes to compare efficiency of these agents: odds of reversion, time to reversion, and relapse rates. Reversion and relapse rates were similar with adenosine and CCAs. We could not reliably examine time to reversion in a pooled analysis owing to severe heterogeneity. Time to reversion was on average less than a minute with adenosine and longer than six minutes with CCAs. The difference between these two treatments is probably of little clinical significance for patients who are haemodynamically stable.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>Investigators reported only one episode of hypotension among patients treated with verapamil and none in those treated with adenosine. Two cardiac arrests occurred in a paediatric study published in the 1980s, in clinical circumstances for which current practice guidelines would not recommend verapamil without expert consultation (<LINK REF="REF-ACLS-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACLS 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>Minor adverse events occurred more frequently with adenosine and affected approximately one in ten patients. No studies specifically defined minor adverse events. Study authors relied on post hoc reporting; therefore, it is possible that the actual rate was higher than was reflected in the data. From a medical perspective, short-lived symptoms such as chest pain may be perceived as minor; however, no studies explored patients' perception of the relative severity of these events. No study commented on the sense of impending death or doom associated with adenosine treatment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Patient-centred outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The two outcomes for which we could find no data (i.e. patient satisfaction and length of hospital stay) may be helpful in the clinical decision as to which treatment should be used. From the patient's perspective, the risk of brief but unpleasant side effects, such as feeling close to death, may be unacceptable.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-10-06 13:28:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Samer Alabed">
<P>The GRADE approach shows that the quality of the evidence is moderate for the odds of reversion outcome (i.e. the result is likely to be close to the true effect but can be substantially different). The quality of evidence is low for the outcome of rate of major adverse events, but this result should be viewed with caution (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). Reasons for downgrading the quality of evidence for adverse events were the presence of high risk of bias in the blinding domain for all included studies and imprecision of results with wide confidence intervals. As studies objectively assessed reversion to sinus rhythm using electrocardiograms (ECGs), lack of blinding of participants or outcome assessors is not expected to have an impact on this endpoint.</P>
<P>Authors of all seven included studies stated that these were randomised trials; however, randomisation was poorly or incompletely reported. Only two studies specified how randomisation was undertaken (<LINK REF="STD-Greco-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Greco 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lim-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lim 2009</LINK>). One study described allocation concealment (<LINK REF="STD-Lim-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lim 2009</LINK>). None of the included studies were blinded.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">For people with SVT</HEADING>
<P>We found no evidence of differences in effects of adenosine and calcium channel antagonists (CCAs) for treatment of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). Our results are based on evidence of moderate quality. We found that adenosine is associated with more frequent minor adverse events such as chest pain.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">For clinicians</HEADING>
<P>Adenosine is the safer option in clinical situations for which verapamil is clearly contraindicated, as when people who have hypotension and poor left ventricular function are already taking beta-blockers, when individuals have other tachyarrhythmias such as broad complex tachycardia, or when a rapid effect is essential (as in very unstable or highly symptomatic patients). Verapamil is suggested for patients with asthma, as well as for stable patients in whom an extra 5 minutes is not likely to result in a worse clinical outcome, patients treated with adenosine in the past who experienced uncomfortable side effects that they would rather avoid if possible, patients who relapsed to SVT shortly after receiving adenosine because of frequent ectopics, and patients with frequent atrial or ventricular ectopics that could trigger a new episode of arrhythmia.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">For funders and policy makers</HEADING>
<P>Although current guidelines recommend adenosine as the first treatment choice, we could not confirm its superiority versus CCAs (<LINK REF="REF-Blomstrom_x002d_Lundqvist-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blomstrom-Lundqvist 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Page-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Page 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Resuscitation-Council-_x0028_UK_x0029_-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Resuscitation Council (UK) 2015</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Differences between original review in 2006 and update in 2017</HEADING>
<P>The main changes in review methods compared with those used in the original review include the following.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Excluding studies of induced SVT: We excluded studies involving induced SVTs as they are not relevant to patients presenting acutely to the emergency department. Patients with inducible SVT may not necessarily be affected by SVT in their daily life. Induced SVTs can be terminated with pacing manoeuvres, whereas spontaneous SVTs treated in emergency rooms/A&amp;E may last for hours and may require IV treatment for control.</LI>
<LI>Excluding quasi-randomised trials: Although the review protocol mentioned inclusion of quasi-RCTs, we decided to exclude trials with major violations in randomisation methods or treatment allocation. We also excluded studies reported to be randomised but showing no data on baseline differences between treatment interventions, and those in which major differences occurred at a rate of &gt; 1 per 20 comparisons (which makes them unlikely to have occurred by chance) (<LINK REF="REF-Carlisle-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carlisle 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Carlisle-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carlisle 2017</LINK>). When we had concerns about study methods, we excluded the study if study authors did not respond to our requests for clarification.</LI>
<LI>Using odds ratio instead of Peto odds ratio: The <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> discourages use of the Peto odds ratio and recommends use of the odds ratio instead (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Summary of findings tables: We prepared these in accordance with new requirements provided in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I>.</LI>
<LI>Search for ongoing trials: The protocol and the original review did not plan or perform this.</LI>
<LI>Remove "in adults" from title: The protocol did not attempt to include adults only, and the original review included only one study in children (<LINK REF="STD-Greco-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Greco 1982</LINK>).</LI>
