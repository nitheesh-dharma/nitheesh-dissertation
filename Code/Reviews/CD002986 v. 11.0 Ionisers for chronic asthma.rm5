Please use this version as I have spell checked it again.&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;br&gt;28may2003&lt;br&gt;_________________&lt;br&gt;TJL: 280503&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Chris, &lt;br&gt; I have made a couple of amendments to this review in the section 'Description of studies'. I have set the section out with subheadings on study design, patients, interventions and outcomes, and added some more detail there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of the studies really explored severity, and the review now reflects that more clearly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Best wishes, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.1&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2&lt;br&gt;Needs contributions need to be added.&lt;br&gt;Switch off totals for single studies&lt;br&gt;Cross-over issues.&lt;br&gt;Home and lab&lt;br&gt;2#2 needs subgroups and then re-enter the data.&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;EFFECTS OF POSITIVE ION GENERATORS&lt;br&gt;Only one study measured the effects of positive ions on lung function. This study demonstrated that although positively ionised air was associated with a larger fall in FEV1 with exercise, this did not reach statistical significance. Baseline FEV1 was not demonstrated to be significantly different between treatment groups. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;CJC Technical Editing 10_9_02&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors and contributions: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of included studies: fine. I note that all studies are cross overs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaview Labels: Look fine. Why is outcome 3 no totals and outcome 5 all totals? This is not consistent so I have switched 3 on for totals. There is of course the problem of analysis of crossover trials in RevMan. Are there any within patient change data presented?&lt;br&gt;***ALL TOTALS NOW OFF**** thanks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SYNOPSIS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Baseline&amp;quot; Forced Expiratory Volume in one second [FEV1] in one laboratory based study in children and one home based study in adults measuring FEV1 after four weeks exposure to control and negatively ionised air showed no significant difference in absolute FEV1 (litres) between treatments. &lt;br&gt;I HAVE TAKEN THIS SENTENCE OUT OF THE ABSTRACT AS IT IS A SINGLE STUDY RESULT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;METHODS&lt;br&gt;I think we need to put in a health warning in the methods about RevMan and cross-over studies. Can we discuss?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RESULTS&lt;br&gt;As there was no description of allocation concealment I think the Jadad scores should all be 3 not 4? There is a minus one score if we do not know the randomisation was OK? (Unless you think the double blinding means this does not matter). Can we discuss this?&lt;br&gt;Single study results should not be reported as WMD as there is only one study. How do the confidence intervals of the t-tests for the single studies compare with the results reported in the original papers?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Using the Asthma Symptom Score &amp;quot;1&amp;quot;(Warner , 1993) there were no significant differences between the treatments. After six weeks exposure to both ionised air and control air, in the symptom dimensions of &amp;quot;nighttime wheeze&amp;quot; [WMD-0.1(95 %C.I. -0.22, 0.20)]; &amp;quot;daytime wheeze&amp;quot; [WMD 0.02(95 %C.I.-0.2, 0.24)]; &amp;quot;nighttime cough&amp;quot; [WMD 0.29 (95 %C.I. -0.09, 0.67)]; and &amp;quot;daytime activity&amp;quot; [WMD: 0.0(95 %C.I.-0.1, 0.1)] The total WMD when these dimensions were combined was 0.01 (95 %C.I.-0.07, 0.09)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the Asthma Symptom Score &amp;quot;2&amp;quot; (Larsen, 1994) there were no significant differences between the treatments, after four weeks exposure to both ionised and control air, in the symptom dimensions scores of: &amp;quot;total&amp;quot; [WMD 13.5(95 %C.I. -19.75, 46.75)]; &amp;quot;sleep disturbance&amp;quot; [WMD 3.2(95 %C.I. -3.77, 10.17)]; &amp;quot;wheeze&amp;quot; [WMD 3.2 (95 %C.I.-7.0, 13.4)]; &amp;quot;activity level&amp;quot; [WMD2.1(95 %C.I. -8.6, 12.8)]; &amp;quot;coughing&amp;quot; [WMD 2.7(95 %C.I. -5.53, 10.93)] and &amp;quot;sputum production&amp;quot; [WMD2.3(95 %C.I. -5.17, 9.77)].&lt;br&gt;The Nogrady study also used this scale, however, the authors reported a mean of all five dimensions only. There was no significant difference between exposure periods in the mean symptom score [WMD, 0-0.21(95 %C.I.-1.09, 0.67)].&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THE ABOVE PARAGRAPHS AS THEY ARE NOT POOLED RESULTS. I THINK I SHOULD DISCUSS THIS WITH PAUL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Three studies recorded subject's asthma medication use (inhaled or oral bronchodilators, corticosteroids, sodium cromoglycate and other medications) (Nogrady(a), 1983; Nogrady(b), 1983; Warner , 1993; Larsen, 1994) Although one described it as beta-2 agonist use only (Larsen, 1994). In terms of the number of puffs of beta-2 agonist used in the adult study group and using a weighted mean difference, there was no significant difference between treatment periods [WMD 1.21(95 %C.I.-27.28, 29.7)]. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WMD SHOULD NOT BE USED HERE DUE TO DIFFERENT SCALES REPORTED.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;DISCUSSION&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;it is important to note however that the Ben-Dov et al study (Ben-Dov, 1983), a laboratory based study in children demonstrated that during the active ionisation period, the FEV1 after exercise provocation fell 8% less than that during the control air period. This reduction in bronchial reactivity was statistically significant using the Student's T- Test with a P value of &amp;lt;0.015. This reflects the power inherent in a paired T-test, compared to the use of a weighted mean difference. The clinical relevance of this finding generated in a controlled laboratory setting with the concentration of ions at the mouthpiece 100 times the natural concentration in the air is unclear. Furthermore, a statistically significant reduction in bronchial reactivity after histamine challenge did not occur. Interestingly, four of nine subjects demonstrated greater histamine sensitivity during inhalation of negative ions compared to control air. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THIS IS A CRUCIAL DIFFERENCE AND WE SHOULD REPORT THE PAIRED RESULTS NOT SPURIOUS SMD RESULTS. THIS MEANS ABANDONING REVMAN FOR ALL THE SINGLE STUDY RESULTS AND POOLING USING INVERSE VARIANCE WHERE THERE ARE REPORTED PAIRED T-TESTS. I WILL NEED TO SEE THE DATA FROM THE PAPERS HERE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scales are unvalidated not invalidated (i have changed this).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In conclusion, based on the results of individual studies, in a laboratory setting, positively ionised air has been shown to aggravate exercise induced asthma and negatively ionised air has been shown to attenuate exercise induced asthma during exposure to these charged ions at 100 fold the concentration found naturally in the air. &amp;quot; THIS IS NOT JUSTIFIED BY THE DATA PRESENTED.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;16/01/03&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Chris, &lt;br&gt; Karen and I have been through the review and we have made several changes based upon the issues you raised concerning pooling crossover data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have elected not to pool the crossover data and we have removed the pooled anaylses results from the text in the Results section. We analysed the change scores from the Nogrady study as first arm data having put the numbers into Excel and done means and SDs from there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can take out the final paragraph if you think that it is too strong. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Best wishes, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1_4_3&lt;br&gt;Metaview totals all off now - thank you.&lt;br&gt;Abstract:&lt;br&gt;The results no longer match Metaview for the abstract so this para needs a re-write - sorry/&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;EFFECTS OF NEGATIVE ION GENERATORS&lt;br&gt;Pooled analysis of studies with adults and children showed no significant difference in Morning Peak Expiratory Flow between treatment periods. Studies with adults and children were pooled and showed the same absence of effect in Evening Peak Expiratory Flow.&lt;br&gt;Different symptom scales were used therefore it was not possible to pool data for symptom scores, so analyses are reported separately.&lt;br&gt;Beta-2 agonist use combined with 'total' medication use show no significant difference between treatment groups. Data combined from adults and children generated no significant difference in asthma medication use between exposure periods. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have amended the discussion and conclusions to the effect that we do not have good evidence to suggest that ionisers are of benefit and would be grateful if the abstract could also be adjusted to reflect this.&lt;br&gt;Thanks,&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2_5_3 The abstract is now fine (I have slightly amended the wording) and this is ready for Kirsty and Peer review.&lt;br&gt;Old title: =Ionisers for chronic asthma&lt;br&gt;Old title: =Ionisers for chronic asthma&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SS section checked 4/3/05 Liz&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2017-09-04 14:14:45 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Dennett" REVIEW_NO="ION-AST" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.3.5 " REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="11.0">

<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Ion generators have been marketed for use in homes to remove dust and smoke particles in order to improve symptoms in people with asthma. Although complex laboratory studies show that ion generators alter airways function, the few studies which have been conducted in the homes of people with asthma, demonstrate no significant benefit in improving lung function or symptoms. </P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2012-06-22 15:38:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Asthma is a chronic pulmonary disorder which affects an estimated 3.4 million people in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-ONS-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">ONS 1996</LINK>). A recent National Asthma Campaign survey (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2000</LINK>) suggests that 42% of those who have asthma face significant challenges in their daily lives due to their condition. Two thirds of the asthma population are said to be receiving inhaled steroids with many expressing concerns about the long-term effects of their medication (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2000</LINK>). Although pharmacological interventions continue to improve, the prevalence of asthma remains high (<LINK REF="REF-ONS-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">ONS 1996</LINK>). Such concerns highlight the need for further investigation into the benefits of non-pharmacological treatment in order to compliment pharmacological therapies. <BR/> <BR/>Previous reports have shown that alteration of ions in the air may have an effect on respiratory function (<LINK REF="REF-Wehner-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wehner 1969</LINK>). As a result, interest has grown in the physiological effects of positive and negative air ions in people with asthma. With the development of ion generators it has become possible to artificially manipulate the ion content in air. Studies (<LINK REF="STD-Nogrady-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Nogrady 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lipin-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Lipin 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Warner-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Warner 1993</LINK>) have been carried out to test the efficacy of air ionisers in order to reduce air-borne allergens and smoke particles, with a view to alleviating asthma symptoms. Results of such studies are often inconclusive and the effectiveness of air ionisers as a treatment for asthma remains debatable. This systematic review of the available evidence was conducted in order to summarise the results of all identified randomised controlled trials comparing ionisers to placebo.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine whether air ionisers (positive or negative ion emitters) are effective in relieving symptoms and improving respiratory function in people with chronic asthma. </P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2012-06-22 15:36:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Due to the crossover design employed in the studies, we could not reliably pool data from the individual studies in RevMan, and individual study data only is shown in the Forest plots. We extracted first arm data for <LINK REF="STD-Nogrady-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Nogrady 1983</LINK> and analysed this based upon individual patient scores. We reported data for outcomes in the crossover trials in the text of the review.</P>
<P>If parallel group data are available in future versions of this review, we will report pooled analyses as weighted mean differences (WMD) and standardised mean differences (SMD) depending upon the availability of data measured on the same or different metrics. If we can obtain suitable paired data for crossover studies, we will combine this using inverse variance meta-analysis. Where a more positive outcome is favourable, (e.g. PEF) data, we entered this as positive values. In this case the titles of the horizontal axes have been reversed so that effects that favour the treatment under review move to the right. We have graphed continuous outcomes for which lower scores imply improvement (e.g. symptom scores and percentage reduction in FEV1 as a measure of bronchial reactivity) according to standard Cochrane graphical convention such that effects that favour the treatment under review move to the left.</P>

<P>Negatively ionised air was used in four home-based studies (<LINK REF="STD-Daugbjerg-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Daugbjerg 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Larsen-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Larsen 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nogrady-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Nogrady 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Warner-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Warner 1993</LINK>) and one laboratory based study (<LINK REF="STD-Ben_x002d_Dov-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Ben-Dov 1983</LINK>). Positively ionised air was used in one laboratory based study (<LINK REF="STD-Lipin-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Lipin 1984</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Nogrady-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Nogrady 1983</LINK> exposed participants to 150,000 negative ions/ml at night for 10 hours during the 8 week active treatment period. <LINK REF="STD-Daugbjerg-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Daugbjerg 1988</LINK> exposed participants to 220,000 negative ions per cm<SUP>3</SUP> or placebo for either eight and then four weeks or four and then eight weeks treatment.

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Ben_x002d_Dov-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Ben-Dov 1983</LINK> exposed participants to negatively charged ions (0.5 to 1.0 x 106 ions per cm<SUP>3</SUP> for approximately 45 minutes) and conducted identical six minute exercise provocation tests (cycle ergometry) where each challenge was undertaken twice (3 to 24 hours apart) with active and placebo ionisers.

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>There was variation in the overall outcomes used across the six studies.</P>
<P>The studies conducted under laboratory conditions measured lung function and did not assess symptoms or medication usage (<LINK REF="STD-Ben_x002d_Dov-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Ben-Dov 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lipin-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Lipin 1984</LINK>)</P>
<P>Of the remaining studies, assessments were conducted of lung function in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Larsen-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Larsen 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nogrady-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Nogrady 1983</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Warner-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Warner 1993</LINK>); symptoms were assessed in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Daugbjerg-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Daugbjerg 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Larsen-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Larsen 1994</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Warner-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Warner 1993</LINK>) and attempts to record medication usage were made in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Daugbjerg-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Daugbjerg 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Warner-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Warner 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Nogrady-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Nogrady 1983</LINK>) reported data with significant differences in baseline measurements (approximately 100 ml difference in PEF) between the two comparison groups possibly due to the gender distribution which is suggestive of unsuccessful randomisation. Results were presented in the form of the two groups, according to whether participants were exposed to the active ioniser or the placebo ioniser first. Data from each group were analysed separately and intra-group comparisons were made between the active and placebo periods. A second publication of the trial contributed no extra data to the review so is listed in 'excluded studies'.</P>
<P>Data from another study (<LINK REF="STD-Daugbjerg-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Daugbjerg 1988</LINK>) does not appear in the table of comparisons as the data were not useable due to the use of non-validated symptom scoring.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>Overall, the included papers were of strong study design. All studies were conducted double-blind, except the Daugjberg study (<LINK REF="STD-Daugbjerg-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Daugbjerg 1988</LINK>) which was single blind. The order of the treatments within the crossover were described as randomised but randomisation methods were not stated. However, none of the studies commented on the number of participants excluded from the trials or reported a power calculation to determine sample size. Withdrawals and drop-outs were adequately described. </P>
<P>The sample sizes of each of the six studies were small, ranging from 12 to 20 participants. The total number of participants contributing data from all six studies was 106.</P>
<P>A wash-out period between treatment arms of two weeks was reported in only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Nogrady-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Nogrady 1983</LINK>). Although the duration of exposure in the laboratory studies was short, it is unknown whether a wash-out period of greater than 3 to 24 hours would be required. </P>
<P>Inclusion/exclusion criteria were not formally specified. Inclusion criteria was specified in two studies, with respect to a definition of stable asthma (<LINK REF="STD-Larsen-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Larsen 1994</LINK>), and a concentration of house dust mite allergen Der p1 (<LINK REF="STD-Warner-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Warner 1993</LINK>) . The two laboratory based studies reported a general statement of inclusion of subjects as those being "known to have had asthmatic attacks provoked by physical exertion". Only one study specified exclusion criteria relating to medication use (<LINK REF="STD-Larsen-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Larsen 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was total agreement between two independent assessments of study quality using the Cochrane approach and the Jadad scale. All five studies were graded B according to the Cochrane approach to concealment of allocation as none described the method of concealment of allocation. This is not a major concern if the blinding of participants and assessors was secure. No further details were provided by the authors, about methods of concealment or randomisation, which increased the allocated scores of the included trials. All studies were given a Jadad score of 3. </P>

<P>Three studies, one conducted in children (<LINK REF="STD-Warner-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Warner 1993</LINK>) and two in adults (<LINK REF="STD-Nogrady-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Nogrady 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Larsen-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Larsen 1994</LINK>) recorded asthma symptoms. The Warner study utilised a different symptom scale while the Nogrady and Larsen studies used the same. These measured five dimensions of symptoms and reported a mean symptom score only, not scores for the individual dimensions including the "Total" dimension. Of these three studies, only the Larsen study reported a "Total" dimension. Thus it was not possible to pool these data in an analysis using a standardised mean difference and the analyses are reported separately according to the use of Asthma Symptom Scale "1" and Asthma Symptom Scale "2".</P>
<P>Using the Asthma Symptom Score "1" (<LINK REF="STD-Warner-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Warner 1993</LINK>) there were no significant differences between the treatments. After six weeks exposure to both ionised air and control air, in the symptom dimensions of "nighttime wheeze"; "daytime wheeze"; "nighttime cough" and "daytime activity".</P>
<P>Using the Asthma Symptom Score "2" (<LINK REF="STD-Larsen-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Larsen 1994</LINK>) there were no significant differences between the treatments, after four weeks exposure to both ionised and control air, in the symptom dimensions scores of: "total"; "sleep disturbance"; "wheeze"; "activity level"; "coughing" and "sputum production".</P>

The confidence interval of the effect of positive ionisation on FEV1 after exercise includes no difference and also a clinically significant deterioration, but the sample size is too small to draw any firm conclusion. Baseline FEV1 was also demonstrated not to be significantly different between treatment groups.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-01-19 16:21:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>The impact of weather and the resulting ionic charge of the air has been thought to have an impact on biological systems (<LINK REF="REF-Sulman-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sulman 1984</LINK>) including the respiratory system (<LINK REF="STD-Palti-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Palti 1966</LINK>). Studies of the effects of weather on morbidity have been conducted with respect to the Foehn, a dry southerly wind of central Europe (<LINK REF="REF-Posse-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Posse 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gnecchi-Ruscone-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gnecchi Ruscone 1985</LINK>) and although asthma patients often report a worsening of symptoms with weather changes, early studies indicate no relationship (<LINK REF="REF-Dantzler-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dantzler 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wagner-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wagner 1983</LINK>).</P>
<P>Ion generators have been marketed for use to reverse negative ion depletion and to remove dust and smoke particles by electrostatic precipitation. There is a paucity of data in the literature generated from randomised controlled trials of the effects of ion generators for chronic asthma. Consequently this review has been limited by the small numbers of studies eligible for inclusion in the review and also the inconsistent use of outcome of measures. It is possible that the studies lacked the statistical power to detect changes in outcomes because of the small sample sizes of these studies, ranging from 12 to 20.</P>
<P>The five studies of the effects of negative ion generators and the one study of the effect of a positive ion generator included in this review have failed generally to demonstrate any benefit of these instruments for the treatment of chronic asthma in children and adults. Relevant outcome measures such as PEF, FEV1 after exercise and histamine provocation, symptom scores and asthma medication showed no significant improvement after extended periods of exposure to charged ions compared to normal/control air. It is important to note however that the Ben-Dov et al study (<LINK REF="STD-Ben_x002d_Dov-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Ben-Dov 1983</LINK>), a laboratory based study in children demonstrated that during the active ionisation period, the FEV1 after exercise provocation fell 8% less than that during the control air period. This reduction in bronchial reactivity was statistically significant using the Student's paired t-test with a P value of less than 0.015. This reflects the power inherent in a paired t-test, compared to the use of a mean difference. The clinical relevance of this finding generated in a controlled laboratory setting with the concentration of ions at the mouthpiece 100 times the natural concentration in the air is unclear. Furthermore, a statistically significant reduction in bronchial reactivity after histamine challenge did not occur. Interestingly, four of nine participants demonstrated greater histamine sensitivity during inhalation of negative ions compared to control air.</P>
<P>The study by Lipin et al (<LINK REF="STD-Lipin-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Lipin 1984</LINK>) also demonstrated a statistically significant increase in bronchial reactivity after exercise in participants during inhalation of positive ions (P = 0.04). In this study, eight of twelve children experienced a greater reduction in FEV1 when the active ioniser was used compared to the placebo ioniser. Two showed no change and two showed a reduction in reactivity. All other outcomes in this review were statistically consistent with those reported by authors of the studies.</P>
<P>Asthma symptoms were not demonstrably improved as a consequence of active ionisation. The two studies, however, which recorded or reported this outcome used two apparently un validated symptom scales; the Nogrady study (<LINK REF="STD-Nogrady-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Nogrady 1983</LINK>) which utilised the same scale as the Larsen study (<LINK REF="STD-Larsen-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Larsen 1994</LINK>) reported a mean symptom score of the five dimensions rather than the "Total" dimension score. The frequency of "nighttime cough" recorded in the Warner study (<LINK REF="STD-Warner-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Warner 1993</LINK>) increased during the ionisation period (exposure to negative ions for six weeks) to a level which approached statistical significance [Wilcoxon signed rank sum test P = 0.055]. If the use of room air ionisers is to be pursued then this finding requires further investigation.</P>
<P>Asthma medication use was not demonstrated to be significantly reduced during active ionisation compared to when the placebo ioniser was in use. Beta-2 agonist use was an outcome measure in only one of three studies which recorded medication use. The amount of rescue medication used is more likely to reflect a change in condition as compared to other asthma medications.</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Larsen-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Larsen 1994</LINK>) provoked some interesting correspondence (<LINK REF="REF-Jonassen-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jonassen 1996</LINK>) which suggests the need to carry out initial trials on the efficiency of the ioniser before using it in a trial. The ioniser is an instrumental component in the trial and could potentially influence the trial outcome. Another point about the length of time an ioniser should be turned on in order to 'clean' the air in a room is also worthy of consideration. Any trials implemented to test an improvement of symptoms in asthma patients should consider these points.</P>
<P>In conclusion, individual studies in a laboratory setting suggest that positively ionised air may aggravate exercise induced asthma and negatively ionised air may attenuate exercise induced asthma during exposure to these charged ions at 100 fold the concentration found naturally in the air. No other significant benefit or harm in terms of lung function (baseline and absolute FEV1, PEF), asthma symptoms or medication use were demonstrated and none occurred in the home setting.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Based on the evidence currently available from randomised controlled trials, a recommendation cannot be given for the use of room air ionisers in the homes of patients with chronic asthma. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The strength of evidence from six randomised controlled trials does not suggest that air ionisers are significantly beneficial for patients with chronic asthma. There are no further data to provide additional evidence to support their use and the absence of such data in the medical literature since 1993 suggests a declining interest. The review does suggest, however, that further trials would need to incorporate issues on compliance, efficiency of the ioniser and the environment in which the trial takes place. </P>
