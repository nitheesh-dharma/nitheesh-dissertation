<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-02-10 04:39:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Many people have urinary problems that are difficult to control by non-surgical means. Most surgical treatments are for people with stress incontinence only. Implants that provide continuous electrical stimulation to the nerves that control the bladder have been used in people with other types of incontinence. These devices are expensive, the surgery is invasive, and many people need another operation. It is not clear how best to use these devices. However, implantable stimulators that provide continuous electrical stimulation to the nerves or nerve roots supplying the bladder and pelvis, or to the peripheral nerves that share the same nerve roots, can benefit carefully selected patients with difficult-to-control urinary problems.<BR/>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-02-17 10:14:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nerve stimulation for lower urinary tract problems is the subject of more than one Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Berghmans-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berghmans 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Khazali-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khazali 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kovoor-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kovoor 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Patel-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 2008</LINK>). In addition, a further Cochrane review addresses the use of sacral nerve stimulation to treat faecal incontinence and constipation (<LINK REF="REF-Mowatt-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mowatt 2007</LINK>). This review concentrates on surgically implanted stimulators that provide electrical stimulation to the sacral nerves (<LINK REF="REF-Shaker-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaker 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Kerrebroeck-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Kerrebroeck 1998</LINK>). Patients offered such surgery have usually failed several more conservative types of management by the time implants are contemplated.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-02-12 14:00:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The impact of incontinence on quality of life, and therefore the importance of managing it as effectively as possible, can scarcely be overemphasised. Control of storage of urine and bladder emptying is achieved by a complex interaction between the structures supporting the bladder and urethra; the detrusor (bladder) muscle; the muscles of the urethra, pelvic floor, and the abdominal wall; and the higher brain centres and peripheral nerves. A disruption at any level can interfere with normal urine storage and voiding. Neurogenic disruption can result from proven neurological disease or trauma (for example spinal cord injury). Similar changes can also occur without overt neurological damage where people may have an overactive bladder or one that does not void properly and so over-fills. Electrical nerve stimulation (neuromodulation) has been used to try to overcome these problems.</P>
<P>Nerve stimulation by electrical or magnetic induction has been used for stress urinary incontinence, urgency and frequency problems including urge urinary incontinence, and voiding problems.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Stress urinary incontinence is urine leakage associated with an increase in abdominal pressure, such as with a cough, sneeze, or physical exercise. Urgency is a sudden compelling desire to pass urine that is difficult to defer, even if the bladder is not full; urgency urinary incontinence is when leakage accompanies the sense of urgency. Mixed incontinence is a combination of stress and urge incontinence.</LI>
<LI>Increased daytime urinary frequency describes the complaint by an individual who considers that he or she voids too often during the day. Overactive bladder syndrome is the symptom of urgency usually accompanied by frequency, nocturia, and or incontinence.</LI>
<LI>Voiding problems include weak flow and urinary retention that results in an over-dilated bladder; this is termed detrusor areflexia when it is due to an inability of the detrusor muscle to contract adequately.</LI>
</UL>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-02-17 10:14:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nerve stimulation can be achieved using surface electrodes or transcutaneous needles, or electrodes implanted close to nerves; or induced by a changing external magnetic field applied near the nerves (<LINK REF="REF-Appell-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Appell 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brubaker-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brubaker 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goldberg-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldberg 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Govier-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Govier 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hasan-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hasan 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jabs-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jabs 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Siegel--1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siegel 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Kerrebroeck-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Kerrebroeck 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Nerve stimulation can be delivered through electrical or magnetic stimulation. Electrical stimulation can be intermittent (not using an implanted device) at a clinic or at home, or continuous via implanted devices and electrodes.</P>

<P>Continuous stimulation (the subject of this review) is delivered via surgically implanted devices and electrodes (<LINK REF="REF-Brindley-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brindley 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brindley-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brindley 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Creasey-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Creasey 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shaker-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaker 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Kerrebroeck-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Kerrebroeck 1998</LINK>). Devices with implanted electrodes come in two types:</P>
<UL>
<LI>sacral anterior root stimulation (Brindley) with or without de-afferentation;</LI>
<LI>sacral nerve stimulation (neuromodulation).</LI>
</UL>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sacral anterior root stimulation (Brindley)</HEADING>
<P>Sacral anterior root stimulation has been used for selected spinal cord injury patients. Electrodes implanted intradurally or extradurally stimulate the nerves or the nerve roots supplying the bladder, pelvic floor, and urethral sphincter. Continence is achieved by abolishing any reflex bladder activity by sacral posterior root division, usually at the conus level. This also results in the bladder being unable to empty. When voiding is required, an external radio transmitter is applied to the skin overlying the radio receiver block which is implanted in a subcutaneous position in the abdomen and is connected by cables surgically placed under the skin to the spinal electrodes. The induced electrical impulses are thence conveyed to the nerves. This implant also has the ability to achieve neurologically mediated penile erection, and electrical stimulation of defaecation for some patients. These devices have demonstrated efficacy so that it it is unlikely that randomised trials will be undertaken (<LINK REF="REF-Brindley-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brindley 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Creasey-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Creasey 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Kerrebroeck-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Kerrebroeck 1993</LINK>). For this reason, this type of implantable stimulator will not be considered further in this review. In this respect the review differs from the protocol. </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sacral nerve stimulation (neuromodulation)</HEADING>
<P>This type of stimulation is the focus of the review. Initially an electrode is placed via the sacral foramen alongside a sacral nerve (usually S3). In a second procedure the electrode is connected by cables under the skin to an implanted programmable pulse generator that provides stimulation within set stimulation parameters. Implantation of the pulse generator is usually carried out only after a successful trial of percutaneous (skin surface) nerve evaluation (PNE). In earlier techniques a temporary electrode was placed near the nerve and stimulation provided by an external pulse generator. More recently the permanent electrode has been used for an additional test phase (in a two-stage procedure). If PNE is regarded as successful, the patient then proceeds to full implantation with the pulse generator. The technology has been used for patients with overactive bladders, urgency incontinence, and voiding (retention of urine) difficulties, and for some patients with defaecation problems (<LINK REF="REF-Mowatt-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mowatt 2007</LINK>) . It has also been used in the management of chronic pelvic pain but this indication is not included in this review.</P>
<P>In patients with urge urinary incontinence caused by detrusor overactivity, sacral neuromodulation seems to act primarily by activation of non-muscular afferent sacral nerve fibres that inhibit parasympathetic motor neurones in the cord through interneurones. It appears that any change induced by implanted electrodes persists only while the stimulator is turned on, returning to baseline when the stimulation is stopped. A longer lasting benefit has, however, been reported for stimulation via vaginal or anal plug electrodes, persisting after active treatment stops.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-02-12 13:39:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is unclear how neuromodulation might work, in which groups of patients it might be effective, and what type of delivery is optimal (<LINK REF="REF-Bosch-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bosch 1998</LINK>). When a nerve is stimulated, signals travel both toward the periphery and toward the central nervous system. There may be responses to these signals that come from the central nervous system or the tissues innervated by the nerve, or the central nervous system may be modified to re-interpret some signals. Some recent work shows that central mechanisms may be involved. Thus the precise mode of action of neuromodulation on the lower urinary tract is unclear and this review does not attempt to answer the question of how neuromodulation works.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-02-10 08:05:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A non-Cochrane systematic review of sacral nerve stimulation for urge urinary incontinence and urgency or frequency symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Brazzelli-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brazzelli 2006</LINK>) considered evidence from comparative observational series, case series, and population-based registries as well as from randomised controlled trials. However, that review did not include voiding problems.</P>
<P>Although implanted electronic stimulators have been used increasingly during the last 20 years, there are few randomised trials and thus there remains uncertainty about the effectiveness of the intervention. As well as uncertainty about effectiveness, there is uncertainty about the best way to carry out the surgery and this review considers the randomised trials that address this issue (<LINK REF="REF-Braun-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Braun 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hohenfellner-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hohenfellner 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Janknegt-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Janknegt 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scheepens-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scheepens 2001</LINK>). Not all implants are successful, and adverse events are also considered in this review (<LINK REF="REF-Everaert-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Everaert 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koldewijn-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koldewijn 1994</LINK>).</P>

<P>Apart from the report by Everaert (<LINK REF="STD-Everaert-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Everaert 2002</LINK>), all of the reports have common authors and many of the elements of the studies are the same. Three of the reports clearly came from the same study but it had been split up and reported by indication (<LINK REF="STD-Hassouna-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hassouna 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jonas-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Jonas 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schmidt-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Schmidt 1999</LINK>). In other reports the numbers of participants differed, as did the dates of recruitment. It is unclear whether these were reports of the same study, subsets of the same study, updates of the same study after further recruitment, or different studies. For this reason it was decided not to pool the results of the studies.</P>
<P>Everaert compared a one-stage implant against the standard two-stage implant in patients with overactive bladder symptoms (<LINK REF="STD-Everaert-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Everaert 2002</LINK>). In this trial, all participants had a surgically implanted lead but in the two-stage group this was initially connected to a temporary external pulse generator, which was replaced with a permanent implanted pulse generator if the test phase was successful. The other reports all randomised participants to either have an immediate implant or a delayed implant (<LINK REF="STD-Gr_x00fc_newald-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Grünewald 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hassouna-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hassouna 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hassouna-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hassouna 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jonas-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Jonas 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schmidt-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Schmidt 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Siegel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Siegel 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weil-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Weil 2000</LINK>). Those in the 'delay group' were offered implants only after six months and served as the control arm for the trials during that six months. Many of the studies reported results after all patients had received implants but only the results at six months are included here as they are related to the period of randomisation.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Other considerations</HEADING>
<P>None of these studies reported on adverse effects by group. Some reported adverse events on all implanted people 12 months after implantation (<LINK REF="STD-Hassouna-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hassouna 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jonas-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Jonas 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schmidt-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Schmidt 1999</LINK>). In 219 people, side effects with more than 5% prevalence at 12 months were: pain at implant site (15.3%), new pain (9.0%), suspected lead migration (8.4%), infection (6.1%), transient sensation of electric shock (5.5%), and pain at the lead site (5.4%). Surgical revision of the implant or leads had to be carried out in 33.3% of the people.</P>

<P>No study reported an economic analysis. No study compared implants with a specific alternative treatment.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-02-12 13:44:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It would appear that devices that provide neuromodulation offer benefits to patients. There are highly significant changes in all the outcomes measured and these are consistently in favour of the implant. The findings are consistent across the different indications of urinary urge incontinence, urgency or frequency, and urinary retention. However, most results were only reported in single studies, so the magnitude of the effect must remain uncertain. The design of that study might be interpreted with some caution since blinding is impossible when a delayed implantation arm was the control treatment. It might be considered that 'switched off' implanted neuromodulation or crossover on and off designs may be easier to interpret.</P>
<P>It is of interest that in the existing systematic review of sacral nerve stimulation for urgency incontinence and urgency or frequency symptoms alone, the results of the case series studies were very much in line with the evidence from the randomised studies(<LINK REF="REF-Brazzelli-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brazzelli 2006</LINK>). Seventeen of these case series studies reported that 39% of patients with urge urinary incontinence were cured following implantation, and that 50% or greater improvement in incontinence symptoms was observed in 67%. Although evidence from case series studies can be less reliable than evidence from randomised trials, because of the risk of confounding, it is notable that these results are broadly similar to those of the randomised trials. In the randomised trials about 50% of patients in the stimulation group achieved complete continence or an improvement greater than 90% in the main incontinence symptoms, while a 50% improvement in the main incontinence symptoms was observed in about 87%. In addition, in the case series studies the benefits of neuromodulation were reported to persist at follow-up periods three to five years after implantation.</P>
<P>Once a patient is deemed potentially eligible for an implantable pulse generator, their potential to benefit is tested by non-invasive percutaneous nerve evaluation (PNE). At least 30% fail to show benefit at this stage and thus never receive an implant. The best way to carry out PNE remains unclear (<LINK REF="STD-Borawski-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Borawski 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is clearly a potential for complications following implantation (<LINK REF="REF-Oerlemans-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oerlemans 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sutherland-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sutherland 2007</LINK>). It is of concern that a high proportion of implants do not work or lose efficacy after implantation, as this is a very expensive procedure. Some of this is due to lead migration, which may be reduced with new types of lead and with bilateral lead placement. Complications can occur at the site of the implant but it appears that most of these can be treated or overcome. Most of the long-term studies have poor rates of follow up so that the information may not be reliable. There appears to be a low overall success rate, with 30% or more potentially eligible patients not being implanted and 30% or more of those implanted not gaining any benefit.</P>
<P>It is unclear how many studies exist. Certainly three reports (<LINK REF="STD-Hassouna-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hassouna 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jonas-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Jonas 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schmidt-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Schmidt 1999</LINK>) are part of the same study but they do not include the same patients. Thus they may be subgroup analyses, with the subgroups decided after randomisation; the results should, therefore, be treated with caution.</P>
<P>In one report (<LINK REF="STD-Weil-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Weil 2000</LINK>) the effect on general health status, as measured by the SF-36, was unclear as it was different on only one of the eight dimensions, but in another it was highly significant (<LINK REF="STD-Hassouna-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hassouna 2000</LINK>). It is unclear why this should be so.</P>
<P>Sacral nerve stimulation with implantable devices continues to evolve. The usual site for implantation has changed, the type of lead has changed, and the testing before implantation (not covered in this review) has changed. Most of these changes have occurred without being tested in randomised trials. While this can be appropriate, more trials are needed to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of current techniques.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-02-10 09:51:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Implantable neurostimulators have benefits for some patients with overactive bladder symptoms, retention without organic obstruction, and in those for whom other methods of treatment have failed. They might be considered a promising, potential solution to bladder dysfunctions which have a serious impact on patients' health status and quality of life, in carefully selected patients. The ability to reverse the procedure (by removal of the leads and the pulse generator) may make it a more attractive option than some other surgical interventions. However, patients need to be monitored carefully as not all implants are successful and a high proportion will need revision of some sort, or treatment for complications. Implants are very expensive. It is still unclear how best to choose patients for this procedure.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-02-10 09:53:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>While it seems clear that implants work, there remain many unanswered questions. Since the studies included in this study were conducted it would appear that the placement of the implant has changed from the abdomen to the buttock, as this was found to be less painful. The reason for this may be clinically obvious but it has not been tested in randomised trials. There are also questions about unilateral versus bilateral leads, different methods of securing the leads, costs and benefits, and whether percutaneous nerve evaluation is an efficient test to select suitable patients. It is also unclear why implants fail in some patients despite positive test phase results. As these devices are expensive and implantation is invasive, it is essential to evaluate them and to minimise the failure rate.</P>
<P>Researchers should be open about the details of their studies and make it clear when they are part of a larger study, and how subgroups were identified. Studies should use outcomes that are important to patients and be reported in accordance with the CONSORT statement to allow design and data abstraction. Since these studies were carried out, injections of botulinum toxin have become more common for people with an overactive bladder, in spite of less than ideal evidence of efficacy and effectiveness. Unless there is an obvious advantage, these need to be compared with implantable generators of electrical stimulation.</P>
