<P>There is moderate evidence that heat wrap therapy reduces pain and disability for patients with back pain that lasts for less than three months. The relief has only been shown to occur for a short time and the effect is relatively small. The addition of exercise to heat wrap therapy appears to provide additional benefit. There is still not enough evidence about the effect of the application of cold for low-back pain of any duration, or for heat for back pain that lasts longer than three months.</P>
<P>Heat treatments include hot water bottles, soft heated packs filled with grain, poultices, hot towels, hot baths, saunas, steam, heat wraps, heat pads, electric heat pads and infra-red heat lamps. Cold treatments include ice, cold towels, cold gel packs, ice packs and ice massage.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Heat and cold are commonly utilised in the treatment of low-back pain by both health care professionals and people with low-back pain.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of superficial heat and cold therapy for low-back pain in adults.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Back Review Group Specialised register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (<I>The Cochrane Library Issue 3</I>, 2005), MEDLINE (1966 to October 2005), EMBASE (1980 to October 2005) and other relevant databases.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We included randomised controlled trials and non-randomised controlled trials that examined superficial heat or cold therapies in people with low-back pain.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors independently assessed methodological quality and extracted data, using the criteria recommended by the Cochrane Back Review Group.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Nine trials involving 1117 participants were included. In two trials of 258 participants with a mix of acute and sub-acute low-back pain, heat wrap therapy significantly reduced pain after five days (weighted mean difference (WMD) 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68 to 1.45, scale range 0 to 5) compared to oral placebo. One trial of 90 participants with acute low-back pain found that a heated blanket significantly decreased acute low-back pain immediately after application (WMD -32.20, 95%CI -38.69 to -25.71, scale range 0 to 100). One trial of 100 participants with a mix of acute and sub-acute low-back pain examined the additional effects of adding exercise to heat wrap, and found that it reduced pain after seven days. There is insufficient evidence to evaluate the effects of cold for low-back pain, and conflicting evidence for any differences between heat and cold for low-back pain.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The evidence base to support the common practice of superficial heat and cold for low back pain is limited and there is a need for future higher-quality randomised controlled trials. There is moderate evidence in a small number of trials that heat wrap therapy provides a small short-term reduction in pain and disability in a population with a mix of acute and sub-acute low-back pain, and that the addition of exercise further reduces pain and improves function. The evidence for the application of cold treatment to low-back pain is even more limited, with only three poor quality studies located. No conclusions can be drawn about the use of cold for low-back pain. There is conflicting evidence to determine the differences between heat and cold for low-back pain.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-06-13 11:59:24 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Low-back pain is a common complaint with the lifetime prevalence reported as ranging from 11% to 84% (<LINK REF="REF-Walker-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 2000</LINK>). The cause of pain is non-specific in about 95% of people presenting with acute low-back pain, with serious conditions being rare (<LINK REF="REF-Hollingworth-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hollingworth 2002</LINK>). Chronic low-back pain is a well documented disabling condition, costly to both individuals and society (<LINK REF="REF-Carey-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carey 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Frymoyer-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frymoyer 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maniadakis-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maniadakis 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Different health care disciplines commonly use heat and cold treatments for the treatment of low-back pain (<LINK REF="REF-Battie-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Battie 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Car-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Car 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Geffen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geffen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hamm-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamm 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jette-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jette 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Li-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rush-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rush 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stanos-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stanos 2004</LINK>). Both therapies are simple to apply and are inexpensive. They may be used by people with low-back pain at home, or may be employed by practitioners as part of a treatment regimen.</P>
<P>Traditionally, ice has been recommended for acute injury and heat has been recommended for longer term injuries (<LINK REF="REF-Grana-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grana 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Michlovitz-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michlovitz 1996</LINK>). Superficial heat modalities convey heat by conduction or convection. Superficial heat elevates the temperature of tissues and provides the greatest effect at 0.5 cm or less from the surface of the skin. However, deep heating is achieved by converting another form of energy to heat, for example, shortwave diathermy, microwave diathermy and ultrasound (<LINK REF="REF-Vasudevan-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vasudevan 1997</LINK>). Superficial heat includes such modalities as hot water bottles, heated stones, soft heated packs filled with grain, poultices, hot towels, hot baths, saunas, steam, heat wraps, heat pads, electric heat pads and infra-red heat lamps. Cold therapy is used to reduce inflammation, pain and oedema. Superficial cold includes cryotherapy, ice, cold towels, cold gel packs, ice packs and ice massage.</P>
<P>Various national guidelines for the management of low-back pain have conflicting recommendation for heat and cold therapy. The US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality guidelines found no evidence of benefit from the application of ice or heat for acute low-back pain, however recommended self-application of heat or cold for patients to provide temporary relief of symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Bigos-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bigos 1994</LINK>). Other guidelines give different recommendations (<LINK REF="REF-ACC-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACC 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ICSI-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICSI 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-AAMPGG-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAMPGG 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Europe-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Europe 2004</LINK>).</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this review was to determine the efficacy of superficial hot or cold therapies in reducing pain and disability in low-back pain in adults, aged 18 and older.</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS MODIFIED="2008-06-13 11:58:55 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomised controlled clinical trials (CCTs) comparing superficial hot or cold therapy to placebo, no therapy or to other therapies.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Studies were selected that included participants aged 18 years or over, with the complaint of non-specific low-back pain. Trials that included participants with pathological causes of low-back pain and low-back pain with radiculopathy were excluded. For the purpose of this review, the duration of back pain was defined as acute (less than six weeks), sub-acute (six weeks to 12 weeks) or chronic (longer than 12 weeks), as defined by the Cochrane Back Review Group (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 2003</LINK>).</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Trials were included in which superficial heat or cold therapy was administered to at least one group within the trial. Trials in which co-interventions (eg. exercise) were given were only included if the co-interventions were similar across comparison groups. If co-interventions were given, trials were excluded if we could not isolate the effects of heat or cold from the effects of the other therapies delivered. Trials of spa therapy (balneotherapy) were excluded because that intervention is being assessed by another Cochrane review. At the time of publication of our review, the protocol for the balneotherapy review had only proceeded to the editorial review stage.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>Trials were included that used at least one of the five outcomes considered to be important in low-back pain research: pain (eg. measured by visual analogue scale (VAS)), disability/function (eg. measured by Oswestry, Roland Disability Scale), overall improvement, patient satisfaction and adverse effects. The primary outcomes for this review were pain and physical functional status. Some included trials measured other outcomes, eg. trunk flexibility or skin temperature, however, these results are not included in the analysis because they are out of the scope of this review.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of methodological quality of included studies</HEADING>
<P>The methodologic quality of the included trials was independently assessed by two authors (SF and MC) and checked by a third author (JR). The assessment of methodologic quality was performed according to the methodologic criteria list recommended by the Cochrane Back Review Group (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>), and scored as a "yes (+)", "no (-)" or "don't know (?)" (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). There were 11 criteria relevant to the internal validity of the study, against which each trial was assessed, including selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias and detection bias. The methodological quality assessment of the trials was used to grade the strength of the evidence. Higher quality trials were defined as fulfilling six or more of the 11 methodological quality criteria. Lower quality trials were defined as fulfilling fewer than six criteria.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Included studies</HEADING>
<P>See the table of 'Characteristics of Included Studies' for full details. The median number of participants in each trial was 90 (range 36 to 371). One of the trials included acute low-back pain participants (<LINK REF="STD-Nuhr-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Nuhr 2004</LINK>), four included a mix of acute and sub-acute low-back pain participants (<LINK REF="STD-Mayer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mayer 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nadler-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Nadler 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nadler-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Nadler 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nadler-2003b" TYPE="STUDY">Nadler 2003b</LINK>), three included chronic low-back pain participants (<LINK REF="STD-Melzack-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Melzack 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-St-John-Dixon-1972" TYPE="STUDY">St John Dixon 1972</LINK>) and one had a mix of acute, sub-acute and chronic participants (<LINK REF="STD-Landen-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Landen 1967</LINK>).</P>
<P>The nature of the interventions differed between the trials. Two trials compared hot packs to ice massage (<LINK REF="STD-Landen-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Landen 1967</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 1992</LINK>), one trial compared ice massage to transcutaneous electrical stimulation (<LINK REF="STD-Melzack-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Melzack 1980</LINK>), one trial compared a full body active warming electric blanket to passive warming by way of a woollen blanket (<LINK REF="STD-Nuhr-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Nuhr 2004</LINK>) and one trial compared a wool body belt that provided warmth to a lumbar corset (<LINK REF="STD-St-John-Dixon-1972" TYPE="STUDY">St John Dixon 1972</LINK>).</P>
<P>Four trials assessed the effect of a heated lumbar wrap compared to various interventions. Three of these trials compared the heated wrap to pain relief medication and to a non-heated wrap (<LINK REF="STD-Nadler-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Nadler 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nadler-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Nadler 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nadler-2003b" TYPE="STUDY">Nadler 2003b</LINK>) and one trial compared the heated wrap alone to exercise alone, to heat plus exercise and to an educational booklet (<LINK REF="STD-Mayer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mayer 2005</LINK>). The heat wrap is a disposable product made of layers of cloth-like material that contain heat-generating ingredients (iron, charcoal, table salt and water). These ingredients heat up when exposed to oxygen and provide heat (40 degrees C) for at least eight hours. The heat wrap is applied to the lumbar region of the torso and is secured with a velcro-like closure, thus allowing it to be worn while remaining mobile. It can be worn during the day or night. The single use heat wrap costs approximately US$6.00 to $8.00 for a packet of two.</P>
<P>The outcomes assessed and the timing of outcomes varied. Pain was assessed in all trials, however for only five trials were pain data available for meta-analysis. Three trials only measured pain immediately after the treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Melzack-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Melzack 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nuhr-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Nuhr 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 1992</LINK>), four trials measured pain over four to seven days (<LINK REF="STD-Mayer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mayer 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nadler-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Nadler 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nadler-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Nadler 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nadler-2003b" TYPE="STUDY">Nadler 2003b</LINK>), one trial measured pain at the time of hospital discharge (<LINK REF="STD-Landen-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Landen 1967</LINK>) and one after two weeks (<LINK REF="STD-St-John-Dixon-1972" TYPE="STUDY">St John Dixon 1972</LINK>). A validated disability measure was used in four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Mayer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mayer 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nadler-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Nadler 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nadler-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Nadler 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nadler-2003b" TYPE="STUDY">Nadler 2003b</LINK>). None of the trials assessed overall improvement or participant satisfaction.</P>
<P>Four of the trials declared industry funding (<LINK REF="STD-Mayer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mayer 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nadler-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Nadler 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nadler-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Nadler 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nadler-2003b" TYPE="STUDY">Nadler 2003b</LINK>). The three Nadler trials were all conducted by the same research team and were funded by the manufacturer of the heat wrap device. The authors of each of these trials were either employees or paid consultants of the company that manufactures the heat wrap device. Correspondence from the authors indicated that these three trials are completely separate studies with each of them including different participants.</P>

<P>The included trials were of varying methodological quality (see <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). Applying the criteria of six or more equalling a high quality study, five of the trials were of high quality (range 6 to 8) and four low quality (range 1 to 5). Five of the trials were reported as randomised (<LINK REF="STD-Mayer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mayer 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nadler-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Nadler 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nadler-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Nadler 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nadler-2003b" TYPE="STUDY">Nadler 2003b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nuhr-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Nuhr 2004</LINK>). In the Nadler series of trials, the method of randomisation was not described. One trial was a non-randomised CCT (<LINK REF="STD-Landen-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Landen 1967</LINK>) and three were non-randomised cross-over trials (<LINK REF="STD-Melzack-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Melzack 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-St-John-Dixon-1972" TYPE="STUDY">St John Dixon 1972</LINK>). Washout of the interventions was not considered in any of the cross-over trials. Trial population sizes were generally small (median sample size = 90, range 36 to 371). Five of the trials reported clear inclusion and exclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Mayer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mayer 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nadler-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Nadler 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nadler-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Nadler 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nadler-2003b" TYPE="STUDY">Nadler 2003b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nuhr-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Nuhr 2004</LINK>), two trials reported brief inclusion and exclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Landen-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Landen 1967</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Melzack-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Melzack 1980</LINK>) and two trials did not state exclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Roberts-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-St-John-Dixon-1972" TYPE="STUDY">St John Dixon 1972</LINK>). Allocation concealment was adequate in only one of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Nuhr-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Nuhr 2004</LINK>), and in the remaining trials was either not reported or was inadequate. Blinded outcome assessment was carried out in four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Nadler-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Nadler 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nadler-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Nadler 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nadler-2003b" TYPE="STUDY">Nadler 2003b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nuhr-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Nuhr 2004</LINK>) and was either not done or was unclear in the remaining five trials. Blinding of participants to the interventions of heat or cold was not possible in most cases. Most trials had an acceptable loss to follow-up, however, only three of the trials reported if an intention-to-treat analysis was undertaken (<LINK REF="STD-Nadler-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Nadler 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nadler-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Nadler 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nadler-2003b" TYPE="STUDY">Nadler 2003b</LINK>).</P>

<P>Nine trials involving 1117 participants were included in this review. Only four of these trials had pain data in a form that could be extracted and combined in a meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Mayer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mayer 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nadler-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Nadler 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nadler-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Nadler 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nadler-2003b" TYPE="STUDY">Nadler 2003b</LINK>), and this was only possible after obtaining further data from the authors of the studies. All of these trials examined a heat wrap as the main intervention. One trial had pain data that could be extracted (<LINK REF="STD-Nuhr-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Nuhr 2004</LINK>), however it was absolute pain data as compared to change in pain data used in the other heat wrap trials. The remaining four trials did not present data in a form that could be extracted for meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Landen-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Landen 1967</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Melzack-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Melzack 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-St-John-Dixon-1972" TYPE="STUDY">St John Dixon 1972</LINK>).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 01: Heated wrap versus oral placebo or non-heated wrap</HEADING>
<P>Four higher quality trials assessed a heated wrap or heated blanket versus either an oral placebo tablet, or a non-heated wrap (<LINK REF="STD-Nadler-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Nadler 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nadler-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Nadler 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nadler-2003b" TYPE="STUDY">Nadler 2003b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nuhr-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Nuhr 2004</LINK>) in participants with a mix of acute and sub-acute (less than three months) low-back pain. It was only possible to combine the data from a maximum of two trials.</P>
<P>Pain relief data were extracted from two of the trials with 258 participants that compared a heated wrap to oral placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Nadler-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Nadler 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nadler-2003b" TYPE="STUDY">Nadler 2003b</LINK>). The short-term pain relief was significantly greater for the heated back wrap than for the oral placebo (weighted mean difference (WMD) 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68 to 1.45 scale range zero to five). Pain relief was only measured for up to five days after randomisation. This result indicates an approximate 17% reduction in pain after five days with a heated back wrap compared to oral placebo. Pain data measuring the degree of "unpleasantness" were only available for one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Nadler-2003b" TYPE="STUDY">Nadler 2003b</LINK>) and indicated a significant decrease in the short-term (WMD -13.50, 95%CI -21.27 to -5.73, scale range zero to 100).</P>
<P>Absolute pain data were only available in one trial of 90 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Nuhr-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Nuhr 2004</LINK>). This trial demonstrated a statistically significant benefit of a heated blanket compared to a non-heated blanket immediately after treatment in acute (less than six hours) low-back pain (WMD -32.20, 95%CI -38.69 to -25.71, scale range zero to 100). Pain was only measured immediately after the heat was applied for approximately 25 minutes, and no further follow-up occurred.</P>
<P>Only two trials provided data on disability (<LINK REF="STD-Nadler-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Nadler 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nadler-2003b" TYPE="STUDY">Nadler 2003b</LINK>), measured with the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire. The short-term (four days) reduction in disability was significantly greater for the heated back wrap than for oral placebo (WMD -2.10, 95%CI -3.19 to -1.01, scale range zero to 24).</P>
<P>Adverse effects were minor for the heated back wrap. Two trials provided data on the adverse effect of "skin pinkness" after use of the heated wrap (<LINK REF="STD-Nadler-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Nadler 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nadler-2003b" TYPE="STUDY">Nadler 2003b</LINK>). A total of six out of 128 participants experienced this outcome in the heated back wrap group, compared to one participant out of 130 in the placebo group.</P>

<P>Three higher quality trials compared a heated back wrap to oral ibuprofen (<LINK REF="STD-Nadler-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Nadler 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nadler-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Nadler 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nadler-2003b" TYPE="STUDY">Nadler 2003b</LINK>), and one of these trials also included a comparison group that took oral acetaminophen (<LINK REF="STD-Nadler-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Nadler 2002</LINK>). Unfortunately, none of these trials presented data in a way that could be combined in a meta-analysis. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Nadler-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Nadler 2002</LINK>) found that a heated back wrap provided significantly greater pain relief and improved function than oral ibuprofen and oral acetaminophen after both one day and four days of treatment. The other two Nadler trials did not provide results for this comparison.</P>
<P>One high quality trial of 100 participants compared a heated back wrap alone to exercise alone and to an education booklet (<LINK REF="STD-Mayer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mayer 2005</LINK>). Measured at one and four days after randomisation, the heat wrap provided significantly more pain relief than an educational booklet (Day 2: WMD 0.60, 95%CI 0.05 to 1.15, scale range 0 to 5); Day 4: WMD 1.10, 95%CI 0.55 to 1.65)) but not more than McKenzie exercise (Day 2: WMD 0.40, 95%CI -1.15 to 0.95); Day 4: WMD 0.30, 95%CI -0.41 to 1.01)). At seven days after randomisation, there were no significant differences in pain relief between the groups. The heat wrap provided significantly improved function compared to an educational booklet at Day 2 (WMD -1.40, 95%CI -2.79 to -0.01, scale range 0 to 24) and Day 4 (WMD -2.30, 95%CI -4.24 to -0.36)) but not at Day 7 (WMD -1.70, 95%CI -3.92 to 0.52)). There was no significant difference in function between heat wrap and McKenzie exercise at either Day 2, Day 4 or Day 7.</P>
<P>One lower quality non-randomised cross-over trial compared a wool body belt providing warmth to a lumbar corset in chronic low-back pain participants (<LINK REF="STD-St-John-Dixon-1972" TYPE="STUDY">St John Dixon 1972</LINK>). No pain results were provided.</P>

Heat wrap plus exercise provided significantly more pain relief than an educational booklet at Day 4 (WMD 1.60, 95%CI 0.89 to 2.31, scale range 0 to 5) and Day 7 (WMD 2.00, 95%CI 1.29 to 2.71)), and also for function (Roland Morris) (Day 4: WMD -2.60, 95%CI -4.54 to -0.66); Day 7: WMD -4.40, 95%CI -6.62 to -2.18)). Heat wrap plus exercise also provided significantly more pain relief and improvement in function than either heat or exercise alone at Day 7.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Only a few studies have been published evaluating the effects of superficial heat or cold for low-back pain. We found nine trials involving 1117 participants that were suitable for inclusion in this review. Of these, six trials examined heat compared to no heat or other interventions, one compared cold to another intervention and two trials compared heat to cold. The included trials were very heterogeneous in terms of interventions used, control treatments, outcome measures, timing of follow-up and presentation of data. Therefore, it was not possible to perform any meaningful meta-analyses, and it was difficult to reach firm conclusions for most types of treatments.</P>
<P>According to the qualitative criteria for levels of evidence, for a mixed population with acute and sub-acute low-back pain, there is moderate evidence that a heated wrap applied for eight hours, or an electric blanket applied for 25 minutes, are both better than no heat for pain in the short-term (four days). There is moderate evidence (one small high quality RCT) that heat wrap is better for pain and function than an educational booklet during the early stages of treatment (days two to four), but not after seven days. There is moderate evidence that combining heat wrap with McKenzie exercises is better for pain relief and function after seven days than an educational booklet and either heat wrap or exercise alone. The effect of these treatments was small. If the short-term beneficial effects of this therapy can be verified in further high quality trials, then its use would be valuable.</P>
<P>There is empirical data that indicate that industry-funded studies are more likely to be positive than non-funded studies (<LINK REF="REF-Bhandari-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhandari 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Djulbegovic-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Djulbegovic 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2002</LINK>). The results of the Nadler series of studies and the Mayer study of heat wrap therapy should be considered with this in mind, and independent studies would be useful to verify their results. Also, considering the cost of the disposable heat wraps, it would be useful to include a cost-effectiveness analysis in future trials.</P>
<P>No randomised controlled trials were located that examined the effects of cold for low-back pain. Given that this it is a commonly held belief that cold is beneficial for recent onset musculoskeletal injuries (<LINK REF="REF-Bleakley-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bleakley 2004</LINK>), it was surprising that no studies were located that applied cold treatment to acute low-back pain. In fact, in the trials conducted with participants with acute and sub-acute low-back pain, heat was applied. The trials that were located for cold treatment used cold for chronic low-back pain and were of poor methodological quality. No conclusions can be drawn for the use of cold treatment in low-back pain.</P>
<P>There is conflicting evidence when comparing heat treatment to cold treatment. Two low quality non-randomised trials of chronic low-back pain participants were located. One concluded that hot packs and cold packs were equally effective and the other concluded that ice massage was better than either hot packs or cold packs.</P>
<P>There were no major adverse events reported in any of the trials. Some minor events were reported with the heat wrap therapy, in the form of "skin pinkness" that resolved quickly.</P>
<P>There are methodological challenges when conducting high quality trials into these therapies. For example, it is questionable whether or not participants can be blinded to these interventions. The Nadler series of studies and the Nuhr study attempted to blind participants by including a non-heated wrap or blanket and an oral placebo group, however the investigators did not measure whether participants could determine if they were receiving an active therapy or not. Also, outcome assessors should be blinded to the allocation of the participants to at least improve the quality of this aspect of the trials. It is recommended that these methodological issues are considered in future trials.</P>
<P>Heat and cold are modalities that are commonly used in practice in conjunction with other interventions, especially in the physical therapy professions. We only found one small study that evaluated the use of heat combined with exercise, and we found no study that examined cold in this context. Thus, no conclusions can be drawn regarding the use of heat or cold in combination with other therapies, other than in combination with exercise.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-06-13 09:25:40 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Heat and cold are commonly recommended by clinicians for low-back pain. The evidence base to support this common practice is not strong. There is moderate evidence that continuous heat wrap therapy reduces pain and disability in the short term, in a mixed population with acute and sub-acute low back pain (up to three months), and that the addition of exercise to heat wrap therapy further reduces pain and improves function. This evidence is limited to a small number of trials using a relatively small number of participants, and the size of the effect is small. The application of cold treatment to low-back pain is even more limited, with only three poor quality studies located. No conclusions can be drawn about the use of cold for low-back pain. There is conflicting evidence to determine the differences between heat and cold for low-back pain.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Many of the studies were of poor methodological quality and there certainly is a need for future higher-quality RCTs. Also, many trials were poorly reported, and we recommend that authors use the CONSORT statement as a model for reporting RCTs (www.consort-statement.org). The results of the majority of the studies could not be pooled with other studies because of the way the authors reported the results. Therefore, we suggest that the publications of future trials report, for continuous measures, means with standard deviations or means with standard error of means, and for dichotomous measures, number of events and total participants analysed.</P>
<P>Future research should focus on areas where there are few or no trials, for example, simple heat applications like hot water bottles, ice massage versus no cold and heat versus cold treatment, and trials in chronic low-back pain participants. The classification of duration of low-back pain was not consistent in the different studies, and in the future, authors should be clear on the definition of acute, sub-acute and chronic low-back pain, and report the duration of pain in their results. Future studies should be adequately powered and have both a short-term follow-up (for acute pain) and a long-term follow-up (for chronic pain).</P>
