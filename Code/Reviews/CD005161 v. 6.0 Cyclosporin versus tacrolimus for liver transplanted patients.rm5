<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-17 14:50:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>Almost every liver transplant recipient takes either cyclosporin or tacrolimus to prevent rejection of the graft. This is a review of the clinical trials that compared patients initially prescribed one of the two anti-rejection drugs after liver transplantation. Sixteen trials (3813 participants) were included. The review shows that tacrolimus is marginally better than cyclosporin at preventing patient death and graft loss. Tacrolimus is substantially better than cyclosporin at preventing rejection. No differences were seen between the drugs with respect to adverse events (renal failure, lymphoproliferative disorder) except for diabetes mellitus, which was more common with tacrolimus. After liver transplantation more patients stayed on tacrolimus than on cyclosporin. Tacrolimus is more beneficial than cyclosporine and should be considered the treatment of choice after liver transplantation. This review does not evaluate the benefit or harm of switching from one anti-rejection drug to another.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Most liver transplant recipients receive either cyclosporin or tacrolimus to prevent rejection. Both drugs inhibit calcineurin phosphatase which is thought to be the mechanism of their anti-rejection effect and principle toxicities. The drugs have different pharmacokinetic profiles and potencies. Several randomised clinical trials have compared cyclosporin and tacrolimus in liver transplant recipients, but it remains unclear which is superior. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate the beneficial and harmful effects of immunosuppression with cyclosporin versus tacrolimus for liver transplanted patients. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>
<I>The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register</I>, the<I> Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials</I> in <I>The Cochrane Library</I>,<I> MEDLINE</I>, <I>EMBASE,</I> and <I>Science Citation Index Expanded</I>, and conference proceedings were searched (August 2005) to identify relevant randomised clinical trials. Our search included scanning of reference lists in relevant articles and correspondence with investigators and pharmaceutical companies. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All randomised clinical trials where tacrolimus was compared with cyclosporin for the initial treatment of first-time liver transplant recipients. We included randomised trials irrespective of blinding, language, and publication status.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>The primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality. Data were synthesised (fixed-effect model) and results expressed as relative risk (RR), values less than 1.0 favouring tacrolimus, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Two authors assessed trials for eligibility, quality, and extracted data independently. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>We included 16 randomised trials. The number of deaths was 254 in the tacrolimus group (1899 patients) and 302 in the cyclosporin group (1914 patients). At one year, mortality (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.99) and graft loss (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.86) were significantly reduced in tacrolimus-treated recipients. Tacrolimus reduced the number of recipients with acute rejection (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.88), and steroid-resistant rejection (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.74) in the first year. Differences were not seen with respect to lymphoproliferative disorder or de-novo dialysis rates, but more de-novo insulin-requiring diabetes mellitus (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.86) occurred in the tacrolimus group. More patients were withdrawn from cyclosporin therapy than from tacrolimus (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.66).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Tacrolimus is superior to cyclosporin in improving survival (patient and graft) and preventing acute rejection after liver transplantation, but it increases the risk of post-transplant diabetes. Treating 100 recipients with tacrolimus instead of cyclosporin would avoid acute rejection and steroid-resistant rejection in nine and seven patients, respectively, and graft loss and death in five and two patients, respectively, but four additional patients would develop diabetes after liver transplantation.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-17 14:48:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Cyclosporin was introduced as primary immunosuppressant after liver transplantation instead of azathioprine over 20 years ago without testing in randomised clinical trials because of perceived transparent benefit (<LINK REF="REF-Starzl-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Starzl 1985</LINK>). About 10 years ago, the first randomised clinical trials of immunosuppression after liver transplantation compared tacrolimus versus cyclosporin. Two large registration trials showed a reduction in the rate of acute rejection with tacrolimus, but reductions in post-transplantation mortality and graft loss were not statistically significant (<LINK REF="STD-European-Study-1994" TYPE="STUDY">European Study 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-U.-S.-Study-1994" TYPE="STUDY">U. S. Study 1994</LINK>). Subsequently both tacrolimus and cyclosporin were found to have a common mechanism of action (ie, inhibition of calcineurin phosphatase) even though they bound different intra-cellular proteins. These intra-cellular proteins belong to the immunophilin family. Cyclosporin binds cyclophilin and tacrolimus binds FKBP12 (<LINK REF="REF-Siekierka-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siekierka 1992</LINK>). The role of immunophilin binding in the mechanism of toxicity is not clear, but it may allow for a different side effect profile of these drugs, which are now known as calcineurin inhibitors. For instance, cyclosporin is known to cause hirsuitism whereas tacrolimus either has no effect or causes hair loss. Therefore, cyclosporin and tacrolimus may have different benefit and harm profiles, but to date randomised clinical trials have not shown statistically significant differences in major outcomes after liver transplantation. A systematic review of cyclosporin versus tacrolimus for kidney transplanted patients has been conducted (<LINK REF="REF-Knoll-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knoll 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Webster-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Webster 2005</LINK>), but we have not identified previous meta-analyses or systematic reviews for liver transplanted patients (<LINK REF="REF-Knoll-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knoll 1999</LINK>).</P>

<P>S Klingenberg, the Trials Search Coordinator, performed electronic searches using search strategies as revised by the authors. E Haddad and V McAlister evaluated whether these trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The search results and selections were monitored by all authors.</P>
<P>
<I>The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register</I> (August 2005), the<I> Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials </I>(<I>CENTRAL</I>) in <I>The Cochrane Library </I>(Issue 3, 2005), <I>MEDLINE </I>(1950 to August 2005), <I>EMBASE </I>(1980 to August 2005), and <I>Science Citation Index Exapanded</I> (1945 to August 2005) (<LINK REF="REF-Royle-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Royle 2003</LINK>)<I> </I>were searched using the strategies as described in <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>. E Renouf scanned bibliographies in relevant articles and conference proceedings (Transplantation Society biannual meetings 1988 to 2004; International Liver Transplantation Society Congress 1995 to 2004). V McAlister wrote to authors of included trials and pharmaceutical companies that are involved in the production of tacrolimus or cyclosporin.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-10-17 14:48:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>The present review was performed following the recommendations of The Cochrane Collaboration (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>). Identified trials were listed and their fulfilment of the inclusion criteria assessed by V McAlister. Excluded trials were listed with the reason for exclusion.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Data extraction </B>
<BR/>E Haddad and V McAlister independently extracted data using standardised extraction forms. E Renouf prepared copies of the reports that were blinded with regard to place of publication, authors, and their affiliation for the primary data extraction process. Data extraction results were monitored by all authors. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. V McAlister wrote to investigators and to the sponsoring companies of included trials to ask for data that were not presented in the published reports.</P>
<P>From each trial, we extracted the following characteristics of the included:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Patients (inclusions and exclusion criteria, mean age, proportion of men, aetiology of liver disease, creatinine pre-op and at one year;</LI>
<LI>Interventions (dose and duration, concomitant therapy, maintenance drug dose, maintenance drug level);</LI>
<LI>Trials (setting, methodological quality, publication status, duration of follow-up, and all outcomes).</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<B>Methodological quality </B>
<BR/>Randomisation and follow-up were extracted as measures of methodological quality (<LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>) using the definitions listed below.<BR/>
<I>
<BR/>
<B>Generation of the allocation sequence</B>
</I>
<BR/>This is the procedure used to create a random sequence ensuring that each patient has a known, unpredictable, and usually equal chance of being assigned to intervention groups. The allocation sequence generation was classified as adequate (if the allocation sequence was generated by a computer or random number table), unclear (if the trial was described as randomised, but the method used for the allocation sequence generation was not described), or inadequate (if a system involving dates, names, or admittance numbers were used).</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Allocation concealment </I>
</B>
<BR/>This is the procedure used to conceal the allocation sequence from the investigators who assign patients to the intervention groups. The allocation concealment was classified as adequate (if the allocation of patients involved a central independent unit, sealed envelopes, on-site locked computer, or identically appearing numbered drug bottles or containers prepared by an independent pharmacist), unclear (if the trial was described as randomised, but the method used to conceal the allocation was not described), or inadequate (if the trial was quasi-randomised).</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Blinding</I>
</B>
<BR/>Considering the nature of the intervention, we expected that none of the eligible trials will be double blind. Blinding was therefore not included in our assessment of methodological quality.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Follow -up</I>
</B>
<BR/>We extracted the number and reasons for all losses to follow-up to assess the risk of attrition bias.</P>
<P>
<B>Statistical analyses</B>
<BR/>The analyses were performed in RevMan Analysis 1.0 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>) and Stata version 6.0 for Windows. The number of events and number of patients in all intervention arms were used to calculate relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Risk differences with 95% CI were also analysed and tabulated for outcome differences. Continuous outcomes were presented as weighted mean differences (WMD) with 95% CI. Because we expected considerable homogeneity, data were combined in fixed-effect meta-analyses. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed as sensitivity analyses, but were only to be reported if the results differ significantly from the fixed-effect models. Intention-to-treat analyses including all patients irrespective of compliance or follow-up was performed. Carry forward of the last observed response was used for patients with missing data. For the primary outcome measure, evidence of publication bias and other biases was evaluated in regression analyses of funnel plot asymmetry. Sources of heterogeneity were evaluated through sensitivity, subgroup, and meta-regression analyses. The analyses included the extracted patient, intervention, and trial characteristics listed above as explanatory variables. V McAlister performed all meta-analyses in RevMan. LL Gluud performed additional blinded statistical analyses including meta-regression and regression analyses of funnel plot asymmetry. The following subgroup analyses were carried out: paediatric recipients; patients infected with hepatitis C virus at the time of transplantation; trials using oil-based cyclosporine; trials where cyclosporine was combined with azathioprine; trials where tacrolimus and cyclosporine are combined with mycophenolate mofetil or sirolimus. Sensitivity analyses that combine outcomes from trials where follow-up data for one year were not available, even after correspondence with the principle investigator, were performed using a time point closest to one year (either less or more) that was available.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>Searches performed on August 30, 2005 resulted in 717 hits. This yielded 114 reports when duplicates were removed. After initial review, 20 randomised trials were identified of which four were excluded on further examination because they were a review of other studies (<LINK REF="STD-Arnold-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Arnold 1995</LINK>), a sub-analysis of another study (<LINK REF="STD-Loinaz-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Loinaz 2001</LINK>), or designed for other purposes, usually regarding perioperative care, without any of the outcomes being studied for inclusion in this systematic review (<LINK REF="STD-Ericzon-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ericzon 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trull-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Trull 2002</LINK>).

<B>Included trials</B>
<BR/>The 16 included trials allocated 3813 participants of whom 1899 were randomised to tacrolimus and 1914 to cyclosporin. Seven of the trials were conducted at single centre sites (<LINK REF="STD-Fung-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Fung 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stegall-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Stegall 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fisher-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fisher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zervos-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Zervos 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klupp-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Klupp 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rolles-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rolles 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Therapondos-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Therapondos 2002</LINK>), while the remaining nine trials were multi-centred. In all, the trials involved 59 liver transplantation centres in 18 countries. Most of the randomised trials restricted enrolment to adults, but one included children (<LINK REF="STD-U.-S.-Study-1994" TYPE="STUDY">U. S. Study 1994</LINK>) and one was restricted to children (<LINK REF="STD-Kelly-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kelly 2004</LINK>). Hepatitis C virus (HCV) cirrhosis was the commonest indication for transplantation in studies after 1994; two randomised trials confined entry to patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) (<LINK REF="STD-Zervos-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Zervos 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 2004</LINK>); only one other trial identified the outcome in patients with HCV (<LINK REF="STD-Grazi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Grazi 2004</LINK>). The three earliest trials with 1157 participants compared tacrolimus with the original oil based formulation of cyclosporin (Sandimmun®) (<LINK REF="STD-Fung-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Fung 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-European-Study-1994" TYPE="STUDY">European Study 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-U.-S.-Study-1994" TYPE="STUDY">U. S. Study 1994</LINK>) whereas the other 15 trials with 1656 participants compared tacrolimus with the microemulsion formulation (Neoral®). Concomitant immunosuppression given to all patients (both study groups, all participating centres) included corticosteroids (all trials except <LINK REF="STD-Rolles-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rolles 1999</LINK>); azathioprine (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Grady-2002" TYPE="STUDY">O'Grady 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Therapondos-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Therapondos 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greig-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Greig 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 2004</LINK>), and mycophenolate mofetil (<LINK REF="STD-Stegall-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Stegall 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fisher-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fisher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klupp-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Klupp 1999</LINK>). In one multi-centred trial, azathioprine was given only in some centres but to both study groups (<LINK REF="STD-Grazi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Grazi 2004</LINK>). In five trials, azathioprine was given only to cyclosporin treated patients according to local practice (<LINK REF="STD-European-Study-1994" TYPE="STUDY">European Study 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-U.-S.-Study-1994" TYPE="STUDY">U.

All of the trials used trough level monitoring to guide cyclosporin and tacrolimus dosing except one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Grazi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Grazi 2004</LINK>), which used the two hour post-dose level to guide the dose of cyclosporin. </P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>Allocation concealment was adequate in most trials. The method of allocation concealment was not specified in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Stegall-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Stegall 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zervos-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Zervos 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rolles-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rolles 1999</LINK>). All of the trials were open labelled because of the need for therapeutic drug monitoring. Intention-to-treat analysis was available in all the trials. Follow-up data were complete for patient and graft survival (primary outcome) and for rejection, but reduced in all other categories. In one trial graft survival was only reported at six months, but all other data were available at 12 months after transplantation (<LINK REF="STD-Grazi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Grazi 2004</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2008-10-17 14:48:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>The primary outcome favoured tacrolimus. Mortality at one year was reduced by 15% in the tacrolimus patients (comparison 01.01: RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.99). Graft survival was reported in 15 trials favouring tacrolimus with 22% less grafts lost (comparison 01.02: RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.89). Rejection and steroid resistant rejection were reduced by 18% and 43%, respectively, in the tacrolimus treated recipients (comparison 01.03: RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.88; comparison 01.04: RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.71). These results are from intention-to-treat analyses. Substantially more patients discontinued cyclosporin than tacrolimus (comparison 01.10: RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.74). However, the rate of new-onset diabetes was increased by 27% in the tacrolimus-treated patients (comparison 01.08: RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.44).</P>
<P>No differences were seen in the rates of chronic renal failure requiring dialysis ((comparison 01.05: RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.64 to 3.78) or of lymphoproliferative disorder after liver transplantation (comparison 01.09: RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.36 to 2.86). Differences in the serum creatinine at one year favouring tacrolimus were not statistically significant, but data were available from only two trials with a total of 672 patients (comparison 01.07: RR, -2.67 mmol/L, 95% CI -9.55 to 4.22). Insufficient data were reported regarding other adverse events for systematic analysis, but the data are included in the characteristics of included trials table. </P>
<P>The number of deaths was 254 in the tacrolimus group (1899 patients) and 302 in the cyclosporin group (1914 patients). The actual number of patients and events are presented in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> with the absolute risk differences and 95% CI. Treating 100 recipients with tacrolimus instead of cyclosporin would avoid rejection and steroid-resistant rejection in nine and seven patients, respectively, and graft loss and death in five and two patients, respectively, but four additional patients would develop diabetes after liver transplantation.</P>
<P>Regression asymmetry tests showed no significant evidence of publication bias or other biases (P = 0.33). In meta-regression analyses the treatment effect was not significantly associated with the allocation sequence generation (regression coefficient -0.022, 95% CI -0.57 to 0.52) or allocation concealment (regression coefficient -0.17, 95% CI -0.48 to 0.15). Identical results for the primary outcome were found whether fixed-effect or random-effects meta-analyses were used because the studies lack heterogeneity, I<I>
<SUP>2</SUP>
</I> = 0%. Random-effects meta-analyses did not change the other outcomes. </P>
<P>Stratified analyses showed that the heterogeneity of the trials and the outcomes were not altered by inclusion of the following subgroups: (1) oil-based cyclosporin (comparison 02) <U>(</U>

Separate analyses of these subgroups showed similar results to the rest of the trials except that some subgroups were of insufficient size for the differences to be statistically significant. Stratified analysis of trials confined to patients with HCV (<LINK REF="STD-Zervos-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Zervos 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 2004</LINK>) did not alter the result when combined with the other trials, all of which included patients with HCV and other diagnoses (comparison 05). Stratified analysis of the different protocols of concomitant immunosuppression with azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil also showed similar results in each subgroup, but the sample sizes were much reduced by the stratification (comparison 06). Reporting of actual doses and levels of drug used was too sparse to permit more detailed analysis, and the results are given in the characteristics table of each trial. Similarly, other adverse events, which were not reported regularly enough for comparison, are reported in the characteristics table of each trial.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-10-17 14:48:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>Cyclosporin was introduced, without the benefit of clinical trial, into care of the recipient after liver transplantation. Even at the time that tacrolimus was developed, considerable hesitancy remained regarding the robustness of liver transplantation to allow for randomisation. This concern is apparent in a description of the earliest randomised trial in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Fung-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Fung 1991</LINK>) and in a discussion of the two registration randomised clinical trials of tacrolimus (<LINK REF="REF-Starzl-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Starzl 1995</LINK>). In the succeeding decade, a further 13 randomised clinical trials of tacrolimus versus cyclosporin in liver transplantation were performed indicating increasing comfort with the procedure. This systematic review shows why this occurred. Outcomes after liver transplantation are very good. Overall patient and graft survival rates are 85% and 80%, respectively.</P>
<P>The superiority of tacrolimus over cyclosporin after liver transplantation has to be considered in the context of these excellent overall results. Calculating the risk difference of each treatment helps us understand its impact. Treating 100 liver recipients with tacrolimus instead of cyclosporin would result in two less deaths, five less graft losses, nine less patients with acute rejection, and seven less with steroid-resistant rejection, but four more patients would develop diabetes. The ranges suggested by 95% CI for these risk differences are included in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. </P>
<P>More heterogeneity between the trials is seen in rejection than in other outcomes. One source of heterogeneity here may be the variable rates of rejection observed in each trial. This is probably due to the evolution of rejection diagnosis over time. Definition of rejection was standardised within trials, but not between trials. The rate of diagnosis of rejection appears to be lower in more recent trials than in earlier ones, even though the immunosuppressive protocols are similar. This might be due to improved differential diagnostic ability and a reduced liver biopsy rate, but these features are beyond the scope of this review. There was no evidence that different criteria were applied to recipients of either tacrolimus or cyclosporin in the trials. Despite the heterogeneity, a consistent finding in each trial was a clinically and statistically significantly lower rate of rejection in liver transplant recipients randomised to tacrolimus.</P>
<P>Relatively few trials excluded adjuvant immunosuppression with either azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil. Several trials permitted use of azathioprine in cyclosporin, but not tacrolimus treated patients at centres where this was the normal practice. One trial permitted this use of azathioprine at certain centres only if it were also prescribed to tacrolimus recipients. More recently trials of concomitant mycophenolate mofetil given to both groups have been performed. Stratification of the analyses according to the different forms of adjuvant immunosuppression reduced the sample size so that conclusions cannot be drawn with respect to mortality, but most of the other comparisons did not show any impact of adjuvant immunosuppression on the differences reported above between cyclosporin and tacrolimus. </P>
<P>The outcomes studied are reported on the basis of intention to treat. Cyclosporin discontinuation does not ameliorate the disadvantage associated with that group. The benefit of switching from cyclosporin to tacrolimus or vice versa cannot be evaluated from these trials. This review looked at outcomes one year after transplantation. The impact of diabetes may not be manifest for many years. The risk of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder persists beyond one year, so that outcomes for the groups with respect to that comparison may change. Similarly the risk of calcineurin inhibitor related nephrotoxicity may increase with time. The results of this review must be considered in the context of possible long-term outcomes.</P>
<P>The involvement of the majority of transplant centres throughout the world in the randomised trials reviewed combined with the lack of heterogeneity of the trials support the veracity of this review. Very similar results with respect to graft survival, rejection, and diabetes were achieved by a recent Cochrane review of tacrolimus and cyclosporin in kidney transplantation (<LINK REF="REF-Webster-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Webster 2005</LINK>). Both cyclosporin and tacrolimus are immunosuppressive because they inhibit calcineurin phosphatase in lymphocytes. Inhibition of the same pathway in the beta-cells of the pancreas reduces insulin production. The superior effect of tacrolimus in the prevention of rejection was accompanied by an increase in the rate of diabetes in this review and in the kidney transplantation meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Webster-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Webster 2005</LINK>). The difference between cyclosporin and tacrolimus may, therefore, be related to the potency of calcineurin phosphatase inhibition. Insufficient data regarding exposure to cyclosporin or tacrolimus were reported to know if the outcomes would merge with particular dosing protocols. The higher rate of cyclosporin discontinuation seen consistently throughout the reviews suggests that clinicians find it more difficult to achieve the balance between efficacy and unwanted effects with that medication than with tacrolimus. Differences between cyclosporin or tacrolimus in pharmacokinetic profiles or in secondary adverse events may account for this difficulty. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Tacrolimus is superior to cyclosporin in patients after liver transplantation. Liver transplant recipients on tacrolimus need careful monitoring for the development of diabetes.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>More research with cyclosporin and tacrolimus is required to disassociate the unwanted effects of calcineurin inhibition from the intended immunosuppressive effect. These investigations may exploit the different pharmacokinetic profiles, different drug interactions, and different adverse effect profiles of cyclosporin and tacrolimus to maintain maximum patient and graft survival with minimum adverse events.</P>
