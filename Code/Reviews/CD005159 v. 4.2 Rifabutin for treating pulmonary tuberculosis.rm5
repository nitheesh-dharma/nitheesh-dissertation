<TITLE>Rifabutin for treating pulmonary tuberculosis</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-11-06 14:04:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne-Marie Stephani">
<P>Among current challenges in tuberculosis treatment are reducing the length of time that drugs must be taken to less than six months and finding ways to safely combine tuberculosis drugs with those used in the treatment of HIV infection. Rifabutin is a drug that has the potential to address these issues if substituted for rifampicin, a mainstay of current treatment. This review identified five trials involving 924 people, but none were of high quality. The review found no significant differences between rifabutin- and rifampicin-containing treatment in curing tuberculosis and preventing relapse, but higher doses of rifabutin might be associated with more adverse effects and there was no evidence that it could shorten treatment. However, very few people with HIV and tuberculosis, who are most likely to benefit from use of rifabutin due to its lack of interaction with antiretroviral drugs, were included in the trials. Better quality clinical trials are needed to understand the place of rifabutin in the treatment of people with tuberculosis, particularly those who also have HIV.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2009-11-10 16:27:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne-Marie Stephani">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Rifamycins are an essential component of modern short-course regimens for treating tuberculosis. Rifabutin has favourable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties and is less prone to drug&#8722;drug interactions than rifampicin. It could contribute to shortening of therapy or simplify treatment in HIV-positive people who also need antiretroviral drugs.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To compare combination drug regimens containing rifabutin with those containing rifampicin for treating pulmonary tuberculosis</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2009-11-10 16:27:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne-Marie Stephani">
<P>We searched Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register (July 2009), CENTRAL (<I>The Cochrane Library 2009, </I>Issue 3), MEDLINE (1966 to July 2009), EMBASE (1974 to July 2009), and LILACS (1982 to July 2009). We also searched the Indian Journal of Tuberculosis (1983 to 2006), conference abstracts, reference lists, and unpublished data on file at Pfizer Inc.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomized and quasi-randomized trials including participants with sputum smear and/or culture-confirmed tuberculosis that compared a rifabutin-containing with an otherwise identical rifampicin-containing regimen.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors independently assessed study eligibility and methodological quality, and extracted data. Dichotomous data were analysed and combined using relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a fixed-effect model. Subgroup analyses were carried out according to rifabutin dose.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Five trials with a total of 924 participants met the inclusion criteria; 5% of participants were HIV positive. Only one small trial was methodologically adequate. The two largest trials (818 participants) had unclear allocation concealment and included &lt; 90% of randomized participants in the analysis. There was no statistically significant difference in between the regimens for cure (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.04; 553 participants, 2 trials) or relapse (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.45 to 3.35; 448 participants, 2 trials). The number of adverse events was not significantly different (RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.88 to 2.31; 714 participants, 3 trials), though the RR increased with rifabutin dose: 150 mg (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.45 to 2.12; 264 participants, 2 trials); and 300 mg (RR 1.78, 95% CI 0.94 to 3.34; 450 participants, 2 trials). However, lack of dose adjustment by weight in the relevant trials complicates interpretation of this relationship.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The replacement of rifampicin by rifabutin for first-line treatment of tuberculosis is not supported by the current evidence. HIV-positive people with tuberculosis, the group most likely to benefit from the rifabutin use, are under-represented in trials to date, and further trials in this group would be useful.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-11-09 13:45:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>About a third of the world's population is infected with <I>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</I>. Tuberculosis remains one of the biggest killers among infectious diseases, with up to three million people dying from tuberculosis each year (<LINK REF="REF-Dye-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dye 1999</LINK>). Diagnosis of tuberculosis generally relies on smear microscopy and culture of the sputum. The disease typically results in progressively destructive lung lesions but may affect almost any part of the body, usually with advanced wasting and death in more than half of cases in the absence of intervention. Despite the availability of increasingly effective treatment since the middle of the twentieth century the global burden of tuberculosis has continued to grow. This is partly because it is the commonest opportunistic infection in HIV-infected individuals and partly due to the practicalities of organizing complicated and prolonged treatment, with drug resistance often the price of failure (<LINK REF="REF-Dye-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dye 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>The discovery of effective antituberculous agents such as streptomycin, isoniazid, and para-aminosalicylic acid in the 1940s and early 1950s and their use in combination regimens to prevent drug resistance mutations arising in <I>M. tuberculosis</I> transformed the lives of tuberculosis sufferers. The introduction of the rifamycin class of antibiotics in the 1960s again revolutionized the treatment of tuberculosis and, as a component of a three- or four-drug regimen also including isoniazid and pyrazinamide, it was a crucial factor in reducing the duration of treatment from up to 18 to six months, raising rates of cure at six months to more than 90%, and reducing relapse to less than 5% (<LINK REF="REF-Fox-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fox 2001</LINK>). Rifampicin, the first clinically useful rifamycin, has remained a central component of therapy. Its principal action appears to be in the later 'sterilizing' phase of treatment, and its postulated activity against semi-dormant organisms, which may form a significant component of the pool of persisting bacilli (<LINK REF="REF-Dickinson-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickinson 1981</LINK>), is probably the explanation for its efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-Mitchison-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitchison 1992</LINK>). The favourable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of rifamycins have also enabled treatment to be safely given as infrequently as twice a week rather than daily, helping to improve adherence to treatment in difficult situations. However, current regimens still require people to adhere to six months of treatment to reduce relapse rates to an acceptable level and new approaches to treatment clearly need to focus on improving the 'sterilizing' activity of the regimen (<LINK REF="REF-Gelband-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gelband 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>New rifamycin derivatives with different properties have been synthesized, the first of which to reach clinical trials was rifabutin, a spiropiperidyl derivative of the parent compound rifamycin S (<LINK REF="REF-Marsili-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marsili 1981</LINK>). This drug was initially released on a compassionate basis in 1983 for the treatment of disseminated <I>Mycobacterium avium intracellulare</I> infection in patients with AIDS (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 1987</LINK>). This initial experience suggested that it had good tolerability and safety, with the most prominent, and unusual, adverse effect being uveitis. At lower doses rifabutin also seemed to offer significant potential advantages over rifampicin for the treatment of <I>M. tuberculosis</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Kunin-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kunin 1996</LINK>). Several in vitro properties of rifabutin point to enhanced 'sterilizing' activity. Though the ratio of peak plasma concentration in humans to minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) in the laboratory (Cmax/MIC) for rifabutin (7.5) is lower than that for rifampicin (67), it is less protein-bound (71% vs 85%), and is more strongly accumulated by cells (ratio of intracellular to extracellular concentrations 9 vs 5). Rifabutin is much more fat soluble than rifampicin resulting in a much larger volume of distribution (9.3 L/kg vs 1 L/kg) and higher tissue/plasma concentration ratios. It also has several theoretical pharmacokinetic advantages that include minimal induction of CYP3A4/5, its principal metabolizing enzyme in the liver, and absorption that is typically unaffected by food (<LINK REF="REF-Burman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burman 2001</LINK>). The in vitro MIC of <I>M. tuberculosis</I> is lower for rifabutin (&lt; 0.06 mg/mL) than for rifampicin (0.15 mg/mL) (<LINK REF="REF-Heifets-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heifets 1988</LINK>). Furthermore, rifabutin may retain its activity against isolates resistant to rifampicin in 10% to 30% of cases, possibly due to differences in affinity for mycobacterial RNA polymerase or additional inhibition of DNA biosynthesis (<LINK REF="REF-Ungheri-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ungheri 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cavusoglu-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cavusoglu 2004</LINK>). Studies of pharmacodynamics in a mouse model supported these pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data and suggested that <I>M. tuberculosis</I> infection was eradicated approximately twice as quickly with rifabutin as with rifampicin (<LINK REF="REF-Ji-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ji 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>This evidence from animal models or studies of relevant pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties in humans suggests that rifabutin may have the capability of accelerating the sterilization phase of treatment that could result in shorter treatment regimens for tuberculosis. Are these potential advantages of rifabutin realized in clinical research? In the treatment of human tuberculosis the drug has been used in three clinical situations: previously untreated disease; multidrug-resistant disease (<LINK REF="REF-Grassi-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grassi 1996</LINK>); and in HIV-associated tuberculosis where drug interactions between non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and particularly protease inhibitors and rifampicin have been a problem (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2000</LINK>). This review summarizes and evaluates the existing evidence from clinical trials comparing rifampicin- with rifabutin-containing regimens in these three situations.</P>

For each outcome, the number of participants randomized and the number analysed in each treatment arm were extracted to allow assessment of loss to follow up. For dichotomous outcomes at fixed time points (sputum smear/culture status at two, three, and six months), we extracted the number of participants experiencing the event and the number assessed in each arm (negative/positive/lost to follow up). Relapse data were also expressed as proportions at the end of follow up since no other measures were made available in the trial reports. Time-to-event outcome measures were intended to be summarized only by extracting median times to or hazard ratios for smear or culture negativity where available. For most of the included trials these details were not reported, with only quoted P-values from Cox modelling or the log-rank test, and we were unable to obtain either the results of further unpublished analyses or individual patient data from the trial authors.</P>

<P>GD analysed the data using <LINK REF="REF-Review-Manager-4.2" TYPE="REFERENCE">Review Manager 4.2</LINK>. The primary outcome and most of the secondary outcomes were analysed as a comparison of proportions using risk ratio (RR) as a measure of effect and presented with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Intention-to-treat analyses on an available-case basis were possible and are presented for all of these outcomes. Best-case and worst-case analyses were also carried out for the relapse outcomes due to the differing quality of follow up between the two largest included trials; they are referred to only in the text. Heterogeneity amongst the included trials was sought by inspection of the forest plot and by formal testing using both the chi-squared<SUP> </SUP>statistic with a significance level of 5% and the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic with a threshold of 50% representing a moderate level of heterogeneity. Funnel plots were constructed to look for evidence of publication bias. We combined the data using a fixed-effect model; we would have used the random-effects model had there been significant heterogeneity and it was still appropriate to combine trials. We carried out subgroup analyses according to the dose size of rifabutin used in the trials. One of the included trials, <LINK REF="STD-Gonzalez-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Gonzalez 1994</LINK>, used an allocation ratio of 1:1:1, so for the purposes of the meta-analysis we split the control arm in this trial into two equal groups, rounding up any non-integers in the numerator and/or denominator.</P>

Two trials were moderately large with a total of 818 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Gonzalez-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Gonzalez 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McGregor-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McGregor 1996</LINK>), while the three other trials were smaller with 106 participants in total (<LINK REF="STD-HKCS_x002f_BMRC-1992" TYPE="STUDY">HKCS/BMRC 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rowinska-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rowinska 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schwander-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Schwander 1995</LINK>). Two were conducted in Africa (one in each of Uganda and South Africa), one in Hong Kong, one in Poland, and one was a multicentre trial involving participants in Argentina, Brazil, and Thailand.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Participants</HEADING>
<P>The trials involved diverse groups of participants: <LINK REF="STD-Rowinska-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rowinska 1992</LINK> involved Polish people with new or chronic disease; <LINK REF="STD-HKCS_x002f_BMRC-1992" TYPE="STUDY">HKCS/BMRC 1992</LINK> was a paired study of Chinese people with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (and was designed to detect response to rifabutin in the presence of established rifampicin-resistance); <LINK REF="STD-Gonzalez-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Gonzalez 1994</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-McGregor-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McGregor 1996</LINK> included people with previously untreated tuberculosis in Africa, South-East Asia, and South America; while <LINK REF="STD-Schwander-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Schwander 1995</LINK> was restricted to HIV-positive Ugandan people with previously untreated disease. Overall, 90% of participants in the trials included were believed to be HIV negative, and none of the trials provided antiretroviral therapy.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>The trials employed regimens with three different doses of rifabutin (150 mg, 300 mg, or 600 mg) and also differed with respect to whether the dose was adjusted according to bodyweight, as summarized in <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>.</P>

Also, three trials carried out some form of time-to-event analysis using either smears (<LINK REF="STD-Schwander-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Schwander 1995</LINK>) or cultures (<LINK REF="STD-Gonzalez-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Gonzalez 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McGregor-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McGregor 1996</LINK>), though we could extract relevant time-to-event outcomes from only <LINK REF="STD-Gonzalez-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Gonzalez 1994</LINK>.<BR/>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Cure and relapse</HEADING>
<P>Two trials reported these outcome measures (<LINK REF="STD-Gonzalez-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Gonzalez 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McGregor-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McGregor 1996</LINK>). On the basis of available cases, both rifampicin- and rifabutin-containing regimens achieved acceptable cure rates (&#8805; 95%). Relapse rates reported in <LINK REF="STD-McGregor-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McGregor 1996</LINK> (8% to 11%) were more than four-fold higher than those in <LINK REF="STD-Gonzalez-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Gonzalez 1994</LINK> (0.8% to 1.8%). However, this heterogeneity was not statistically significant as assessed by the chi-squared and I<SUP>2</SUP> tests. Funnel plots were not very informative given that there were only two trials, but they did not suggest publication bias.</P>
<P>There was no statistically significant difference in cure (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.04; 553 participants, 2 trials, <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>) or relapse (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.45 to 3.35; 448 participants, 2 trials, <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>) despite there being numerically more relapses for the rifabutin-based regimens in both trials. These results were unaffected by rifabutin dose (150 mg or 300 mg). Follow up to 24 months was only 38% in <LINK REF="STD-McGregor-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McGregor 1996</LINK>, with 'best-case' estimates of 3% and 4.1% relapse for the rifampicin- and rifabutin-containing regimens respectively. While <LINK REF="STD-Gonzalez-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Gonzalez 1994</LINK> achieved 68% follow up, this included only 75% of the cohort at the time of the trial report with 'best-case' estimates of 0.6% and 1.2% for the rifampicin- and rifabutin-containing regimens.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Smear and culture conversion</HEADING>
<P>All of the included trials reported one or more of these outcome measures. There were no statistically significant differences in sputum culture conversion at two months (214 participants, 1 trial, <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>) or at three months (654 participants, 2 trials,<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). Results of survival analysis and median conversion time based on culture were reported only in <LINK REF="STD-Gonzalez-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Gonzalez 1994</LINK>. Only the outcome of the analysis was reported, and this did not support any statistical differences between the treatment groups (median time to negative culture 34 versus 37 days for the rifampicin- and rifabutin-containing regimens, logrank test P = 0.59). <LINK REF="STD-McGregor-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McGregor 1996</LINK> reported only the mean time to culture conversion (99 versus 100 days for the rifampicin- and rifabutin-containing regimens), so we could not combine these outcomes.</P>
<P>The three small trials relied on outcomes based primarily on sputum smear conversion and used different and incompletely reported measures of effect. Of these, only <LINK REF="STD-Schwander-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Schwander 1995</LINK> reported the results of a time-to-event analysis, which included Cox regression. After an adjustment for radiological cavitation, an apparent advantage for the rifabutin-containing regimen (P &lt; 0.05) did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.1). Median times to smear conversion for the regimens were not reported.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse events</HEADING>
<P>Four trials reported information on adverse events (<LINK REF="STD-HKCS_x002f_BMRC-1992" TYPE="STUDY">HKCS/BMRC 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rowinska-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rowinska 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gonzalez-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Gonzalez 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McGregor-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McGregor 1996</LINK>). Overall reported proportions of participants experiencing any adverse event varied between trials, from 4% (<LINK REF="STD-McGregor-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McGregor 1996</LINK>) to 70% (<LINK REF="STD-HKCS_x002f_BMRC-1992" TYPE="STUDY">HKCS/BMRC 1992</LINK>); the latter trial used higher doses of rifabutin in the context of different and more toxic companion drugs for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and hence was not directly comparable with the other three trials. Even within the three trials evaluating first-line therapy, the incidence of adverse events varied widely; for example, 19% of participants receiving 300 mg rifabutin in <LINK REF="STD-Gonzalez-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Gonzalez 1994</LINK> experienced an adverse event compared to 4% in <LINK REF="STD-McGregor-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McGregor 1996</LINK>, which used the same dose. Furthermore, dose adjustment by weight was not included in the protocol of either of these trials. On an available-case basis, there was no significant difference in the risk of adverse events between rifampicin- and rifabutin-containing regimens (RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.88 to 2.31; 714 participants, 3 trials, <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>, though the RR increased from a dose of 150 mg rifabutin (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.45 to 2.12; 264 participants, 2 trials, <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>) to 300 mg (RR 1.78, 95% CI 0.94 to 3.34; 450 participants, 2 trials, <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>). However, in no trial did there appear to be an increased incidence of specific relevant serious adverse events such as leucopoenia or hepatitis (common to all rifamycins) or of uveitis (specific to rifabutin), with no cases of the latter being reported in any of the included trials. In <LINK REF="STD-Gonzalez-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Gonzalez 1994</LINK>, though it was claimed that adverse events tended to be classified as "severe" more often in the control arm, only 0.5% of controls discontinued whereas 3% of participants in the rifabutin 300 mg arm ultimately discontinued study medication. In <LINK REF="STD-McGregor-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McGregor 1996</LINK> the proportion discontinuing was 0.01% in both arms.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-11-09 13:45:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified five trials directly comparing regimens containing rifabutin with rifampicin for treating tuberculosis, all of which date from the period shortly after licensing of the drug. None of these trials was of high methodological quality, they were conducted in diverse patient populations, and the outcome measures chosen by the investigators varied. The included trials comprised less than 1000 participants and were dominated by two moderately sized multicentre trials, conducted on three continents, and in which few HIV-positive individuals are likely to have been included. We assessed follow up in both of these trials as inadequate.</P>
<P>There was no evidence that rifabutin- and rifampicin-containing regimens differed in terms of efficacy as assessed by sputum culture conversion at two, three, or six months on treatment. The proportion of participants who relapsed after treatment was different in the two major trials reporting this endpoint (8% to 11% in <LINK REF="STD-McGregor-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McGregor 1996</LINK> and 0.8% to 1.8% in <LINK REF="STD-Gonzalez-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Gonzalez 1994</LINK>). While treatment was administered daily throughout the trial in <LINK REF="STD-Gonzalez-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Gonzalez 1994</LINK>, it was given twice weekly in the continuation phase in <LINK REF="STD-McGregor-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McGregor 1996</LINK>. In addition, this finding may reflect the more intense transmission environment in South Africa and the fact that in neither study were relapses distinguished from reinfections using molecular methods. Though relapses occurred more frequently on rifabutin-containing regimens at either 150 mg or 300 mg, this was not a statistically significant finding, and the overall estimates of absolute relapse rates would be considered acceptable by current standards. In the context of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, the only published study did not support a role for rifabutin in the treatment of people harbouring rifampicin-resistant organisms (<LINK REF="STD-HKCS_x002f_BMRC-1992" TYPE="STUDY">HKCS/BMRC 1992</LINK>). None of the trials stated whether demonstration of equivalence, non-inferiority, or superiority was the purpose of the primary comparison. None of the secondary outcome measures defined in the review give any substantial support to superiority of rifabutin and were not designed to provide information relating specifically to reducing the duration of treatment. No power calculations were presented and the size of the trials is certainly too small to evaluate superiority. There does not therefore currently appear to be any case for replacing rifampicin with rifabutin in the first-line regimen on the basis of efficacy alone, though it seems reasonable on the limited evidence available to assume that rifabutin-containing regimens are likely to be similar in efficacy for practical purposes to those containing rifampicin. However, given that the CI for relapse currently includes a RR as high as three and the poor quality of follow up in the included trials to date, new, higher quality, equivalence trials would be needed to provide further reassurance on this point.</P>
<P>Participants taking rifabutin-containing regimens were reported to have a similar number of adverse events as those taking rifampicin-containing regimens in the three trials of first-line treatment that reported adverse event data. Higher doses of rifabutin (300 mg) were associated with an increasing proportion of participants experiencing any adverse event, but at neither dose level did this proportion differ significantly from the standard dose of rifampicin (600 mg). In the largest trial, discontinuation rates in the rifabutin arm were as high as 3% on the higher dose. Notably, however, few of these adverse events were serious and did not include any of those of particular concern such as leucopoenia, hepatitis, or uveitis. Furthermore, the absence of any dose adjustment by weight in the two largest trials could have increased the frequency of adverse events in the rifampicin and rifabutin 300 mg arms. However, given that the review provides no evidence to prefer the higher dose of rifabutin in terms of efficacy, a case can be made for using lower doses in future trials or at the very least ensuring that adjustment of dose according to weight is used.</P>
<P>This review identified only one trial comprising a small number of HIV-positive participants who were not receiving antiretroviral therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Schwander-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Schwander 1995</LINK>). Though this trial was methodologically sound it did not report outcome measures that could easily be compared with those of the other trials. HIV-positive people, who constitute the majority of tuberculosis patients in sub-Saharan Africa, are therefore currently under-represented in this review. Future trials in this group will be more complex to conduct than those included in the review to date, since their design must necessarily also include evaluation of the effect of the antiretroviral regimen selected. However, there is a clear need for more information about the use of rifabutin in these people, since it is precisely this group in whom the greatest practical benefits of substituting rifabutin for rifampicin can be envisaged.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Rifabutin-containing regimens perform as well as rifampicin-containing regimens in achieving cure and preventing relapse, but higher doses of rifabutin may be associated with more adverse events and discontinuations. There is no evidence currently to support the replacement of rifampicin by rifabutin for the treatment of new cases of tuberculosis on the basis of efficacy. However, HIV-positive people were under-represented in the included trials and are the group most likely to benefit from substitution of rifampicin with rifabutin due to its lack of interaction with antiretroviral drugs.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Attempting to establish superiority of rifabutin alone in larger trials may not be a worthwhile goal, but well-designed and executed equivalence trials with more precise confidence limits would be useful. Further trials evaluating the use of rifabutin and rifampicin in conjunction with antiretroviral therapy for people with HIV-related tuberculosis must be a priority since no trials have yet evaluated this combined intervention, which has the potential to greatly simplify their care. </P>
