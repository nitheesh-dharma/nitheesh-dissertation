<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>The lower jaw (also known as the mandible) is an important bone that shapes the face, holds the lower teeth in place and is used to move the mouth, for talking and chewing food. Fractures are most often found in the part of the lower jaw that supports teeth (known as the body), the part where the jaw curves upwards into the neck (the angle), or at the knobbly-shaped joint found at the very top of the jaw bone (the condyle). Available treatments align and stabilize the fracture, allowing the bone to heal in the proper position. Treatments may or may not involve surgery.</P>
<P>This review, produced by the Cochrane Oral Health Group, examines different methods for treating fractures of the body and angle of the mandible in existing research and studies.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>People of all ages can fracture their lower jaw, but fractures mainly occur as a result of violence (for example, being hit or punched in the jaw) or by being involved in an accident on the road (for example, car crashes or bicycle accidents). These fractures can be stabilized by physically binding the jaw shut with a system of bars, wires or elastic bands (intermaxillary fixation), or by using tiny screws or plates attached directly to the fractured sections of the lower jaw bone whilst still allowing the mouth to open (rigid fixation).</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence on which this review is based is up to date as of 28 February 2013. Twelve studies with a combined total of 689 participants were included in this review. Participants ranged in age from 16 to 68 years and most participants (90%) were male. All of the studies compared different types of surgical treatments, and each study evaluated a different aspect of surgical treatment such as different types of plates, screws, or wires or how long the jaw was immobilized after surgery.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>There were concerns about the design and quality of all the studies. All the studies evaluated different aspects of surgical treatment. None of the studies evaluated non-surgical treatments such as intermaxillary fixation and no study compared surgical treatment with non-surgical treatment. As a result there is no clear evidence to indicate which approach is the best to manage these fractures.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence found is poor. Recommendations are made for further well-conducted research studies in this area to be undertaken.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-07-04 11:58:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Zbys Fedorowicz">
<P>Fractures of the mandible (lower jaw) are a common occurrence and usually related to interpersonal violence or road traffic accidents. Mandibular fractures may be treated using open (surgical) and closed (non-surgical) techniques. Fracture sites are immobilized with intermaxillary fixation (IMF) or other external or internal devices (i.e. plates and screws) to allow bone healing. Various techniques have been used, however uncertainty exists with respect to the specific indications for each approach.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2013-07-02 14:35:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Zbys Fedorowicz">
<P>The objective of this review is to provide reliable evidence of the effects of any interventions either open (surgical) or closed (non-surgical) that can be used in the management of mandibular fractures, excluding the condyles, in adult patients.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-07-04 11:59:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Zbys Fedorowicz">
<P>We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 28 February 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2013, Issue 1), MEDLINE via OVID (1950 to 28 February 2013), EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 28 February 2013), <I>meta</I>Register of Controlled Trials (to 7 April 2013), ClinicalTrials.gov (to 7 April 2013) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (to 7 April 2013). The reference lists of all trials identified were checked for further studies. There were no restrictions regarding language or date of publication.<BR/>
</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-05-26 04:17:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Zbys Fedorowicz">
<P>Randomised controlled trials evaluating the management of mandibular fractures without condylar involvement. Any studies that compared different treatment approaches were included.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-07-04 12:15:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>At least two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Results were to be expressed as random-effects models using mean differences for continuous outcomes and risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals. Heterogeneity was to be investigated to include both clinical and methodological factors.<BR/>
</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-07-04 12:12:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Zbys Fedorowicz">
<P>Twelve studies, assessed as high (six) and unclear (six) risk of bias, comprising 689 participants (830 fractures), were included. Interventions examined different plate materials and morphology; use of one or two lag screws; microplate versus miniplate; early and delayed mobilization; eyelet wires versus Rapid IMF&#8482; and the management of angle fractures with intraoral access alone or combined with a transbuccal approach. Patient-oriented outcomes were largely ignored and post-operative pain scores were inadequately reported. Unfortunately, only one or two trials with small sample sizes were conducted for each comparison and outcome. Our results and conclusions should therefore be interpreted with caution. We were able to pool the results for two comparisons assessing one outcome. Pooled data from two studies comparing two miniplates versus one miniplate revealed no significant difference in the risk of post-operative infection of surgical site (risk ratio (RR) 1.32, 95% CI 0.41 to 4.22, P = 0.64, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%). Similarly, no difference in post-operative infection between the use of two 3-dimensional (3D) and standard (2D) miniplates was determined (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.19 to 8.13, P = 0.81, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 27%). The included studies involved a small number of participants with a low number of events.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-07-04 12:19:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Zbys Fedorowicz">
<P>This review illustrates that there is currently inadequate evidence to support the effectiveness of a single approach in the management of mandibular fractures without condylar involvement. The lack of high quality evidence may be explained by clinical diversity, variability in assessment tools used and difficulty in grading outcomes with existing measurement tools. Until high level evidence is available, treatment decisions should continue to be based on the clinician's prior experience and the individual circumstances.</P>

Other causes include injury from contact sports, falls, work-related accidents, alcohol and drug abuse in addition to pathological and iatrogenic factors.</P>
<P>Fractures resulting from violence are most commonly associated with the angle region while those related to road traffic accidents usually involve the condyle, body and parasymphysis. Fractures not involving the condylar process of the mandible account for 65% to 75% of the total number of mandibular fractures (<LINK REF="REF-Ellis-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ellis 2005</LINK>). A minority of mandibular fractures (less than 1%) occur in edentulous patients and many of these involve the mandibular body (<LINK REF="REF-Bruce-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bruce 1993</LINK>). Mandibular fractures in elderly people are also more likely to be associated with falls (<LINK REF="REF-Nishiike-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nishiike 2002</LINK>) but have also been reported in atrophic edentulous mandibles after the insertion of dental implants (<LINK REF="REF-Carls-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carls 1996</LINK>). The majority of mandibular fractures occur at more than one site, typically bilaterally (<LINK REF="REF-Kubilius-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kubilius 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ogundare-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ogundare 2003</LINK>
<U>)</U>.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Signs and symptoms</HEADING>
<P>Mandibular fractures may present with a variety of signs and symptoms such as pain, swelling, limited jaw movement, bleeding, tenderness and step deformity at the fracture site. Diminished or altered sensation to the lower lip (anaesthesia, hypoaesthesia or paraesthesia) resulting from damage to the inferior alveolar nerve, and associated soft tissue trauma including intraoral bruising, gingival lacerations and sublingual haematoma are also common. Dentoalveolar injuries are often observed with fractures involving the tooth-bearing regions of the mandible; occlusal derangement may also occur with its severity related to the site and degree of displacement of the fracture.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-07-02 14:23:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Zbys Fedorowicz">
<P>The intervention is aimed at realignment (reduction) of the fractured segments into their normal anatomic positions (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1999</LINK>), and prevention of movement by immobilization (fixation) of the fractured bone thereby allowing osseous union to occur (<LINK REF="REF-Banks-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Banks 2001</LINK>). The ultimate goal is to restore occlusion (bite), mandibular anatomy and jaw function.</P>
<P>Treatment approaches range from conservative non-invasive management by 'closed' reduction and immobilization using intermaxillary fixation (IMF) to the more invasive surgical 'open' reduction with internal fixation approach. Several key factors can influence the management of mandibular fractures including the location of the fracture and the degree of displacement. In the dentate mandible, reduction must aim to restore good functional occlusion whereas less precise reduction may be acceptable if sections of the body of the mandible are edentulous or lack opposing teeth. In closed (non-surgical) reduction the bone ends or fragments are realigned either manually or using traction devices without surgically exposing the fracture site, whereas in an open (surgical) reduction the fracture site is surgically exposed during the procedure (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>A range of options exist for internal fixation of the fractured mandibular segments (<LINK REF="REF-van-den-Bergh-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">van den Bergh 2012</LINK>). These include transosseous wiring, circum-mandibular wiring, compression plates, reconstruction plates, miniplates and lag screws (<LINK REF="REF-Ellis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ellis 1999</LINK>). Other less commonly used methods include: intra- and extra- medullary K-wires, and metallic mesh (<LINK REF="REF-Chakraborty-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chakraborty 2011</LINK>) which may involve the simultaneous use of autogenous bone grafts (<LINK REF="REF-Basa-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Basa 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zi_x0119_bowicz-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zi&#281;bowicz 2006</LINK>). Titanium miniplates and screws are used extensively for internal fixation. During the last two decades bone plates made of resorbable materials (e.g. polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid, and polydioxanone) have also increased in popularity but are not used much in mandibular fractures. One of the main factors contributing to their popularity is biological degradation, eliminating the potential need for a second operation for plate removal. However, foreign body inflammatory responses have been described with polylactic and polyglycolic implants (<LINK REF="REF-Mohamed_x002d_Hashem-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mohamed-Hashem 2000</LINK>). In the edentulous or partially-dentate mandible adjunctive use of dentures, Gunning splints and external fixation appliances may be helpful to stabilize the fracture, although these methods may not be appropriate for grossly displaced fractures of the edentulous mandible, especially those that are atrophic (<LINK REF="REF-Barber-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barber 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>A number of patient and operator related factors may influence the approach to reduction and fixation of mandibular fractures. Patient factors include age, medical health, state of the dentition, degree of fracture displacement or comminution, and the presence and degree of associated trauma and infection. Important operator factors include surgical skills and experience, operating room facilities, and equipment. In addition, the cost of treatment may have direct implications for both patients and operator.</P>
<P>Protocols for managing mandibular fractures are evolving, with traditional treatment involving intraoperative IMF in conjunction with rigid internal fixation. However non-compression miniplates, which provide only relative stability, have gained in popularity more recently. The importance of intraoperative IMF as an adjunct to facilitate the application of internal fixation has more recently been questioned (<LINK REF="REF-Bell-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bell 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gear-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gear 2005</LINK>). The use of a single miniplate on the superior border of the mandible is increasingly preferred for management of mandibular angle fractures among American and European surgeons (<LINK REF="REF-Gear-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gear 2005</LINK>). Non-compression plates are also more widely advocated when large bone plates are placed along the inferior border of the mandible. In addition, design changes have been proposed to bone plates for rigid internal fixation to enhance biomechanical characteristics in the symphysis, parasymphysis and mandibular body (<LINK REF="REF-Lovald-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lovald 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Madsen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Madsen 2008</LINK>). The aim of such systems is to enhance fracture stability, while minimizing the bulk of the implanted plates and improving patient comfort.</P>

<P>Nine possible post-operative complications in the management of mandibular fractures have been described by the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons and are often used as parameters of care (<LINK REF="REF-Meaders-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meaders 1998</LINK>):</P>

<P>The likelihood of complications increases in older patients with fractures requiring longer stabilization and often accompanied by more post-operative complications particularly in those patients with a history of systemic health problems and in those treated with open (surgical) reduction. Inflammatory complications may also develop in the elderly more frequently than in other age groups (<LINK REF="REF-Pankratov-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pankratov 2000</LINK>). There is also a higher incidence of non-union with severely atrophic mandibles. Additional complications which have been reported include fractured plates, persistent anaesthesia/dysaesthesia and osteomyelitis (<LINK REF="REF-Eyrich-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eyrich 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Luhr-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luhr 1996</LINK>).

<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-07-02 14:33:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Zbys Fedorowicz">
<P>The closed (non-surgical) reduction technique to a large extent relies on the restoration of the occlusion to achieve correct alignment of the fractured bone segments through IMF with bone or dental ligations or both (<LINK REF="REF-Toma-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toma 2003</LINK>). In the open (surgical) technique, alignment of the bone segments can be accomplished by extraoral and transoral approaches to achieve exposure, followed by internal fixation (open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF)) carried out under direct vision (<LINK REF="STD-Shetty-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Shetty 2008</LINK>). Direct exposure of the fracture site may be achieved via an intraoral incision overlying the fracture site; extraorally, via a submandibular (or Risdon) incision; or through an existing laceration where appropriate. A transbuccal approach combining a stab extraoral incision with intraoral exposure is widely used for mandibular angle fractures.</P>
<P>The mechanism of healing of a fracture depends on the method of immobilization used. With non-rigid fixation methods (e.g. IMF or transosseous wiring) a haematoma is formed in the fracture line, initially emanating from the marrow and later from the periosteum. The haematoma subsequently gives rise to a callus which is responsible for initial stability between the segments. Ultimately, the callus ossifies thereby restoring bony reunion. Rigid fixation methods, usually employed in conjunction with open (surgical) reduction, ensure close proximity of the fracture segments. Minimal callus formation is observed with rigid fixation and the bone heals primarily by remodelling.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-07-02 14:34:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Zbys Fedorowicz">
<P>Mandibular fractures are generally treated by either open (surgical) or closed (non-surgical) reduction techniques followed by external or internal fixation or both. There is still a lack of consensus on several aspects of the management of mandibular fractures i.e. whether and when to use open or closed reduction, the choice of specific fixation techniques or the appropriateness of surgical or non-surgical interventions for specific types of fractures (<LINK REF="REF-Bell-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bell 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gear-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gear 2005</LINK>). Patients also require adequate information on the effectiveness, risks, benefits and quality of life implications of each potential treatment option to facilitate informed decision making (<LINK REF="REF-Der_x002d_Martirosian-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Der-Martirosian 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gironda-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gironda 2006</LINK>).

<P>The methods used to generate the allocation sequence and the method of concealing the sequence, such that participants and investigators enrolling participants could not foresee the upcoming assignment, are the most important and sensitive indicators for minimising bias in a clinical trial (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). The method of sequence generation was reported adequately in only five of the 12 trials; in the remainder it was not described at all or was, at best, unclear.

<P>Whilst the challenges of blinding participants and personnel to the interventions considered in this review are recognised, few of the studies attempted to ensure that the outcome assessments were independent of the investigators. Consequently, in most of the studies, it was unclear if foreknowledge of the allocated interventions by participants and personnel could have been prevented during the study (performance bias), therefore the judgement given for this domain was 'unclear' with the exception of one (<LINK REF="STD-Bhatt-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bhatt 2010</LINK>). In the latter study, it was explicitly stated that "blinding was not used", therefore a judgement of 'high risk' of bias was given. As the investigators in most of the studies were the outcome assessors and were generally not 'blinded' to the allocated interventions (detection bias) a judgement of 'high risk' of bias was given for this domain in six of the studies, with a further four judged 'unclear' (<LINK REF="STD-Gupta-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pigadas-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Pigadas 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singh-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 2012</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sugar-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sugar 2009</LINK>) and only the remaining two scored as 'low risk' (<LINK REF="STD-Jain-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Jain 2010</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kaplan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kaplan 2001</LINK>).</P>

<P>Although there were some losses to follow-up, 4/21 (19.0%) in the titanium group and 2/19 (10.5%) in the resorbable group, at the 1-month recall, we were able to re-analyse the individual patient data provided by the investigators.

Mild pain occurred in 9/21(42.9%) participants in the titanium group compared to 6/19 (31.6%) in the resorbable group (RR = 0.74, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.68). Moderate pain was experienced in 1/21(4.8%) in the titanium and 2/19 (10.5%) in the resorbable group (RR = 2.9, 95% CI 0.22 to 22.5). Severe pain was unique to participants in the resorbable group 1/19 (5.3%) (Additional <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). However, the investigators did not accurately report the methods used to evaluate pain severity in their studies. Consequently we are unable to speculate on the reliability of the pain assessment techniques.

Small differences in risk of malocclusion (2.0%) or inability to chew hard foods (1.5%) were observed between the intervention groups.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-07-04 11:46:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The management of mandibular fractures without condylar involvement may be influenced by a range of local conditions and factors which include the degree of displacement, the extent of associated problems and the anatomic location of the fracture. However, in view of the wide range of possible interventions, a number of technical and surgical controversies persist. Although there is a lack of consensus as to whether surgical interventions can give better results than closed (non-surgical) treatment, there are certain types of fracture that do not lend themselves to treatment by closed (non-surgical) methods. Consequently, randomised trials comparing all types of mandibular fractures cannot be justified; albeit for the majority of situations (i.e. single fractures, undisplaced fractures or multiple fractures without complications outside the maxillofacial region), randomised controlled trials are the preferred study design to assess the best approach to treatment.</P>
<P>The objectives of this systematic review were to undertake a complete analysis of outcomes both from an objective viewpoint and with respect to patient reports. Given that assessment of key parameters (e.g. occlusion, facial symmetry or nerve function) prior to the event leading to the fracture is impossible, final assessments from a patient's perspective are often essential to gauge the response to interventions. Unfortunately, many of these patient-reported outcomes were poorly or incompletely described in the included studies or were assessed in a number of different ways. While it is important that future studies do consider patient-centred outcomes, there is also an onus on investigators to provide consistent and standardised reporting.</P>
<P>The sparsity of evidence identified in this review may reflect a range in the diversity and questionable reliability of the traditional, normative predictors of success. For example, a major outcome in many studies was the need for secondary surgery; an outcome of this nature is likely to be subjective, with different clinicians having individual thresholds for further treatment. In addition, causes of further treatment may vary, ranging from major complications such as non-union or malunion to minor problems (e.g. infection necessitating plate removal). Furthermore, given that the aetiology of mandibular fractures, particularly multiple fractures, is typically related to significant traumatic episodes, robust analysis can be compromised by difficulty in separating the response to surgery from extraneous physical and psychological injury. Consequently, assessment of pain scores and other patient-reported outcomes can be complex, and may be confounded by other clinical parameters. Use of strict selection criteria with omission of certain subtypes or causes of injury (e.g. maxillofacial trauma with multiple non-facial injuries) is therefore important during the conduct of future research.</P>
<P>There is wide agreement that factors, such as the degree of surgical complexity and the possibility of post-operative complications with either open (surgical) or closed (non-surgical) treatment, may influence clinical decisions. This review illustrates that there is currently insufficient high quality evidence to support a single approach, either open (surgical) or closed (non-surgical), in the management of the fractured mandible without condylar involvement. Therefore, until more robust evidence in the form of well-designed randomised controlled trials is available, treatment decisions will continue to be based on individual circumstances and clinical experience.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-07-04 11:46:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Zbys Fedorowicz">
<P>Twelve studies, six of which were assessed as high and six as unclear risk of bias were included. A total of 689 participants aged 16 to 68 years with 830 fractures were investigated. Unfortunately, there were very limited numbers of trials with small sample sizes conducted for each comparison and outcome. Therefore, our results and conclusions should be interpreted with caution.</P>
<P>Interventions and comparisons considered were open reduction involving differing plate materials and morphology (i.e. use of one or two lag screws; early and delayed mobilization; eyelet wires versus Rapid IMF&#8482; and management of angle fractures with intraoral or transbuccal approaches). Patient-oriented outcomes appear to have been largely ignored and post-operative pain scores were either unavailable or inadequately reported in the majority of the included studies.</P>
<P>Pooled data for post-operative infection in two studies indicated no significant difference between the single and two miniplates groups (RR = 1.32, 95% CI 0.41 to 4.22, P = 0.64, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%). Likewise, no difference in post-operative infection between use of two 3D and standard (2D) miniplates was determined (RR = 1.26, 95% CI 0.19 to 8.13, P = 0.81, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 27%). However the studies involved a small number of participants with a low number of events. Surgical site infection was also reported in other studies but no significant differences were identified.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-07-03 14:39:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Zbys Fedorowicz">
<P>Although a relatively large number of studies were included in this review, these were of moderate or low quality and reporting of outcome data was suboptimal. Consequently, the overall quality of the evidence was considered to be low, precluding clearcut conclusions in relation to the relative merits of one technique over another. In addition, while there is an increasing emphasis on patient-reported measures of outcome in health care generally, there was limited consideration given to patient relevant outcomes in the studies included in this review.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Limitations in study design and implementation</HEADING>
<P>Although the overall clinical design of the included studies appeared to be adequate, our assessments of risk of bias revealed limitations in the quality of the studies covering most of the interventions.</P>
<P>There was considerable variation in the reporting of these studies and in particular the methods used to generate the sequence, to conceal the allocation, and the measures taken to blind investigators and participants. These factors, allied to unsuccessful attempts to contact many of the investigators for additional information, created difficulties in making accurate assessments of the risk of bias in some of the included studies.<BR/>The inability to blind investigators and outcomes assessors to the interventions, which is considered a valuable step in reducing bias, presented challenges in the design of many of the studies. Data for losses to follow-up and the final disposition of missing participants, where failure was a key outcome, were additional indicators of a likelihood of biased assessment of the intervention effect. Independent post-operative evaluation could have helped to limit the effects of subjectivity in the assessment of these outcomes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Indirectness of the evidence</HEADING>
<P>The objectives of this review were broad, namely to compare the effects of any intervention (open/surgical or closed/non-surgical) in the management of mandibular fractures without condylar involvements. Some difficulties were encountered in terms of addressing a restricted version of the main review question with regard to criteria including population, intervention, comparator and outcomes. In particular, adolescent patients were included in some studies, there was also a preponderance of males in most studies.</P>
<P>Both mandibular fractures with and without condylar involvement were reported in some randomised controlled trials. Attempts were made to omit these data from the analysis.</P>
<P>In addition, data were absent for many patient-preferred outcomes, with patient-centred outcomes largely overlooked and the total absence of any assessments of the impact of interventions on quality of life in the included studies. In certain cases, only surrogate/proxy outcome measurements related indirectly to our patient-oriented outcomes were reported. One of the included studies evaluated the extent of mouth opening using the interincisor measurement which is a surrogate/proxy outcome of a patient-oriented outcome on restoration of function (i.e. chewing and speaking). However, the research settings were in general considered appropriate and relevant to the majority of treatment centres undertaking management of mandibular fractures.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2013-07-03 14:43:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Zbys Fedorowicz">
<P>While this review only considered randomised controlled trials, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Andreasen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andreasen 2008</LINK>) compared healing with open and closed techniques but no randomised controlled trials were included. All of the studies were retrospective and thus their conclusions need to be viewed within the context of being at risk of bias. In addition, the investigators in these studies did not appear to have considered or included any patient-reported outcomes in their assessments. Consequently, higher complication rates with open techniques are likely to be have been confounded by the use of open techniques in the management of more displaced and complex fractures.<BR/>A further review, which included both retrospective and prospective studies, compared outcomes with resorbable plates and screws and involved both traumatic and planned mandibular fractures (e.g. during orthognathic surgery) (<LINK REF="REF-Agarwal-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agarwal 2009</LINK>). A comparison of five outcomes following rigid fixation and mono-cortical fixation of mandibular fractures were reported in <LINK REF="REF-Regev-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Regev 2010</LINK> but both retrospective and prospective studies were included and combined in the meta-analysis with consideration of outcomes relating to mandibular angle fractures only.</P>

<P>There is a shortage of high quality evidence relevant to treatment modalities considered in this review; the effectiveness of interventions for management of mandibular fractures without condylar involvement remains unclear. Clinical decisions regarding the most appropriate management of these cases must be based on clinical experience, and the nature of the presentation taking into account patients' preferences and choices.<BR/>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-07-04 11:48:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>While it is accepted that for practical reasons, trials testing surgical interventions are generally less common than therapeutic drug trials, there would appear to be a continuing need for further trials to evaluate the effectiveness of open reduction versus closed treatment of fractured mandibles without condylar involvement. Currently, most of the outcome measurements used in clinical trials are not standardised patient-oriented outcome measurements. Trialists should first develop a standardised set of patient-oriented outcomes before conducting further clinical trials. It is important that future trials are robust, well-designed and reported according to the CONSORT statement (<A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org/">http://www.consort-statement.org/</A>) or the extensions of the CONSORT statement. They should also carefully consider the IDEAL recommendations for clinical trials evaluating surgical interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Ergina-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ergina 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCulloch-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCulloch 2009</LINK>). Clear conduct and reporting will enable appraisal and interpretation of results, and accurate judgements to be made about the risk of bias, and the overall quality of the evidence. Although it is uncertain whether reported quality mirrors the true conduct of the study, it is noteworthy that studies with unclear methodology have been shown to produce biased estimates of treatment effects (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). Adherence to guidelines, such as the CONSORT statement, would promote transparent, better and more complete reporting.</P>
<P>A significant drawback of most published studies is that fractures in various locations throughout the mandible are included. It is known that some fractures, for instance those involving the angle of the mandible, have a higher risk of complications than in other locations. Restricting the inclusion criteria in future studies to fractures in specific regions of the mandible will yield more meaningful information. It would also be beneficial if future randomised controlled trials could focus more closely on comparisons of rigid fixation utilising strong plates (the AO technique) with one of the other commonly reported methods (e.g. closed reduction, miniplates or midsized plates).</P>
<P>Other variables that should be controlled or investigated in future studies include: infected and non-infected fractures, single fractures and multiply-fractured mandibles, and simple linear or comminuted fractures. Each of these criteria is important to control or analyse or both as they influence the decision to use either closed or open approaches to treatment, the amount of internal fixation hardware required, and timing of interventions.</P>

<P>The previous version of this review which only considered fractures of the edentulous atrophic mandible failed to identify any eligible randomised trials (<LINK REF="REF-Nasser-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nasser 2007</LINK>), and therefore the scope of the review was widened to include all fractures of the mandible but excluding those of the condyle. We will provide evidence for a wider clinical question and also indirect evidence to inform the original question on the management of fractured edentulous atrophic mandible.</P>
<P>Although we initially planned to limit participants to18 years and over, several of the identified studies included a small number of participants under 18 years. For practical purposes when the second molars are erupted the mandible can be considered adult and the open or closed approaches are both similar to those used in the adult mandible. Based on content expert advice received, we included these studies under the following conditions:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the focus of the study was on adults and most of the participants were over 18 years of age;</LI>
<LI>the outcome measurements are unlikely to be affected by the addition of this age group.</LI>
</UL>
<P>If adequate data are available in future updates we will conduct a subgroup analysis to explore any potential differences based on a threshold of 18 years of age on the effect of interventions.</P>

There is a need for more research on any type of intervention for the management of mandibular fractures. However, the most fundamental unanswered question remains 'Which approach is most effective open treatment with internal fixation or closed management?'</P>
