<SUMMARY_BODY>

</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Intrauterine devices (IUD) are safe and effective methods of long term reversible contraception. The design, and copper content as well as placement of the copper on IUDs could affect their effectiveness and side-effect profile.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>We compared different copper IUDs for their effectiveness and side effects.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Multiple electronic databases were searched with appropriate key words and names of the IUDs known to be in the market. We searched the reference lists of papers identified and contacted trialists when possible. There was no language restriction.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials comparing different IUDs were considered. Trials needed to report on clinical outcomes.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data on outcomes and trial characteristics were extracted in duplicate and independently by two reviewers. Meta-analysis results are expressed as rate difference (RD) using a fixed-effects model with 95% confidence interval (CI). In the presence of significant heterogeneity a random-effects model was applied.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>We included 35 trials, resulting in 18 comparisons of 10 different IUDs in approximately 48,000 women. TCu380A was more effective in preventing pregnancy than MLCu375 (RD 1.70%, 95% CI 0.07% to 2.95% after 4 years of use). TCu380A was also more effective than MLCu250, TCu220 and TCu200. There tended to be fewer pregnancies with TCu380S compared to TCu380A after the first year of use, a difference which was statistically significant in the fourth year (RD -1.62%, 95% CI -3.00% to -0.24%). This occurred despite more expulsions with TCu380S (RD 3.50%, 95% CI 0.36% to 6.63% at 4 years). MLCu375 was no more effective than TCu220 at 1 year of use, or MLCu250 and NovaT up to 3 years. Compared to TCu380A or TCu380S, none of the IUDs showed any benefits in terms of bleeding or pain, or any of the other reasons for early discontinuation. None of the trials that reported events at insertion found one IUD easier to insert than another or caused less pain at insertion. There is no evidence that uterine perforation rates vary by type of device. There are minimal randomised data on IUD use in nulliparous women.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>TCu380A or TCu380S appear to be more effective than other IUDs. No IUD showed consistently lower removal rates for bleeding and pain in comparison to other IUDs. There is no evidence that any particular framed copper device is better suited to women who have not had children.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-05-12 21:15:51 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>The IUD is the most widely used reversible method of contraception in the world today, used by an estimated 100 million women (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1997</LINK>). Around 13% of couples use an IUD, more in the developing world than developed (<LINK REF="REF-United-Nations-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">United Nations 2006</LINK>). Thus this review has direct relevance to millions of users. Developed in the beginning of the nineteenth century, intrauterine devices (IUDs or IUCDs) became popular for contraceptive use from the 1960s onwards (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1987</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Tietze-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tietze 1970</LINK>). The earlier IUDs were non-medicated and consisted only of what is nowadays referred to as the frame of the IUD, the frame being made of plastic material. These IUDs have been replaced by the more effective copper-bearing devices over the years. Intrauterine copper devices exist in different shapes, mainly framed ones (T or horseshoe shaped), and frameless ones. The framed devices stay in place in the uterine cavity due to the extended horizontal 'arms' whereas the frameless ones are anchored to the wall of the uterine fundus. </P>
<P>Copper-bearing IUDs consist usually of a plastic core body, surrounded by copper wires; some devices have a silver core to delay fragmentation of copper and increase their lifespan. Earlier devices contained copper around the vertical stem only. Further development lead to the addition of extra copper, and for the T-frame adding copper sleeves to the horizontal arms with the aim to provide copper surface close to the fundus and therefore improve the effectiveness (<LINK REF="STD-Sivin-1979A" TYPE="STUDY">Sivin 1979A</LINK>). The generally recommended duration of use is between 3-10 years, depending on the device, but large follow-up studies have shown that some IUDs can be used for up to 12 years providing highly effective contraception (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1997</LINK>). Devices with longer duration of action are preferred as they reduce the need for re-insertion and insertion-related problems.</P>
<P>Discontinuation of contraceptive methods is a major factor in unwanted fertility (<LINK REF="REF-Blanc-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blanc 1999</LINK>). Discontinuations of intrauterine device use are less common, apart from implants, than for other methods, partly perhaps because cessation of use requires a deliberate decision to have the device removed (<LINK REF="REF-Ali-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ali 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Trussell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trussell 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Blanc-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blanc 1999</LINK>). The continuation rates with IUDs are reported around 70% after three years of use (<LINK REF="REF-UNDP-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNDP 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-WHO-1994" TYPE="STUDY">WHO 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>The contraceptive mechanism of copper IUDs is mainly to prevent fertilisation by inhibiting sperm mobility, stimulating a cytotoxic inflammatory reaction that is spermicidal. Further, it changes the intrauterine environment to make it more hostile for implantation (<LINK REF="REF-Mishell-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mishell 1998</LINK>). The effectiveness of copper IUDs is comparable to other long acting reversible contraceptives, such as injectables (<LINK REF="REF-Trussell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trussell 2004</LINK>). Failure rates are highest earlier during its use and seem to be positively correlated with the surface area of copper in the endometrial cavity (<LINK REF="REF-Tatum-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tatum 1972</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1997</LINK>). </P>
<P>Sometimes IUDs are difficult to insert, although complications during insertion, such as cervical laceration or uterine perforation are rare (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1997</LINK>). Expulsion has been reported to occur mostly during the first year of use (<LINK REF="STD-WHO-1994" TYPE="STUDY">WHO 1994</LINK>); it may occur more frequently in nulliparous compared to multiparous women, and it has been claimed to depend on the form and frame of the device (<LINK REF="STD-WHO-1994" TYPE="STUDY">WHO 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sastrawinata-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Sastrawinata 1991</LINK>). However, a Cochrane systematic review showed there was insufficient evidence to state that frameless devices reduce the problem of early expulsion compared to framed ones (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2005</LINK>). Increased or prolonged vaginal bleeding has been described as the most common side-effect (<LINK REF="REF-Mishell-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mishell 1998</LINK>) and could be related to the copper content of the IUD, therefore raising concern that this may decrease the tolerability and compliance with high copper content devices. Smaller devices with less copper content aim to minimise side effects and to provide an alternative for women with smaller sized uterus, but may be less effective. Other side effects reported are abdominal pain, especially during menstruation, and vaginal discharge (<LINK REF="STD-Sastrawinata-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Sastrawinata 1991</LINK>). <BR/>The possible association between use of IUDs in general and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) has been a concern, and it has led to a decrease in IUD use at the time, mainly in the USA (<LINK REF="REF-Mishell-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mishell 1998</LINK>). An analysis of data from WHO's IUD clinical trials showed that PID in IUD users is related to the time since insertion and to the background risk for sexually transmitted diseases. No significant differences were found among different types of copper containing IUDs (<LINK REF="REF-Farley-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farley 1992</LINK>). </P>
<P>The optimal IUD choice has important public health implications as it concerns millions of women worldwide. This review focuses on the framed IUDs and their effectiveness and side effects; frameless IUDs are reviewed elsewhere (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2005</LINK>).</P>

The last search was performed on 08 May 2006. For this update we have added one new trial (<LINK REF="STD-Haugen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Haugen 2007</LINK>). </P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>	<B>Data extraction <BR/>	</B>Identified titles and abstracts were assessed whether they fulfilled the inclusion criteria and full text articles were retrieved for those eligible or unsure. Quality assessment and data extraction were done independently by two of the authors using a specially designed data extraction form. Baseline characteristics such as setting, age group, parity, previous contraceptive use, previous infection, time of insertion (e.g. post abortion, post partum), were recorded. Data on IUD specification, including size, shape, have been extracted from the original papers. Further information on the <LINK REF="STD-Bahamondes-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bahamondes 1999</LINK> trial was provided by the author. Copper dose refers to the copper surface area of the IUD.</P>
<P>	<B>Quality assessment<BR/>	</B>The quality assessment took into account the description of randomisation and allocation procedure and loss-to-follow-up rate.<BR/>A score has been assigned for allocation concealment, using the following criteria: <BR/>(A) adequate concealment of allocation (such as central randomisation; use of numbered, sealed opaque envelopes)<BR/>(B) unclear whether concealment of allocation is adequate<BR/>(C) inadequate concealment of allocation (such as alternation)<BR/>(D) concealment of allocation not used<BR/>Only trials scoring A or B were included in the review. </P>
<P>	<B>Analysis<BR/>	</B>Survival (time-to-event) methods are used in contraception studies that involve long periods of observation and take into account varying lengths of time that women remain in a study. Kaplan-Meier or daily life-table estimates are commonly used in IUD studies (<LINK REF="REF-Farley-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farley 1986</LINK>). Monthly (actuarial) life-table estimates have also been used extensively in the past (<LINK REF="REF-Tietze-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tietze 1973</LINK>). Farley has shown that the results obtained with both methods are very similar (<LINK REF="REF-Farley-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farley 1986</LINK>) and for the purposes of this review are treated the same and combined in the meta-analyses. Both methods give estimated probabilities of event over a specific time period, which are expressed as percentages or rates per 100 women. </P>
<P>In IUD studies reasons for discontinuation 'compete' with each other in the sense that if a woman discontinues from the study because the IUD is expelled, for example, or because of excessive bleeding, she is no longer at risk of pregnancy in that interval. Based on how these competing events are handled, two types of rates can be derived in life-table analysis in contraception studies. Most studies report adjusted, or non-competing single decrement life-table rates, in which the rates are calculated after adjusting ('censoring') for discontinuations for other reasons (also called cumulative 'net' probability rates by statisticians (<LINK REF="REF-Farley-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farley 1986</LINK>), and 'gross' cumulative rates by demographers (<LINK REF="REF-Tietze-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tietze 1973</LINK>)). Adjusted rates are theoretical and not observable, and provide a pure estimate for each reason for comparison with other IUDs. The advantage of the adjusted rate is that an excess rate for one reason, for example expulsion, will not influence discontinuations rates for other reasons. Adjusted rates are used when looking at single events, such as pregnancies or expulsions, in isolation to compare events rates among different devices, as the influence of other events, such as discontinuations for bleeding, is removed. </P>
<P>Crude rates, or competing multiple decrement life-table rates, on the other hand, are discontinuation rates for an event without adjusting for other events (also called 'net' rates by Tietze). Crude rates provide an estimate of overall IUD performance, showing the relative importance of different reasons for discontinuation, which are additive. Crude rates give systematically lower estimates. In this review <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1992</LINK> was the only one to use multiple decrement life tables.</P>
<P>For individual studies we subtracted the rates for the comparison IUDs to get the rate difference, and calculated the standard error of the difference from the square root of the sum of the square of each standard error in Excel (Version 11.2, 2005). Outcomes were pooled in RevMan (Version 4.2, 2005) using the inverse variance method. When there was substantial heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic greater than 50%), we used the random effects model. </P>
<P>The meta-analysis graphs indicate the direction of effect at the bottom of the graph. If the rate difference (RD) is positive, and the outcome is undesirable (e.g. pregnancy, discontinuation), the result favours the second IUD listed in the graph. </P>
<P>Trials that met the inclusion criteria but for which results could not be included in the meta-analyses, due to the way their results were presented, are listed in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>.</P>

<P>	<B>Devices used in the included trials</B>: Copper T380A (TCu380A), TCu380 Slimline (TCu380S), CopperT220 (TCu220) and Copper T200 (TCu200) IUDs have a T-shaped polyethylene frame, measuring 36 mm long and 32 mm wide. A monofilament thread is tied at the distal end of the stem, allowing for removal of the device. The TCu380A has copper wire on the vertical stem with a surface area of 320 mm<SUP>2</SUP>, and 30 mm<SUP>2</SUP> of copper on sleeves in the middle of each of the horizontal arms. The TCu380S has the copper sleeves at the ends of the horizontal arms, embedded into the arms. The TCu220 has copper collars on the vertical stem and horizontal arms, amounting to a total of 220 mm<SUP>2</SUP>. The TCu200 has a copper wire along the vertical stem with a surface area of 200 mm<SUP>2</SUP>.</P>
<P>Multiload 375 (MLCu375) and Multiload 250 (MLCu250) are horseshoe-shaped devices with copper wires around the plastic vertical stem amounting to either 375 mm<SUP>2</SUP> or 250 mm<SUP>2</SUP>. The arms are down-curved, with a 'saw-like' appearance.</P>
<P>Nova T has a copper surface area of 200 mm<SUP>2</SUP> and NovaT380 has a surface of 380 mm<SUP>2</SUP>. The copper coil has a silver wire core and is on the vertical stem. The horizontal arms are rounded at the end and face slightly downwards once inserted, giving the device a more curved shape compared to the straight arms of the T-devices. The distal end of the vertical stem forms a loop to which the thread is attached.</P>
<P>Copper 7 (Cu 7): consists of a vertical and one horizontal arm, giving it the shape of the number '7'. The copper wire is around the stem and has a total copper surface of 200 mm<SUP>2</SUP>.</P>
<P>The Cu-Safe 300 has a slightly thinner frame, with the horizontal arms being 23 mm wide and the ends are bent downwards and inwards. A copper wire is wound around the stem and amounts to about 300 mm<SUP>2</SUP> of copper surface.</P>
<P>	<B>Excluded studies</B> (see Table of Excluded Studies):<BR/>Thirty-five papers were excluded: 11 for quality issues (e.g. no allocation concealment); six because they were not randomised controlled trials; 12 because they were duplicate publications, and six because the IUD tested is no longer in use or they are other IUDs.</P>

Sivin [<LINK REF="STD-Sivin-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Sivin 1990</LINK>] used linear congruent method for randomisation, and van Kets [<LINK REF="STD-Van-Kets-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Van Kets 1995</LINK>] prepared a random list for each investigator. Haugen [<LINK REF="STD-Haugen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Haugen 2007</LINK>] randomised in blocks of ten. Baveja [<LINK REF="STD-Baveja-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Baveja 1989</LINK>] also used constrained randomisation, with equal number of women assigned to each device and separate random permutation for each centre. Several issues with the Baveja trial suggest caution in interpretation of its results. It is not clear what 'constrained' randomisation exactly means, there is imbalance in numbers allocated to high versus low copper IUD groups and one centre dropped out after recruiting more than 150 women and the data for those women are not available. In the Arowojolu trial [<LINK REF="STD-Arowojolu-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Arowojolu 1995</LINK>], women randomly and blindly picked up an envelope. The rest of the included trials did not further specify the randomisation process.</P>
<P>	<B>Allocation concealment:</B> Allocation concealment was rated 'A' for 14 trials and 'B' (unclear) for the rest (see table of included studies). A number of the latter reported the use of sealed envelopes, but did not specify that the envelopes were sealed or opaque, so concealment could not be assumed.</P>
<P>	<B>Blinding:</B> Double blinding was described for two trials without further information [<LINK REF="STD-Arowojolu-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Arowojolu 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Petersen-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Petersen 1991</LINK>].

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>The review includes 18 comparisons of 10 different IUDs. Data from trials that could not be incorporated into the meta-analyses, because the standard errors were not published, are presented in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>.<BR/>	<B>	<BR/>Comparisons:</B>	<BR/>	<I>1. MLCu375 vs TCu380A <BR/>	</I>Three multicentre trials (7048 women) were included in this meta-analysis [<LINK REF="STD-Cole-1985C" TYPE="STUDY">Cole 1985C</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sastrawinata-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Sastrawinata 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-WHO-1994" TYPE="STUDY">WHO 1994</LINK>]. The TCu380A was more effective in preventing pregnancy than the MLCu375 at all time intervals to 10 years. The rate difference (RD) at 1, 2, 6 and 10 years was 0.60% (95% CI 0.13% to 1.06%), 1.10% (95% CI 0.29% to 1.90%), 1.52% (95% CI 0.08% to 2.95%) and 1.90% (95% CI 0.12% to 3.59%) respectively. The six and 10-year data were from one trial (<LINK REF="STD-WHO-1994" TYPE="STUDY">WHO 1994</LINK>). There tended to be more expulsions with MLCu375 with longer duration of use, and those were statistically significant from the fourth year of follow-up. The rate difference at 10 years was 3.50% (95% CI 0.44% to 6.56%). However, the ectopic pregnancy rate was lower with MLCu375, although this was statistically significant only after 10 years of follow-up, and the rate difference was small (RD -0.70%; 95% CI -1.33% to -0.07%). </P>
<P>There was no significant difference in removals for bleeding and/or pain in the first two years. However, in the large WHO trial there were fewer removals for bleeding alone with MLCu375 in the fourth and sixth year of use (RD -1.80%; 95%CI -3.61% to 0.01% and RD -3.16%; 95% CI -5.61% to -0.71%, respectively). There were also fewer removals because of excessive bleeding and pain in this trial in the same years. Both are reflected in the reduced total medical removal rate in these years with MLCu375 (RD -2.60%; 95% CI -4.96% to -0.24% and RD -3.75%; 95% CI -6.82% to -0.68% respectively). There are no data published for individual menstrual-related reasons for later years, but the differences appear to have been reduced or eliminated, as by the tenth year of follow-up in the WHO trial, there was no difference in total medical removals (RD -0.60%; 95% CI -4.62% to 3.42%).<BR/>There are two other reports of trials comparing the same IUDs but the data could not be incorporated in the meta-analyses. <LINK REF="STD-Champion-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Champion 1988</LINK> presented two and three -year follow-up data from some of the centres included in <LINK REF="STD-Cole-1985C" TYPE="STUDY">Cole 1985C</LINK>, which showed similar results to the earlier years. The small Arowojolu [1995] trial found no significant difference in pregnancy rates and expulsions, as no significant difference in removals for bleeding or pain (see <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). Data from this trial, and other trials which could not be incorporated into the meta-analyses because the standard errors were not published, are presented in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>.<BR/>	<I>	<BR/>2. MLCu250 vs TCu380A <BR/>	</I>One trial compared these devices [<LINK REF="STD-Farr-1994A" TYPE="STUDY">Farr 1994A</LINK>], reporting on outcomes after 1 year of use only. There were fewer pregnancies in the group receiving TCu380A compared to the MLCu250 after 1 year (RD 1.00%, 95%CI 0.24% to 1.76%). There were no statistically significant differences in expulsion, discontinuation for bleeding and pain or other medical or non-medical reasons between the devices.<BR/>	<I>	<BR/>3. TCu380S vs TCu380A <BR/>	</I>Two large trials were included in this comparison (2564 women). One trial lasted four years [<LINK REF="STD-Sivin-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Sivin 1990</LINK>] and the other five years [<LINK REF="STD-Bahamondes-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bahamondes 1999</LINK>]. There tended to be fewer pregnancies with TCu380S after the first year, which was statistically significant in the fourth year (RD -1.62%, -3.00% to -0.24%). There were more expulsions with TCu380S (RD 2.86%, 95% CI 1.04% to 4.68% at 1 year, and 3.50%, 95% CI 0.36 to 6.63% at 4 years). There were no statistical differences in removal rates for bleeding and/or pain, PID or other medical reasons for discontinuation. <BR/>	<I>	<BR/>4. TCu220 vs TCu380A <BR/>	</I>Three trials (4647 women) were included in this meta-analysis [<LINK REF="STD-Baveja-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Baveja 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Farr-1994B" TYPE="STUDY">Farr 1994B</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-WHO-1990C" TYPE="STUDY">WHO 1990C</LINK>]. One year results for pregnancy showed significant heterogeneity in the two trials reporting this outcome [<LINK REF="STD-Baveja-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Baveja 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Farr-1994B" TYPE="STUDY">Farr 1994B</LINK>]. Similarly, there was heterogeneity between <LINK REF="STD-WHO-1990C" TYPE="STUDY">WHO 1990C</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Baveja-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Baveja 1989</LINK> at year three. In the Baveja trial there tended to be fewer pregnancies with TCu220, while in the other two trials there tended to be more. The <LINK REF="STD-WHO-1990C" TYPE="STUDY">WHO 1990C</LINK> trial reported additional follow-up results at 5, 7, 8, 10 and 12 years, all consistently showing higher pregnancy rates with TCu220. There were no statistically significant differences for ectopic pregnancy, expulsion, perforation or discontinuation either due to bleeding, pain, infection, or all use related discontinuations between the comparison groups. In the <LINK REF="STD-Chen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2003</LINK> trial there were no differences in reported pregnancies or removals for bleeding and/or pain, but there were more expulsions with TCu380A at 5 and 10 years of follow-up.<BR/>	<I>	<BR/>5. TCu200 vs TCu380A <BR/>	</I>Four trials (6372 women) were included in this comparison [<LINK REF="STD-Baveja-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Baveja 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Farr-1994A" TYPE="STUDY">Farr 1994A</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Shrestha-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Shrestha 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sivin-1979A" TYPE="STUDY">Sivin 1979A</LINK>] with maximum follow-up of 3 years. Here again, the <LINK REF="STD-Baveja-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Baveja 1989</LINK> trial introduced heterogeneity, with fewer pregnancies in the TCu380A group in the other three trials but not in the Baveja trial. When the trials were combined (using random effects model), there were more pregnancies in the TCu200 group at 1 year (RD 1.42%, 95% CI 0.09% to 2.76%), but at 2 years there was no statistically significant difference between the groups (RD 2.32%, 95% CI -1.18% to 5.82%). Only one trial reported results after 3 years of use [<LINK REF="STD-Baveja-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Baveja 1989</LINK>], showing no difference between the groups. There were fewer discontinuations due to bleeding and pain in the TCu200 group after 1 and 2 years (RD -1.9%, 95% CI -3.27% to -0.53% and RD -3.38%, 95% CI -5.33% to -1.44%) but no difference after 3 years of use. There was no statistically significant difference in the number of expulsions, perforations, infections, other medical or non-medical reasons and overall continuation or discontinuation rates between the groups.<BR/>	<I>	<BR/>6. Cu-Safe 300 vs TCu380A <BR/>	</I>One small trial involving 600 women with a follow-up to 3 years was included in the review [<LINK REF="STD-Van-Kets-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Van Kets 1995</LINK>]. The trial was too small to detect an excess pregnancy rate of 1% with Cu-Safe300 at 3 years (95% CI -3.10% to 5.10%). There was a tendency towards more expulsions and towards fewer removals for bleeding and pain with Cu-Safe 300 with both almost reaching statistical significance. The trial report states these latter results are statistically significant, but this is not consistent with the published results.<BR/>	<I>	<BR/>7. Cu7 vs TCu380A<BR/>	</I>	<LINK REF="STD-Cole-1985B" TYPE="STUDY">Cole 1985B</LINK> found no statistically significant difference in one year rates for pregnancies or expulsions, or removals for bleeding and/or pain, or other medical reasons (see <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>)<BR/>	<I>	<BR/>8. NovaT380 vs TCu380S<BR/>	</I>One study [<LINK REF="STD-Haugen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Haugen 2007</LINK>)] compared these devices in 1005 women. There was twice the number of pregnancies in the NovaT380 group, statistically significant at the end of the first year of use (RD 1.40%, 0.30% to 2.50% at year 1, RD 2.30%, -0.64% to 5.24% at year 5). The overall expulsion rates were similar, although there were fewer partial expulsions with NovaT380. There were no statistically differences in removal rates for bleeding, pain, dysmenorrhoea PID or other medical reasons, and overall discontinuation rates were similar.<BR/>	<I>	<BR/>9. TCu220 vs MLCu375<BR/>	</I>One trial with a follow-up of one year was included in this comparison [<LINK REF="STD-Ho-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 1992</LINK>]. There was no difference in the number of pregnancies, expulsions, discontinuations due to medical reasons or continuation rates between the comparison groups.<BR/>	<I>	<BR/>10. MLCu250 vs MLCu375<BR/>	</I>This comparison includes two small trials with a follow-up of three years [<LINK REF="STD-Bratt-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Bratt 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1992</LINK>]. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups for pregnancy after one year (RD 0.50%; 95% CI -1.97% to 0.93%), two years ( RD 0.02%; 95% CI -2.45% to 2.50%) and three years ( RD 0.79; 95% CI -2.19 to 3.78) or expulsions. The two studies were heterogenous for discontinuations for bleeding and pain. The combined results (random effects model) showed no statistical difference between the devices, and there was no statistical difference in discontinuation for PID, other medical reasons, planned pregnancy and other personal reasons. <BR/>	<I>	<BR/>11. Nova T vs MLCu375<BR/>	</I>Three trials involving a total of around 2400 women were included in this comparison with follow-up of up to three years [<LINK REF="STD-Bratt-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Bratt 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Saure-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Saure 1985</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1992</LINK>]. The combined rate differences for pregnancy and discontinuation for bleeding and pain were not statistically significant different between the two groups for 1, 2 or 3 years of follow-up. There was no statistically significant difference in rates for discontinuation due to PID, other medical or personal reasons or all discontinuations. <BR/>	<I>	<BR/>12. MLCu250 vs TCu220<BR/>	</I>One trial reported outcomes for one and two years [<LINK REF="STD-Goh-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Goh 1983</LINK> A]; and another trial at three years [<LINK REF="STD-WHO-1990A" TYPE="STUDY">WHO 1990A</LINK>]. There tended to be more pregnancies with MLCu250, but statistically significant at the end of the second year only (RD 2.20%; 95% CI 0.18% to 4.22%). The results were similar for both groups for expulsions and removals for different medical and personal reasons.<BR/>	<I>	<BR/>13. Nova T vs TCu220<BR/>	</I>One large trial (3728 women) was included [<LINK REF="STD-WHO-1990B" TYPE="STUDY">WHO 1990B</LINK>], reporting on outcomes at three and five years of use. Pregnancy rates were statistically significant less in the TCu220 group after three and five years of use (RD 2.1%, 95% CI 0.75% to 3.63% and RD 5.5%, 95% CI 2.78% to 8.22%). Discontinuation for non-medical reasons and overall discontinuation rates were also statistically significant less in the TCu220 group after five years of use (RD 5.5%, 95%CI 1.89% to 9.11% and RD 3.7%, 95% CI 0.09% to 7.31%, respectively). Rates for expulsion, ectopic pregnancy, discontinuations due to bleeding and pain or other medical reasons were similar for both groups.<BR/>	<I>	<BR/>14. Cu 7 vs TCu220<BR/>	</I>Four trials were included, reporting on outcomes over two years of use [<LINK REF="STD-Goh-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Goh 1983</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-WHO-1982" TYPE="STUDY">WHO 1982</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-WHO-1983A" TYPE="STUDY">WHO 1983A</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-WHO-1983B" TYPE="STUDY">WHO 1983B</LINK>]. In the TCu220 group, there were fewer pregnancies, expulsions and use related discontinuations. The rates for perforation, ectopic pregnancy, discontinuation due to bleeding and pain, PID or other medical reasons were not statistically different for both groups. <BR/>	<I>	<BR/>15. TCu220 vs TCu200<BR/>	</I>One large trial was included [<LINK REF="STD-Sivin-1979B" TYPE="STUDY">Sivin 1979B</LINK>], reporting on outcomes to two years of use. There were fewer pregnancies in the group using TCu220 at the end of two years of use (RD -3.2%, 95% CI -5.04% to -1.36%). No significant differences in rates for expulsion, discontinuation due to bleeding and pain, other medical or personal reasons and overall discontinuation were shown between the groups.<BR/>	<I>	<BR/>16. Nova T vs TCu200<BR/>	</I>There was one trial included in this comparison [ <LINK REF="STD-Luukkainen-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Luukkainen 1979</LINK>]. There were significantly less pregnancies in the Nova T group after 1, 2 and 3 years of use (RD -1.5%, 95%CI -2.81% to -0.19%; RD -2.6%, 95%CI -4.44% to -0.76%; RD -4.2%, 95%CI -6.59% to -1.81%). There were significantly more expulsions with Nova T by the end of the third year of use (RD 2.9%, 95%CI 0.11% to 5.69%). The rates for discontinuation due to bleeding and pain, PID, other medical or non-medical reasons and overall continuation were similar for the two groups.</P>
<P>	<I>17.

The combined results were similar for both groups for pregnancy (RD 0.94. 95%CI -1.88% to 3.76% at 3 years) , perforation, different reasons for discontinuation and continuation rates.</P>
<P>	<I>18. MLCu250 vs Cu 7</I>	<BR/>Two small trials were included reporting on outcomes up to one [<LINK REF="STD-Petersen-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Petersen 1991</LINK>] and two years of use [<LINK REF="STD-Goh-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Goh 1983</LINK>]. In the Goh trial (564 women) there were less pregnancies, expulsions and overall use related discontinuations in the MLCu250 group after one year of use. Pregnancy rates continued to be lower in the second year, but the difference was not statistically significant different. All use related discontinuations, discontinuation due to bleeding and pain, PID and other medical reasons were similar at two years of use for both groups. Expulsions at two years of use continued to be less frequent in the MLCu250 group (RD -4.50%, 95% CI -7.75% to -1.25%). <LINK REF="STD-Petersen-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Petersen 1991</LINK> compared MLCu375 and Cu7 with shorter version of each device in a trial in 236 nulligravidae.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-05-12 21:14:29 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review includes all IUD trials to date that compared standard framed IUDs. Five alternative plastic frames were assessed. Most frames have versions with different copper loads or placement. Our review has demonstrated that the frame and amount and position of copper all play a part in performance. The T-shaped devices, when carrying a surface area of 380mm<SUP>2</SUP> of copper performed better than other contenders. In general, the comparative analyses suggest higher effectiveness and similar side-effect profile with high copper IUDs compared to low copper ones although some variability exists in different comparisons. In this discussion we focus on the IUDs that are used widely.</P>
<P>Cumulative pregnancy rates for the different IUDs vary between 0.5-2.2% for the smaller (less than 300mm<SUP>2</SUP> of copper) and 0.1-1.0% for the devices with a higher copper load after the first year of use (<LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>) and are 5.8% for the TCu220 compared to 2.2% for the TCu 380A after 12 years of use. The comparative analyses suggest a higher effectiveness and similar side-effect profile with IUDs having larger copper surface areas compared to those with smaller areas, although some variability exists in different comparisons.</P>
<P>TCu380A and TCu380S have the lowest pregnancy rates in the trials. They also have the longest duration of use, which minimises the need for replacement and the attendant problems.</P>
<P>Comparison 1: MLCu375 vs TCu380A<BR/>TCu380A is the superior of these two devices, although the differences were not large. There was a small excess in pregnancies with MLCu375, from around 1% at the end of one year of use to 2% at ten years. MLCu375 also had a higher expulsion rate, appearing from the third year of use. Most of the data comparing these two devices come from one trial [<LINK REF="STD-WHO-1994" TYPE="STUDY">WHO 1994</LINK>], and 54% of women taking part in this ongoing trial are in China [<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2004b</LINK>] (see <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>). The pregnancy rate in both arms of this trial is significantly higher amongst the Chinese participants compared to non-Chinese, at least part of which will be explained by the much reduced loss-to-follow-up at Chinese centres (TCu380A 5.8% and MLCu375 6.8%, and 25.9% and 21.8% in non-Chinese at 10 years). The pregnancy rate at ten years of use was 70% higher with MLCu375 compared to TCu380A in the Chinese centres where there was a low loss rate, but similar in the non-Chinese centres with the high loss rate. The low loss rate in the Chinese cohort and the high quality of the WHO trial generally, supports the conclusion that TCu380A performs better than MLCu375.</P>
<P>Removal for bleeding and pain are generally the main reasons for use-related removals in IUD trials. There is a suggestion that troublesome bleeding and pain may be less of a problem with MLCu375, as was found in the WHO trial at four and six years. No data on these outcomes is available for later years, but the similarity in total medical removals at 10 years of follow-up suggest that any benefit did not persist and may have been due to chance.</P>
<P>The simplicity of the insertion technique for MLCu375 and the smaller diameter of the insertion tube, may make this IUD appropriate in some circumstances. But if insertions are easier with MLCu375, this was not shown in the large <LINK REF="STD-WHO-1994" TYPE="STUDY">WHO 1994</LINK> trial. There were five reported failed insertions with MLCu375 and three with TCu380A (p=0.46).</P>
<P>Comparison 3: TCu380S vs TCu380A<BR/>The one device that performed as well, if not better than TCu380A, was the modified version of the same device, TCu380S, in which the copper sleeves on the arms are flush with, and at the ends of the plastic arms. The pregnancy rate difference tended to favour TCu380S after the first year, reaching statistical significance in the fourth year of use. This occurred despite more expulsions with TCu380S. Apart from this, the modified version performed similarly to its progenitor. The validity of both of the trials making this comparison is unlikely to have been affected by selection bias as the allocation was concealed in both. The blinding of the women in the <LINK REF="STD-Sivin-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Sivin 1990</LINK> trial should have partially prevented other potential biases from funding of the trials by the manufacturer of TCu380S.</P>
<P>Anecdotal evidence suggests some clinicians find it easier to load the narrower arms of the modified device into the inserter tube, as the whole of the arms and not just the tips can fit into the inserter tube. Some also find that a modification of the inserter tube for TCu380S, in which the device is pushed through the tube from below, eases the loading, but this insertion tube has a slightly wider diameter.</P>
<P>Comparison 4: TCu220 vs TCu380A<BR/>TCu220 differs from TCu380A in that the copper coil on the stem of the TCu380A frame is replaced by copper sleeves, which have a smaller total copper surface area. This difference in copper load may be the reason for its lower effectiveness in preventing pregnancy. In this review it was apparent from the fifth year of use. Apart from that, the two IUDs performed similarly, notably with no difference in removals for bleeding and pain, despite the difference in copper load. Most of the data in the later years for this comparison comes from one trial [<LINK REF="STD-WHO-1990C" TYPE="STUDY">WHO 1990C</LINK>], which had high, though similar, loss-to-follow-up rates, which reduces our confidence in the conclusion that TCu380A is the superior IUD. The pregnancy rate in the <LINK REF="STD-Baveja-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Baveja 1989</LINK> trial tended to be lower with TCu220 compared to TCu380A. This may be due to chance, as the pregnancy rate with TCu220 in this trial was unusually low, while the rate for TCu380A was high when compared to the performance of these IUDs in other trials in this review. Also, the possibility of selection bias has to be considered, as the methods used to conceal allocation in the Baveja trial were not described.</P>
<P>Comparison 8. NovaT380 vs TCu380S<BR/>In the <LINK REF="STD-Haugen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Haugen 2007</LINK> study, the sample size was based on removal rates for bleeding and pain, and the study was underpowered to detect a clinically significant doubling of pregnancy rates with NovaT380 compared to TCu380S. Apart from the difference in efficacy, these devices performed similarly. While there were fewer partial expulsions with NovaT380, the overall expulsion rates did not differ. IUD expulsions, partial or complete, are important primarily if they result in pregnancy. Expulsions that result in pregnancy are recorded as pregnancies. There were fewer pregnancies with TCu380A. Three other trials in this review compared expulsion rates with NovaT and copper T framed devices. The expulsion rates were similar in <LINK REF="STD-Batar-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Batar 1987</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-WHO-1990B" TYPE="STUDY">WHO 1990B</LINK> and higher with NovaT in the <LINK REF="STD-Luukkainen-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Luukkainen 1979</LINK> trial.</P>
<P>Comparison 10: MLCu250 vs MLCu375<BR/>Trials using these two devices are easy to blind throughout the course of the trial as the devices are very similar and have the same coloured strings. Unfortunately, this does not appear to have been done in either of the two included studies. In none of the outcomes reviewed were there any differences in performance between these devices, either in the individual trials or in the meta-analyses. The one exception was removals for bleeding and pain in the <LINK REF="STD-Bratt-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Bratt 1988</LINK> trial, which found a statistically lower rate of removals with the lower copper load device at one year, different from Wilson [<LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1992</LINK>] who found no difference between the devices. The data does not support using the lower copper-load device to minimise problems with excessive bleeding or pain. Importantly, the two trials terminated at three years duration, after which time any improved efficacy in preventing pregnancy with a higher copper load device, and any excess removals for bleeding and pain, might have become apparent. If a Multiload device is preferred, the data gives no support to use the one with less copper, MLCu250, when MLCu375 has been shown to provide effective long-term contraception.</P>
<P>Comparison 11: NovaT vs MLCu375<BR/>Poor reporting of the trials making this comparison means that we do not know whether the women received the type of device to which they had been randomly allocated, making selection bias possible. Some of these studies may have been funded by a manufacturer, and tight research methods are particularly important. The direction of any possible bias is unknown. Loss-to-follow-up rates were low in the Wilson trial (<LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1992</LINK>), and are not given in <LINK REF="STD-Saure-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Saure 1985</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Bratt-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Bratt 1988</LINK>. In the three trials, the two devices performed similarly, and there were no differences in outcomes in the meta-analyses.</P>
<P>Problems at insertion (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>)<BR/>Interestingly, despite the 5 different frames, different IUD insertion tubes and different insertion techniques, there were no differences in reported problems at insertion. Sixteen trials reported insertion failure rates. On average one in 300 insertions failed, and there were no differences between the devices.</P>
<P>At a theoretical level, the NovaT, Multiload and Cu-Safe devices, which are narrower at insertion, could be easier to insert. Eight trials reported failed insertion with a Multiload compared to a T-shaped device. In none of the trials was there a statistically significant difference in failure to insert. Three trials reported the numbers requiring dilation when either a Multiload or a T-shaped device was used. There was no difference in the rates. Two trials comparing a NovaT to a T-shaped device found no difference in the number of insertions that were reported as 'difficult', or in which the insertion failed. <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1992</LINK> was the only trial that found a difference at insertion. There were more insertions recorded as difficult with NovaT compared to the two Multiload devices combined, but there was no difference in the number of failed insertions. There were no differences in reported pain at insertion in the seven trials that reported this outcome. Likewise there was no difference between the devices in six trial that reported the numbers of perforations, and the six trials that reported cumulative perforation rates, some up to 12 years, showed no statistical difference in perforation rates. The trial data reported here suggest no type of device is easier to insert or causes less pain at insertion than another. However, almost all of the women included in the trials were multiparous, so this may or may not apply to women who have not had children.</P>
<P>Nulliparous women<BR/>Increasingly, women who have not had children are choosing an IUD as their preferred method of contraception. WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use advises that nulliparous women can generally use the method [<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2004a</LINK>]. The optimum IUD for these women is unknown, however. Most of the trials include only parous women, and most trials that do include women who have not had children have not published a subgroup analysis to determine performance in nulliparous women. Sivin reported separated data for nulliparous and parous women in the trials comparing TCu380A to TCu200 and TCu220 to TCu200 [<LINK REF="STD-Sivin-1979A" TYPE="STUDY">Sivin 1979A</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sivin-1979B" TYPE="STUDY">Sivin 1979B</LINK>]. The performance of the IUDs did not appear to vary by parity. The Petersen trial included nulliparous women only, but is too small and inadequately reported to provide valid information [<LINK REF="STD-Petersen-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Petersen 1991</LINK>]. We were unable to include the Otero-Flores (<LINK REF="STD-Otero_x002d_Flores-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Otero-Flores 2003</LINK>) trial because of the apparent unreliability of the reporting (<LINK REF="REF-Sivin-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sivin 2004</LINK>). There is insufficient evidence to address whether a shorter stem offers any advantage in nulliparous women.</P>
<P>Choice of IUD<BR/>The International Planned Parenthood Federation recommends that 'only one type of IUD be used in any service delivery setting; at the most, two with similar insertion techniques may be used. This specialization will help the staff inserting the devices to maintain a high level of skill.' On the evidence reviewed here, which includes all randomised trials of framed IUDs, TCu380A or TCu380S should be the device of first choice, but there seems to be no place for a second device with a similar insertion technique, as this would suggest TCu200 or TCu220, which offer no advantage over their sister devices.</P>
<P>Quality of trials<BR/>The quality of reporting in many of the trials was poor. Only about one quarter of included trials reported secure allocation concealment; most trials did not specify the randomisation procedures or adhered to the intention to treat principle. Few trials provided definitions for their outcomes, such as PID, expulsion (e.g. WHO 1983A). In case of expulsion it may include cases of small displacement in one trial and entire expulsion in others. The continuation rates in the long-term WHO studies were good (&lt; 77% after 3 years; 25-30% after 8 years) giving more stability to the results.</P>
<P>Many of the trials last for one or two years, which is shorter than the expected use of the devices, which limits the value of those trials when choosing an IUD. Trials should last for at least three years.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>TCu380A is the preferred IUD over MLCu375, MLCu250, TCu220, TCu200 and Cu-Safe300. Indirect evidence suggests that it performs superiorly to NovaT and Cu7. TCu380S may be preferred to TCu380A for those who find it difficult to load the TCu380A, as it is at least as effective at TCu380A, although it may have a higher expulsion rate. None of the IUDs were easier to insert than another, so this review does not support selecting one over another to facilitate insertion. There is no evidence that any particular framed copper device is better suited to nulliparous women.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>It is unlikely that new IUDs will be much more effective than TCu380A in short-term use. Contending IUDs will need to be studies in large number over a long period of time. Well-conducted randomised trials comparing devices which are smaller at insertion and smaller in-situ with TCu380A or TCu380S could identify more suitable IUDs for nulliparous women or those with a tight cervical canal. In common with other systematic reviews in this field, we appeal for transparency in reporting trials and adherence to CONSORT guidelines, and ask journal peer reviewers to ensure that authors follow the guidelines. </P>
