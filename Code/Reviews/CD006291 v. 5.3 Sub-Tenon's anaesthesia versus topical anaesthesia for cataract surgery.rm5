<TITLE>Sub-Tenon's anaesthesia versus topical anaesthesia for pain control and better operating conditions for cataract surgery</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-08-26 11:11:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Cataract is the most common cause of low vision and blindness; it is usually due to the normal ageing process but may be found in younger people. Cataract occurs as loss of the natural clearness of the lens of the eye. A cataract is treated by surgery to remove the lens and replace it with an artificial one. Surgery ideally should be performed within six months of diagnosis to avoid further loss of vision. Debate continues as to which local anaesthetic technique provides better pain relief for the patient and facilitates the task of the surgeon at the same time.</P>
<P>Topical anaesthesia is provided by placing local anaesthetic drops or gel of local anaesthetics on the surface of the eye. Sub-Tenon's anaesthesia is provided by first numbing the surface of the eye with local anaesthetic drops, holding the tissue lining (conjunctiva and Tenon&#8217;s capsule) in front of the eye with blunt tweezers and making a small nick in it using curved blunt-ended scissors. A small blunt sub-Tenon's cannula is passed through this hole to inject local anaesthetic into sub-Tenon's space. Advantages of topical anaesthesia over sub-Tenon's block include reduced time in administration, less pain during administration and shorter duration of action, allowing the person to rapidly regain sight after surgery.</P>
<P>We included eight randomized controlled trials in the review, and we based our analysis on seven of these: two cross-over trials that included 125 participants, and five parallel trials involving 492 participants. The mean age of participants varied from 71.5 years to 83.5 years. Oral sedation was used for two trials only. No trial used oral analgesics before the operation, and no trials mentioned their source of funding. This review showed that sub-Tenon&#8217;s anaesthesia provided slightly better pain relief than topical anaesthesia during cataract surgery. The difference was equal to 1.1 on a scale from 0 to 10. Pain on the day after surgery was slightly lower for participants who received topical anaesthesia, and the difference was equivalent to 0.2 on a scale from 0 to 10. Both surgeons and participants preferred sub-Tenon&#8217;s anaesthesia. However, all trials were performed at a time when surgeons were only starting to use topical anaesthesia. There was not enough evidence from included trials to say whether one anaesthetic technique would be associated with a lower or higher incidence of important surgical complications during surgery (posterior capsular tear, iris prolapse) that may lead to postoperative complications and eventually to poorer vision. Topical anaesthesia and sub-Tenon&#8217;s anaesthesia therefore are accepted and safe methods of providing anaesthesia for cataract surgery.</P>

<P>Local anaesthesia for cataract surgery can be provided by sub-Tenon's or topical anaesthesia. Both techniques offer possible advantages. This review, which originally was published in 2007 and was updated in 2014, was undertaken to compare these two anaesthetic techniques.</P>

<P>Our objectives were to compare the effectiveness of topical anaesthesia (with or without intracameral local anaesthetic) versus sub-Tenon's anaesthesia in providing pain relief during cataract surgery.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-08-26 11:11:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>We included eight studies in this updated review but could retain in the analysis only seven studies on 742 operated eyes of 617 participants. Two cross-over trials included 125 participants, and five parallel trials included 492 participants. These studies were published between 1997 and 2005. The mean age of participants varied from 71.5 years to 83.5 years. The female proportion of participants varied from 54% to 76%. Compared with sub-Tenon's anaesthesia, topical anaesthesia (with or without intracameral injection) for cataract surgery increases intraoperative pain but decreases postoperative pain at 24 hours. The amplitude of the effect (equivalent to 1.1 on a score from 0 to 10 for intraoperative pain, and to 0.2 on the same scale for postoperative pain at 24 hours), although statistically significant, was probably too small to be of clinical relevance. The quality of the evidence was rated as high for intraoperative pain and moderate for pain at 24 hours. We did find differences in pain during administration of local anaesthetic (low level of evidence), and indications that surgeon satisfaction (low level of evidence) and participant satisfaction (moderate level of evidence) were less with topical anaesthesia. There was not enough evidence to say that one technique would result in a higher or lower incidence of intraoperative complications compared with the other.<BR/>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-08-24 14:52:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Both topical anaesthesia and sub-Tenon's anaesthesia are accepted and safe methods of providing anaesthesia for cataract surgery. An acceptable degree of intraoperative discomfort has to be expected with either of these techniques. Randomized controlled trials on the effects of various strategies to prevent intraoperative pain during cataract surgery could prove useful.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-08-25 18:13:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-08-25 18:13:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>The World Health Organization (WHO) defines normal vision as 20/25 or better, and near normal vision as 20/30 to 20/60. By this definition, the prevalence of low vision/blindness (worse than 20/60) in Canada would be 22 per 10,000 (<LINK REF="REF-Maberley-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maberley 2006</LINK>). The incidence increases with age: 52 per 10,000 population for individuals 65 to 74 years old; 416 per 10,000 population for those 75 to 84 years old; and 904 per 10,000 population for individuals 85 years of age and older (<LINK REF="REF-Maberley-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maberley 2006</LINK>). By the same definitions, cataract and cataract complications account for 29.9% (95% confidence interval (CI) 23.5% to 37.1%) of the causes of abnormal vision (<LINK REF="REF-Maberley-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maberley 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Cataract is defined as loss of transparency of the natural lens of the eye, usually due to the ageing process. It can be found in younger people secondary to congenital, drug-induced, inflammatory or traumatic causes. Surgery is the only recognized treatment. Cataract surgery is actually the most commonly performed elective procedure (<LINK REF="REF-Malot-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malot 2011</LINK>). Phacoemulsification with intraocular lens insertion is the technique of choice in the vast majority of countries (<LINK REF="REF-Behndig-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Behndig 2011</LINK>). Surgery ideally should be performed within six months (possibly within six weeks) of diagnosis. Compared with those who waited six weeks or less, people who waited six months or longer experienced greater vision loss, reduced quality of life and an increased rate of falls (<LINK REF="REF-Hodge-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodge 2007</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-08-25 18:13:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Local anaesthesia (with or without sedation) is the anaesthetic technique used today for the vast majority of patients (<LINK REF="REF-Eichel-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eichel 2005</LINK>), and surgery is usually performed on an ambulatory basis (<LINK REF="REF-Malot-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malot 2011</LINK>). Local anaesthesia may consist of retrobulbar blocks, peribulbar blocks, sub-Tenon's blocks or topical anaesthesia (with or without intracameral injection) (<LINK REF="REF-Alhassan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alhassan 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ezra-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ezra 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nouvellon-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nouvellon 2010</LINK>). The ideal anaesthetic technique should provide excellent analgesia with a low rate of complications. In the light of the large number of surgeries performed each year - a number that may increase with aging of the population - the ideal technique should also be cost efficient.</P>
<P>Retrobulbar anaesthesia, which consists of injection of 3 to 5 mL of local anaesthetic inside the muscular cone, was the first block used for cataract surgery. However, it has been associated with rare but severe potential complications: retrobulbar haemorrhage, globe perforation, optic nerve injury, extraocular muscle damage and brain stem anaesthesia (<LINK REF="REF-Nouvellon-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nouvellon 2010</LINK>). For these reasons, retrobulbar anaesthesia has been replaced by peribulbar anaesthesia, defined as injection of local anaesthetic into the extraconal space (up to 12 mL). Although reduced risk of complications was expected with peribulbar anaesthesia as compared with retrobulbar anaesthesia, needle-related complications were reported with peribulbar anaesthesia, and a clear advantage of one technique over the other was never formally demonstrated (<LINK REF="REF-Alhassan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alhassan 2008</LINK>). Sub-Tenon's anaesthesia (episcleral or parabulbar anaesthesia) consists of the injection of 3 to 5 mL of local anaesthetic inside the episcleral space. The local anaesthetic can be injected through a blunt cannula after opening a small button hole into the conjunctiva and Tenon&#8217;s capsule with a blunt Wescott scissors, while the conjunctiva is grasped with a small forceps. As the technique avoids injection through a blindly inserted needle, it is believed to be safer than retrobulbar or peribulbar block.</P>
<P>Inroduced in the 1990s, topic anaesthesia has become the most commonly used form of anaesthesia for cataract surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Malot-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malot 2011</LINK>). Local anaesthetic (in drop or gel form) is placed on the surface of the eye. This may be supplemented intraoperatively by injection of local anaesthetic into the anterior chamber of the eye with a blunt needle through the operative incision (intracameral) (<LINK REF="REF-Ezra-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ezra 2007</LINK>). </P>

<P>Advantages of topical anaesthesia over sub-Tenon's block include reduced time in administration (&#8805; 12 patients per operating room per day) (<LINK REF="REF-Malot-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malot 2011</LINK>), shorter duration of action, allowing the patient to rapidly regain sight after surgery, and less pain during administration of anaesthesia (<LINK REF="STD-Mathew-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mathew 2003</LINK>).</P>

<P>This is an update of a previous Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Davison-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davison 2007</LINK>). In the previous version, review authors concluded that topical anaesthesia was associated with a slight difference in pain experienced during the intraoperative period (mean difference (MD) 1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83 to 1.72) and a greater incidence of posterior capsule tear and vitreous loss (4.3% vs 2.1%). This current version of the review was undertaken to look for new studies and to update methods.</P>

<LI>Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias): We considered the trial adequate if all dropouts or withdrawals were accounted for, if the number of dropouts was small (&lt; 20%) and was similar for both interventions and if reasons for dropping out seemed reasonable. We considered the trial inadequate for this specific item if reasons for dropping out were not stated or did not sound reasonable or if the number was high (&#8805; 20%) or was vastly different between groups.</LI>
<LI>Selective reporting (reporting bias): We considered the trial to have low risk of bias if all measurements stated in the Methods section were included in the Results section, and at high risk of bias if only some of the results mentioned in the Methods section were given in the Results section. Per-protocol results (not ITT) were considered as selective reporting.</LI>

<P>As much as was feasible, we reported results as risk ratios (RRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for dichotomous data, and as mean differences and 95% CIs for continuous data. If some of the continuous data were given on different scales, we produced results as standardized mean differences (SMDs) and 95% CIs. For SMDs, we considered 0.2 a small effect, 0.5 a medium effect and &#8805; 0.8 a large effect (<LINK REF="REF-Pace-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pace 2011</LINK>). When an effect was noted, a number needed to treat for additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) or a number needed to treat for additional harmful outcome (NNTH) was calculated from the odds ratio.</P>

Pain during surgery was greater with topical anaesthesia than with sub-Tenon's anaesthesia (SMD 0.64, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.84; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 36%; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). With one high-quality trial used as a standard (<LINK REF="STD-Srinivasan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Srinivasan 2004</LINK>; standard deviation (SD) 2.3), this would correspond to a visual/verbal analogical pain scale (VAS) score of 1.5 on a scale from 0 to 10. Egger's regression intercept showed that a small-study effect may partially explain the statistical heterogeneity (P value = 0.04 (two-tailed)). Duval and Tweedie's trim and fill analysis showed that two studies might be missing to left of mean for an adjusted point of estimate of 0.55 (95% CI 0.33 to 0.77). When studies were subgrouped by risk of bias for blinding of the outcome assessor, the difference was significantly less in studies in which the outcome assessor was blinded to the anaesthetic technique used (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 83% for heterogeneity between subgroups). The difference measured for this item in studies at low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Sekundo-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sekundo 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Srinivasan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Srinivasan 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zafirakis-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Zafirakis 2001</LINK>) would correspond to a difference in VAS scores of 1.1 on a scale from 0 to 10. We graded the evidence only on the basis of three studies at low risk of bias. In the light of results of one low risk of bias study (<LINK REF="STD-Srinivasan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Srinivasan 2004</LINK>; SD of sub-Tenon's group 2.2), 120 participants (60 per group) were required to eliminate a difference of 1/10 in VAS score (from 3.4 to 2.4) (alpha 0.05; beta 0.2; one-sided test).</P>

One study author (<LINK REF="STD-Srinivasan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Srinivasan 2004</LINK>) reported 3/65 posterior capsular tears compared with 2/136, and 0/65 cases of iris prolapsus compared with 1/136 for topical and sub-Tenon's anaesthesia, respectively (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Two other study authors reported no intraoperative complications (<LINK REF="STD-Sekundo-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sekundo 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vielpeau-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Vielpeau 1999</LINK>); this information is not available for the other studies. Given an incidence of posterior capsular tear of 1%, 116,884 events (58,442 per group) would be required to eliminate an increase of 15% in incidence (alpha 0.05; beta 0.2; one-sided test).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2015-08-26 11:12:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>We included in this updated review eight randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that met our inclusion criteria of evaluating topical anaesthesia against sub-Tenon's anaesthesia for cataract surgery. Of these eight trials, we included seven in our analyses. We have described above the methodological shortcomings of these studies. Only two studies specified the method of randomization (<LINK REF="STD-R_x00fc_schen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rüschen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Srinivasan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Srinivasan 2004</LINK>), and the method of randomization was considered at high risk for one study (three groups with unequal numbers and different surgeons for different groups; <LINK REF="STD-Mathew-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mathew 2003</LINK>) (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>).</P>
<P>All studies used different combinations of local anaesthetic agents in differing amounts and concentrations. For the purposes of this review, it was assumed that all were fit for the purpose for which they were used, that is, provision of anaesthesia by topical or sub-Tenon's administration for a standard cataract surgery. Comparison of the effectiveness of local anaesthetic agents was outside the remit of this review. The same is true for the different types of operating techniques used (clear corneal incision and scleral tunnel with or without sutures). Throughout the world, different drugs and techniques are used for cataract surgery, so we included all studies in the review.</P>
<P>For the outcome of pain experienced during surgery, as compared with the previous version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Davison-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davison 2007</LINK>), we were able to enter six studies into this updated version (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>) (vs only four). In doing so, we found that the difference between anaesthetic techniques was overestimated in studies in which there was uncertainty around blinding of outcome assessor to the anaesthetic technique used (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). If the outcome assessor was adequately blinded to the anaesthetic technique used, the difference in pain experienced during surgery was equivalent to 1.1 on a score from 0 to 10. It is notable that none of the investigators gave oral analgesics to participants before performing surgery. Pain during surgery was sometimes noted during cauterization of the episcleral vessels (<LINK REF="STD-Sekundo-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sekundo 2004</LINK>) - a step that can be avoided by making the incision slightly more anterior in the eye. The addition of intracameral local anaesthetic has been proposed to help decrease intraoperative pain among patients undergoing cataract surgery under topical anaesthesia (<LINK REF="REF-Ezra-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ezra 2007</LINK>). Intracameral local anaesthetic injection is a controversial issue. Intracameral local anaesthetics have been shown to be cytotoxic in animal studies, with some local anaesthetics possibly more harmful than others (<LINK REF="REF-Pescosolido-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pescosolido 2011</LINK>). In their review, Ezra et al. found that intracameral local anaesthetic injection decreases intraoperative VAS score (MD -0.27, 95% CI -0.43 to -0.11; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%) on a scale from 0 to 10 (<LINK REF="REF-Ezra-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ezra 2007</LINK>). Although the difference was statistically significant, the clinical relevance of this difference is not obvious. In the present review, intracameral local anaesthetic injection was used in one study only (<LINK REF="STD-Sekundo-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sekundo 2004</LINK>). Results from this study were not different (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>) from those of the other two studies using a similar method (outcome assessor blinded to the technique used) without intracameral injection (<LINK REF="STD-Srinivasan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Srinivasan 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zafirakis-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Zafirakis 2001</LINK>). Pain perception may influence a person's co-operation during surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Omulecki-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Omulecki 2009</LINK>). Pain may be perceived at various stages of surgery including at distention of the anterior chamber (<LINK REF="REF-Hou-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hou 2012</LINK>), and prophylactic application of intraocular pressure-lowering medications may alter pain sensation during phacoemulsification cataract surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Ulas-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ulas 2013</LINK>). Pre-operative administration of 1 gram of oral acetaminophen reduces intraoperative and postoperative pain (<LINK REF="REF-Kaluzny-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaluzny 2010</LINK>). Orally administered anxiolytics given before surgery may improve co-operation of the patients (<LINK REF="REF-Khezri-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khezri 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>In one cross-over trial, participants found that pain related to administration of anaesthesia was significantly greater with sub-Tenon's technique than with topical anaesthesia (SMD -2.21, 95% CI -2.57 to -1.86; in favour of topical anaesthesia; <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). However, the difference was not found when only parallel trials (SMD -0.20, 95% CI -0.43 to 0.04; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%) were considered - a situation that should be closer to everyday clinical practice. Slightly more pain at 24 hours was reported with sub-Tenon's technique compared with topical anaesthesia (SMD -0.47, 95% CI -0.75 to -0.19; equivalent to a mean of 0.2 on a score from 0 to 10). Participant satisfaction and surgeon satisfaction were greater with sub-Tenon's anaesthetic technique. Results for surgeon satisfaction with this technique reported in included studies may have been due to lack of practice with this "new" form of anaesthesia. Indeed, topical anaesthesia is now the preferred technique in the vast majority of cases (&gt; 85%; <LINK REF="REF-Malot-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malot 2011</LINK>), making it clear that with practice, surgeons can perform cataract surgery in most patients using topical anaesthesia only. Patient satisfaction may be different if those studies would be repeated including only surgeons who have a great deal of experience with topical anaesthesia.</P>
<P>In the previous version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Davison-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davison 2007</LINK>), concerns were raised about the fact that a non-statistically significant higher percentage of posterior capsular tear was found in one study for the topical anaesthesia group (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Posterior capsular rupture may be associated with postoperative complications (<LINK REF="REF-Gonzalez-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gonzalez 2014</LINK>). The association of intraoperative and postoperative complications may lead to poorer postoperative visual acuity (<LINK REF="REF-Gonzalez-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gonzalez 2014</LINK>). Authors of the original review (<LINK REF="REF-Davison-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davison 2007</LINK>) speculated that lack of akinesia could increase the chances of sudden inadvertent patient movement with subsequent inadvertent misplacement of a surgical tool by the surgeon. However, the number of participants included in the present updated meta-analysis is insufficient to permit valid conclusions on the incidence of posterior capsular tear with one technique compared with the other (<LINK TAG="INTERVENTION_EFFECTS" TYPE="SECTION">Effects of interventions</LINK>). Lack of akinesia has not been identified as a risk factor for increasing intraoperative surgical complications during cataract surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2013</LINK>). In their meta-analysis, which included 2862 operated eyes, Lee et al. found a rate of 0.74% posterior capsular rupture with akinetic (sub-Tenon's, peribulbar or retrobulbar) techniques (1494 eyes) compared with 0.80% with kinetic (topical with or without intracameral injection) anaesthetic techniques (1368 eyes) (P value = 0.84). Experienced surgeons can easily immobilize an eye by using two tools. Furthermore, certain surgical techniques (e.g. insertion of a multifocal lens; <LINK REF="REF-Hayashi-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hayashi 2015</LINK>) may prove easier to execute with a kinetic technique, allowing patient collaboration during the procedure. Among factors associated with a higher rate of intraoperative complications, one can probably mention dense nuclear sclerosis and white cataracts (<LINK REF="REF-Briszi-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Briszi 2012</LINK>). Age (<LINK REF="REF-Celebi-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Celebi 2014</LINK>), surgical technique (phacoemulsification vs manual small-incision; <LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2013</LINK>) and use of topical anaesthesia in patients unable to lie flat (<LINK REF="REF-Injarie-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Injarie 2013</LINK>) would not be risk factors for intraoperative complications. Allocation of cataract patients to surgeons matched for experience according to a pre-operative assessment of their risk of complications would allow better surgical outcomes, especially for resident surgeons (<LINK REF="REF-Tsinopoulos-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tsinopoulos 2013</LINK>).</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-08-26 11:12:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Compared with sub-Tenon's anaesthesia, topical anaesthesia (with or without intracameral injection) for cataract surgery increases intraoperative pain but decreases postoperative pain at 24 hours. The amplitude of the effect (equivalent to 1.1 on a score from 0 to 10 for intraoperative pain, and to 0.2 on the same scale for postoperative pain at 24 hours), although statistically significant, was probably too small to be of clinical relevance. Therefore, both techniques can be considered suitable for cataract surgery. There is not enough evidence from RCTs to say if one technique would have a higher or lower incidence of intraoperative complications compared with the other.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-08-25 14:14:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Results of the present meta-analysis suggest that both techniques can be used for cataract surgery. On the basis of three studies including 501 participants, in which the outcome assessor was blinded to the anaesthetic technique used, we found that the difference in intraoperative pain (equivalent to 1.1 on a score from 0 to 10, in favour of sub-Tenon's technique) is probably too small to be of clinical relevance. This review does not include enough participants to exclude differences in intraoperative complications between these anaesthetic techniques.</P>

<P>Despite using the same studies, we have had to change the conclusions from those of the original review (<LINK REF="REF-Davison-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davison 2007</LINK>) on the basis of the following.</P>
<OL>
<LI>We were able to pool the data of more studies (different techniques of data extraction). As a result of this, the new analysis shows that the higher level of pain with topic anaesthesia was overestimated by the inclusion of studies in which outcome assessors were not blinded to the anaesthetic technique used.</LI>
<LI>The original review stated that surgeons had a small preference for the sub-Tenon's technique. Possibly because they are now more familiar with topical anaesthesia, surgeons in various countries are telling us by their numbers that they are using almost exclusively topic anaesthesia, or at least in the majority of their patients. We can no longer say that they prefer sub-Tenon's anaesthesia despite the results of RCTs performed years ago; this seems no longer true.</LI>
<LI>The original review stated that topical anaesthesia was associated with a higher rate of intraoperative complications. We have calculated that the number of participants included in our review was insufficient to allow us to present conclusions on this.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Therefore, with the new analysis and integration of actual literature on the topic (up to 2014), we have had to change the conclusions, despite the fact that we did not add new studies to the analysis.</P>
