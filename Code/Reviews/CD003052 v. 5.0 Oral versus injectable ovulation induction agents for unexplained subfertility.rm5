<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>For many couples who cannot become pregnant, no reason is apparent after investigation (unexplained infertility). One treatment option for these couples is for the woman to be given medications to increase the number of eggs she produces each cycle. This treatment is also sometimes combined with a technique of purifying the partner's sperm and injecting it through the woman's cervix at her fertile time. This review of trials looked at which type of these medications, oral-form or injection-form, were the best in producing the most successful outcome. The review found no significant benefit of using one type of medication (oral or injectable) over the other, although there were insufficient data from trials. More research is needed to examine this question.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2008-11-13 09:27:58 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Oral (anti-oestrogens) and injectable (gonadotrophins) ovulation induction agents have been used to increase the number of eggs produced by a woman per cycle in treatment for unexplained subfertility. It is unclear whether there are significant advantages of one type of treatment over the other in this context or in terms of fertility.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the efficacy of oral versus injectable ovulation induction agents for unexplained subfertility. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The search strategy of the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group was used for the identification of relevant randomised controlled trials.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All trials where oral ovulation induction agents were compared with injectable ovulation induction agents in treatment groups generated by randomisation, from couples with unexplained subfertility, were considered for inclusion in the review.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Five randomised controlled trials, including a total of 231 identified couples with unexplained subfertility, were found and included in this review. All trials were assessed for quality criteria. The studied outcomes were pregnancy, live birth, miscarriage, multiple birth, occurrence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and cycle cancellation.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-11-13 09:27:58 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>Where trials with important co-interventions were excluded, there was no significant difference in the odds of beneficial outcomes for oral versus injectable ovulation induction agents - live birth per couple (OR 0.06, 95%CI 0.00 to 1.15), pregnancy per woman (OR 0.33, 95%CI 0.09 to 1.20); nor of detrimental outcomes for injectable versus oral agents - miscarriage (OR 0.11, 95%CI 0.00 to 2.84); there were no reported cases of multiple births, cases of ovarian hyperstimulation or discontinued cycles consequent upon overstimulation.</P>
<P>Where trials with the co-intervention of a human chorionic gonadotrophin trigger injection (given only in the injectable ovulation induction agent treatment arm) were not excluded there was no significant difference in the odds of live birth per couple (OR 0.40, 95%CI 0.15 to1.08). However oral ovulation induction agents had significantly reduced odds of pregnancy per woman compared to injectable ovulation induction agents (OR 0.41, 95%CI 0.17 to 0.80). For detrimental outcomes, there were no significant differences in the odds of miscarriage (OR 0.61, 95%CI 0.09 to 4.01) and multiple birth (OR 1.08, 95%CI 0.16 to 7.03) for injectable versus oral agents. No data were available concerning the occurrence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome nor cycle cancellation.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is insufficient evidence to suggest that oral agents are inferior or superior to injectable agents in the treatment of unexplained subfertility. Information on harms is sketchy, and remains compatible with large differences in either direction. Much larger trials than have previously been undertaken are required to provide information on relative harms as well as benefits.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-11-13 09:40:28 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>The management of subfertility in couples has many different avenues for investigation and treatment, dependent upon the cause of the subfertility. This review deals with couples whose subfertility is unexplained.</P>
<P>Unexplained subfertility is a diagnosis of exclusion, when the standard investigation of both the female and male partner has ruled out other causes of subfertility. In short, the diagnosis encompasses women who can ovulate plus have patent fallopian tubes and there is no male factor subfertility. It does not mean that there is no reason for the subfertility, but that the reason is unable to be identified by routine investigation at that time. Approximately 10 to 15 percent of infertile couples will receive the diagnosis of unexplained subfertility. </P>
<P>Ovulation induction is a rational treatment for women who fail to ovulate. The theory is to encourage the ovaries to produce oocytes (eggs from an ovary), in the hope that they will be available for fertilisation by the male's sperm leading to pregnancy. This theory is extended for treating unexplained subfertility, where the intention is to induce multiple follicular development, where more than one egg is produced - thus increasing the likelihood of fertilisation. Treatments commonly used to induce ovulation are broadly divided into two categories with respect to how they are given to the woman, oral and injectable.</P>
<P>Oral treatments, such as clomiphene citrate or tamoxifen are anti-oestrogens which release the hypothalamus and pituitary gland from the negative feedback effects of oestrogen. The release of gonadotrophin releasing-hormone (GnRH) is enhanced. This hormone stimulates the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the pituitary gland. FSH and LH promote follicle development in the ovary and ovulation respectively. This method is often referred to as the indirect way of increasing gonadotrophins, as opposed to the more direct approach of injectable treatments.</P>
<P>The injectable treatments are gonadotrophins designed to have an action similar to FSH, exerting an effect directly on the ovary to promote follicular development. The first preparations of FSH were extracted from cadaver (a dead person) pituitary glands. However, this was an expensive process and raised concerns about the risk of transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) - as CJD is believed to cross species via brain, spinal cord and other nervous tissue. These preparations were replaced by urinary gonadotrophins such as human menopausal gonadotrophins (hMG), which have significant LH activity in addition to FSH activity. Another drug, urofollitrophin, is a urinary gonadotrophin of higher purity with less LH activity, often referred to as high purity urinary gonadotrophin. The most recent development is the use of genetic based technology to produce recombinant FSH (r-FSH), the purest exogenous form of this hormone. </P>
<P>Ovulation induction agents have an established role in the treatment of subfertility in women who cannot ovulate (anovulation), in the case of clomiphene (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-_x0028_A_x0029_-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes (A) 2000</LINK>), and in the case of gonadotrophins where the woman is resistant to clomiphene (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-_x0028_B_x0029_-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes (B) 2000</LINK>). However the role of ovulation induction agents for controlled ovarian stimulation in unexplained subfertility is less clear. Although their is some evidence that their use might correct subtle cycle disorders such as luteal insufficiency (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1989</LINK>). The use of clomiphene compared to placebo or no treatment in unexplained subfertility has been shown to have a significant but small positive effect on the conception rate for couples with unexplained subfertility (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-_x0028_C_x0029_-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes (C) 2000</LINK>), but this may be counterbalanced by the side effects with clomiphene including multiple pregnancy and symptoms including transient hot flushes and visual disturbances plus hyperstimulation. There has also been a reluctance amongst clinicians to prescribe clomiphene for more than six ovulatory cycles, because of suggestions that this long term use can lead to ovarian cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Balasch-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balasch 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>However, does gonadotrophin therapy offer benefit over anti-oestrogens such as clomiphene in couples with unexplained subfertility? There maybe an increased likelihood of cancellation of a cycle due to over stimulation with gonadotrophin therapy. Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome may also be a risk. The risk of multiple pregnancy and miscarriage must also be considered and finally there are increased costs associated with gonadotrophin therapy compared to oral ovulation agents. Therefore the use of gonadotrophin therapy for unexplained subfertility must be justifiable on the grounds of robust evidence of its effectiveness when compared with anti-oestrogens before it becomes standard clinical practice.</P>
<P>This review aims to summarise the evidence for gonadotrophin therapy versus anti-oestrogens for controlled ovarian stimulation in unexplained subfertility.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The primary objective of this review was to compare the effectiveness of oral ovulation induction agents (anti-oestrogens) and injectable ovulation induction (gonadotrophins) treatments for controlled ovarian stimulation in the treatment of unexplained subfertility, in order to see which was of greater benefit. Benefit was assessed primarily as treatment leading to pregnancy and successful delivery. Secondary objectives of the review were to assess other outcomes, such as miscarriage, multiple birth, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and cycle cancellation. Though important, cost analyses were not performed in this review</P>

<SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2008-11-13 09:36:01 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>All reports which described (or might have described) randomised controlled trials of anti-oestrogens versus gonadotrophin therapy for the treatment of unexplained subfertility were obtained using the following search strategy.</P>
<P>1) The Menstrual Disorders &amp; Subfertility Group's Specialised Register of controlled trials was searched for any trials. See the Review Group for more details on the make-up of the Specialised Register.</P>
<P>2) The following electronic databases were searched using Ovid software;<BR/>Medline - 1966 to 2000<BR/>Embase - 1980 to 2000<BR/>Bio extracts - 1980 to 2000</P>
<P>The Medline, Embase and Bioabstract databases were searched using subject headings and keywords see <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>
</P>
<P>3) The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR) on the Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2000 was also searched in all fields using the following words:</P>
<P>1. Clomiphene<BR/>2. Tamoxifen<BR/>3. GnRH or gonadotrophin<BR/>4. 1 and 2 and 3</P>
<P>4) The National Research Register (NRR), a register of ongoing and recently completed research projects funded by, or of interest to, the United Kingdom's National Health Service, as well as entries from the Medical Research Council's Clinical Trials Register, and details on reviews in progress collected by the NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, was searched for any trials with the following keywords,</P>
<P>1 clomiphene or clomid or serophene<BR/>2 tamoxifen or nolvadex<BR/>3 1 or 2<BR/>4 gonadotrophin or menotrophin or menotropin<BR/>5 hMG or FSH<BR/>6 gonal-f or puregon or follitropin or pergonal<BR/>7 humegon or menogon or normegon or metrodin or orgafol<BR/>8 4 or 5 or 6 or 7</P>
<P>The Clinical Trials register, a registry of federally and privately funded US clinical trials was also searched for the same keywords.</P>
<P>5) The citation lists of relevant publications, review articles, and included studies was also searched.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-11-13 09:36:30 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>Statistical analysis was performed in accordance with the statistical guidelines developed by the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group. The heterogeneity of the studies was analysed by inspecting the scatter in the data points and the overlap in the confidence intervals and more formally by checking the results of the chi-squared test. Apparent statistical heterogeneity was investigated informally by consideration of factors such as study quality. Where possible results of trials will be pooled. However in the case of statistical heterogeneity then trials with different insemination techniques will be considered separately.</P>
<P>For dichotomous data, two by two tables were generated for each trial and expressed as an odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). This data was combined for meta-analysis with RevMan software -using the Peto-modified Mantel-Haenszel method and a fixed effects model. It was expected that the majority of data would be dichotomous. Any continuous data would have been combined for meta-analysis with RevMan software using the weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% CI and a fixed effects model.</P>
<P>In the graphical display of the meta-analyses, a benefit from oral ovulation induction agents (anti estrogens) would be displayed graphically to the right of the centre-line and a benefit from injectable ovulation induction agents (gonadotrophins) would be displayed graphically to the left of the centre-line. Considering injectable agents, for an outcome such as pregnancy, an increase in odds is considered a benefit of intervention and thus such increased odds would be displayed to the left of the centre-line. For an outcome such as miscarriage, an increase in the odds is considered a detrimental effect of the intervention and thus such increased odds would be displayed to the right of the centre-line. This should be noted when the summary graphs are viewed for the assessment of the relative beneficial and detrimental effects of each intervention.</P>
<P>Whenever there were missing elements in the data, attempts were made to contact the investigators. If this was impossible, the reviewers have stated any assumptions that are used in the extraction and analysis of the data. Where there were cross-over trials, the reviewers used the first part of the trial, before cross over, as per Cochrane protocol</P>
<P>Separate sub-group meta-analyses, if there were a large enough number of trials included in the review, would be performed for trials comparing anti-oestrogens to different types of gonadotrophins, trials where donor insemination was used, and trials where a potentially influential co-intervention was used.</P>
<P>It was planned to undertake sensitivity analyses if there were more than ten trials included in the review to examine the stability of the results in relation to:<BR/>1) differences in methodological quality (inclusion of all trials compared to trials of high quality only);<BR/>2) trials using r-FSH studies compared with trials where other gonadotrophins were used;<BR/>3) trials using the partner's sperm in unexplained subfertility compared to trials using donor sperm in male factor subfertility;<BR/>4) inclusion of only trials with no co-intervention compared to inclusion of all trials.</P>
<P>However this was not performed because only six trials were included.</P>
<P>It is the intention of the reviewers that a new search for RCTs will be performed every two years and the review updated accordingly.</P>
<STUDY_SELECTION MODIFIED="2008-11-13 09:30:33 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>The selection of studies for inclusion in the review was undertaken by two reviewers (Nat Athaullah and Michelle Proctor). The titles and abstracts of articles found in search were screened by Nat Athaullah, who discarded studies that were clearly ineligible but was overly inclusive rather than risk losing relevant studies. Both reviewers independently assessed whether the studies met the inclusion criteria, with disagreements resolved by a third reviewer (Neil Johnson), although none arose. Further information was sought from the authors where papers contained insufficient information to make a decision about eligibility</P>

<P>Thirty-two studies were identified which potentially fitted the stated inclusion criteria. Further investigation showed five were adequate for inclusion in this review. All of the trials described treatment with clomiphene - no trials with the use of tamoxifen were found. All five trials compared clomiphene with either hMG or r-FSH. None of the included trials mentioned the use of donor sperm.</P>

<P>Twenty-seven trials were excluded from the review. The reasons for exclusion of these trials are summarised in the table of characteristics of excluded studies.</P>
<P>STUDIES INCLUDED IN THE REVIEW</P>
<P>See <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>
</P>
<P>Five trials were included in the review. Four trials were of parallel design, one was of cross-over design (<LINK REF="STD-Ecochard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ecochard 2000</LINK>). All described themselves as random, although four did not state how randomisation was achieved. Three compared clomiphene with hMG (<LINK REF="STD-Ecochard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ecochard 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karlstrom-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Karlstrom 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karlstrom-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Karlstrom 1998</LINK>), one with high-purity urinary gonadotrophin (<LINK REF="STD-Balasch-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Balasch 1994</LINK>) and one with r-FSH (<LINK REF="STD-Nakajima-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Nakajima 1999</LINK>). Two trials were performed in Sweden and one apiece in USA, Canada, Spain and France.</P>
<P>All the trials included couples diagnosed with unexplained subfertility, though two had not clearly discussed how they reached this diagnosis. Only 231 of the 695 couples in the five trials could be clearly identified as having unexplained subfertility. There were a variety of different clomiphene and gonadotrophin regimens, which differed between each group. In all six of the studies a hCG trigger injection was used to induce ovulation - in three trials this was used for both treatment regimes (<LINK REF="STD-Balasch-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Balasch 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ecochard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ecochard 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Manganiello-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Manganiello 1997</LINK>) and in three trials only the gonadotrophin group received the trigger injection (<LINK REF="STD-Karlstrom-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Karlstrom 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karlstrom-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Karlstrom 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nakajima-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Nakajima 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Balasch-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Balasch 1994</LINK> - CC versus high purity urinary gonadotrophins</P>
<P>Women were randomised to receive two cycles of either clomiphene citrate (CC) or high purity urinary gonadotrophins. The study consisted of 100 participants (60 with male factor and 40 with unexplained subfertility, although the results from the couples with male factor were not included in this review). The diagnosis of unexplained subfertility was stated. The average age of the women was given. For those in the CC group, 50 mg was given on day 5-9, whilst those in the high purity urinary gonadotrophins group received 75 IU from day 7 until follicular maturation. In both groups a trigger of 10,000 IU hCG was given when the leading follicle was &gt;=17 mm. In both groups the women were inseminated by IUI. Pregnancy was diagnosed by ultrasound. Details regarding pregnancy rate and miscarriages were given. There was no mention of multiple births or OHSS.</P>
<P>The author was contacted for additional information and a reply was received. Randomisation was achieved via computerised allocation. Treatment was unblinded. 20 women with unexplained subfertility were randomised to receive CC+IUI and 20 women with unexplained subfertility were randomised to receive high purity urinary gonadotrophins+IUI. There were no multiple births, miscarriages or OHSS cases.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Ecochard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ecochard 2000</LINK> - CC versus hMG</P>
<P>Women were randomised to receive two cycles of CC or hMG. After this, the protocols were reversed, with the participants receiving the other treatment . The study consisted of 58 participants, 12 of whom had unexplained subfertility. How this diagnosis was made was also stated. Women over the age of 39 were excluded from treatment. The CC protocol was 50-100 mg/day from days 3-7 of the cycle. The hMG protocol was 150 IU on days 4, 6, 8 and 9. Ovulation was triggered with 5,000 IU hCG when the leading follicle was &gt;=16 mm. In both groups women were then inseminated by IUI. Pregnancy was diagnosed both by serum beta-hCG and transvaginal ultrasound. Details regarding cancelled cycles, miscarriage rate and fecundity rate were given. No detail with regard to OHSS incidence was stated.</P>
<P>The author was contacted for additional information and a reply was received. There were 12 women diagnosed with unexplained subfertility and only these were included in this review. Six were randomised to two cycles of CC then two cycles of hMG and six were randomised to two cycles of hMG then two cycles of CC. Results before cross-over were considered for the meta-analysis. Data for live births, pregnancy, miscarriage and multiple births were found.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Karlstrom-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Karlstrom 1993</LINK> - CC versus hMG + hCG trigger</P>
<P>Women were randomised to receive either CC or hMG. 157 women took part in the study, of whom 148 were analysed (76 received hMG and 72 received CC). The diagnosis of unexplained subfertility was given, though the study did not include women over the age of 39. The dosage of hMG was 150 IU given on days 2-4. CC dosage was given as 100 mg on days 3-5. The hCG trigger was only given in the hMG subgroup, CC relying on urinary LH surge. This was followed by IUI or direct intraperitoneal sperm injection (DIPI). How pregnancy was diagnosed was not stated. Data on pregnancy rate, multiple birth occurrence, miscarriage rate and OHSS were stated.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Karlstrom-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Karlstrom 1998</LINK> - CC versus hMG + hCG trigger</P>
<P>Information regarding this trial is from an abstract. The full text has been requested from the authors.</P>
<P>Women were randomised to receive either hMG or CC. 353 couples with unexplained subfertility, male factor infertility, cervical factor or mild endometriosis were randomised, of which 321 couples completed treatment. Half of the women were treated daily (no start day given) with 150 IU hMG. The other half of the women received CC for 5 days (again no start day given). The hMG group received a hCG trigger when the follicle reached 17 mm. The CC group's ovulation was timed with urinary LH. After this, women were then randomised to receive either IUI, direct intraperitoneal insemination (DIPI) or a combination of the two. Pregnancy rate per woman was reported. Information on multiple births, miscarriage rate and OHSS were not reported by the trial.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Nakajima-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Nakajima 1999</LINK> - CC versus r-FSH +hCG trigger</P>
<P>Information regarding this trial is from an abstract. The full text has been requested from the authors.</P>
<P>Women were randomised to receive CC or r-FSH. 22 women were received four cycles of the treatment they were randomised to in alternate months (i.e. one cycle of treatment, one rest cycle, one cycle of treatment etc instead of four continuous cycles of CC or r-FSH). The diagnosis of unexplained subfertility was not clearly given, however the abstract stated that women had undergone "complete investigation" and had been infertile for at least 18 months. Dosages and regimens for both treatments were not given. Ovulation in the CC group was timed with urinary LH, whereas in the r-FSH group, ovulation was induced with hCG (dosage not given). Data on pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate, multiple birth frequency and OHSS frequency were given.</P>

<P>RANDOMISATION TO MEDICATION PROTOCOL</P>
<P>All of the included studies were stated to be randomised trials. Three of the studies did not mention how they achieved randomisation (<LINK REF="STD-Nakajima-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Nakajima 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karlstrom-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Karlstrom 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karlstrom-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Karlstrom 1998</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Ecochard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ecochard 2000</LINK> used opaque envelopes and a random numbers table. From correspondence it was determined that <LINK REF="STD-Balasch-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Balasch 1994</LINK> used computerised allocation. Thus in summary, we have scored the following studies accordingly (From criteria stated in the Methods of the Review):<BR/>A - <LINK REF="STD-Balasch-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Balasch 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ecochard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ecochard 2000</LINK>
<BR/>B - <LINK REF="STD-Karlstrom-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Karlstrom 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karlstrom-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Karlstrom 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nakajima-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Nakajima 1999</LINK>
</P>
<P>BLINDING</P>
<P>From correspondence, <LINK REF="STD-Balasch-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Balasch 1994</LINK> was an unblinded study. The degree of blinding was unclear in the other four included studies.</P>
<P>INTENTION-TO-TREAT ANALYSIS AND WITHDRAWALS</P>
<P>Only one of the included studies mentioned an intention to treat analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Ecochard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ecochard 2000</LINK>), 7/97 cycles of CC (7.2%) and 2/86 hMG cycles (2%) had to be cancelled in this trial but analysis was performed with and without these cycles. Studies which stated where women did not complete treatment were <LINK REF="STD-Karlstrom-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Karlstrom 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karlstrom-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Karlstrom 1998</LINK>; and <LINK REF="STD-Nakajima-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Nakajima 1999</LINK>, the percentage dropout rates being 7.0%, 9.1%, and 9.1% respectively (these figures are withdrawals of the whole trial not just the subset with unexplained subfertility only). There were no dropouts from the <LINK REF="STD-Balasch-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Balasch 1994</LINK> study (from correspondence). Reasons for the dropout rates were given in <LINK REF="STD-Karlstrom-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Karlstrom 1993</LINK>.</P>
<P>POWER CALCULATIONS</P>
<P>Only one on the included trials mentioned doing a power calculation (<LINK REF="STD-Ecochard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ecochard 2000</LINK>). Ecochard calculated that they needed to include 224 cycles of treatment to show a difference between the two treatments at 80% power (alpha = 0.05), assuming that fecundity was 10% and that hMG increased that to 25%. This trial only completed 174 cycles (58 women, although only 12 had unexplained subfertility) so statistical power was not reached.<BR/>.<BR/>BASELINE SIMILARITY OF THE GROUPS</P>
<P>(1) AGE</P>
<P>The average age of participants was given in all but two of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Karlstrom-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Karlstrom 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nakajima-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Nakajima 1999</LINK> - both abstracts). The average age of the women receiving each intervention was within one standard deviation of each other.</P>
<P>(2) DIAGNOSIS OF UNEXPLAINED SUBFERTILITY.</P>
<P>Four studies stated how they diagnosed unexplained subfertility. The criteria of this review stated that the preferred diagnosis involved looking for proof of tubal patency (hysterosalpingogram or laparoscopy), normal ovulatory function (basal body temperature, cervical mucus changes, LH testing of serum and mid-luteal progesterone) and normal semen analysis (WHO criteria).</P>
<P>These criteria were fulfilled by two studies - (<LINK REF="STD-Balasch-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Balasch 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karlstrom-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Karlstrom 1993</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Ecochard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ecochard 2000</LINK> mentioned that not all of the women received both a hysterosalpingogram and a laparoscopy. <LINK REF="STD-Karlstrom-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Karlstrom 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Nakajima-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Nakajima 1999</LINK> did not mention the diagnostic criteria at all, but again they were abstracts. The <LINK REF="STD-Karlstrom-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Karlstrom 1998</LINK> abstract, mentioned that they had similar protocols to the <LINK REF="STD-Karlstrom-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Karlstrom 1993</LINK> paper.</P>
<P>(3) CLOMIPHENE AND GONADOTROPHIN PROTOCOLS.</P>
<P>None of the trials used an identical regimen with regard to the treatment that was being prescribed. Where stated, dosages of clomiphene ranging from 50 mg-150 mg were used. These were given for five days in all six of the trials, although the start day was anywhere from before day one of the menstrual cycle through to day five. hMG was given in dosages of 150 IU, though the dosage was given either continuously for five days, starting either on day 2-4 or every other day from day four. See the Description of Studies section for more details on the protocols used by individual trials.</P>
<P>(4) THE USE OF A HCG TRIGGER</P>
<P>All but one of the included trials used a hCG trigger. In trials where the dosage was stated, hCG was given as 5000-10000 IU when the follicles were between 16-19 mm. Every group received a hCG trigger except for the clomiphene treated groups in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Karlstrom-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Karlstrom 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karlstrom-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Karlstrom 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nakajima-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Nakajima 1999</LINK>). The hCG trigger is a crucial co-intervention in these three trials and the assessed intervention in the case of these trials becomes clomiphene versus gonadotrophins plus the hCG trigger.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2008-11-13 09:32:36 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>Overall five studies were selected which compared anti-oestrogens with gonadotrophins. No studies were found comparing either anti-oestrogens or gonadotrophins in unity with combination.</P>
<P>Of the pre-specified sub-group meta-analyses, trials comparing anti-oestrogens to different types of gonadotrophins, and trials where the co-intervention of hCG trigger was used in only the gonadotrophin group and not the clomiphene group (a potentially influential co-intervention), were analysed as sub-groups.</P>
<P>LIVE BIRTH PER COUPLE<BR/>Two studies, both comparing CC versus hMG, provided data on 15 live births (<LINK REF="STD-Ecochard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ecochard 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karlstrom-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Karlstrom 1993</LINK>). The results as a whole were not statistically significant (Peto OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.47). The analysis was dominated by the results of Karlstrom 1993, as the pre-crossover results from Ecochard 2000 did not produce a live birth for either protocol.</P>
<P>Although the meta-analysis did not use the results from the post-crossover phase of the <LINK REF="STD-Ecochard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ecochard 2000</LINK> trial, it should be noted that there was one live birth out of 12 randomised participants. It occurred in the hMG phase of stimulation in a protocol involving two cycles of CC followed by two cycles of hMG.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Balasch-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Balasch 1994</LINK> stipulated that there were six pregnancies but there were no miscarriages. Though presumably all the pregnancies went on to produce live births, this review cannot accept such a presumption.</P>
<P>PREGNANCY RATE PER WOMAN</P>
<P>Three studies, two comparing CC versus hMG and one comparing CC versus high purity urinary gonadotrophins, were identified which reported the pregnancy rate per woman. The results as a whole were statistically significant with the hMG group showing a higher pregnancy rate (Peto OR 0.44 95% CI 0.19 to 0.99). The analysis was dominated by the results of Karlstrom 1993 which included 148 of the 200 women included in this comparison. The sub-group of anti-oestrogens versus hMG, which included two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ecochard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ecochard 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karlstrom-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Karlstrom 1993</LINK>) showed no significant difference (Peto OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.37). The one study comparing clomiphene with high purity urinary gonadotrophins (<LINK REF="STD-Balasch-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Balasch 1994</LINK>) also showed no significant difference (Peto OR 0.22 95% CI 0.04 to1.20). No trials reported pregnancy rate per woman (stated or otherwise) for studies which compared clomiphene with recombinant FSH.</P>
<P>When the meta-analysis was repeated excluding the trials with a hCG co-intervention in only the gonadotrophin group (<LINK REF="STD-Karlstrom-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Karlstrom 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nakajima-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Nakajima 1999</LINK>), the results were not statistically significant (Peto OR 0.33 95% CI 0.09 to1.20). For CC hMG (<LINK REF="STD-Ecochard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ecochard 2000</LINK>), there was no statistical difference (Peto OR 7.39 95% CI 0.15 to 372.41). For CC vs high purity urinary gonadotrophins (<LINK REF="STD-Balasch-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Balasch 1994</LINK>), there was also no statistical difference (Peto OR 0.22 95% CI 0.04 to1.20).</P>
<P>Although the meta-analysis did not use the results from the post-crossover phase for the <LINK REF="STD-Ecochard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ecochard 2000</LINK> trial, it should be noted that there were two pregnancies out of 12 randomised participants. One occurred in the post-crossover clomiphene phase and the other in the post-crossover hMG phase of respective protocols.</P>
<P>PREGNANCY RATE PER CYCLE</P>
<P>Data per couple are required for meaningful comparison, however pregnancy per cycle is reported more often in subfertility research. Reported numbers are given for information in the graphs, but it should be noted that the apparent confidence intervals may be incorrect and that pooling the reported figures would be inappropriate</P>
<P>Five trials were identified which reported pregnancy rate per cycle. The confidence intervals of all five trials crossed the line of no effect, however the mean pregnancy rate of the clomiphene group was only 8% compared to 25% with gonadotrophins, indicating that a benefit associated with gonadotrophins. Similarly, no levels of significance were detected for any of the subgroups.</P>
<P>Although the analysis did not use the results from the post-crossover phase of the <LINK REF="STD-Ecochard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ecochard 2000</LINK> trial, it should be noted that there were two pregnancies in 36 cycles of treatment. One occurred in the post-crossover clomiphene phase and the other in the post-crossover hMG phase of respective protocols.</P>
<P>MISCARRIAGE RATE PER PREGNANCY</P>
<P>Three trials, one comparing CC versus hMG, one comparing CC versus high purity urinary gonadotrophins and one comparing CC with rFSH, were identified which detailed miscarriage rate per pregnancy (for the purposes of this meta-analysis, defined as a woman being clinically pregnant who does not deliver a live baby). The results as a whole were not statistically significant (Peto OR 0.46 95% CI 0.06 to 3.33). The subgroup comparing anti-oestrogens with hMG was also not statistically significant (Peto OR 0.69 95% CI 0.07 to 6.99). In this group it should also be noted that in the pre-crossover results for the <LINK REF="STD-Ecochard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ecochard 2000</LINK> trial, there was one miscarriage in the CC group, but this was not included in the meta-analysis because there were no pregnancies in the hMG group. There were no miscarriages in either group in the study comparing anti-oestrogens with high purity urinary gonadotrophins (<LINK REF="STD-Balasch-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Balasch 1994</LINK>). The one study comparing anti-oestrogens with recombinant FSH (<LINK REF="STD-Nakajima-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Nakajima 1999</LINK>) showed no statistical significance (Peto OR 0.14 95% CI 0.00 to 6.82).</P>
<P>When the meta-analysis was repeated excluding the trials with a co-intervention hCG trigger only in the gonadotrophin group (<LINK REF="STD-Karlstrom-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Karlstrom 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nakajima-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Nakajima 1999</LINK>), there were insufficient data for statistical analysis to be feasible.</P>
<P>Although the meta-analysis did not use the results from the post-crossover phase of the <LINK REF="STD-Ecochard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ecochard 2000</LINK> trial, it should be noted that, of the two pregnancies, one miscarried. This occurred from a post-crossover clomiphene phase.</P>
<P>MULTIPLE BIRTH RATE PER PREGNANCY</P>
<P>Three trials were identified, one comparing CC versus hMG, one comparing CC versus high purity urinary gonadotrophins and one comparing CC with rFSH, which detailed the multiple birth rate (a woman who delivers two or more babies in the one pregnancy). The results as a whole were not statistically significant (Peto OR 0.37 95% CI 0.06 to 2.43). All subgroups were also not statistical significant.</P>
<P>When the meta-analysis was repeated excluding the trials with a co-intervention hCG trigger only in the gonadotrophin group (<LINK REF="STD-Karlstrom-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Karlstrom 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nakajima-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Nakajima 1999</LINK>), there were insufficient data for statistical analysis to be feasible.</P>
<P>OCCURRENCE OF OHSS</P>
<P>None of the included trials reported any cases of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and thus statistics could not be generated.</P>
<P>OCCURRENCE OF OVERSTIMULATION LEADING TO DISCONTINUATION OF THE CYCLE</P>
<P>None of the included trials reported any cases of cancelled cycles owing to overstimulation and thus statistics could not be generated.</P>
<P>SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS</P>
<P>A sensitivity analysis was to be performed if there were more than ten trials, on criteria stated above. However only five trials were included in the meta-analysis.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-11-13 09:40:28 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>When trials with important co-interventions were excluded from the meta-analysis, no significant differences were apparent between gonadotrophins and anti-oestrogens for the primary outcomes. Even without exclusions, the meta-analysis had insufficient power to detect a clinically significant difference. For example a single study would require analysed data from over 300 participants to have 80% power to detect a possible doubling of the pregnancy rate. (see meta-analysis graph for comparison 02, anti-oestrogens versus gonadotrophins, excluding trials with hCG trigger co-intervention; outcome 02, pregnancy rate per woman<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>), .</P>
<P>There are a number of important considerations as follows.</P>
<P>1. METHODOLOGICAL COMMENTS</P>
<P>The meta-analysis gave a high weighting to one study (<LINK REF="STD-Karlstrom-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Karlstrom 1993</LINK>), due to its large sample size. However this study had weakness in its methodology (for its use in this meta-analysis), which has been previously stated in another meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Gallot_x002d_Lavallee-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gallot-Lavallee 1995</LINK>). Ovulation was triggered in their hMG protocol, whereas it was allowed to occur naturally in the CC cycles and its timing was judged with urinary LH levels. Thus the two treatment groups not only differed in their intervention alone, but also in how ovulation was triggered, which could be a major confounding factor. <LINK REF="STD-Karlstrom-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Karlstrom 1993</LINK> argued that for cycles stimulated with CC, urinary LH surge leads to better pregnancy outcomes than using a hCG trigger, quoting a study by <LINK REF="STD-Martinez-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Martinez 1991</LINK> as support for their argument. Thus they wanted to compare optimal CC performance with optimal hMG performance. However this <LINK REF="STD-Martinez-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Martinez 1991</LINK> trial is equally flawed, using a cross-over design without a wash-out period; in fact for this trial, results before cross-over were identical.<BR/>Furthermore:<BR/>(1) A hCG trigger had been recommended by two studies previously (<LINK REF="STD-Harrison-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fisch-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Fisch 1989</LINK>), though neither timed the hCG injection with follicle size on ultrasound.<BR/>(2) <LINK REF="STD-Plosker-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Plosker 1994</LINK> examined factors to increase pregnancy rate in cycles with IUI and concluded that a hCG trigger was superior to urinary timed LH levels.<BR/>(3) Several studies in our meta-analysis used a hCG trigger for its CC component.</P>
<P>It would be inappropriate to draw conclusions based on the results of the meta-analysis which included trials with this important co-intervention. It was thus deemed rational to repeat the meta-analysis excluding trials which used a hCG trigger in only one arm of the trial (i.e. excluded studies were <LINK REF="STD-Karlstrom-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Karlstrom 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karlstrom-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Karlstrom 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nakajima-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Nakajima 1999</LINK>). This analysis lacked statistical power and was unable to identify whether there may be differences between anti-oestrogens and gonadotrophins for the variables examined.</P>
<P>The dosage of CC was different in all of the included trials. It is unclear whether the dosage makes a significant difference, though one review (<LINK REF="REF-Blacker-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blacker 1992</LINK>) suggested that a dose of 50mg would provide the highest cumulative pregnancy rates - this review was based on data from 1982. Although the dosage of hMG used was consistent, 150 IU over 5 days, the start day varied. There is no clear consensus of ideal regimens for these interventions.</P>
<P>None of the included trials were double blinded, inevitably allowing scope for bias. A couple being treated with clomiphene may not be observed as meticulously as those on hMG (<LINK REF="REF-Gallot_x002d_Lavallee-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gallot-Lavallee 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>2. FINDINGS FROM OTHER RANDOMISED TRIALS.</P>
<P>One of our included trials used the pre-crossover data from a crossover trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ecochard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ecochard 2000</LINK>). The trial's full results concluded that there was no significant difference between CC and hMG, which did not differ from the results used in the meta-analysis. The trial differed from others in the meta-analysis as they did not adjust the dose of hMG to the size of the follicle, which was the case in other studies (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Karlstrom-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Karlstrom 1993</LINK>). Also a study which did not include women with unexplained subfertility (<LINK REF="STD-Check-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Check 1992</LINK>), concluded that there was no evidence HMG leading to superior pregnancy rates when compared to clomiphene.</P>
<P>No trials fitting the criteria were found comparing a combination of the two drugs with either anti-oestrogen or gonadotrophin on its own. A randomised trial by <LINK REF="STD-Ransom-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ransom 1996</LINK> was, excluded because all the women included had failed on CC. The researchers concluded that menotrophins were better on their own than CC/hMG in women who have failed under CC therapy.</P>
<P>3. FINDINGS FROM NON-RANDOMISED TRIALS.</P>
<P>There have been a number of non-randomised studies published. <LINK REF="STD-Karande-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Karande 1995</LINK> compared CC with hMG as part of a comparison of FSH and IUI protocols and concluded that there was no statistical advantage in using one over the other. <LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Sadek-1998" TYPE="STUDY">El-Sadek 1998</LINK> reported that though there was a trend favouring the use of CC/hMG over CC alone, there was no statistical difference. <LINK REF="STD-Plosker-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Plosker 1994</LINK> stated that protocols involving hMG were more likely to produce a pregnancy than those which are natural or stimulated with CC alone. <LINK REF="STD-Dickey-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Dickey 1992</LINK> also performed a retrospective analysis which drew the same conclusion.</P>
<P>It remains unclear whether combinations are superior to the treatments on their own.</P>
<P>4. SECONDARY OUTCOMES.<BR/>Though previous literature has suggested that there is more likely to be multiple pregnancies and OHSS incidence with the use of either clomiphene or gonadotrophins, this could not be demonstrated in our meta-analysis. In fact none of the trials reported any cases of OHSS.</P>
<P>5. OTHER POINTS OF NOTE</P>
<P>Each of the studies which were used in the review used a different protocol for its gonadotrophin administration. For example <LINK REF="STD-Ecochard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ecochard 2000</LINK> used alternate day hMG administration then used the hCG trigger when the follicle was 16mm, whereas <LINK REF="STD-Balasch-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Balasch 1994</LINK> started hMG administration on day 7 and triggered at 17mm. It is clear that there is no definitive protocol for these injections, nor whether one or the other is better. If there was a sub optimal gonadotrophin administration protocol, it would skew the results</P>
<P>It is also important to note the other alternatives and variations to anti-oestrogens and gonadotrophins. It has been proposed that CC might not be as effective as hMG owing to its adverse effects on cervical mucus and the endometrium (<LINK REF="STD-Dickey_x0028_2_x0029_-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Dickey(2) 1993</LINK>). A recent study (<LINK REF="STD-Gerli-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gerli 2000</LINK>) suggested the use of ethinyl oestradiol with CC to reverse these effects, though this may lead to a higher miscarriage rate. Certainly further research is required.</P>
<P>Though beyond the scope of this review, cost is also worthy of discussion. The medications vary in price but a cycle of recombinant fsh can be twenty times that of clomiphene. Many centres use clomiphene as a first choice, however many others use FSH and other injectable agents as their primary agent. These decisions are often not evidence based but are due to individual clinical preference. <LINK REF="REF-Guzick-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guzick 1998</LINK> performed a retrospective analysis which attempted to calculate cost per pregnancy. This suggested that though gonadotrophins were more likely to produce pregnancy, the cost per pregnancy was less in the clomiphene group as opposed to the gonadotrophin group, i.e. clomiphene was more cost effective. However they also concluded that randomised controlled trials comparing the two agents were necessary to provide more definitive information (<LINK REF="REF-Guzick-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guzick 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>In 1995 a meta-analysis comparing CC and hMG was published (<LINK REF="REF-Gallot_x002d_Lavallee-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gallot-Lavallee 1995</LINK>), which could only locate three randomised trials. It concluded that hMG may be better than CC, but this may be a consequence of better monitoring and perhaps an increased incidence of multiple pregnancies. The <LINK REF="REF-Gallot_x002d_Lavallee-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gallot-Lavallee 1995</LINK> meta-analysis included the findings of both randomised and non-randomised studies, although statistical analysis was not performed because of the use of non-randomised populations. Although it involved a similar search strategy to ours, other differences were the inclusion of a comparison with placebo and no policy of exclusion or inclusion of trials based upon methodological quality. Our meta-analysis, six year's after the <LINK REF="REF-Gallot_x002d_Lavallee-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gallot-Lavallee 1995</LINK> meta-analysis and with more stringent inclusion criteria, has failed to demonstrate conclusively which should be the treatment of choice.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is insufficient evidence that the use of oral versus injectable ovulation induction rates gives rise to differences in pregnancy or live birth rates in unexplained subfertility. Preference and cost of treatment will be other influential factors governing the decision of which agent to use.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further RCTs of sufficient quality and power (numbering more than 300 participants) are needed to answer this question. The challenge for those who promote the use of gonadotrophins in this context is to demonstrate their benefit in a randomised trial. Such a trial should be preceded by ascertainment of the optimal dose regimes of oral and injectable ovulation induction agents in the context of unexplained infertility. It is likely to benefit from a multi-centre approach and must be free from bias introduced by co-interventions or differential monitoring. Trials should report outcome data as a live birth rate 'survival' analysis. Ideally the trials should have the same universal protocols for both its arms. If the more expensive, injectable agents are proven to be beneficial, maybe in certain health care systems, funding for their usage will be granted.</P>
