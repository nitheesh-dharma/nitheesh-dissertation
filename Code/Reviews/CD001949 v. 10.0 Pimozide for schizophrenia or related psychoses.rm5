<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-10-03 15:42:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>People with schizophrenia have &#8216;positive symptoms&#8217; such as hearing voices and seeing things (hallucinations) and fixed strange beliefs (delusions). People with schizophrenia also have &#8216;negative symptoms&#8217; such as tiredness, apathy and loss of emotion. Antipsychotic drugs are the main treatment for the symptoms of schizophrenia and can be grouped into older drugs (first generation or &#8216;typical&#8217;) and newer drugs (second generation or &#8216;atypical&#8217;). Pimozide is a &#8216;typical&#8217; antipsychotic drug that was first introduced in the late 1960s and was given to people with schizophrenia. Pimozide is thought to be effective in treating the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia or similar mental health problems such as delusional disorder, but it produces serious side effects such as muscle stiffness, tremors and slow body movements. Pimozide may also cause heart problems and has been linked to sudden unexplained death. Monitoring the heart via electrocardiogram is now required before and during treatment with pimozide. It is well known that people with mental health problems suffer from physical illnesses such as heart disease and diabetes and can die on average twenty years younger than those in the general population.<BR/>An update search for this review was carried out 28 January 2013; the review now includes 32 studies that assess the effects of pimozide for people with schizophrenia or similar mental health problems. Pimozide was compared with other antipsychotic drugs, placebo (&#8216;dummy&#8217; treatment) or no treatment. Results suggest that pimozide is probably just as effective as other commonly used &#8216;typical&#8217; antipsychotic drugs (for outcomes such as treating mental state, relapse, leaving the study early). No studies included delusional disorders, so no information is available on this group of people. No evidence was found to support the concern that pimozide causes heart problems (although this may be result of the fact that the studies were small and short term and the participants did not receive doses above recommended limits of 20 mg/d). Pimozide may cause less sleepiness than other typical antipsychotic drugs, but it may cause more tremors and uncontrollable shaking. The claim that pimozide is useful for treating people with negative symptoms also is not supported and proven. However, the quality of evidence in the main was low or very low quality, studies were small and of short duration and were poorly reported. Large-scale, well-conducted and well-reported studies are required to assess the effectiveness of pimozide in the treatment of schizophrenia and other mental health problems such as delusional disorder.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-09-11 14:25:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Dolores Matthews">
<P>We sought all relevant randomised clinical trials (RCTs) comparing pimozide with other treatments.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-09-11 14:25:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Working independently, we inspected citations, ordered papers and then re-inspected and assessed the quality of the studies and of extracted data. For homogeneous dichotomous data, we calculated the relative risk (RR), the 95% confidence interval (CI) and mean differences (MDs) for continuous data. We excluded data if loss to follow-up was greater than 50%. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and used GRADE to rate the quality of the evidence.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-09-12 09:44:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 32 studies in total: Among the five studies that compared pimozide versus placebo, only one study provided data for global state relapse, for which no difference between groups was noted at medium term (1 RCT n = 20, RR 0.22 CI 0.03 to 1.78, <I>very low quality of evidence</I>). None of the five studies provided data for no improvement or first-rank symptoms in mental state. Data for extrapyramidal symptoms demonstrate no difference between groups for Parkinsonism (rigidity) at short term (1 RCT, n = 19, RR 5.50 CI 0.30 to 101.28, <I>very low quality of evidence</I>) or at medium term (1 RCT n = 25, RR 1.33 CI 0.14 to 12.82, <I>very low quality of evidence</I>), or for Parkinsonism (tremor) at medium term (1 RCT n = 25, RR 1 CI 0.2 to 4.95, <I>very low quality of evidence</I>). No data were reported for quality of life at medium term.</P>
<P>Of the 26 studies comparing pimozide versus any antipsychotic, seven studies provided data for global state relapse at medium term, for which no difference was noted (7 RCTs n = 227, RR 0.82 CI 0.57 to 1.17, <I>moderate quality of evidence</I>). Data from one study demonstrated no difference in mental state (no improvement) at medium term (1 RCT n = 23, RR 1.09 CI 0.08 to 15.41, <I>very low quality evidence</I>); another study demonstrated no difference in the presence of first-rank symptoms at medium term (1 RCT n = 44, RR 0.53 CI 0.25 to 1.11, <I>low quality of evidence</I>). Data for extrapyramidal symptoms demonstrate no difference between groups for Parkinsonism (rigidity) at short term (6 RCTs n = 186, RR 1.21 CI 0.71 to 2.05,<I> low quality of evidence</I>) or medium term (5 RCTs n = 219, RR 1.12 CI 0.24 to 5.25,<I> low quality of evidence</I>), or for Parkinsonism (tremor) at medium term (4 RCTs n = 174, RR 1.46 CI 0.68 to 3.11, <I>very low quality of evidence</I>). No data were reported for quality of life at medium term.</P>
<P>In the one study that compared pimozide plus any antipsychotic versus the same antipsychotic, significantly fewer relapses were noted in the augmented pimozide group at medium term (1 RCT n = 69, RR 0.28 CI 0.15 to 0.50, <I>low quality evidence</I>). No data were reported for mental state outcomes or for extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). Data were skewed for quality of life scores, which were not included in the meta-analysis but were presented separately.</P>
<P>Two studies compared pimozide plus any antipsychotics versus antipsychotic plus placebo; neither study reported data for outcomes of interest, apart from Parkinsonism at medium term and quality of life using the Specific Level of Functioning scale (SLOF); however, data were skewed.</P>
<P>Only one study compared pimozide plus any antipsychotic versus antipsychotics plus antipsychotic; no data were reported for global state and mental state outcomes of interest. Data were provided for Parkinsonism (rigidity and tremor) using the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS); however, these data were skewed.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-09-11 14:25:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although shortcomings in the data are evident, enough overall consistency over different outcomes and time scales is present to confirm that pimozide is a drug with efficacy similar to that of other, more commonly used antipsychotic drugs such as chlorpromazine for people with schizophrenia. No data support or refute its use for those with delusional disorder.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-09-11 14:25:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-09-11 14:25:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Schizophrenia is a severe and enduring mental illness with a lifetime risk of about 1% (<LINK REF="REF-Davies-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 2007</LINK>). Symptoms of schizophrenia are commonly clustered into positive, negative and cognitive symptoms. Positive symptoms comprise hallucinations, delusions and thought disorder. Negative symptoms sometimes are more difficult to elicit; however, it is generally accepted that apathy, avolition, anhedonia, alogia and impairment of attention are negative symptoms. Cognitive decline can happen over many years and can be difficult to detect (<LINK REF="REF-Radhakrishnan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Radhakrishnan 2012</LINK>). Often the illness can present with a mixture of the above cluster of symptoms. Growing concern surrounds the fact that people who suffer from schizophrenia are more likely to have higher morbidity from physical illness compared with the general population (<LINK REF="REF-De-Hert--2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Hert 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Delusions are commonly defined as false fixed beliefs that are out of keeping with the person's cultural background. Delusional beliefs can occur as part of the cluster of positive symptoms of schizophrenia and can take the form of a simple or elaborate or a well-systematised set of beliefs. Delusional disorders are defined as 'ICD-10 definition' (<LINK REF="REF-ICD-10-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICD 10 1994</LINK>). Antipsychotics have been the mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia, and anecdotally pimozide has been used most often to treat delusional disorders. Pimozide was one of the earlier antipsychotic medications that was thought to have an association with sudden cardiac death. In the UK, the British National Formulary (<LINK REF="REF-BNF" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF</LINK>) recommends monitoring of ECT before treatment initiation, and if evidence of QT interval prolongation is found, withdrawing the treatment or reducing the dose and reviewing the medication. Of course more recently, other antipsychotics have come under the scanner as well, and QT prolongation is being recognised increasingly as a possible side effect of these drugs.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-09-11 14:25:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Pimozide was first formulated in the late 1960s by Janssen Pharmaceutica (<LINK REF="REF-Janssen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Janssen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Udabe-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Udabe 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yaryura_x002d_Tobias-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yaryura-Tobias 1998</LINK>) and was marketed for the care of people with schizophrenia or related psychoses such as delusional disorder. Pimozide is often advocated as the preferred drug treatment for delusional disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Kaplan-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaplan 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Opler-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Opler 1995</LINK>), and it has been claimed that it is particularly effective for one subtype, namely, monosymptomatic hypochondriacal psychosis (<LINK REF="REF-Munro-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munro 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ungvari-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Ungvari 1986</LINK>). Pimozide has also been claimed to have particular efficacy for negative symptoms such as apathy, poor volition and slow and 'impoverished' thinking (<LINK REF="STD-Feinberg-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Feinberg 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Opler-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Opler 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>Pimozide is generally well tolerated apart from extrapyramidal side effects (tremor, muscle stiffness and slow body movements). However, it has been associated with cardiotoxicity and sudden unexplained death. Electrocardiogram monitoring is required before and during its use (<LINK REF="REF-BNF-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF 2012</LINK>), and pimozide is now contraindicated for people with known heart problems (prolonged QT interval) or a history of arrhythmia (<LINK REF="REF-BNF-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF 2012</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-09-11 14:25:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Pimozide is a diphenylbutylpiperidine antipsychotic drug (1-[1-[4,4-bis(p-fluorophenyl)butyl]-4-piperidyl]-2-benzimidazolinone; <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). It is an oral antipsychotic drug that differs from other antipsychotic drugs in several ways. It has a long half-life (55 to 150 hours), which means that it can be given as infrequently as once daily in acute psychotic illness and three times weekly in the maintenance phase (<LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1982_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1982*</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-King-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 1995</LINK>). This may be useful for people whose compliance is poor but who refuse depot medication (<LINK REF="STD-McCreadie-1987" TYPE="STUDY">McCreadie 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>Pimozide is derived from the butyrophenone class, of which haloperidol is the best known example. It differs from haloperidol in that it has a more specific dopamine blocking action (D2 receptor antagonist with very high affinity for 5-HT7 receptor) and is therefore less sedative (<LINK REF="REF-Silverstone-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silverstone 1995</LINK>). It is distinguished from other antipsychotic drugs by its potent calcium blocking activity. The usual dose ranges from 2 to 20 mg daily, with a maximum licensed daily dose for adults of 20 mg (<LINK REF="REF-BNF-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF 2012</LINK>).</P>

<P>Pimozide is a drug that was developed in the 1960s for the treatment of schizophrenia or related psychoses, and it remains available in the formulary (BNF) for treating patients with schizophrenia and monosymptomatic hypochondriacal psychosis.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Extraction</HEADING>
<P>For this 2013 update, review authors MM and SS extracted data from all included studies. In addition, to ensure reliability, CEA independently extracted data from a 10% random sample of the total included studies. We discussed any disagreement, documented decisions and, if necessary, contacted authors of studies for clarification. With remaining problems, CEA helped to clarify issues, and we documented those final decisions. We extracted data presented only in graphs and figures whenever possible but included these only if two review authors independently attained the same result. We attempted to contact authors through an open-ended request to obtain missing information or for clarification whenever necessary. Had we encountered cluster trials, we would have extracted data relevant to each component centre of such studies separately.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Management</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.1 Forms</HEADING>
<P>We extracted data onto standard, simple forms.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.2 Scale-derived data</HEADING>
<P>We included continuous data from rating scales only if:<BR/>a. the psychometric properties of the measuring instrument had been described in a peer-reviewed journal (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>); and<BR/>b. the measuring instrument had not been written or modified by one of the trialists for that particular trial.</P>
<P>Ideally, the measuring instrument should be a self-report or should be completed by an independent rater or relative (not the therapist). We realise that often this is not reported clearly; we have noted whether or not this is the case in <LINK TAG="STUDY_DESCRIPTION" TYPE="SECTION">Description of studies</LINK> and in the 'Risk of bias' tables.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.3 Endpoint versus change data</HEADING>
<P>Both endpoint and change data offer advantages. Change data can remove a component of between-person variability from the analysis. On the other hand, calculation of change needs two assessments (baseline and endpoint), which can be difficult to perform in unstable and difficult to measure conditions such as schizophrenia. We decided to use primarily endpoint data and to use change data only if the former were not available. We combined endpoint and change data in the analysis, as we used mean differences (MDs) rather than standardised mean differences throughout (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>; Chapter 9.4.5.2).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.4 Skewed data</HEADING>
<P>Continuous data on clinical and social outcomes often are not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data, we aimed to apply the following standards to all data before inclusion: (a) standard deviations and means are reported in the paper or can be obtained from the authors; (b) when a scale starts from the finite number zero, the standard deviation (SD), when multiplied by two, is less than the mean (as otherwise, the mean is unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>)); (c) if a scale started from a positive value (such as the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), which can have values from 30 to 210), we modified the calculation described above to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases, skew is present if 2 SD &gt; (S Smin), where S is the mean score and S min is the minimum score. Endpoint scores on scales often have finite starting and ending points, and these rules can be applied. We entered skewed endpoint data from studies of fewer than 200 participants as other data within the data and analyses section rather than into the statistical analysis. Skewed endpoint data pose less of a problem when one is looking at the mean if the sample size is large; had we come across such larger-scale studies, we would have entered such data into syntheses. When continuous data are presented on a scale that includes a possibility of negative values (such as change data), it is difficult to tell whether or not data are skewed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.5 Common measure</HEADING>
<P>To facilitate comparison between trials, we intended to convert variables that can be reported in different metrics, such as days in hospital (mean days per year, per week or per month), to a common metric (e.g. mean days per month). However, no such variables were found in the included studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.6 Conversion of continuous to binary</HEADING>
<P>Where possible, we made efforts to convert outcome measures to dichotomous data. This can be done by identifying cut-off points on rating scales and dividing participants accordingly into 'clinically improved' and 'not clinically improved'. It is generally assumed that if a 50% reduction is seen in a scale-derived score such as the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS; <LINK REF="REF-Overall-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1962</LINK>) or the PANSS (<LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>), this could be considered as a clinically significant response (<LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005a</LINK>). If data based on these thresholds were not available, we used the primary cut-off presented by the original authors. Most included studies dichotomised data from rating scales to rate them as 'improved' or 'not improved' (as defined in each study), which was included under the global state outcome of 'no improvement'. Where conversions have not been made, this means that a 50% reduction in the scale-derived data was not found.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.7 Direction of graphs</HEADING>
<P>Where possible, we entered data in such a way that the area to the left of the line of no effect indicated a favourable outcome for pimozide. If we had to enter data in a way that the area to the left of the line indicates an unfavourable outcome, this was noted in the relevant graphs.</P>

<P>For this 2013 update, MM and SS worked independently to assess trial quality by using criteria described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). This new set of criteria is based on evidence of associations between overestimate of effect and high risk of bias of the article, such as sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data and selective reporting.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Binary data</HEADING>
<P>For binary outcomes, we calculated a standard estimation of the risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). It has been shown that RR is more intuitive (<LINK REF="REF-Boissel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boissel 1999</LINK>) than odds ratios and that odds ratios tend to be interpreted as RR by clinicians (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2000</LINK>). If heterogeneity was identified (<LINK TAG="HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT" TYPE="SECTION">Assessment of heterogeneity</LINK>), we used a random-effects model. For statistically significant results, we used 'Summary of findings' tables to calculate the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome /for an additional harmful outcome statistic and its 95% CI.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Continuous data</HEADING>
<P>For continuous outcomes, we estimated the mean difference (MD) between groups. We would prefer to not calculate effect size measures (standardised mean difference (SMD)). However, if scales of very considerable similarity were used, we presumed that a small difference in measurement was present, and we would have calculated effect size and transformed the effect back to the units of one or more of the specific instruments. However, no such data were found.</P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2013-09-11 14:33:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Cluster trials</HEADING>
<P>Studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice), but analysis and pooling of clustered data pose problems. Authors often fail to account for intraclass correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>), whereby P values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This causes type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Had we included any cluster trials, and in cases where clustering was not accounted for in primary studies, we would have presented data in a table, with an (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review, if any cluster trials are identified, we will seek to contact first authors of such studies to obtain intraclass correlation coefficients for their clustered data and to adjust for this by using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>If clustering had been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we would have presented these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, with adjustment for the clustering effect.</P>
<P>We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a 'design effect'. This is calculated by using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) [Design effect = 1 + (m1) * ICC] (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). Again, had we found any cluster trials, or if subsequent versions of this review should identify such trials, when the ICC is not reported it will be assumed to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Cross-over trials</HEADING>
<P>A major concern of cross-over trials is the carry-over effect. It occurs when an effect (e.g. pharmacological, physiological, psychological) of treatment in the first phase is carried over to the second phase. As a consequence, on entry to the second phase, participants can differ systematically from their initial state despite a wash-out phase. For the same reason, cross-over trials are not appropriate if the condition of interest is unstable (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). As both effects are highly likely in severe mental illness, we would have used only data from the first phase of cross-over studies, had any such studies been identified. However, this review does not include any cross-over design studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Studies with multiple treatment groups</HEADING>
<P>When a study involves more than two treatment arms, if relevant, we presented the additional treatment arms in comparisons. If data were binary, we simply added them and combined them within the two-by-two table. If data were continuous, we combined them by following the formula provided in Section 7.7.3.8 ('Combining groups') of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). When additional treatment arms were not relevant, we did not reproduce these data.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Overall loss of credibility</HEADING>
<P>At some degree of loss of follow-up, data must lose credibility (<LINK REF="REF-Xia-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xia 2009</LINK>). We chose that, for any particular outcome, should more than 40% of data be unaccounted for, we did not reproduce these data or use them within analyses. If, however, more than 40% of those in one arm of a study were lost, but the total loss was less than 40%, we marked such data with an (*) to indicate that such a result may well be prone to bias. This was the case in <LINK REF="STD-Gross-1974_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Gross 1974*</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1975_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1975*</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Abuzzahab-1980_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Abuzzahab 1980*</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCreadie-1982_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">McCreadie 1982*</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1982_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1982*</LINK>.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Binary</HEADING>
<P>When attrition for a binary outcome was between 0% and 60%, and when data were not clearly described, we presented data on a 'once-randomised-always-analyse' basis (an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis). All ot those leaving the study early were assumed to have the same rates of negative outcome as those who completed, with the exception of the outcomes of death and adverse effects. For these outcomes, the rate of those who stayed in the study in that particular arm of the trial was used for those who did not. We undertook a sensitivity analysis to test how prone the primary outcomes were to change when 'completer' data only were compared with the ITT analysis by using the above assumptions.</P>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">3.2 Standard deviations</HEADING>
<P>Had we been confronted with missing SDs, we would have tried first to obtain the missing values from the authors. If the missing values were not available, where measures of variance for continuous data were missing but an exact standard error (SE) and CIs were available for group means, and either a P value or a T value was available for differences in means, we were able to calculate them according to the rules described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>): When only the SE is reported, SDs are calculated by the formula SD = SE * square root (n). Chapters 7.7.3 and 16.1.3 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) present detailed formulae for estimating SDs from P values, T or F values, confidence intervals, ranges or other statistics. If these formulae do not apply, we would have calculated the SDs according to a validated imputation method based on the SDs of the other included studies (<LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2006</LINK>). Although some of these imputation strategies can introduce error, the alternative would be to exclude a given study&#8217;s outcome and thus to lose information. However, we did not have to impute any of these values.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">3.3 Last observation carried forward</HEADING>
<P>We anticipated that in some studies, the method of last observation carried forward (LOCF) would be employed within the study report. As with all methods of imputation applied to deal with missing data, LOCF introduces uncertainty about the reliability of the results (<LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2007</LINK>). Therefore, in cases where LOCF data have been used in the trial, if less than 50% of the data have been assumed, we reproduced these data and indicated that they are the product of LOCF assumptions.</P>

An I<SUP>2 </SUP>estimate greater than or equal to around 50% accompanied by a statistically significant Chi<SUP>2</SUP> statistic was interpreted as evidence of substantial levels of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).

<P>We understand that there is no closed argument regarding preference for the use of fixed-effect or random-effects models. The random-effects method incorporates an assumption that the different studies are estimating different, yet related, intervention effects. This often seems to be true to us, and the random-effects model takes into account differences between studies even if no statistically significant heterogeneity is noted. However, the random-effects model confers a disadvantage: It puts added weight onto small studies, which often are the most biased ones. Depending on the direction of effect, these studies can inflate or deflate the effect size. We chose the fixed-effect model for all analyses.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Investigation of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>If inconsistency was high, we have reported this. First, we investigated whether data had been entered correctly. Second, if data were correct, we visually inspected the graph and successively removed studies outside of the company of the rest to see whether homogeneity was restored. For this review, we decided that should this occur with data contributing to the summary finding of no more than around 10% of total weighting, we would present the data. If this did not occur, we did not pool data and discuss issues. We know of no supporting research for this 10% cut-off, but we use prediction intervals as an alternative to this unsatisfactory state.</P>
<P>
<BR/>When unanticipated clinical or methodological heterogeneity was obvious, we simply stated hypotheses regarding this for future reviews or future versions of this review.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Implication of randomisation</HEADING>
<P>We included trials in a sensitivity analysis if they did not state they were randomised but were described in some way as to imply randomisation.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Assumptions for lost binary data</HEADING>
<P>When assumptions had to be made regarding people lost to follow-up and missing SD data (see <LINK TAG="MISSING_DATA" TYPE="SECTION">Dealing with missing data</LINK>), we compared the findings on primary outcomes when we used our assumption compared with completer data only. We undertook a sensitivity analysis to test how prone results were to change when 'completer' data only were compared with imputed data using the above assumption. If a substantial difference was noted, we reported results and discussed them but continued to employ our assumption.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>We analysed the effects of excluding trials that were judged to be at high risk of bias across one or more of the domains of randomisation (implied as randomised with no further details available): allocation concealment, blinding and outcome reporting for the meta-analysis of the primary outcome. If exclusion of trials at high risk of bias did not substantially alter the direction of effect or the precision of effect estimates, we included data from these trials in the analysis.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">4. Imputed values</HEADING>
<P>Had we imputed values, we would have also undertaken a sensitivity analysis to assess the effects of including data from trials for which we used imputed values for ICC in calculating the design effect in cluster randomised trials.</P>
<P>If imputed values are used in future versions of this review, we will note substantial differences in the direction or precision of effect estimates in any of the sensitivity analyses listed above, and we will not pool data from excluded trials with those of other trials contributing to the outcome but will present them separately.</P>

<P>The initial 2002 search yielded 114 electronic records. Of these, 79 were obtained as full publications. This initial selection process was independently repeated on a random sample of 12 records by TM, who achieved a Cohen's kappa of 0.63. Independent repeating of the assessment of the full publications on a 10% sample yielded 100% agreement. A further seven publications were obtained for perusal after handsearching of the references of obtained papers, but none of these could be included. High-yield journals were found to be those that had been handsearched previously by Cochrane Groups. An additional search by Janssen Medical Information Department led the review authors to obtain 24 further papers. Many of these had already been excluded. For the July 2005 update, the search yielded 51 citations (see <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>) and a 2011 and a most recent 2013 search for the current update yielded 14 citations, of which three new studies were included. A total of 91 trials were assessed for eligibility; of the excluded publications, 60 were sufficiently close to the review's inclusion criteria to be included in the excluded studies table, and 31 were subsequently included in the data and analysis (see <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK> for study flow diagram). Contacting authors of included studies yielded further data (see <LINK TAG="ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS" TYPE="SECTION">Acknowledgements</LINK>).</P>

<P>We included 32 studies published between 1971 and 2012. Most studies were described as 'randomised'; four trials did not make explicit reference to a randomised design; however, each employed a double-blind method (<LINK REF="STD-Andersen-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kline-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Kline 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Abuzzahab-1980_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Abuzzahab 1980*</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haas-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Haas 1982</LINK>). These trials were rated as 'high' risk of bias and were subject to a sensitivity analysis when data for primary outcomes of interest were provided. Only four trials provided an adequate description of randomisation (<LINK REF="STD-Pinard-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Pinard 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1975_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1975*</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McInnes-1978" TYPE="STUDY">McInnes 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barnes-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Barnes 1983</LINK>); the remaining studies mentioned 'randomisation' and a double-blind technique but delivered no further information regarding the methods employed.</P>
<P>Six trials that were previously included in older versions of this review have been excluded; this decision was based on unbiased judgements made by the current review authors and was due to inadequate randomisation and blinding methods (<LINK REF="STD-Masiak-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Masiak 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCreadie-1978" TYPE="STUDY">McCreadie 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCreadie-1983" TYPE="STUDY">McCreadie 1983</LINK>), or it occurred when closer inspection revealed misinterpreted data resulting when no overall extractable data (<LINK REF="STD-Sims-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Sims 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lapierre-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Lapierre 1976</LINK>) or no pre-cross-over data were available from a study with a cross-over design (<LINK REF="STD-Morris-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Morris 1970</LINK>).</P>

<P>Not all included participants in <LINK REF="STD-McInnes-1978" TYPE="STUDY">McInnes 1978</LINK> had schizophrenia, as 15 were diagnosed as having schizophrenia; 2 had Korsakoff's and 1 had bipolar disorder. Further, in <LINK REF="STD-Andersen-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 1972</LINK>, unclear diagnostic criteria were used to diagnose schizophrenia or 'paranoid syndrome'.

<P>The mean average dose of pimozide, based on the 22 studies that clearly reported it, was 11.52 mg/d, and the range, taken from 16 studies, was 1 to 70 mg/d. The highest average dose was 45.7 mg; however, the frequency was unclear (<LINK REF="STD-Huber-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Huber 1971</LINK>). The highest reported mean daily dose was 30 mg/d (<LINK REF="STD-Chouinard-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Chouinard 1982</LINK>). For comparison, the current recommended maximum dose of pimozide in the UK is 20 mg/d (<LINK REF="REF-BNF-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF 2012</LINK>). Twelve studies reported a maximum dose matching or exceeding this 20 mg limit (<LINK REF="STD-Huber-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Huber 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kolivakis-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Kolivakis 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1975_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1975*</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Donlon-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Donlon 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Abuzzahab-1980_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Abuzzahab 1980*</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCreadie-1980" TYPE="STUDY">McCreadie 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pecknold-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Pecknold 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chouinard-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Chouinard 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haas-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Haas 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCreadie-1982_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">McCreadie 1982*</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1982_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1982*</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Silverstone-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Silverstone 1984</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">5.1 Pimozide versus placebo</HEADING>
<P>Five studies compared pimozide with placebo, using low to medium doses of pimozide only one included study adopted a very high dose of up to 40 mg/d (<LINK REF="STD-Huber-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Huber 1971</LINK>). Most studies had more than two treatment arms and also present data for the comparison of 'pimozide versus any antipsychotic' (see later). <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1975_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1975*</LINK> had three treatment arms and compared 2 to 16 mg/d of oral pimozide (average daily dose of 5.5 mg) with placebo (mean of 3 capsules/d) or 75 to 375 mg/d thioridazine. In the trial conducted by <LINK REF="STD-Falloon-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Falloon 1978</LINK>, participants received oral pimozide at a maximum dose of 16 mg/d(median 8 mg/d) plus inert fluphenazine injections, or they received active fluphenazine injections at a maximum dose of 50 mg/wk (median 25 mg/2 wk) plus inert pimozide tablets. The pimozide/placebo comparison in this study was made during a six-month follow-up period in which all injections (both active and placebo) were withdrawn from a selection of participants who had remained well throughout the previous 12 months of the trial. Participants in the <LINK REF="STD-Gross-1974_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Gross 1974*</LINK> study were assigned to receive one of three treatments: 2 to 12 mg/d (mean 6.3 mg/d) pimozide, placebo or trifluoperazine (see later for the trifluoperazine comparison); and <LINK REF="STD-Pinard-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Pinard 1972</LINK> had five treatment arms, in which participants received 3 mg/d pimozide; 6 mg/d pimozide; placebo; or 5 mg/3 times daily or 15 mg/d trifluoperazine (see later). The results for these groups were combined to equal three treatment arms for the purposes of presenting data in the meta-analysis (i.e., data from the two pimozide groups were presented together, as were the data from the two trifluoperazine groups). <LINK REF="STD-Huber-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Huber 1971</LINK> was the only study to compare pimozide versus placebo with no additional treatment arms, in which participants received a high dose of up to 40 mg/d oral pimozide or an oral placebo. Finally, <LINK REF="STD-Denijs-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Denijs 1973</LINK> were employed in a two-month maintenance phase when all participants received a mean of 7.72 mg/d pimozide. Those who had not relapsed during this period were then randomly assigned to continue pimozide or receive placebo (we have presented the data from this withdrawal study separately).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">5.2 Pimozide versus any antipsychotic</HEADING>
<P>Twenty-six studies compared pimozide with antipsychotic drugs.

Among these studies, one described the use of a moderate pimozide dose of maximum 16 mg (<LINK REF="STD-Falloon-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Falloon 1978</LINK>); another used a low mean dose of 5.3 mg/d pimozide (<LINK REF="STD-Barnes-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Barnes 1983</LINK>) and the final two studies by the same author employed an intermittent regimen of pimozide, with a maximum 32 mg every four days a week (<LINK REF="STD-McCreadie-1980" TYPE="STUDY">McCreadie 1980</LINK>) or 40 mg once a week (<LINK REF="STD-McCreadie-1982_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">McCreadie 1982*</LINK>). Dosages of fluphenazine decanoate were moderate and comparable amongst the studies taken intermittently, these ranged from a mean of 8.2 mg (<LINK REF="STD-Barnes-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Barnes 1983</LINK>) or 12.5 mg a week (<LINK REF="STD-McCreadie-1980" TYPE="STUDY">McCreadie 1980</LINK>) to a median of 25 mg every two weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Falloon-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Falloon 1978</LINK>) or a mean of 14 mg biweekly (<LINK REF="STD-McCreadie-1982_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">McCreadie 1982*</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">6. Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Most outcomes were reported as dichotomous (yes-no/binary outcomes) and are presented in this review as such. Scale-derived data on global state (Clinical Global Impression (CGI)) were usually categorical and therefore easily dichotomised. This process of dividing categorical data into two is vulnerable to the inclusion of bias, that is, someone seeing the data might conceivably choose a point of division in a biased fashion. The 'cut-off' used in this review was chosen on the basis of advice given blind to the data. Details of scales that provided usable data are shown below. We have given reasons for exclusion of data from instruments under 'Outcomes' in the 'Excluded studies' section.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">7.1 Global state</HEADING>
<P>7.1.1 Clinical Global Impression CGI (<LINK REF="REF-Guy-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guy 1976</LINK>)<BR/>This three-item observer-rated scale measures severity of illness (CGI-S), global improvement (CGI-I) or change (CGI-C) and therapeutic response, which are rated on a 7-point scale from 1 = normal to 7 = extremely unwell; lower scores are indicative of decreased severity and/or greater recovery, and the treatment response ratings, which take into account both therapeutic efficacy and treatment-related adverse effects, range from 0 = marked improvement and no side effects, to 4 = unchanged or worse, with side effects outweighing therapeutic effects. Each component of the CGI is rated separately, and the instrument does not provide a global score. <LINK REF="STD-Pecknold-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Pecknold 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Ronchi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">De Ronchi 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Friedman-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Friedman 2011</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Gunduz_x002d_Bruce-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Gunduz-Bruce 2013</LINK> are the only studies that have reported data using this scale.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">7.2 Mental state</HEADING>
<P>7.2.1 Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale BPRS (<LINK REF="REF-Overall-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1962</LINK>)<BR/>The BPRS is an 18-item scale that measures positive symptoms, general psychopathology and affective symptoms. The original scale consists of 16 items, but the revised 18-item scale is more commonly used. Scores range from 0 to 126. Each item is rated on a 7-point scale, with 0 = 'not present' to 7 = 'extremely severe' and with high scores indicating more severe symptoms. <LINK REF="STD-Gunduz_x002d_Bruce-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Gunduz-Bruce 2013</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Pecknold-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Pecknold 1980</LINK> were the only studies to report data from this scale. <LINK REF="STD-Anumonye-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Anumonye 1976</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kline-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Kline 1977</LINK> provided binary data using the BPRS to measure improvement/no improvement, including results from participants who had achieved an 'absent' level of improvement (<LINK REF="STD-Anumonye-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Anumonye 1976</LINK>) and from participants with either 'no change' or a 'worsened' level of improvement (<LINK REF="STD-Kline-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Kline 1977</LINK>).</P>
<P>7.2.2 Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale MADRS (<LINK REF="REF-Montgomery-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montgomery 1979</LINK>)<BR/>This scale is used to assess the severity of a range of psychotic symptoms in people with schizophrenia. It is a 65-item comprehensive psychopathology scale that is used to identify the 17 most commonly occurring symptoms in primary depressive illness. Ratings are based on 10 items. A high score indicates more severe and/or extensive symptoms. <LINK REF="STD-Silverstone-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Silverstone 1984</LINK> was the only study to report data from this scale.</P>
<P>7.2.3 Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale PANSS (<LINK REF="REF-Kay-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1987</LINK>)<BR/>PANSS was developed from the BPRS and the Psychopathology Rating Scale. It is used to evaluate positive, negative and other symptom dimensions in schizophrenia. The scale consists of 30 items, each measured on a 7-point scoring system ranging from 1 = absent to 7 = extreme. Only <LINK REF="STD-Friedman-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Friedman 2011</LINK> provided data using this scale.</P>
<P>7.2.4 Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms SANS (<LINK REF="REF-Andreasen-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andreasen 1982</LINK>)<BR/>The SANS measures the incidence and severity of negative symptoms using a 25-item scale and a 6-point scoring system, with 0 = better to 5 = worse; a higher score indicates a more severe experience of negative symptoms. <LINK REF="STD-De-Ronchi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">De Ronchi 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Gunduz_x002d_Bruce-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Gunduz-Bruce 2013</LINK> were the only studies to provide data using this scale.</P>
<P>7.2.5 Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms SAPS (<LINK REF="REF-Andreasen-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andreasen 1982</LINK>)<BR/>The SAPS, which is intended for use as a complementary instrument to the SANS, measures positive symptoms using a 34-item scale with a similar 6-point scoring system, by which 0 = better to 5 = worse. The 34 items are split into four sections, each measuring specific positive symptoms, including hallucinations, delusions, bizarre behaviour and positive formal thought disorder. <LINK REF="STD-De-Ronchi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">De Ronchi 1996</LINK> was the only study that provided usable data from this scale.</P>

<P>7.3.1 Social Behaviour Assessment Schedule SBAS (<LINK REF="REF-Platt-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Platt 1980</LINK>)<BR/>The SBAS is a standardised, semi-structured interview with the participant's closely involved family or friend (the 'informant'), undertaken without the participant present. The scale takes around 60 to 90 minutes to complete and measures both objective and subjective elements, referred to as the 'objective burden' (the effect of the participant's behaviour on others) and the 'subjective burden' (the distress directly inflicted by the participant upon others). The objective burden is assessed in a separate section, which takes into account changes that have occurred in the household and in the lives of the informant and relatives; the subjective burden is rated separately for each item in sections B (behaviour, onset, distress), C (change in social performance, onset of change, distress) and D (effects on children, onset, patient-relatedness, distress, effects on informant, effects on others). Section E assesses concurrent events of relevance to the participant's current situation (again, measuring onset and independence), and Section F assesses the amount of help and support that the informant receives from friends/relatives (support, informant's housing situation). Ratings are assigned for each item from a 0, 1, 2, 3 rating schema, where a lower score indicates a better outcome. <LINK REF="STD-Barnes-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Barnes 1983</LINK> was the only study to employ this scale, which provided skewed data.</P>

Seven items are included in the first section of the scale the 'questionnaire' and are judged on a 4-point scale of 0 to 3, where 0 = absent and 3 = severe. The second section the 'examination' examines three items, including tremor, bradykinesia, and gait and posture. These are rated for individual body parts on a two-dimensional continuum of severity and frequency. <LINK REF="STD-Friedman-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Friedman 2011</LINK> was the only study that provided usable data from this scale; these data were skewed.</P>
<P>7.5.2 Extrapyramidal Side Effects Scale EPS (<LINK REF="REF-Simpson-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simpson 1970</LINK>)<BR/>This observer-rated scale is designed to assess parkinsonian and related extrapyramidal side effects. The scale consists of ten items, including gait, arm dropping, shoulder shaking, elbow rigidity, wrist rigidity, leg pendulousness, head dropping, glabella tap, tremor and salivation; each is measured on a 5-point scoring system from 0 = absent to 4 = severe. <LINK REF="STD-Pecknold-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Pecknold 1980</LINK> was the only study that reported data using this scale; however, these were, again, skewed.</P>

<P>Twenty-eight studies were reported to be randomised; four studies were rated as 'high risk' of bias because no description of randomisation was provided (<LINK REF="STD-Andersen-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kline-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Kline 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Abuzzahab-1980_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Abuzzahab 1980*</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haas-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Haas 1982</LINK>); only 'double blind allocation' had taken place. Inclusion of data from these studies did not substantially alter most results of the analyses. Therefore we decided to include these studies in the overall analyses. When these studies appeared in our primary outcomes, they were subject to a sensitivity analysis this has been provided in the data and analysis sections (sensitivity analysis: <LINK REF="CMP-007.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-007.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.2</LINK>). Only four studies provided adequate information on randomisation techniques (<LINK REF="STD-Pinard-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Pinard 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1975_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1975*</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McInnes-1978" TYPE="STUDY">McInnes 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barnes-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Barnes 1983</LINK>). The remaining 24 studies were rated as 'unclear' risk of bias, as they had mentioned that randomisation had been employed but did not provide any further details.</P>
<P>
<BR/>Eighteen of the 28 studies reported as randomised included equal numbers of participants in the experimental and control groups without stating that they had used a matched pair design. The method of randomisation generally was not described with the exceptions of <LINK REF="STD-McInnes-1978" TYPE="STUDY">McInnes 1978</LINK>, who reported 'flicking a coin', and <LINK REF="STD-Pinard-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Pinard 1972</LINK>, who used a 'random number table'. Allocation concealment was generally poorly reported. Exceptions were <LINK REF="STD-Gowardman-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Gowardman 1973</LINK>, who reported allocation by the hospital pharmacist, suggesting adequate separation of allocation and treatment, and <LINK REF="STD-McInnes-1978" TYPE="STUDY">McInnes 1978</LINK>, who employed a 'double blind code'. <LINK REF="STD-Donlon-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Donlon 1977</LINK> reported allocation by a 'disinterested third party'. Poor reporting of allocation concealment has been associated with an overestimation of effect of about 30% to 40% (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>), which is likely with the remaining trials.</P>

<P>Overall description of blinding was poor throughout the records of the included studies; studies were described as 'double blind' with two exceptions, where <LINK REF="STD-Anumonye-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Anumonye 1976</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-De-Ronchi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">De Ronchi 1996</LINK> used a single-blind method. Eighteen studies briefly mentioned precautions that they used to maintain blindness (<LINK REF="STD-Chouinard-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Chouinard 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Andersen-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kudo-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Kudo 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Denijs-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Denijs 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gowardman-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Gowardman 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Claghorn-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Claghorn 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gross-1974_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Gross 1974*</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kolivakis-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Kolivakis 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1975_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1975*</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Falloon-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Falloon 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCreadie-1980" TYPE="STUDY">McCreadie 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chouinard-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Chouinard 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haas-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Haas 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCreadie-1982_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">McCreadie 1982*</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1982_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1982*</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barnes-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Barnes 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Silverstone-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Silverstone 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nishikawa-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Nishikawa 1985</LINK>). Twelve studies reported identical appearing drug treatment; <LINK REF="STD-Nishikawa-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Nishikawa 1985</LINK>, in addition, reported that taste was made identical by adding a "common gastric acid". Seven studies reported adding oral placebo to the experimental regimens to ensure that all participants had the same dosing frequency, and another three reported giving drug treatment as a single daily dose to all participants. Six studies that compared pimozide with a depot antipsychotic injection reported using a 'double dummy design' (<LINK REF="STD-Andersen-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Falloon-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Falloon 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCreadie-1980" TYPE="STUDY">McCreadie 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCreadie-1982_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">McCreadie 1982*</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barnes-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Barnes 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCreadie-1987" TYPE="STUDY">McCreadie 1987</LINK>), meaning that they had given either placebo injection or oral placebo to trial participants.</P>
<P>Blindness was not reported to have been tested in any of the included studies. Two questions: one to the participant "What do you think you have been given?" and one to the rater "What drug do you think this person was allocated?" would have clarified the situation. Failure to test double blinding leaves doubt as to how much observation bias is included in the data.</P>

<P>Only three studies reported data with 100% follow-up of participants (<LINK REF="STD-Gowardman-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Gowardman 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Anumonye-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Anumonye 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chouinard-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Chouinard 1982</LINK>), and LOCF was used in six of the included studies, in which loss was reported at 35% or less (<LINK REF="STD-Chouinard-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Chouinard 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Denijs-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Denijs 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Amin-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Amin 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barnes-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Barnes 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Ronchi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">De Ronchi 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Friedman-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Friedman 2011</LINK>). One study reported a large number of participants lost to follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Abuzzahab-1980_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Abuzzahab 1980*</LINK>), with only 24% of participants completing the full three years of the study only the outcome of 'leaving the study early' was presented in the data and analysis as per our protocol regarding <LINK TAG="MISSING_DATA" TYPE="SECTION">Dealing with missing data</LINK>.</P>
<P>Overall, poor reporting at each stage of the included studies made it difficult to ascertain the true numbers of participants who left the study early use of a flow chart would have been an appropriate measure to accurately reflect these numbers. Seventeen studies provided details of participants leaving the study early (<LINK REF="STD-Chouinard-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Chouinard 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huber-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Huber 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Andersen-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Denijs-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Denijs 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kolivakis-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Kolivakis 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1975_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1975*</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Anumonye-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Anumonye 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Amin-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Amin 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Donlon-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Donlon 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCreadie-1980" TYPE="STUDY">McCreadie 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pecknold-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Pecknold 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haas-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Haas 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCreadie-1982_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">McCreadie 1982*</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1982_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1982*</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Silverstone-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Silverstone 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCreadie-1987" TYPE="STUDY">McCreadie 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Ronchi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">De Ronchi 1996</LINK> ), and five studies did not make clear the numbers of participants lost to follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Pinard-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Pinard 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Claghorn-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Claghorn 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kline-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Kline 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McInnes-1978" TYPE="STUDY">McInnes 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nishikawa-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Nishikawa 1985</LINK>).

<P>Most studies were rated as high risk of bias, as not all outcomes were reported, in particular, data from rating scales went unreported from the time intervals specified in the study protocols. Continuous scale data were often poorly reported and either lacked explicit statements regarding the denominator and standard deviation or were presented only as significance tests.</P>
<P>
<BR/>Six of the 21 studies providing global outcomes appear to have presented their categorical global state data using a 'last observation carried forward' approach for those who left the study (<LINK REF="STD-Chouinard-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Chouinard 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Denijs-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Denijs 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Amin-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Amin 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barnes-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Barnes 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Ronchi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">De Ronchi 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Friedman-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Friedman 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gunduz_x002d_Bruce-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Gunduz-Bruce 2013</LINK>). Sometimes this was stated in the text, but in other instances, it was apparent only from the tables.

<P>Twenty-one of the included studies provided information regarding funding sources; of these, three did not specify any involvement with pharmaceutical companies, instead receiving support grants from the United States Public Health Service and the Psychopharmacology Fund, Minneapolis, Minnesota (USA) (<LINK REF="STD-Abuzzahab-1980_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Abuzzahab 1980*)</LINK>; a grant from the LEO Research Foundation, Helsingborg (Sweden) (<LINK REF="STD-Andersen-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 1972</LINK>) or support from the Stanley Medical Research Institute, Chevy Chase, Maryland (USA) (<LINK REF="STD-Gunduz_x002d_Bruce-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Gunduz-Bruce 2013</LINK>). The remaining studies were supplied grants as well as financial or other support from pharmaceutical companies: each of eighteen studies reported receipt of funding, advice, support and drugs provided by specific pharmaceutical companies. This included funding/grants or study drugs supplied by McNeil Laboratories, Fort Washington, Pennsylvania (USA) (<LINK REF="STD-Chouinard-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Chouinard 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huber-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Huber 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gross-1974_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Gross 1974*</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kolivakis-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Kolivakis 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1975_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1975*</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Donlon-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Donlon 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kline-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Kline 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pecknold-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Pecknold 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1982_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1982*</LINK>) and drugs supplied by Ravizza Farmaceuti, Milan (Italy) (<LINK REF="STD-De-Ronchi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">De Ronchi 1996</LINK>). Seven of the included studies received study drugs, advice or financial or other support from the pharmaceutical company responsible for developing pimozide, Janssen Pharmaceutica (Belgium) (<LINK REF="STD-Denijs-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Denijs 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Falloon-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Falloon 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCreadie-1980" TYPE="STUDY">McCreadie 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haas-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Haas 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCreadie-1982_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">McCreadie 1982*</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Silverstone-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Silverstone 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCreadie-1987" TYPE="STUDY">McCreadie 1987</LINK>). One author in the <LINK REF="STD-Silverstone-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Silverstone 1984</LINK> study was an employee of Janssen Pharmaceutica at the time of the trial. Further, <LINK REF="STD-Friedman-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Friedman 2011</LINK> received funding from grant MH0678060182 of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) but reported an extensive list of study authors' commercial interests, including previous grant support and contacts of employment (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> for further details).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">2. Rating scales</HEADING>
<P>Most of the included studies did not indicate whether raters of measurement scales were independent of treatment; only seven studies reported using independent assessors (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1975_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1975*</LINK> reported that the raters were a "research nurse and project psychiatrist". The research nurse data were thought more likely to be independent and are presented in this review, although the project psychiatrist data are very similar. Because the scale-rated outcomes were largely rated by a person who was unlikely to be disinterested in the final result, most of these are presented in this review with the warning, 'prone to bias'. Only seven studies gave details on how rating scales were administered and the extent to which raters were independent (<LINK REF="STD-Andersen-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pinard-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Pinard 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Anumonye-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Anumonye 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Falloon-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Falloon 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCreadie-1980" TYPE="STUDY">McCreadie 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCreadie-1982_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">McCreadie 1982*</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Friedman-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Friedman 2011</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. COMPARISON 1: PIMOZIDE versus PLACEBO</HEADING>
<P>Five studies were included in this comparison, with a total of 163 participants. Only two studies provided data for the primary outcomes of mental state and extrapyramidal symptoms, which included specific symptoms (n = 45; <LINK REF="STD-Huber-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Huber 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1975_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1975*</LINK>).

<P>Overall results were equivocal for global state, with no real differences noted between those receiving pimozide and those receiving placebo. Only one small study provided data for relapse, which by medium term slightly favoured pimozide, indicating a greater risk of relapse for those receiving placebo. However, this was not significant (1 RCT n = 20, RR 0.22 CI 0.03 to 1.78; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).</P>

<P>Again, individual studies with small sample sizes presented data for abnormal laboratory tests; tests were equivocal for each outcome with confidence intervals for best estimate of effect, including both no effect and appreciable benefit/ harm. Slight favour was noted with pimozide when any abnormal haematological data were assessed (1 RCT n = 25, RR 0.53 CI 0.19 to 1.51), when white cell count increased (1 RCT n = 19, RR 0.56 CI 0.06 to 5.14) and when blood urea nitrogen balance was abnormal (1 RCT n = 25, RR 0.23 CI 0.01 to 5.12); slight favour was seen with placebo with liver function abnormalities (1 RCT n = 25, RR 2.06 CI 0.09 to 46.11) and increased alkaline phosphatase (1 RCT n=19, RR 1.67 CI 0.36 to 7.82; <LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>).

<P>For our primary outcomes, only three studies reported data; therefore, a meaningful sensitivity analysis for randomisation is weak. For mental state: relapse, no indication in the results suggest that a study rated at 'high risk' was likely to overestimate the effects of the intervention (<LINK REF="CMP-007.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.1</LINK>). This was also the case for our additional primary outcome of Parkinsonism (<LINK REF="CMP-007.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.2</LINK>).

<P>Funnel plots were planned to investigate the possibility of publication bias (see <LINK TAG="METHODS" TYPE="SECTION">Methods</LINK>). The small study sizes led us to seek expert advice (see '<LINK TAG="ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS" TYPE="SECTION">Acknowledgements</LINK>'). Such plots are not powerful investigative tools and are further weakened when study size shows little variation (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>). Global state: No improvement data from the comparison of pimozide versus any antipsychotic were used to investigate whether systematic small trial bias was evident in a funnel plot analysis (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). Although the plot appears symmetrical (indicating an absence of bias), it should be remembered that a small number of studies was included, and it is difficult to draw any meaningful conclusions from the data. We think it inadvisable to read too much into this exploratory, low-powered technique of investigation. More studies with a wide spread of findings are needed.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Comparison 1: PIMOZIDE versus PLACEBO</HEADING>
<P>Please see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>. Data are very limited, allowing for few confident conclusions. Pimozide does appear better than placebo for preventing relapse by medium term, with only one small study providing data. Acceptability of treatment, as measured indirectly by leaving the study early, appeared the same for placebo for the first three months but favoured pimozide in the longer term. All adverse effects data are subject to random error, making confidence in the outcomes impossible.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Comparison 2: PIMOZIDE versus PLACEBO: WITHDRAWAL STUDY</HEADING>
<P>The one withdrawal study (<LINK REF="STD-Denijs-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Denijs 1973</LINK>; n = 40) comparing continuation of pimozide with its double-blind substitution by placebo suggested that once a person is stabilised by taking pimozide, its withdrawal will usually result in the need for supplementary antipsychotic treatment. One death was reported with pimozide, but this death was reported by the authors as not related to treatment.</P>
<P>Data from this small study support the impression that pimozide is an effective antipsychotic. Fewer people continuing pimozide required additional medication when compared with those withdrawn from it.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">3. Comparison 3: PIMOZIDE versus ANY ANTIPSYCHOTIC</HEADING>
<P>Please see <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3.1 Global state</HEADING>
<P>Generally, pimozide had similar efficacy to other antipsychotic drugs in preventing relapse and various measures of mental state. The outcome of admission is reported in only one study, with oral pimozide not clearly different from depot fluphenazine decanoate. For the unusual group of people recruited to such a trial, the preparations and the drugs may be interchangeable and tailored to clients&#8217; needs and preferences. This finding is unlikely to be generalisable to real-world mental healthcare.</P>
<P>All last observation carried forward analyses contain assumptions regarding the stability of the state of those who left the study early. It is difficult to know how these assumptions may have affected the final results, but analyses of various measures of global state consistently failed to reveal clear differences between the experimental drug and older typical antipsychotic drugs such as the 'benchmark' drug chlorpromazine (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2007</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3.2 Mental state</HEADING>
<P>Overall, data support the clinical efficacy of pimozide but not its superiority over more typical drugs.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3.3 Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>One control group death was due to suicide (<LINK REF="STD-Kolivakis-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Kolivakis 1974</LINK>); this is consistent with a lifetime rate of about 11%, as would be expected for this group. The lifetime incidence of suicide amongst people suffering from schizophrenia is 10% to 13% (<LINK REF="REF-Caldwell-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caldwell 1992</LINK>). The use of high doses of antipsychotic drugs has been associated with sudden death (<LINK REF="REF-Jusic-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jusic 1994</LINK>), but no sudden or cardiac deaths were reported in the included studies, possibly because. most participants did not receive doses above present recommended limits. Case reports of sudden death amongst those taking pimozide were associated with doses higher than 20 mg (<LINK REF="REF-CSM-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">CSM 1990</LINK>). Alternatively, this meta-analysis may not have had sufficient power to detect what might be a rare event.</P>
<P>No difference was found between the overall tolerability of pimozide and that of other drugs as measured indirectly by leaving the study because of adverse events.</P>
<P>A great number of adverse effects were listed in the included studies, but few showed clear differences between pimozide and other drugs. No differences were reported for the rare outcome of death, the several types of abnormal laboratory tests and cardiovascular problems. The latter include ECG changes, but these were reported in only one small study. The caution that surrounds the use of pimozide for people with cardiac problems (<LINK REF="REF-BNF-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF 2012</LINK>) is not based on trial-derived data.</P>
<P>Pimozide was found more likely to cause Parkinsonian tremor (number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 8) than typical antipsychotic drugs in the first three months of use. The difference in extrapyramidal adverse events was not maintained in the longer term (three months to one year). These limited data suggest that pimozide has clinically important extrapyramidal adverse effects.</P>
<P>In the medium term, pimozide was less sedating than the typical drugs (NNTH 4 CI 4 to 7). These differences are consistent with pimozide having more specific dopamine blocking activity than the antipsychotic drugs with which it was compared.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3.4 Leaving the study early</HEADING>
<P>This, the most data-replete result of the review, suggests no difference between pimozide and other drugs. Leaving the study early may be an indirect measure of acceptability of treatment. It has been suggested that because of its longer half-life, pimozide may be useful for people who find it difficult to take tablets on a regular basis (<LINK REF="STD-McCreadie-1987" TYPE="STUDY">McCreadie 1987</LINK>). Data from trials do not support this. On the other hand, in the medium term, pimozide did provide similar results when compared with fluphenazine depot in five studies (n = 189). In two of the comparisons with fluphenazine decanoate depot (n = 63), pimozide was given on an intermittent basis, thus taking advantage of its long half-life. Randomised trials that include relatively compliant people are very limited in their ability to investigate the value of depot medication for those who find compliance with medication difficult (<LINK REF="REF-Quraishi-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quraishi 1999</LINK>), and few claims should be made for pimozide on the basis of the limited data presented in this review. Only 7% of more than 500 people left the study early in the short term, and 35% by up to a year. This supports the theory that people in these trials were able to stick to study protocol, and differences in the outcome of compliance would not have been expected.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">4. Comparison 4. PIMOZIDE + ANY ANTIPSYCHOTIC versus ANY ANTIPSYCHOTIC</HEADING>
<P>Please see <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>. Data were scarce, but in the one study that made this comparison, pimozide when used in combination with another antipsychotic showed significantly reduced relapse rates and earlier losses than were seen when the same antipsychotic was given alone. This was demonstrated in one small study (n = 69), and the result was statistically significant (P = 0.00001).</P>

<P>Please see <LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>. The two small studies that presented data for this comparison used the same intervention (pimozide+clozapine vus clozapine+placebo); however, results were largely presented individually in data and by analyses, largely as the result of lack of uniform outcome measurements and considerable quantities of skewed data. Therefore, meta-analysis was an option only for the outcome of leaving the study early, which presented equivocal data. This comparison was made by the two most recent studies included in this review; larger studies will be needed to further clarify these results.</P>

<P>Please see <LINK REF="SOF-05" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 5</LINK>.</P>
<P>With only one small study providing data for all outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-De-Ronchi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">De Ronchi 1996</LINK>), it is difficult to make any sound judgement of the potential efficacy of augmented pimozide under this comparison, particularly because most reported data suggest no differences between groups or are skewed. All statistically significant data that are reported suggest greater improvement in global state and mental state scores when participants received levosulpiride+haloperidol, as opposed to the pimozide+haloperidol combination. Further research is needed if any confidence in these results is to be attained.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">7. Overall conclusion</HEADING>
<P>Although shortcomings and gaps in the data are evident, overall consistency over different outcomes and time scales is sufficient to confirm that pimozide is an antipsychotic of similar efficacy to other more commonly used antipsychotic drugs, such as chlorpromazine, for people with schizophrenia. It may have a slightly different side effect profile from typical antipsychotic drugs. Data related to delusional disorder and mono-delusional states are not trial-based.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Completeness</HEADING>
<P>This review does report how the trials considered outcomes such as service use, global scores, mental state and adverse effects. However, data on any one outcome are few and power is often limited. Most data are short to medium term, and we obtained no data on quality of life, satisfaction with care or clear functioning outcomes. No people were found to have a specific diagnosis of delusional disorder. This is disappointing in the light of claims made for the drug (<LINK REF="REF-Kaplan-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaplan 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Opler-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Opler 1995</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Applicability</HEADING>
<P>Overall, generalisability was good. All 32 studies included people with schizophrenia who would be recognisable in everyday practice. In most of the studies, the diagnosis was clinical, but a few used rigorous criteria. Participants with acute illness and those with chronic illness participated, and studies were undertaken in both hospital and community settings. The daily doses of pimozide largely reflect present practice, although five studies did employ higher levels than would be expected nowadays. Most outcomes reported are, we believe, accessible to clinicians and to recipients of care.</P>
<P>Most of the included studies were published between 1970 and 1987, with the exception of one study (<LINK REF="STD-Friedman-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Friedman 2011</LINK>), which may reduce applicability to current practice. People with both schizophrenia and substance misuse were frequently excluded; this may reduce the applicability of findings because co-existence of the two problems is common (<LINK REF="REF-Turner-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 1990</LINK>). Non-Western cultures were represented by only two small studies; therefore, applicability to those in the developing world may be limited.</P>

<P>This review currently includes 32 studies with 1277 participants with ages ranging from 16 to 80 years and average age of 43 years. The sexes appeared evenly distributed, with 693 males and 584 females. The included studies were published over a long period (from 1971 to 2012) and in different settings (e.g. inpatients and outpatients). Many trials were completed within four months, and only one study lasted three years. The shortest study was conducted for four weeks, and the longest study had a duration of three years. Most participants had received a diagnosis of schizophrenia. However, the diagnostic criteria were not specified in 58% of the included studies, in which diagnosis was made pragmatically. Other studies used <I>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</I> (DSM) III, DSM IV, International Classification of Diseases (ICD) and Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC) as the criteria for diagnosis. The dose of pimozide ranged from 1 to 70 mg per day, with an average dose of 45.7 mg. Most of the studies were reported to be randomised and to use double-blind technique. However, details were not provided. Only four of the studies described randomisation adequately. Outcomes, participants leaving the study early and statistical data were poorly reported in most studies.</P>
<P>Important methodological limitations were present in the trials included in this review. Some were carried out before the <A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org/">CONSORT</A> (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement of 2001 was issued (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>), thus the level of reporting currently expected was not available in the papers describing these studies, particularly with regard to allocation concealment, randomisation and blinding processes.</P>
<P>Almost all studies were reported as randomised and double-blind, but for most of them, details were not presented. Therefore it is unclear whether the studies were adequately randomised, whether treatment allocation was concealed and whether blinding worked. For each study in the review, areas of unclear bias were identified and are listed in the risk of bias tables under each table of characteristics of included studies; they are also graphically summarised in <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>. Data on participants leaving the study early were not reported in many cases, and statistical reporting was incomplete in almost all studies.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. For people with schizophrenia</HEADING>
<P>Pimozide is probably as effective as other commonly used antipsychotic treatments for schizophrenia. It may therefore be a matter of personal preference as to which treatment is best to select. For those with delusional disorder, no strong evidence suggests that it is an effective treatment or that it is preferable to other antipsychotic drugs, so those with delusional disorder might ask whether other treatments are better supported by evidence. The review authors found pimozide to be a safe drug as long as the currently recommended levels (20 mg/d) are not exceeded. ECG monitoring is needed because use of pimozide has been associated with sudden death at doses higher than are now used. People who are not happy with this situation might prefer an alternative. Pimozide may be less prone to cause sleepiness than typical antipsychotic drugs, but this observation has to be weighed against its possible propensity to cause increased tremor, which may need to be relieved by additional antiparkinsonian medication.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. For clinicians</HEADING>
<P>Pimozide appears to be a treatment of similar efficacy to typical antipsychotic drugs for those with schizophrenia. However, the often made claim that pimozide is a particularly useful treatment for delusional disorder is not based on trial evidence, and no evidence of its efficacy has been found amongst those whose illness is dominated by negative symptoms. Oral pimozide might be useful for those who find depot medication intolerable. Pimozide may be more likely than typical drugs to cause parkinsonian tremor and the need for antiparkinsonian medication, but it appears to be less sedating than other drugs. Overall tolerability for patients (measured indirectly) appears the same as for typical antipsychotic drugs, so clinicians should consider individual susceptibility to adverse effects and patient preference. Sudden or cardiac death was not reported. Pimozide appears to be safe in doses below 20 mg/d. Unfortunately, very few data have been obtained from controlled trials on ECG changes to guide clinicians on optimal monitoring. Evidence is insufficient to allow the review authors to determine the frequency of asymptomatic ECG changes that might require the drug to be stopped in clinical practice. Furthermore, evidence is insufficient to suggest that pimozide augmentation with any antipsychotic may lead to better results in reducing relapse rates and improving mental state or overall quality of life.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">3. For managers/policy makers</HEADING>
<P>Pimozide is inexpensive and appears as effective as other 'first-line', typical antipsychotic drugs. It seems to have a different adverse effect profile when compared with these other drugs and therefore may be preferred by certain people. However, its use does require ECG monitoring, which could be considered an extra cost in terms of staff time.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. General</HEADING>
<P>The trials reviewed predated the CONSORT statement (<LINK REF="REF-Begg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begg 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>). Had this statement been anticipated, a greater quantity of data would have been available to inform practice. Allocation concealment gives the assurance that selection bias is kept to the minimum and should be properly executed and described. Well-reported and well-tested blinding could have encouraged confidence in the control of performance and detection bias. It is important to know how many, and from which groups, people were withdrawn if exclusion bias is to be evaluated. Raters should be independent of treatment. It would have been helpful if authors had presented data in a useful manner that reflects the association between intervention and outcome, for example, relative risk, odds ratio, risk or mean differences, as well as raw numbers. Binary outcomes should be calculated in preference to continuous results, as they are easier to interpret. If P values are used, the exact values should be reported. Trials should report service utilisation data, as well as information on satisfaction with care and economic outcomes (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Specific</HEADING>
<P>The efficacy of pimozide seems comparable with that of other typical antipsychotic drugs, but it has not been tested adequately against placebo, probably because licensing requirements were less stringent at the time pimozide was developed. For example, it has never been tested in a randomised trial for delusional disorder in spite of the claim that it is particularly useful for this condition. This may be a result of the relative rarity of this condition (<LINK REF="REF-Winokur-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winokur 1977</LINK>), or it may be associated with difficulty in obtaining co-operation from this group of people, but claims should be supported by high-grade evidence. The claim that pimozide is useful for people with negative symptoms has not been tested in a trial in which these were properly measured with a well-validated scale. Also, good quality ECG data from clinical trials are insufficient to inform clinicians on the optimal monitoring strategy.</P>
<P>As with so many antipsychotic drugs, the efficacy of this widely available drug has never really been adequately tested in real-world conditions. If energy and funding can be found, good, clinically meaningful trials are justified, probably specifically for those with monosymptomatic hypochondriacal psychosis. This would be a most difficult study to undertake and would necessitate wide collaboration on outcomes of agreed relevance. Nevertheless, this group of people can be most disabled, and should pimozide have a role here, its use would indeed be most valuable. A suggested design is given in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>

<P>CEA - Clive Adams (Cochrane Schizophrenia Group, UK) undertook searches and gave invaluable help in preparing the protocol, selecting and acquiring studies,helping with extracting and summating data and producing the report. His enthusiasm and energy are infectious! We wish to thank Dr. Jayaram Mahesh for his support and feedback throughout the most recent updating process.</P>
<P>Jo Wood (Janssen-Cilag, UK) was most helpful in searching the company's database and supplying articles. Mattias Egger (University of Bristol, UK) gave advice on the validity of funnel plots and allowed perusal of a yet unpublished study on this matter, for which we are grateful.</P>
<P>Several letters were sent by the review authors to study authors, asking for extra information related to their trials. RG McCreadie (Crighton Royal Hospital, Dumfries, UK) was very kind in responding and offering access to unpublished data. We thank Thomas Barnes, who provided further information related to his study included in this review, as did Stephen Platt, who provided us with details of the SBAS rating scale used in the same study. We would also like to thank Diana De Ronchi for her correspondence and assistance.</P>
<P>Karen Perkins and other staff of the well-organised medical library (St. Andrew's Hospital, Northampton, UK) gave invaluable help in obtaining articles and using computer databases. Also thanks to Di Wyman (St. Andrew's Hospital, Northampton, UK) for her patient and efficient administrative help. Thanks are also due to Dr. Nevison Andrews (St. Andrew's Hospital, Northampton, UK) for support and encouragement, and to Dr. Staley (St. Andrew's Hospital, Northampton, UK), likewise for support and encouragement to pursue research projects.</P>
<P>We are really sorry not to include Alec Sultana and Tom McMonagle as co-authors. We would happily do so but have lost all contact with these authors. Elaine Sultana (spouse) helped with correspondence and was always tolerant and supportive during the hours of computer work. Alec Sultana prepared the first protocol, selected studies for the first version of this review, extracted data and helped write the report. Tom McMonagle also provided support during writing of protocol, study selection, data extraction, summation of data and report writing. John Rathbone (update 2005) selected studies, extracted data and assisted with report writing.</P>

<P>1. Additions have been made to <LINK TAG="CRIT_INTERVENTIONS" TYPE="SECTION">Types of interventions</LINK>: The protocol to the current review did not specify a comparison with specific named drugs (atypical or typical) nor dosages, which is certainly a comparison of interest for people receiving treatment as well as for clinicians administering medication and was subsequently addressed in the final text.</P>
<P/>
<P>2. Fixed-effect model used in this 2012 update, whereas a random-effects model was used in the originally published review. The review authors believe that a random-effects model puts added weight onto small studies, which often are the most biased (see <LINK TAG="DATA_SYNTHESIS" TYPE="SECTION">Data synthesis</LINK>). However, a random-effects model was used (1) in a sensitivity analysis to inspect whether this changes the estimate of the effect, and (2) when considerable heterogeneity was present.</P>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">
<P>1. The <LINK TAG="DATA_COLLECTION" TYPE="SECTION">Data collection and analysis</LINK> section has been updated to reflect changes in methodology that have occurred whilst this review was being written, namely, inclusion of Risk of Bias tables and Summary of Findings tables.</P>
<P/>
<P>2. Types of outcome measures have been modified/clarified from the original protocol, this decision was not influenced by the results. Economic outcomes of direct and indirect costs have been qualified as 'defined by each study', to take into account that what may constitute a direct or an indirect cost can differ between trial authors. A further subcategory of 'cost-effectiveness' has been added, again, a factor that would be 'defined by each study'.</P>
<P/>
<P>3. Further, the protocol specified a global state outcome of 'no clinically important change in global state (as defined by individual studies)'; this has been changed to 'any clinically important change in global state (as defined by individual studies)'. The direction of the graphs has been modified to represent an unfavourable outcome for intermittent treatment when results are presented to the left of the line of no effect.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">1. Selection of trials</HEADING>
<P>Material downloaded from electronic sources included details of author, institution or journal of publication.</P>
<P>For the original publication, the principal review author (AS) inspected all reports. These were then re-inspected by TM to ensure reliable selection. We resolved any disagreement by discussion, and when doubt contiinued, we acquired the full article for further inspection. Once the full articles were obtained, we (AS and TM) decided whether the studies met the review criteria. If disagreement could not be resolved by discussion, we sought further information, and these trials were added to the list of those awaiting assessment. For the 2005 update, JR independently selected studies identified through the 2005 search strategy.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2. Assessment of methodological quality</HEADING>
<P>We assessed the methodological quality of included trials in this review using the criteria described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>) and the Jadad Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>). The former is based on evidence of a strong relationship between allocation concealment and direction of effect (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). The categories are defined below.</P>
<P>A. Low risk of bias (adequate allocation concealment).<BR/>B. Moderate risk of bias (some doubt about the results).<BR/>C. High risk of bias (inadequate allocation concealment). For the purpose of the analysis in this review, trials were included if they met the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> criterion A or B.</P>
<P>The Jadad Scale measures a wider range of factors that can impact the quality of a trial. The scale includes three items.<BR/>1. Was the study described as randomised?<BR/>2. Was the study described as double-blind?<BR/>3. Was there a description of withdrawals and people leaving the study early?</P>
<P>Each item receives one point if the answer is positive. In addition, a point can be deducted if the randomisation or the blinding/masking procedures described are inadequate. For this review, we used a cut-off of two points on the Jadad Scale to check the assessment made in accordace with the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> criteria. However, we did not use the Jadad Scale to exclude trials.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">3. Data collection</HEADING>
<P>AS independently extracted data from selected trials, while TM separately re-extracted information from two different samples (10%). When disputes arose, we attempted to resolve these by discussion. When this was not possible and further information was necessary to resolve the dilemma, data were not entered, and we added the trial to the list of those awaiting assessment. For the 2005 update, JR independently extracted data. When doubts arose as to the appropriateness of a study, this was discussed with the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Co-ordinating Editor.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">4. Data synthesis</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">4.1 Data types</HEADING>
<P>We assessed outcomes using continuous (e.g. changes on a behaviour scale), categorical (e.g. one of three categories on a behaviour scale, such as 'little change', 'moderate change' or 'much change') or dichotomous (e.g. 'no important changes' or 'important changes' in a person's behaviour) measures. Currently RevMan does not support categorical data, so we were unable to analysis this.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">4.2 Incomplete data</HEADING>
<P>We did not include trial outcomes if more than 40% of participants were not reported in the final analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">4.3 Dichotomous&#65293;yes/no&#65293;data</HEADING>
<P>We carried out an intention-to-treat analysis. On the condition that more than 60% of people completed the study, all participants allocated to the intervention were counted, whether they completed the follow-up or not. It was assumed that those who dropped out had the negative outcome, with the exception of death. Where possible, efforts were made to convert outcome measures to dichotomous data. This can be done by identifying cut-off points on rating scales and dividing participants accordingly into 'clinically improved' and 'not clinically improved'. If the authors of a study had used a predefined cut-off point for determining clinical effectiveness, this was used by the review authors where appropriate. Otherwise it was generally assumed that if there a 50% reduction had been noted in a scale-derived score, this could be considered as a clinically significant response. Similarly, a rating of 'at least much improved' according to the Clinical Global Impression Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Guy-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guy 1976</LINK>) was considered as a clinically significant response.</P>
<P>The relative risk (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated on the basis of the random-effects model, as this takes into account any differences between studies, even if no statistically significant heterogeneity is observed. It has been shown that RR is more intuitive (Boiseel 1999) than odds ratios, which tend to be interpreted as RR by clinicians (Deekes 2000). This misinterpretation then leads to an overestimate of the impression of the effect. We inspected data to see whether an analysis using a fixed-effect model made any substantive difference in outcomes that were not statistically significantly heterogeneous. When the overall results were significant, we calculated the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) and the number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) as the inverse of the risk difference.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">4.4 Continuous data</HEADING>
<P>4.4.1 Normally distributed data: Continuous data on clinical and social outcomes often are not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data, we applied the following standards to all data before inclusion: (a) Standard deviations and means were reported in the paper or were obtainable from the authors; (b) when a scale started from the finite number zero, the standard deviation, when multiplied by two, was less than the mean (as otherwise, the mean is unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution) (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>); (c) if a scale started from a positive value (such as PANSS, which can have values from 30 to 210), the calculation described above was modified to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases, skew is present if 2 SD &gt; (S - Smin), where S is the mean score and Smin is the minimum score. Endpoint scores on scales often have finite starting and ending points, and these rules can be applied to them. When continuous data are presented on a scale that includes a possibility of negative values (such as change on a scale), it is difficult to tell whether or not data are non-normally distributed (skewed). Skewed data from studies of fewer than 200 participants would have been entered into additional tables rather than into an analysis. Skewed data pose less of a problem when one is looking at means if the sample size is large and would have been entered into a synthesis.</P>
<P>For change data (endpoint minus baseline), the situation is even more problematic. In the absence of individual participant data, it is impossible to know whether data are skewed, although this is likely. After consulting the ALLSTAT electronic statistics mailing list, we presented change data in MetaView to summarise available information. In doing this, it was assumed that data were not skewed or that the analyses could cope with the unknown degree of skew. Without individual participant data, it is impossible to test this assumption. When both change and endpoint data were available for the same outcome category, only endpoint data were presented. We acknowledge that by doing this many of the published change data were excluded, but we argue that endpoint data are more clinically relevant and that if change data were to be presented along with endpoint data, this would be given undeserved equal prominence. We are contacting authors of studies reporting only change data for endpoint figures. We reported non-normally distributed data in the 'other data types' tables.</P>
<P>4.4.2 Rating scales: A wide range of instruments are available to measure mental health outcomes. These instruments vary in quality, and many are not valid, or even ad hoc. For outcome instruments, some minimum standards have to be set. It has been shown that the use of rating scales that have not been described in a peer-reviewed journal (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>) is associated with bias; therefore the results of such scales were excluded. Furthermore, we stipulated that the instrument shouldbe a self-report or should be completed by an independent rater or relative (not the therapist), and that the instrument could be considered a global assessment of an area of functioning. However, as it was expected that therapists would frequently also be the raters, such data were included but were commented on as 'prone to bias'.</P>
<P>Whenever possible, we took the opportunity to make direct comparisons between trials that used the same measurement instrument to quantify specific outcomes. When continuous data were presented from different scales in rating the same effect, both sets of data were presented, and the general direction of effect was inspected.</P>
<P>4.4.3 Summary statistic<BR/>For continuous outcomes, we estimated a weighted mean difference (WMD) between groups, again based on the random-effects model, as this takes into account any differences between studies, even if no statistically significant heterogeneity is noted.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">4.5 Cluster trials</HEADING>
<P>Studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice), but analysis and pooling of clustered data pose problems. First, authors often fail to account for intraclass correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) whereby P values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This causes type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>When clustering was not accounted for in primary studies, we presented the data in a table, with an (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review, we will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intraclass correlation coefficients of their clustered data and to adjust for these using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Where clustering has been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we will present these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjusted for the clustering effect.</P>
<P>We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a 'design effect'. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) [Design effect = 1 + (m - 1) * ICC] (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC was not reported, it was assumed to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>If cluster studies had been appropriately analysed, with intraclass correlation coefficients and relevant data documented in the report taken into account, synthesis with other studies would have been possible using the generic inverse variance technique.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">5. Investigation for heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>First, we considered all included studies within any comparison to judge clinical heterogeneity. Then graphs were visually inspected to investigate the possibility of statistical heterogeneity. This was supplemented using, primarily, the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic. This provides an estimate of the percentage of variability due to heterogeneity rather than chance alone. When the I<SUP>2</SUP> estimate was greater than or equal to 75%, we interpreted this as indicating the presence of high levels of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). If inconsistency was high, we did not summate data but presented the data separately and investigated the reasons for heterogeneity.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">6. Addressing publication bias</HEADING>
<P>We entered data from all identified and selected trials into a funnel graph (trial effect vs trial size) in an attempt to investigate the likelihood of overt publication bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">7. Sensitivity analyses</HEADING>
<P>If available, results for delusional disorder will be compared with results for other psychotic diagnoses with regard to primary outcomes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">8. General</HEADING>
<P>When possible, we entered data in such a way that the area to the left of the line of no effect indicated a favourable outcome for pimozide.</P>
