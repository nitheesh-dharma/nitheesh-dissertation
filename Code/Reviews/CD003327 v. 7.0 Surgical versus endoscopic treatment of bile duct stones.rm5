<P>
<B>Background </B>
<BR/>Gallstones are a common problem in the general population and commonly cause problems with pain (biliary colic) and gallbladder infections (acute cholecystitis). Gallstones can sometimes migrate out of the gallbladder and become trapped in the tube between the gallbladder and the small bowel (common bile duct). Here, they obstruct the flow of bile from the liver and gallbladder into the small bowel and cause pain, jaundice (yellowish discolouration of the eyes, dark urine, and pale stools), and sometimes severe infections of the bile (cholangitis). Between 10% and 18% of people undergoing cholecystectomy for gallstones have common bile duct stones.</P>
<P>Treatment involves removal of the gallbladder as well as the gallstones from this tube. There are several methods to achieve this. Surgery is performed to remove the gallbladder. In the past, this was performed through a single large incision through the abdomen (open cholecystectomy). Newer keyhole techniques (laparoscopic surgery) are now the most common methods of removal of the gallbladder. Removal of the trapped gallstones in the common bile duct can be performed at the same time as the open or keyhole surgery. Alternatively, an endoscope (a narrow flexible tube equipped with a camera) is inserted through the mouth and into the small bowel to allow removal of the trapped gallstones from the common bile duct. This procedure can be performed before, during, and after the surgery to remove the gallbladder. This systematic review attempts to answer the question of the safest and most effective method to remove these trapped gallstones (in terms of open surgery or laparoscopic surgery compared with endoscopic removal), whether removal of the common bile duct stones should be performed during surgery to remove the gallbladder as a single-stage treatment or as a separate treatment before or after surgery (two-stage treatment).</P>
<P>
<B>Review questions</B>
<BR/>We analysed results from randomised clinical trials in the literature to assess the benefits and harms of these procedures</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of evidence </B>
<BR/>We identified a total of 16 trials including 1758 participants. All the trials were at high risk of bias (defects in study design which may result in overestimation of benefits or underestimation of harms). Overall the quality of the evidence is moderate because of the risk of systematic errors or bias (defects in study design) and random errors (insufficient number of participants were included in the trials) which can result in wrong conclusions.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results </B>
<BR/>Our analysis suggests open surgery to remove the gallbladder and trapped gallstones appears to be as safe as endoscopy and may even be more successful than the endoscopic technique in clearing the duct stones. Keyhole (laparoscopic) surgery to remove the gallbladder and trapped gallstones appears to be as safe as and as effective as the endoscopic technique. More randomised clinical trials conducted with low risks of systematic errors (trials) and low risks of random errors (play of chances) are required to confirm or refute the present findings.</P>

<P>Between 10% to 18% of people undergoing cholecystectomy for gallstones have common bile duct stones. Treatment of the bile duct stones can be conducted as open cholecystectomy plus open common bile duct exploration or laparoscopic cholecystectomy plus laparoscopic common bile duct exploration (LC + LCBDE) versus pre- or post-cholecystectomy endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in two stages, usually combined with either sphincterotomy (commonest) or sphincteroplasty (papillary dilatation) for common bile duct clearance. The benefits and harms of the different approaches are not known.<BR/>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-09-02 14:20:17 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Sixteen randomised clinical trials with a total of 1758 randomised participants fulfilled the inclusion criteria of this review. Eight trials with 737 participants compared open surgical clearance with ERCP; five trials with 621 participants compared laparoscopic clearance with pre-operative ERCP; and two trials with 166 participants compared laparoscopic clearance with postoperative ERCP. One trial with 234 participants compared LCBDE with intra-operative ERCP. There were no trials of open or LCBDE versus ERCP in people without an intact gallbladder. All trials had a high risk of bias.</P>
<P>There was no significant difference in the mortality between open surgery versus ERCP clearance (eight trials; 733 participants; 5/371 (1%) versus 10/358 (3%) OR 0.51;95% CI 0.18 to 1.44). Neither was there a significant difference in the morbidity between open surgery versus ERCP clearance (eight trials; 733 participants; 76/371 (20%) versus 67/358 (19%) OR 1.12; 95% CI 0.77 to 1.62). Participants in the open surgery group had significantly fewer retained stones compared with the ERCP group (seven trials; 609 participants; 20/313 (6%) versus 47/296 (16%) OR 0.36; 95% CI 0.21 to 0.62), P = 0.0002.</P>
<P>There was no significant difference in the mortality between LC + LCBDE versus pre-operative ERCP +LC (five trials; 580 participants; 2/285 (0.7%) versus 3/295 (1%) OR 0.72; 95% CI 0.12 to 4.33). Neither was there was a significant difference in the morbidity between the two groups (five trials; 580 participants; 44/285 (15%) versus 37/295 (13%) OR 1.28; 95% CI 0.80 to 2.05). There was no significant difference between the two groups in the number of participants with retained stones (five trials; 580 participants; 24/285 (8%) versus 31/295 (11%) OR 0.79; 95% CI 0.45 to 1.39).</P>
<P>There was only one trial assessing LC + LCBDE versus LC+intra-operative ERCP including 234 participants. There was no reported mortality in either of the groups. There was no significant difference in the morbidity, retained stones, procedure failure rates between the two intervention groups.</P>
<P>Two trials assessed LC + LCBDE versus LC+post-operative ERCP. There was no reported mortality in either of the groups. There was no significant difference in the morbidity between laparoscopic surgery and postoperative ERCP groups (two trials; 166 participants; 13/81 (16%) versus 12/85 (14%) OR 1.16; 95% CI 0.50 to 2.72). There was a significant difference in the retained stones between laparoscopic surgery and postoperative ERCP groups (two trials; 166 participants; 7/81 (9%) versus 21/85 (25%) OR 0.28; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.72; P = 0.008.</P>
<P>In total, seven trials including 746 participants compared single staged LC + LCBDE versus two-staged pre-operative ERCP + LC or LC + post-operative ERCP. There was no significant difference in the mortality between single and two-stage management (seven trials; 746 participants; 2/366 versus 3/380 OR 0.72; 95% CI 0.12 to 4.33). There was no a significant difference in the morbidity (seven trials; 746 participants; 57/366 (16%) versus 49/380 (13%) OR 1.25; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.89). There were significantly fewer retained stones in the single-stage group (31/366 participants; 8%) compared with the two-stage group (52/380 participants; 14%), but the difference was not statistically significantOR 0.59; 95% CI 0.37 to 0.94).</P>
<P>There was no significant difference in the conversion rates of LCBDE to open surgery when compared with pre-operative, intra-operative, and postoperative ERCP groups. Meta-analysis of the outcomes duration of hospital stay, quality of life, and cost of the procedures could not be performed due to lack of data.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-09-02 10:55:37 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Gallstones occur in approximately 15% of the general population (<LINK REF="REF-Stinton-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stinton 2012</LINK>). In people who have cholecystectomy for gallbladder stones, approximately 10% to 18% also have common bile duct stones (<LINK REF="REF-Soltan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soltan 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2008</LINK>). Common bile duct stones can be suspected pre-operatively by symptoms or signs of jaundice, pancreatitis, or cholangitis, or by derangement in liver function tests, or on imaging showing duct dilation or actual ductal stones. Chronic obstruction can result in hepatic abscess, secondary biliary cirrhosis, and portal hypertension. In people without jaundice, with normal duct size on trans-abdominal ultrasound, the prevalence of common bile duct stones at the time of cholecystectomy is less than 5% (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2008</LINK>). The natural history of common bile duct stones is not known, though complications appear to be more frequent and severe than in those with asymptomatic gallstones (<LINK REF="REF-Ko-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ko 2002</LINK>). Up to a third of people with stones identified at intra-operative cholangiogram clear their ducts spontaneously after surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 2004</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-09-02 10:55:27 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Open surgery</B>
<BR/>Open surgical bile duct clearance is achieved by open surgical exploration of the common bile duct that could include flushing (with or without the aid of interventions like glucagon or buscopan), balloon extraction, mechanical lithotripsy or Dormia basket extraction or both (with or without the use of choledochoscopy), and either antegrade or retrograde sphincterotomy.</P>
<P>
<B>Laparoscopic surgery</B>
<BR/>Laparoscopic surgery involves laparoscopic cholecystectomy combined with bile duct exploration (LCBDE) that is achieved either by transcystic or by choledochotomy techniques including flushing, balloon extraction, mechanical lithotripsy or Dormia basket extraction or both (with or without the use of choledochoscopy), with or without sphincterotomy.</P>
<P>
<B>Endoscopy</B>
<BR/>Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) involves endoscopic intervention in the bile duct. A side-viewing duodenoscope is used to identify the ampulla of Vater that is cannulated, and stone extraction is performed by endoscopic sphincterotomy or sphincteroplasty most commonly accompanied by either balloon or basket extraction of the common bile duct stones. Mechanical lithotripsy is used for larger stones.</P>
<P>
<I>Pre-operative ERCP</I>
<BR/>ERCP is performed prior to surgical intervention with the aim of clearing the common bile duct. Patients, later, underwent cholecystectomy (open or laparoscopic) as a separate procedure (irrespective of the duration between the ERCP and laparoscopic cholecystectomy).</P>
<P>
<I>Intra-operative ERCP</I>
<BR/>ERCP is performed at the time of surgical intervention to remove the gallbladder either by passing the guidewire through the cystic duct (rendezvous) or by the transampullary route.</P>
<P>
<I>Postoperative ERC</I>P<BR/>Patients underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy as the initial procedure, and it was followed by ERCP if there were ductal stones identified on intra-operative cholangiogram.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-09-02 10:36:16 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Common bile duct stones are often complicated by obstructive jaundice with or without superadded infection (cholangitis) or pancreatitis. Patients with asymptomatic bile duct stones are at a risk of developing these serious complications and require intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Tazuma-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tazuma 2006</LINK>). Common bile duct exploration and removal of the ductal stones clear the ductal obstruction, and the patient can then proceed with laparoscopic cholecystectomy at the same operation, or as two different procedures.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-09-02 16:58:41 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The ideal treatment for common bile duct stones is still controversial. The options are that of surgical treatment alone (open or laparoscopic surgery) or a combination of endoscopy with surgical treatment (pre-, intra- or post laparoscopic cholecystectomy ERCP) to clear the common bile duct stones.</P>
<P>In the era of open cholecystectomy, most common bile duct stones found at surgery were managed at the time, with only a minority managed by the alternative, namely, ERCP with or without endoscopic sphincterotomy (<LINK REF="REF-Fletcher-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fletcher 1994</LINK>). Studies suggested that surgical common bile duct stone extraction was the recommended option for routine cases (<LINK REF="REF-Neoptolemos-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neoptolemos 1989</LINK>). In the early days of laparoscopic biliary surgery, operative clearance of common bile duct stones along with laparoscopic cholecystectomy was not considered technically possible. Either open surgical clearance or, more commonly, ERCP/sphincterotomy became the techniques used to clear common bile duct stones.</P>
<P>Endoscopic intervention helps removal of stones from the duct so that surgical exploration of the bile duct can be avoided. When the duct is cleared by ERCP, the patient can then proceed to laparoscopic cholecystectomy. ERCP (either pre- or postoperatively) remains the preferred approach at most centres for managing patients with suspected common bile duct stones. However, ERCP is associated with complications such as pancreatitis, haemorrhage, cholangitis, duodenal perforation (5% to 11%) and mortality of up to 1% (<LINK REF="REF-Coelho_x002d_Prabhu-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coelho-Prabhu 2013</LINK>). Failure rates of 5% to 10% are reported with ERCP. Also, when patients proceed to ERCP, a significant number of them may not have stones (<LINK REF="STD-Rhodes-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Rhodes 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nathanson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nathanson 2005</LINK>), yet patients risk these complications. The rate of negative ERCP (without stones), determined on the basis of absence of common bile duct stones, can vary from 15% to 25% (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 2004</LINK>). A selective use of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) in patients with suspected choledocholithiasis is practised in the diagnosis of common bile duct stones, prior to definitive endoscopic or surgical intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Mercer-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mercer 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Laparoscopic exploration and clearance of common bile duct stones has become technically feasible, and several studies have shown that laparoscopic treatment of common bile duct stones is possible and is potentially as effective as ERCP (<LINK REF="STD-Lezoche-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lezoche 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cuschieri-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Cuschieri 1999</LINK>). Transcystic or transcholedochal exploration of the common bile duct could be performed at the time of laparoscopic cholecystectomy (<LINK REF="STD-Martin-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Decker-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Decker 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rojas_x002d_Ortega-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rojas-Ortega 2003</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Clayton-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clayton 2006</LINK> demonstrated that ERCP and LCBDE have similar rates of stone clearance, morbidity, and mortality. Advantages of surgical common bile duct exploration are that the sphincter anatomy is not distorted and that the cholecystectomy is performed during the same procedure. However, surgical common bile duct exploration can be associated with the risk of bile leak (<LINK REF="STD-Nathanson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nathanson 2005</LINK>) and a possibility of long-term complications of common bile duct stricture.</P>
<P>The current review is performed to compare the surgical and endoscopic options of management of common bile duct stones. This is an updated version of the Cochrane systematic review published by <LINK REF="REF-Martin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin 2006</LINK>.</P>

Risk of bias domains were classified as follows:</P>
<P>
<B>Allocation sequence generation</B>
<BR/>- Low risk of bias: sequence generation was achieved using computer random number generation or a random number table. Drawing lots, tossing a coin, shuffling cards, and throwing dice were adequate if performed by an independent person not otherwise involved in the trial.<BR/>- Uncertain risk of bias: the method of sequence generation was not specified.<BR/>- High risk of bias: the sequence generation method was not random.<BR/>
<B>Allocation concealment</B>
<BR/>- Low risk of bias: the participant allocations could not have been foreseen in advance of, or during, enrolment. Allocation was controlled by a central and independent randomisation unit. The allocation sequence was unknown to the investigators (for example, if the allocation sequence was hidden in sequentially numbered, opaque, and sealed envelopes).<BR/>- Uncertain risk of bias: the method used to conceal the allocation was not described so that intervention allocations may have been foreseen in advance of, or during enrolment.<BR/>- High risk of bias: the allocation sequence was likely to be known to the investigators who assigned the participants.<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>Blinding of participants, personnel, and outcome assessors</B>
<BR/>- Low risk of bias: blinding was performed adequately, or the assessment of outcomes was not likely to be influenced by lack of blinding.<BR/>- Uncertain risk of bias: there was insufficient information to assess whether blinding was likely to induce bias in the results.<BR/>- High risk of bias: no blinding or incomplete blinding, and the assessment of outcomes was likely to be influenced by lack of blinding.</P>
<P>Blinding of the participants and healthcare providers is not possible in a study comparing the endoscopic or surgical procedures. Also, it is not ethical to blind the surgeon when the patient might still require bile duct exploration.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>Incomplete outcome data</B>
<BR/>- Low risk of bias: missing data were unlikely to make treatment effects depart from plausible values. Sufficient methods, such as multiple imputation, had been employed to handle missing data.<BR/>- Uncertain risk of bias: there was insufficient information to assess whether missing data in combination with the method used to handle missing data were likely to induce bias in the results.<BR/>- High risk of bias: the results were likely to be biased due to missing data.</P>
<P>
<B>Selective outcome reporting</B>
<BR/>- Low risk of bias: all outcomes were predefined and reported, or all clinically relevant and reasonably expected outcomes were reported. The trial was registered either on the <A HREF="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">www.clinicaltrials.gov</A> web site or a similar register, or there was a published protocol.<BR/>- Uncertain risk of bias: it was unclear whether all predefined and clinically relevant and reasonably expected outcomes were reported.<BR/>- High risk of bias: one or more clinically relevant and reasonably expected outcomes were not reported, and data on these outcomes were likely to have been recorded.</P>
<P>
<B>For-profit bias</B>
<BR/>- Low risk of bias: the trial appeared to be free of industry sponsorship or other kind of for-profit support that might have manipulated the trial design, the conduct, or results of the trial.<BR/>- Uncertain risk of bias: the trial might or might not have been free of for-profit bias as no information on clinical trial support or sponsorship was provided.<BR/>- High risk of bias: the trial was sponsored by the industry or had received other kind of for-profit support.<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>Other bias</B>
<BR/>- Low risk of bias: the trial appeared to be free of other components (for example, academic bias) that could put it at risk of bias.<BR/>- Uncertain risk of bias: the trial might or might not have been free of other components that could put it at risk of bias.<BR/>- High risk of bias: there were other factors in the trial that could put it at risk of bias (for example, authors have conducted trials on the same topic, etc).</P>
<P>Trials assessed as being at 'low risk of bias' in all of the specified domains were considered trials at 'low risk of bias'. Trials assessed as being at 'uncertain risk of bias' or at 'high risk of bias' in one or more of the specified domains were considered trials at 'high risk of bias'.</P>

<B>Participants</B>
<BR/>The number of participants in each trial ranged from 30 to 300. The age of the participants in the included trials varied from 18 years to 80 years (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). The proportion of women in the trials was about 50% (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>, <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). Only five trials reported the duration of follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Neoptolemos-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Neoptolemos 1987;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Hammarstrom-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Hammarstrom 1995;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Targarona-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Targarona 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sgourakis-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sgourakis 2002;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Noble-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Noble 2009</LINK>) (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>).</P>
<P>All trials detailed age distributions except <LINK REF="STD-Hong-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hong 2006</LINK>. Three trials did not describe the sex distribution (<LINK REF="STD-Stiegmann-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stiegmann 1992;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Kapoor-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kapoor 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hong-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hong 2006</LINK>).

<B>Interventions</B>
<BR/>In the open surgery comparison, four trials randomised participants at the time when common bile duct stones were diagnosed, which for the most part was during ERCP rather than on suspicion from blood tests or non-invasive imaging or both (that is, ultrasound sonography and more recently magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) (<LINK REF="STD-Neoptolemos-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Neoptolemos 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stain-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Stain 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hammarstrom-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Hammarstrom 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kapoor-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kapoor 1996</LINK>)). This selection may give the ERCP group an advantage. In the laparoscopic surgery comparison, <LINK REF="STD-Rhodes-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Rhodes 1998</LINK> randomised participants to laparoscopic exploration of the common duct versus postoperative ERCP following the identification of common bile duct stones at intra-operative cholangiography. Participants in whom laparoscopic cholecystectomy or intra-operative cholangiography were not technically feasible were excluded. <LINK REF="STD-Nathanson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nathanson 2005</LINK> randomised participants only after failed transcystic clearance, ie, only more technically challenging participants, to either laparoscopic choledochotomy or postoperative ERCP; diagnosed during therapeutic manoeuvres at the operating table.</P>

Because the data are non-parametric, they cannot be subjected to meta-analysis. In one of these trials (<LINK REF="STD-Stain-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Stain 1991</LINK>), there was a median operating time of 214 (range 115 to 420) minutes in the surgery versus 151 (range 80 to 310) minutes in the endoscopy group. It is, however, not apparent whether this refers to the combined time of endoscopy and surgery, or of surgery alone. In the other trial the data were reported as mean  standard deviation (SD), with the assumption that these were normally distributed. The duration in the surgery group was 142  72 minutes versus 114  78 minutes in the endoscopy group, with no significance detected on parametric testing.</P>

However, since these data are also non-parametric, they cannot be subjected to meta-analysis.

In one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Stain-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Stain 1991</LINK>) there was no indication whether or not a statistical analysis had been performed, with median (range) hospital stays of 5 (2 to 19) days for endoscopy and 6 (4 to 22) days for surgery. In the remaining trial (<LINK REF="STD-Neoptolemos-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Neoptolemos 1987</LINK>), there was a significant benefit favouring endoscopy with median (range) hospital stays of 16 (9 to 59) days for endoscopy and 21 (10 to 52) days for surgery (P = 0.0065). In the former trial (<LINK REF="STD-Stain-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Stain 1991</LINK>), the authors measured hospital stay from the day of first procedure, whereas in the latter it was measured from admission. Even allowing for this, there is clearly marked heterogeneity between the trials in this outcome variable (<LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-09-02 23:12:22 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Overall, based on 16 randomised clinical trials, we still seem to lack sufficient evidence to recommend or refute one approach compared with another, regarding treatment of bile duct stones. This is due to the facts that all included trials have a high risk of bias and random errors.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Open surgery versus endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)</HEADING>
<P>Open surgery resulted in a significantly reduced number of retained stones, and lower rates of failure of planned treatment. There was no significant difference in the mortality and morbidity between the two groups. However, it is important to remember that these comparative trials are from the early days of endoscopy (1987 to 1998) and might have been influenced by the early experience of the endoscopist as well as the limited technological support.</P>
<P>Duration of surgery and the duration of hospital stay were difficult to assess from the trials included. Evaluation of these two outcomes requires inclusion of the duration of each procedure (endoscopic clearance and surgical removal of gallbladder). There were insufficient data to comment on the effect of the size and number of stones on the outcomes, costs involved, postoperative quality of life and postoperative analgesic requirements.</P>
<P>The studies are, however, a little dated and interpretation in the context of modern practice must be guarded. It is entirely possible that the results might have been influenced by the early experience of endoscopists in performing ERCP. It is unlikely that there will be any future trials comparing open surgery with ERCP, and the data from this review represent the best evidence comparing these two interventions.</P>
<P>One relevant scenario for the surgeon may be in the planning or performance of an open cholecystectomy (performed in preference to, or converted from, a laparoscopic cholecystectomy for whatever technical reason, eg, multiple previous laparotomies/adhesions) in a person with unexpected or CBD stones that are considered surgically removable. Open surgery and CBDE is one of the treatment options for these specific groups of patients, where an open cholecystectomy is considered as the follow-up gallbladder surgery and not a laparoscopic surgery.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) + LCBDE versus ERCP + LC or versus ERCP and LC or versus LC + ERCP</HEADING>
<P>Several randomised clinical trials comparing the laparoscopy and endoscopic options were published since this review was first published (<LINK REF="STD-Hong-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hong 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Noble-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Noble 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bansal-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bansal 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rogers-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rogers 2010</LINK>). Pre-operative ERCP to deal with the CBD stones followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a popular option as the surgeon is assured a clear duct with no distal obstruction, reducing the risk of postoperative bile leak and the need for further postoperative procedures. However, studies performing intra-operative cholangiogram demonstrated the presence of silent ductal stones in 5% to 10% that have eventually passed without significant clinical symptoms, questioning the need for ERCP in these people. Some authors therefore advocated postoperative ERCP for those people who had ductal stones at intra-operative cholangiogram. Besides, about 2% to 15% of people who underwent pre-operative ERCP and sphincterotomy had residual ductal stones at intra-operative cholangiogram. This provides an argument to deal with the ductal stones by pre-operative, intra-operative or postoperative ERCP. Laparoscopic common bile duct exploration (LCBDE) offers the advantage of dealing with bile duct stones and gallbladder together, by a minimally invasive surgical procedure, during a single episode of hospitalisation as well as anaesthesia, and without the need for ERCP and endoscopic sphincterotomy.</P>
<P>There was no significant difference in the mortality and overall morbidity rates between LCBDE and the pre-, intra- and postoperative ERCP groups. It was not possible to assess the procedure-specific morbidity such as post-ERCP (+ endoscopic sphincterotomy) pancreatitis, cholangitis and bleeding; post-LCBDE bile leak and intra-abdominal abscesses, due to lack of a standard reporting pattern for these complications (for example, there was an overlap between post-interventional hyperamylasaemia/pancreatitis; no grading of severity of abscess or bile leak that required no or conservative or surgical treatment).</P>
<P>There was no significant difference in the retained stones between the LCBDE and the pre-operative and intra-operative ERCP groups. However, fewer retained stones were encountered in the postoperative ERCP group. These results could have been influenced by the fact that <LINK REF="STD-Nathanson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nathanson 2005</LINK> and colleagues opted to randomise the participants at failed transcystic clearance to ERCP clearance or choledochotomy, adding to the heterogeneity of the included trials.</P>
<P>There was no significant difference in the conversion rates of LCBDE to open surgery when compared with pre-operative, intra-operative, and postoperative ERCP groups.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Single-stage (LC + LCBDE) versus two-stage management (pre-operative ERCP + LC or LC + postoperative ERCP)</HEADING>
<P>We compared the single-stage laparoscopic surgical procedures with two -stage endoscopic procedures. However, we did not include the open surgical trials in the single-stage group for the obvious reasons that the open and laparoscopic surgeries were two different techniques and their results could not be pooled. Also, open trials were from the early endoscopy era. There was no significant difference in the proportion of participants with morbidity, mortality or conversion to open surgery between the two groups. There were less number of patients with retained stones and failed procedures in the single-stage group but this difference was not significant on the random-effect meta-analysis.</P>
<P>It was not possible to assess some important outcomes in this review. <LINK REF="STD-Rogers-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rogers 2010</LINK> is the only trial that compared the quality of life (SF-36) and the Karnofsky performance score between the endoscopy and surgical groups, finding no significant difference between the arms. None of the other trials reported patient satisfaction or quality of life. Postoperative pain scores were reported only by <LINK REF="STD-Bansal-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bansal 2010</LINK> using visual analogue scales and there was no significant difference between the LC + LCBDE versus the pre-operative ERCP + LC groups. With participants in both the arms subjected to laparoscopic or open cholecystectomy, the pain scores might simply be a surrogate outcome, but it would be interesting to know the influence of an additional procedure, ERCP, on patient satisfaction scores in future trials.</P>
<P>Data about the duration of hospital stay were not included in the meta-analysis as the data were either not described (<LINK REF="STD-Bornman-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Bornman 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Targarona-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Targarona 1996</LINK>), presented as parametric data (<LINK REF="STD-Stiegmann-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stiegmann 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nathanson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nathanson 2005</LINK>), as a mixture of parametric and non-parametric data (<LINK REF="STD-Cuschieri-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Cuschieri 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kapoor-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kapoor 1996</LINK>), or were presented in non-parametric data format, that is, median and range (<LINK REF="STD-Neoptolemos-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Neoptolemos 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stain-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Stain 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hammarstrom-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Hammarstrom 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rhodes-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Rhodes 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Suc-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Suc 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sgourakis-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sgourakis 2002</LINK>). Four trials measured treatment cost (<LINK REF="STD-Stiegmann-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stiegmann 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kapoor-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kapoor 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hong-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hong 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rogers-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rogers 2010</LINK>) but it was not possible to tease out the procedure-specific costs. Outcomes such as postoperative pain scores, length of hospital stay, cost of the procedure, quality of life and patient satisfaction need to be assessed and reported in a more standard fashion and must be included in future randomised clinical trials.</P>
<P>The number of stones and the size of stones were not included in the updated review. Successful extraction of the duct stones could be influenced by the technical expertise and preference of the endoscopists (or laparoscopic surgeon performing LCBDE) and the gadgets available in their unit. Moreover, none of the trials have reported their outcomes based on the stone size and number criteria. The influence of the technique of laparoscopic bile duct clearance - transcystic or transcholedochal approach, impact of the biliary drainage procedure (placement of a T-tube or an antegrade biliary stent) on the outcomes of the LCBDE patients was not planned to be assessed in this review.</P>
<P>Overall in this review the primary and the secondary outcomes that were evaluated on an intention-to-treat basis have shown no significant difference between the surgical and endoscopic modalities of the management of bile duct stones - but, as stated, data were too sparse.</P>

<P>This review includes a total of 1758 participants from 16 randomised trials with the primary outcomes addressed in all the papers (except for the data on retained stones in <LINK REF="STD-Bornman-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Bornman 1992</LINK>). The risk of bias in the included trials was high and the quality of the evidence was moderate. One of the major sources of heterogeneity among the trials was the lack of uniform criteria among the trials to confirm the presence of ductal stones at the time of randomisation. Participants who were suspected of having CBD stones, confirmed to have CBD stones by pre-operative imaging and those with randomisation at intra-operative cholangiogram were all included in the review. The expertise of the endoscopists and the laparoscopic surgeons in the initial trials might have affected their outcomes. These issues should be addressed in future trials.</P>
<P>We included the <LINK REF="STD-Sgourakis-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sgourakis 2002</LINK> trial as a randomised clinical trial with high risk of bias as one of the five trials assessing LC + LCBDE versus preoperative ERCP + LC. This decision was taken in spite of the fact that we have suspicion that it may not be a randomised clinical trial as we cannot exclude irregularities. On the other hand, it did not contribute very much to our analyses and most findings were neutral. Accordingly, excluding this trial would not lead to noticeable changes in our findings. </P>

<P>We have followed the Cochrane Collaboration methodology for performing the review.<B> </B>Most of the included studies were assessed to be at high risk of bias in one of the six domains (blinding), and at unclear risk of bias in another domain (allocation concealment) (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). The high risk of bias was mainly attributable to the lack of blinding in all the trials as well as unclear allocation concealment. Blinding of the assessor might be feasible (in future trials), if the postoperative outcomes were to be evaluated by an independent assessor and not by the surgeon or endoscopist.</P>

<P>The current updated review is in agreement with the conclusions of the previously published version (<LINK REF="REF-Martin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin 2006</LINK>) that open surgery seems superior to ERCP in the management of bile duct stones. There is no significant difference in the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic bile duct clearance and the endoscopic options. There is no significant reduction in the number of retained stones and failure rates in the laparoscopy arm compared to that of the pre-operative or intra-operative endoscopy arms, although this was not the case for the postoperative ERCP group. </P>

<P>Open bile duct surgery seems superior to open cholecystectomy plus endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in its ability to achieve bile duct stone clearance. It is important to remember that these comparative trials are from the initial days of endoscopy (1987 to 1998) and the success rates of endoscopic procedures might have improved over the past decade. However, the evidence would suggest that when a surgeon is required to perform an open cholecystectomy in a person with common bile duct (CBD) stones, then surgical duct clearance is a worthy option.</P>
<P>There seems to be no significant differences in the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic bile duct exploration versus the endoscopic options. There was no significant difference in the proportion of participants with retained stones between the laparoscopic and the endoscopic arms (with the exception of the postoperative ERCP group). Similarly, there was no significant difference in the measured outcomes between the single-stage laparoscopic bile duct clearance and the two-stage endoscopic management.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-09-02 23:03:30 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>While it appears that LCBDE is safe and effective, larger good quality randomised clinical trials have a role to validate the findings of this review and also to explore the benefit of assessing evolving practices in the surgical community that may occur not only with increasing experience with laparoscopic techniques, but also with improvements in both endoscopic and laparoscopic technology.</P>
<P>In terms of future trials and trial designs, the following suggestions can be made to investigators:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Based on the available evidence, there is a definite place for open CBD exploration in people who are not suitable for laparoscopic surgery. New multicentre randomised clinical trials (to recruit enough participants) comparing the open CBDE and endoscopy might be able to update the current evidence.</LI>
<LI>The trial design should reflect realistic clinical situations. Randomisation should occur on suspicion of CBD stones and not at ERCP, since this latter situation exposes the surgery-only group to the complications of ERCP without the potential benefits.</LI>
<LI>Further trials comparing the LCBDE and endoscopic procedures are needed to address and evaluate the outcomes that were discussed in the review, in addition to the other clinically relevant outcomes such as: procedure-specific complications, additional procedures required to deal with the complications, hospital stay, total treatment cost and health economics, and, importantly, quality of life and patient satisfaction.</LI>
<LI>Follow-up was generally poorly reported in the trials included in this review. It is particularly relevant for the accurate analysis of morbidity and long-term outcomes. Long-term outcomes might be helpful in making the clinical decision about the management of young patients with CBD stones.</LI>
<LI>With the current advances in laparoscopic surgical technology and expertise, options of laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) + intra-operative ultrasound scan with or without LCBDE, transcystic or transcholedochal exploration of the CBD, and the role of biliary stents need evaluated in future trials.</LI>
<LI>Future trial ought to be planned according to the SPIRIT Statement (<LINK REF="REF-SPIRIT-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">SPIRIT 2013</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>A plea must be made to remind all researchers to present data in appropriate formats, to employ appropriate statistical tests, and report the appropriate features of trial methodology. This is best summarised in the CONSORT statement (<LINK REF="REF-Begg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begg 1996</LINK>) and its associated online electronic checklist that serves not only as a guide for trial publication but for pre-trial preparation. We would also like to emphasise the publication of results in a manner allowing for interpretation of individual patient outcomes, thus allowing the inclusion of a wide range of data in meta-analysis. Appropriate reporting of methodology will allow for the rapid assessment of trial quality. Journal editors are increasingly demanding that trial reporting adheres to the formats described in the CONSORT Statement (<A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org">www.consort-statement.org</A>).</LI>

<P>The following outcomes were redefined in the updated review:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Retained stones: Inability to clear the ductal stones with planned technique (endoscopy or surgery) by the end of that procedure.</LI>
<LI>Failure to complete the planned procedure: Inability to perform the planned procedure and clear the duct by the end of the intervention (endoscopic or surgery). This can be due to technical reasons such as failed cannulation or difficult Calot's dissection, or due to impacted stone.There is a subtle but significant difference between these two comparisons. Retained stones indicate failure to clear the duct due to technical difficulty in getting the stone out,<B> </B>while failure to complete the planned procedure involves difficulty in getting to the stone. Inability to get the stone removed from the duct either due to less expertise or lack of gadgets (inability to get the guidewire into the CBD at ERCP or dissect the Calots is different from inability to remove the stone - in the former, one has not explored the CBD).</LI>
<LI>Conversion to open surgery: Participants requiring conversion of laparoscopic surgery to open surgery.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The following outcomes were not included in the review:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Numbers and size of stones cleared by the procedures is not included in the update. This is because the trials have assessed the outcomes (failure rates, complication rates) that could have been influenced by the size of the stones. However, none of the trials have reported the outcomes based on the stone configuration. We therefore have not included the stone configuration in the review.</LI>
<LI>Number of procedures per participant was not analysed in the update of the review. The number of procedures appears to have been influenced by the number of additional procedures required for duct clearance. We have therefore included rates of retained stones and additional procedures required for duct clearance.</LI>

<B>Trial sequential analysis of mortality (open surgery versus endoscopic retrograde cholangio pancreatography)</B>
<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was calculated to 24,498 patients, based on the proportion of patients in the control group with the outcome of 2.79%, a relative risk reduction of 20%, an alpha of 5%, a beta of 20%, and a diversity of 0%. To account for zero event groups, a continuity correction of 0.01 was used in the calculation of the cumulative Z-curve (blue line). After accruing a total of 729 participants in eight trials, only 2.98% of the DARIS has been reached. Accordingly, the trial sequential analysis does not show the required information size and the trial sequential monitoring boundaries. As shown, the conventional statistical boundaries (dotted red line) have also not been crossed by the cumulative Z-curve.</P>

<B>Trial sequential analysis of morbidity (open surgery versus endoscopic retrograde cholangio pancreatography (ERCP))</B>
<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was calculated to 3,145 patients, based on the proportion of patients in the control group with the outcome of 18.72%, a relative risk reduction of 20%, an alpha of 5%, a beta of 20%, and a diversity of 0%. After accruing a total of 729 participants in eight trials, only 23.18% of the DARIS has been reached. So, the futility area was not drawn. The cumulative Z-curve (blue line) does not cross the trial sequential monitoring boundaries (red line) or the conventional boundaries (etched red line). This is consistent with absence of current evidence of any significant difference between open surgery and ERCP but significantly increased or decreased morbidity of open surgery compared to ERCP cannot be ruled out.</P>

<B>Trial sequential analysis of retained stones (open surgery versus endoscopic retrograde cholangio pancreatography (ERCP))</B>
<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was calculated to 3,803 patients, based on the proportion of patients in the control group with the outcome of 15.88%, a relative risk reduction of 20%, an alpha of 5%, a beta of 20%, and a diversity of 0%. After accruing a total of 609 participants in seven trials, only 16.01% of the DARIS has been reached. So, the futility area was not drawn. The cumulative Z-curve (blue line) does not cross the trial sequential monitoring boundaries (red line) but crosses the conventional boundaries (etched red line). This suggests that although there is a statistically significant reduction in the proportion of people with retained stones in the open surgery group compared to the ERCP group, there is a high risk of random error and one cannot firmly conclude that open surgery has significantly lower retained stones proportion compared to the ERCP group.</P>

<P>
<B>Trial sequential analysis of mortality (laparoscopic common bile duct exploration versus pre-operative endoscopic retrograde cholangio pancreatography after laparoscopic cholecystectomy)</B>
<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was calculated to 71,546 patients, based on the proportion of patients in the control group with the outcome of 1.02%, a relative risk reduction of 20%, an alpha of 5%, a beta of 20%, and a diversity of 0%. To account for zero event groups, a continuity correction of 0.01 was used in the calculation of the cumulative Z-curve (blue line). After accruing a total of 580 participants in five trials, only 0.81% of the DARIS has been reached. Accordingly, the trial sequential analysis does not show the required information size and the trial sequential monitoring boundaries. As shown, the conventional statistical boundaries (etched red line) have also not been crossed by the cumulative Z-curve.</P>

<B>Trial sequential analysis of morbidity (laparoscopic common bile duct exploration (LCBDE) versus pre-operative endoscopic retrograde cholangio pancreatography (ERCP) after laparoscopic cholecystectomy)</B>
<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was calculated to 4,990 patients, based on the proportion of patients in the control group with the outcome of 12.54%, a relative risk reduction of 20%, an alpha of 5%, a beta of 20%, and a diversity of 0%. After accruing a total of 580 participants in five trials, only 11.62% of the DARIS has been reached. So, the futility area was not drawn. The cumulative Z-curve (blue line) does not cross the trial sequential monitoring boundaries (red line) or the conventional boundaries (etched red line). This is consistent with absence of current evidence of any significant difference between LCBDE and ERCP but significantly increased or decreased morbidity of LCBDE compared to ERCP cannot be ruled out.</P>

<B>Trial sequential analysis of retained stones (laparoscopic common bile duct exploration versus pre-operative endoscopic retrograde cholangio pancreatography after laparoscopic cholecystectomy)</B>
<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was calculated to 6,098 patients, based on the proportion of patients in the control group with the outcome of 10.51%, a relative risk reduction of 20%, an alpha of 5%, a beta of 20%, and a diversity of 0%. To account for zero event groups, a continuity correction of 0.01 was used in the calculation of the cumulative Z-curve (blue line). After accruing a total of 580 participants in five trials, only 9.51% of the DARIS has been reached. So, the futility area was not drawn. The cumulative Z-curve does not cross the trial sequential monitoring boundaries (red line) or the conventional boundaries (etched red line). This is consistent with absence of current evidence of any significant difference between LCBDE and ERCP but significantly increased or decreased proportion of people with retained stones of LCBDE compared to ERCP cannot be ruled out.</P>

<B>Trial sequential analysis of mortality (laparoscopic common bile duct exploration versus post-operative endoscopic retrograde cholangio pancreatography after laparoscopic cholecystectomy)</B>
<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was calculated to 71,546 patients, based on the proportion of patients in the control group with the outcome of 1.02%, a relative risk reduction of 20%, an alpha of 5%, a beta of 20%, and a diversity of 0%. To account for zero event groups, a continuity correction of 0.01 was used in the calculation of the cumulative Z-curve (blue line). After accruing a total of 166 participants in two trials, only 0.24% of the DARIS has been reached. Accordingly, the trial sequential analysis does not show the required information size and the trial sequential monitoring boundaries. As shown, the conventional statistical boundaries (etched red line) have also not been crossed by the cumulative Z-curve.</P>

<B>Trial sequential analysis of morbidity (laparoscopic common bile duct exploration versus post-operative endoscopic retrograde cholangio pancreatography after laparoscopic cholecystectomy)</B>
<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was calculated to 4,381 patients, based on the proportion of patients in the control group with the outcome of 14.12%, a relative risk reduction of 20%, an alpha of 5%, a beta of 20%, and a diversity of 0%. After accruing a total of 166 participants in two trials, only 3.79% of the DARIS has been reached. Accordingly, the trial sequential analysis does not show the required information size and the trial sequential monitoring boundaries. As shown, the conventional statistical boundaries (etched red line) have also not been crossed by the cumulative Z-curve (blue line).</P>

<B>Trial sequential analysis of retained stones (laparoscopic common bile duct exploration (LCBDE) versus post-operative endoscopic retrograde cholangio pancreatography (ERCP) after laparoscopic cholecystectomy)</B>
<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was calculated to 7,661 patients, based on the proportion of patients in the control group with the outcome of 24.71%, a relative risk reduction of 20%, an alpha of 5%, a beta of 20%, and a diversity of 0%. After accruing a total of 166 participants in two trials, only 2.17% of the DARIS has been reached. Accordingly, the trial sequential analysis does not show the required information size and the trial sequential monitoring boundaries. The cumulative Z-curve (blue line) crosses the conventional boundaries (etched red line). This suggests that although there is statistically significant reduction in the proportion of people with retained stones in the LCBDE group compared to the post-operative ERCP group, there is a high risk of random error and one cannot firmly conclude that LCBDE has significantly lower retained stones proportion compared to the post-operative ERCP group. The random-effects model also did not reveal significant difference between the groups.</P>

<P>
<B>Trial sequential analysis of mortality (single-stage versus two-stage procedures)</B>
<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was calculated to 86,456 patients, based on the proportion of patients in the control group with the outcome of 0.79%, a relative risk reduction of 20%, an alpha of 5%, a beta of 20%, and a diversity of 0%. To account for zero event groups, a continuity correction of 0.01 was used in the calculation of the cumulative Z-curve (blue line). After accruing a total of 746 participants in seven trials, only 0.86% of the DARIS has been reached. Accordingly, the trial sequential analysis does not show the required information size and the trial sequential monitoring boundaries. As shown, the conventional boundaries have also not been crossed by the cumulative Z-curve.</P>

<P>
<B>Trial sequential analysis of morbidity (single-stage versus two-stage procedures)</B>
<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was calculated to 4,837 patients, based on the proportion of patients in the control group with the outcome of 12.89%, a relative risk reduction of 20%, an alpha of 5%, a beta of 20%, and a diversity of 0%. After accruing a total of 746 participants in seven trials, only 15.42% of the DARIS has been reached. So, the futility area was not drawn. The cumulative Z-curve (blue line) does not cross the trial sequential monitoring boundaries (red line) or the conventional boundaries (etched red line). This is consistent with absence of current evidence of any significant difference between single-stage and two-stage procedures but significantly increased or decreased morbidity of single-stage compared to two-stage procedures cannot be ruled out.</P>

<B>Trial sequential analysis of retained stones (single-stage versus two-stage procedures)</B>
<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was calculated to 9,003 patients, based on the proportion of patients in the control group with the outcome of 13.68%, a relative risk reduction of 20%, an alpha of 5%, a beta of 20%, and a diversity of 49.85%. To account for zero event groups, a continuity correction of 0.01 was used in the calculation of the cumulative Z-curve (blue line). After accruing a total of 746 participants in seven trials, only 8.29% of the DARIS has been reached. So, the futility area was not drawn. The cumulative Z-curve does not cross the trial sequential monitoring boundaries (red line) but crosses the conventional boundaries (etched red line). This suggests that although there is statistically significant reduction in the proportion of people with retained stones in the single-stage group compared to the two-stage group, there is a high risk of random error and one cannot firmly conclude that single-stage group has significantly lower retained stones proportion compared to the two-stage group.</P>
