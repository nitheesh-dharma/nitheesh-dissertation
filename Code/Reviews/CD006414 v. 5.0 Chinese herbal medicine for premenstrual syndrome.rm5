<P>The authors identified two trials that evaluated herbal medicines in PMS. One of these was a higher quality study that tested the traditional Chinese medicine decoction Jingqianping granule. This was shown to increase the rate of recovery from PMS symptoms.

<P>Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a common cyclic disorder for young and middle-aged women that consistently occurs during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. It is characterised by emotional and physical symptoms and can manifest with a wide variety of symptoms, including depression, mood lability, abdominal pain, breast tenderness, headache, and fatigue (<LINK REF="REF-Dickerson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickerson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tempel-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tempel 2001</LINK>). The symptoms of PMS may be sufficiently severe to disrupt women's normal functioning, quality of life, and interpersonal relationships. More severe, mainly psychological symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and other affective symptoms which recur in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle are classified as premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) (<LINK REF="REF-Dickerson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickerson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sundstrom-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sundstrom 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>As many as 75% of women with regular menstrual cycles experience some symptoms of PMS, PMDD affects only 3% to 8% of women in this group (<LINK REF="REF-Steiner-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steiner 2000</LINK>). In addition, PMS is more prevalent among white women, smokers, obese, and younger women (<LINK REF="REF-Masho-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Masho 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV) (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2005</LINK>) requires at least five specified symptoms in order to diagnose premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD); while the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2005</LINK>) requires only one distressing symptom for a diagnosis of PMS. A diagnosis of PMS requires determining the timing of the symptoms in relation to menses, meaningful change between post- and premenstrual symptom severity, and clinically significant severity of the symptoms. The current diagnostic standard requires confirmation of subjective symptom reports by prospective daily diaries. Diagnostic criteria for PMS must recognise the broad range of symptoms, the temporal pattern of the symptoms, and the critical issue of symptom severity, which differentiates clinically significant PMS from normal menstrual cycle changes (<LINK REF="REF-Freeman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freeman 2003</LINK>). The best tool to diagnose PMS is a daily symptoms rating calendar. To have the diagnosis of PMS, the symptoms must be severe enough to disrupt normal daily activities (<LINK REF="REF-Tempel-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tempel 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>The pathogenesis of PMS remains uncertain; research suggests that altered regulation of neurohormones and neurotransmitters is involved (<LINK REF="REF-Dickerson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickerson 2003</LINK>). Several biological mechanisms that underlie menstrually related symptoms have been proposed. They focus mostly on gonadal hormones, their metabolites, and interactions with neurotransmitters and neurohormonal systems such as serotonin, GABA, cholecystokinin, and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Altered responses of these systems to ovarian hormone fluctuations during the menstrual cycle, as well as increased sensitivity to changes in ovarian hormones, may contribute to menstrually related symptoms in vulnerable women. Core underlying mechanisms may be disrupted homeostasis and deficient adaptation (<LINK REF="REF-Halbreich-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halbreich 2003</LINK>). Current research focusing on the biological background of premenstrual syndrome suggests that both psychological and physiological factors exert their effect through dysregulation of serotonergic function. The results of several studies point to a variation in the function of the serotonergic system throughout the menstrual cycle. Ovarian steroids have been found to profoundly influence the activity of the serotonergic system (<LINK REF="REF-Eriksson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eriksson 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gonda-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gonda 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Joffe-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joffe 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rubinow-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubinow 1998</LINK>). Additionally, reduced serotonin uptake by platelets and reduced whole blood serotonin levels during the luteal phase have been demonstrated in women with PMS (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rapkin-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rapkin 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steege-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steege 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Hypomagnesaemia (low magnesium levels in the blood) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of PMS (<LINK REF="REF-Ventskivs_x0027_ka-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ventskivs'ka 2005</LINK>). Moreover, high intake of fats and low intake of foods with high concentration of carbohydrate may be associated with premenstrual symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Nagata-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nagata 2004</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-12-07 14:41:53 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Many different treatments have been suggested as possible therapies for PMS. This is due to the uncertainty of its pathogenesis, the wide range of its manifestations, and a large placebo effect. As serotonin has been implicated in the pathogenesis of PMS, the therapeutic effectiveness of continuous and luteal phase dosing of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) has been evaluated (<LINK REF="REF-Dimmock-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dimmock 2000</LINK>). SSRIs have emerged as first-line therapy for PMS (<LINK REF="REF-Steiner-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steiner 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Ovarian function appears to play a fundamental role in PMS, accordingly treatment strategies designed to suppress ovulation have generally been found to be effective for treatment of menstrually related syndromes and symptoms. Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogues (GnRHa) appear to provide an effective treatment of premenstrual syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Backstrom-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Backstrom 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kouri-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kouri 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wyatt-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wyatt 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>In other studies, women with PMS who practised aerobic exercise reported fewer symptoms than participants in the control group (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steege-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steege 1993</LINK>). Dietary restrictions or supplements may also be useful in women with PMS (<LINK REF="REF-Kessel-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kessel 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moline-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moline 2000</LINK>). Sodium restriction has been proposed to minimise bloating, fluid retention, breast swelling and tenderness. Caffeine restriction is recommended because caffeine intake is related to premenstrual irritability and insomnia. A systematic review of placebo-controlled trials of evening primrose oil suggested lack of any benefit in PMS, although mild relief was demonstrated in women with breast tenderness (<LINK REF="REF-Budeiri-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Budeiri 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>A randomised placebo-controlled study reported there were significant improvements in the symptoms of negative feeling, pain, water retention, and total PMS symptoms in women receiving qigong therapy when compared to placebo controls (<LINK REF="REF-Jang-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jang 2004</LINK>). Qigong consists primarily of meditation, relaxation, physical movement, mind-body integration, and breathing exercises. Practitioners of qigong develop an awareness of qi sensations (energy) in their body and use their mind to guide the qi. When the practitioners achieve a sufficient skill level (master), they can direct or emit external qi for the purpose of healing others.</P>
<P>Some studies also indicate that acupuncture, homeopathy, aromatherapy, reflexology, Gingko biloba, kava kava, black cohosh, and agnus castus can relieve symptoms of PMS such as anxiety, depression, and irritability (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tesch-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tesch 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yu-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yu 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Other treatments for PMS, for which there is inconclusive evidence, include photic stimulation, cognitive behavioural therapy, relaxation therapy, vitamin B6, L-tryptophan, stress reduction, spironolactone, and a complex carbohydrate drink. Although evidence for relief of PMS symptoms is inconclusive, it is reasonable to recommend these as healthy lifestyle changes which may have overall benefits (<LINK REF="REF-Douglas-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Douglas 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Girman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Girman 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rapkin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rapkin 2003</LINK>).</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2008-12-07 14:43:54 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Herbal medicines have long been used in traditional healing systems to treat conditions of particular interest to women, such as premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and menopausal symptoms. For a select number of phytomedicines, including evening primrose oil, black cohosh root extract, dong quai, and chaste tree berry, scientific investigation has identified the pharmacologically active constituents, mechanism of action, and clinical value. Based on the available evidence, chaste tree berry may be a reasonable treatment alternative for some women with PMS. Dong quai (in standard pinyin it is called dang gui) may be used to treat PMS when combined with traditional Chinese multiple-herb formulations (<LINK REF="REF-Hardy-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hardy 2000</LINK>). The current literature supports the use of chaste berry for cyclical breast discomfort and premenstrual syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Roemheld_x002d_Hamm-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roemheld-Hamm 2005</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-12-07 14:48:10 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been used for thousands of years to treat PMS. The rule of TCM for PMS is 'Bian Zheng Lun Zhi': adding or reducing some herbs in a traditional preparation, so-called 'demonstrated preparation', depending on the TCM 'Zheng' signs recognised by a TCM physician. At least eight types of 'Zheng' are recognised by TCM physicians, and various formulations can be used to treat the same type of 'Zheng'. Some new preparations for various 'Zheng xing' (TCM signs) have been developed, for example, 'gan yu qi ci' type PMS can be treated by using adjusted 'cai hu su gan san' (<LINK REF="REF-Lang-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lang 1996</LINK>), 'pi shen yang xu' type PMS by adjusted 'fang ji huang qi tang' combined with 'you gui wan' (<LINK REF="REF-Zhu-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhu 1995</LINK>). These formulations or preparations have been described as effective remedies and it has been suggested they could have clinical applications.</P>
<P>There is increasing public interest in, and use of, herbal medicine therapies which lie outside the 'mainstream' or traditional Western medical practice across the globe (<LINK REF="REF-HLSC-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">HLSC 2000</LINK>). There is evidence to indicate that not all herbs are risk-free. There are concerns about adverse events, particularly allergic reactions, as well as Chinese herbal nephropathy (CHN) affecting the kidneys (<LINK REF="REF-Lampert-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lampert 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lord-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lord 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nortier-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nortier 2000</LINK>). Hence, there is a need to systematically review herbal medicines for their effectiveness and safety.</P>

<P>The following characteristics were assessed.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Randomisation process: assessment for selection bias</HEADING>
<P>A - adequate sequence generation was reported using one of the following approaches: random number tables or computer-generated random numbers, coin tossing or shuffling for generating the allocation sequence before the launch of the trial; trials considered eligible and with a low risk of selection bias.</P>
<P>B - one of the adequate methods outlined in (A) was not specified and only mentioned 'random'; considered to have a moderate risk of selection bias.</P>
<P>C - other methods of allocation, for example quasi-randomisation, that appeared to have a high risk of bias; trials were excluded.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Allocation concealment process: assessment of selection bias</HEADING>
<P>A - adequate measures to conceal allocation: where the person who generated an allocation sequence did not attend to recruitment of the participants, and the allocation sequence was sealed in opaque envelopes or held in a locked computer, or another description that contained convincing elements of concealment; considered to have a low risk of selection bias.</P>
<P>B - unclear: concealed trials in which the author did not report an approach to allocation concealment at all; considered as having a moderate risk of selection bias.</P>
<P>C - inadequately-concealed allocation that reported an approach that did not fall into one of the categories in (A).</P>
<P>D - did not conceal allocation.</P>
<P>C and D were considered as having a high risk of selection bias. </P>

<P>Both included studies were RCTs that used random number tables.This was clearly stated in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2003</LINK> while it was only confirmed following contact with the authors for the <LINK REF="STD-Qiao-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Qiao 2002</LINK> study.</P>

<P>Following contact with the study authors, concealment was considered adequate in one of the included trials (<LINK REF="STD-Qiao-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Qiao 2002</LINK>) as the random number allocation sequence was generated by a statistician not involved in participant recruitment.</P>

<P>
<B>1. Change in premenstrual syndrome symptoms </B>
</P>
<P>(1) Rate of recovery (defined as disappearance of symptoms during the trial)</P>
<P>The two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Qiao-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Qiao 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2003</LINK>) reported recovery rates and showed statistically significant differences in elimination of symptoms between the intervention and control groups.</P>
<P>The rate of recovery in the group using Jingqianping granule was 27.7% (56/202) while it was 8% (8/101) in the Xiaoyaowan group (RR 3.50, 95% CI 1.74 to 7.06). This indicated that Jingqiaping granule was more effective than Xiaoyaowan in eliminating PMS symptoms (<LINK REF="STD-Qiao-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Qiao 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Participants who took the Cipher decoction had a recovery rate of 30% (50/166) while there were no reported recoveries in the vitamin B6 capsule group (0/80) (RR 48.99, 95% CI 3.06 to 783.99). This suggested that Cipher decoction was more effective than vitamin B6 in eliminating PMS symptoms (<LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>(2) Rate of no improvement (defined as symptom severity that remained unchanged during the trial)</P>
<P>Both studies also reported the rate of 'no improvement' and showed statistically significant differences between the intervention and control groups. Eight participants reported no improvement (4%, 8/202) in the Jingqianping granule group compared to 18 in the Xiaoyaowan group (18%, 18/101) (<LINK REF="STD-Qiao-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Qiao 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two participants reported no improvement in TCM signs (1.2%, 2/166) in the Cipher Fang decoction group compared to 31 in the vitamin B6 group (38.8%, 31/80) (<LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2003</LINK>).</P>

</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2003</LINK>) reported on the changes in prolactin, estradiol, and progestin concentrations, before and after treatment. However, only a very small number of participants contributed to the data (14/166 in the experiment group and 10/80 in the control group). We therefore did not include these results in the analysis of this review.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-12-09 00:18:16 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Only two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Qiao-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Qiao 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2003</LINK>) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Qiao-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Qiao 2002</LINK>) was considered to be of higher methodological quality than the other with regard to study design and trial processing because a double-dummy technique was used. Due to the potential selection, detection, and attrition biases in the <LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2003</LINK>, the study was considered to be of a lower methodological quality. However, the formula of the experimental drug (Jingqianping granule) was prepared by the authors themselves and the drug was made by the authors' university. Similarly, the experimental drug used in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Qiao-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Qiao 2002</LINK> was also prepared by authors themselves. Therefore, independent validation of the findings of these trials is advisable.</P>
<P>None of the included trials used a placebo control and active controls were used instead. PMS is a condition with a substantial placebo response rate, hence it is scientifically important to include a placebo group in trials evaluating the therapeutic effectiveness of new medications. Moreover, it has been suggested that, by making comparisons with external placebo, the need for placebo control groups in new studies on patients could be minimised assuming that the novel medication will perform in the same way in a study with only active controls as it would have in a placebo-controlled trial. However, evidence from 32 RCTs involving  7264 participants showed that the degree of improvement was nearly double in active-controlled trials than with the same drugs and dosages in placebo-controlled studies <LINK REF="REF-Woods-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woods 2005</LINK>. Therefore, the high RRs identified in this review could be secondary to the lack of use of placebo controls.</P>
<P>None of the trials provided sufficient information about allocation concealment. After contacting the authors, it was judged that <LINK REF="STD-Qiao-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Qiao 2002</LINK> used adequate methodology to ensure concealment at the time of randomisation. In addition, none of the studies reported on their justification for the required sample size. Although the included trials seem to have recruited a large sample size (<LINK REF="STD-Qiao-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Qiao 2002</LINK> included 303 participants, 202:101; and <LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2003</LINK> included 166:80) it is important to have formal sample size calculations to ensure that the trial is of sufficient power to identify a difference, if one exists.</P>
<P>Surprisingly, several trials claimed to be RCTs but, after contacting the trial authors to enquire about the method of randomisation used, we found that most of the authors misunderstood the concept of randomisation or had forgotten the details of the methodology they employed; they had conducted the studies several years ago. Therefore, most of the studies of Chinese herbal medicine in the management of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) were inadequate to provide reliable therapeutic effect estimates because of poor study design and methodological quality.</P>
<P>Finally, although the diagnostic standard was mentioned in two studies a detailed description of the standard was not provided. In the absence of this key parameter we were unable to judge the validity of the studies and how the diagnosis of PMS was made for the study participants.</P>

<P>Further randomised clinical trials are required of traditional Chinese herbal medicine for the treatment of premenstrual syndrome. Independent validation of the therapeutic effectiveness of Jingqianping granule is advisable. It is crucial that investigators give considerable attention to the methods of randomisation, blinding, determining sample sizes, and the use of placebo-controlled trials. The information on trial methodology should also be reported in detail, according to both CONSORT (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>) and CONSORT for TCM (<LINK REF="REF-Wu-2007-CONSORT" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2007 CONSORT</LINK>).</P>
