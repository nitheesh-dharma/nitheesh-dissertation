<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-06-26 15:29:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne-Marie Stephani">
<P>Dengue is a disease caused by a virus transmitted by mosquitoes, occurring in many resource-limited countries, and children are often most severely affected. Most infected patients will recover with mild symptoms, but a few progress to severe dengue and may die. There is no specific treatment for dengue, but some clinicians provide corticosteroids at an early stage to prevent progression to severe dengue disease; and some treat patients with dengue-related shock with corticosteroids to improve survival. It is important to summarise the effects of corticosteroids in dengue.</P>
<P>We conducted a search up to 6 January 2014 and included eight studies which enrolled 948 participants in total. Four studies of corticosteroids in the treatment of dengue-related shock assessed if corticosteroids could improve survival, but these studies were small and older than 20 years. The evidence we found is of very low quality and do not provide any reliable evidence for corticosteroids for treating dengue-related shock. Four trials evaluated whether corticosteroids provided at an early stage of dengue could prevent development of complications of severe dengue. These trials were more recent, but data were insufficient to be sure whether corticosteroids have an effect on the course of the disease.</P>

<I>Paitents with dengue-related shock </I>
</P>
<P>Four studies enrolled children younger than 15 years with dengue-related shock at hospitals in Southeast Asia and evaluated intravenous corticosteroids. The trials did not detect an effect on death (four trials, 284 participants, <I>very low quality evidence)</I>, the need for blood transfusion (two trials, 89 participants, <I>very low quality evidence</I>), pulmonary haemorrhage (one trial, 63 participants, <I>very low quality evidence</I>), convulsions (one trial, 63 participants, <I>very low quality evidence</I>), or duration of hospitalization (one trial, 63 participants, <I>very low quality evidence</I>). The body of evidence is too small to confidently prove or exclude clinically important effects. Furthermore, the trials are more than 20 years old with several methodological limitations.</P>
<P>
<I>Patients with dengue at an early stage</I>
</P>
<P>Four studies enrolled 664 children and adults with dengue at an early stage of infection (without shock) in Columbia, India, Sri Lanka and Vietnam.

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-06-03 06:35:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Fan Zhang">
<P>Dengue is a viral infection that causes fever, malaise (general feeling of discomfort and illness) and is occasionally fatal. There are in total four different strains of the dengue virus. The bite of the female infected <I>Aedes</I> mosquito, most commonly <I>Aedes aegypti</I>, transmits the virus to humans (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simmons-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simmons 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Onset of the illness is sudden after an incubation period of three to 14 days (average four to seven days). In the early phases of the illness people have non-specific flu-like symptoms, nausea and vomiting, and half of them have a rash. The course of dengue is usually mild and people recover. However, sometimes complications occur in the critical phase when fever resolves on the third to seventh day of illness, usually on the fifth day (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simmons-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simmons 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Before 2009, the WHO classified dengue fever (DF) and four stages of dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) according to clinical manifestations as shock or bleeding. Grade I and II were termed non-shock DHF while grade III and IV were defined as dengue shock syndrome (DSS) (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1997</LINK>). This classification did not reliably identify severely sick patients, therefore the WHO introduced a new classification in 2009. This new classification differentiates between dengue, an uncomplicated disease with full recovery; and severe dengue. In severe dengue, an effect of the infection on the capillaries causes complications: the permeability of the capillaries increases and fluid leaks from the vessels into the tissue, causing a fall in blood pressure and shock. The WHO defines severe disease as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>plasma leakage leading to shock or breathing difficulties, or both;</LI>
<LI>severe bleeding;</LI>
<LI>severe organ impairment (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2009</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>Signs of dengue-related shock are a narrow pulse pressure of 20 mmHg or less, and poor skin perfusion (<LINK REF="REF-Simmons-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simmons 2012</LINK>). Blood tests show increasing concentration of the blood and low levels of platelets and protein. The mechanisms leading to plasma leakage and the role of the immune system in the development of shock are unclear. Researchers suggest that the immune response can result in increased permeability of the capillaries. No animal models exist (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simmons-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simmons 2012</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Epidemiology</HEADING>
<P>Dengue is the most common vector born viral infection in humans and the most rapidly spreading viral disease globally, and an important public health problem in low- and middle-income countries in the tropics where most of the dengue infection happens The dispersal of the efficient mosquito vectors across much of the tropical and subtropical latitudes is crucial for the cause of public health problems. The primary vector has been widely distributed across these tropics (<LINK REF="REF-Simmons-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simmons 2012</LINK>). And the dengue epidemics are closely related to the seasonal climatic change and there are epidemics waves following each rainy season (<LINK REF="REF-Rajapakse-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rajapakse 2012</LINK>). </P>
<P>Over 40% of the world's population (about 2.5 billion) live in dengue-endemic areas, and about 50 to 100 million people are infected with the dengue virus every year. Cases across the Americas, Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific exceeded 2.3 million in 2010. Its incidence has "multiplied many times over the last five decades at an alarming rate"(<LINK REF="REF-Rajapakse-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rajapakse 2012</LINK>). An estimated 500,000 people with severe dengue, of which a large proportion are children, require hospitalization every year. About 2.5% of these patients die of the disease (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2009</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2012a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2012a</LINK>).</P>
<P>The Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific regions carry more than 75% (about 1.8 billion population) of the disease burden. These two regions plus the Americas are the three most seriously affected regions. Many tropical diseases are more common in rural areas, but dengue infections are acquired mostly in urban and semi-urban areas, which puts tourists at higher risk and is an important reason for its increasing endemicity (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>All age groups are affected, but infants and young children are at greater risk of dengue-related shock which is proved by epidemiological studies. The potential mechanism may explain this. Further risk factors include female sex, high body-mass index (BMI), infection with certain virus strains, or individual genetic susceptibility (<LINK REF="REF-Greenfacts-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenfacts 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simmons-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simmons 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2012b</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Diagnosis</HEADING>
<P>Clinicians diagnose severe dengue (including dengue-related shock) on clinical grounds. Laboratory tests confirm the clinical diagnosis. Blood tests support diagnosis and guide management (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2009</LINK>). Current diagnostic methods include the detection of virus (or virus isolation), viral nucleic acid and viral antigen, and the detection of dengue-specific antibodies in the blood.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Management</HEADING>
<P>Currently there is no evidence-base for a specific drug for dengue. Medical interventions remain supportive instead of curative. Patients receive fluid transfusions when hospitalized. Platelets are given when platelet counts drop too low. Severe anaemia in dengue is treated with blood transfusions. For dengue-related shock , the WHO provides detailed recommendations for intravenous fluid resuscitation (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simmons-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simmons 2012</LINK>). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen should be avoided as they can worsen bleeding tendency.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-06-03 06:19:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Fan Zhang">
<P>Corticosteroids are potent anti-inflammatory agents with multiple effects on the immune system and a wide range of applications. In the twentieth century, some researchers conducted studies on the effect of intravenous corticosteroids on dengue-related shock. More recently, researchers began to investigate whether intravenous or oral corticosteroids were effective in preventing disease progression from dengue at an early stage of infection to severe dengue (<LINK REF="STD-Kularatne-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kularatne 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shashidhara-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Shashidhara 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tam-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Tam 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Villar-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Villar 2009</LINK>). Currently, the WHO does not recommend the use of corticosteroids either in severe dengue or in dengue at an early stage of infection (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2009</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-06-03 06:34:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Fan Zhang">
<P>The mechanism in dengue resulting in plasma leakage is still unclear. Complications such as dengue-related shock are occasionally reported during primary infection (the first time a person is infected by a dengue virus), but are strongly associated with secondary infection (the second time a person is infected, possibly by a different serotype of the dengue virus). This indicates an involvement of the immune system, and the mechanism is mediated and enhanced by antibodies against the dengue virus (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2009</LINK>). Clinicians give corticosteroids when they think the host immune response contributes to the disease process. In some areas, corticosteroids have been used for the treatment of dengue-related shock or at an early stage of dengue infection. Observational studies have suggested corticosteroids may benefit people with dengue-related shock (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kularatne-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kularatne 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tam-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Tam 2012</LINK> ).</P>
<P>Clinicians have employed the anti-inflammatory effect of corticosteroids for the treatment of shock caused by sepsis. Patients with sepsis have elevated blood levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines for weeks after clinical resolution of infection, during which shock may become manifest. Studies that have used lower doses of hydrocortisone (&#8804; 300 mg per day or equivalent) for longer durations have reported earlier reversal of shock and improved survival (<LINK REF="REF-Sprung-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sprung 2008</LINK>). A recent systematic review demonstrated that corticosteroids had no clear benefit on mortality in severe sepsis and septic shock (<LINK REF="REF-Annane-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Annane 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>However, recent trials have investigated corticosteroids for treating dengue at an early stage because researchers assumed that corticosteroids might be effective in preventing complications when given early in the course of infection (<LINK REF="STD-Tam-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Tam 2012</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-06-03 06:36:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Fan Zhang">
<P>Dengue poses a relevant global public health problem in resource-poor settings. It is important to evaluate effective treatment options to establish the best possible therapy, and to identify ineffective treatment options which consume limited resources and might do harm.</P>
<P>With the revision of the WHO classification in 2009, the case definition of severe dengue has become broader(<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2009</LINK>). Therefore, all cases classified as Dengue shock syndrome according to the previous, stricter WHO definition (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1997</LINK>) will also meet the criteria for severe dengue of the WHO definition of 2009.</P>

<P>Two authors independently extracted data using a pre-specified, pre-piloted data extraction form. For each outcome we extracted, where available, the number of participants randomized, the number of participants analyzed in each treatment group, the main methods, as well as detail about the interventions and outcomes. For dichotomous outcomes, we recorded the number of participants experiencing the event and the number assessed in each intervention group. For continuous outcomes, we extracted arithmetic means and standard deviations for each intervention group, together with the numbers assessed in each group. Two authors independently extracted and cross-checked data to minimize errors. We contacted the trial authors for clarification or missing data where necessary.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2014-06-03 06:32:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Fan Zhang">
<P>For this review update, we applied the latest Cochrane Collaboration methods for assessing risk of bias in included studies (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). FZ and VK independently assessed the risk of bias for each trial. We followed the guidance to assess whether adequate steps had been taken to reduce the risk of bias across six domains: sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding (of participants, personnel, and outcome assessors); incomplete outcome data; selective reporting; and other sources of bias. We categorized the risk of bias as 'high', 'low', or 'unclear' as per the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Where our judgment was unclear, we attempted to contact the trial authors for clarification. We resolved any disagreements by discussion with PG or DS. We presented this information in a risk of bias summary table and used it for our interpretation of results. We used the GRADE approach to assist our assessment of the quality of evidence and to prepare of 'Summary of findings' tables. </P>

<P>We found the quality of evidence to be very low for all outcomes of this comparison. The four trials were conducted more than 25 years ago from 1960s to 1980s. They preceded newer guidance for transparent reporting on sequence generation and allocation concealment, and have methodological limitations. For our risk of bias assessment, please see <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>. These trials were conducted in hospital settings with low loss to follow-up, and no evidence of selective outcome reporting. The trials were also underpowered and thus too small to reliably detect an effect in the outcomes that they measured.

<P>The quality of evidence for this comparison of the review was low for the outcome death, and very low for dengue-related shock, ICU admission, severe bleeding, severe thrombocytopaenia and ascites. The four trials have lower risk of bias and were conducted more recently between 2004 and 2011. One out of four trials reported high loss to follow-up. Nevertheless, they are seriously underpowered (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>) and cannot be easily generalized to various settings.

However, these reviews did not address the effects of corticosteroids in dengue at an early stage infection.</P>
<P>A study nested in the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Tam-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Tam 2012</LINK> explored the effects of low-dose corticosteroids, high-dose corticosteroids and placebo on the immune response of patients with dengue at an early stage (<LINK REF="STD-Nguyen-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Nguyen 2013</LINK>). The study reported a limited effect of corticosteroids on patients' cytokine levels and immune modulation. This is consistent with results of the clinical trial (<LINK REF="STD-Tam-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Tam 2012</LINK>) which detected no significant clinical benefits after corticosteroids. The authors concluded that "early prednisolone therapy has little impact on the host immune response", even if the dose might be "too little or too late".</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-06-10 10:34:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne-Marie Stephani">
<P>At present, recommended treatment for severe dengue is restricted to supportive therapy. More research is needed to evaluate if drug therapies such as corticosteroids are effective and safe and should be recommended or not.</P>
<P>For corticosteroid use in people with dengue-related shock, it would require a trial of probably more than 1672 people to identify an effect on death (sufficient sample size, <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). Whether this is a priority for care depends on balancing other potentially important interventions are worth testing for managing severe dengue infection.</P>
<P>For people with symptomatic dengue early in the illness, large, rigorously conducted randomized controlled trials that measure death or other severe dengue-related complications as an outcome would be needed to justify the use of corticosteroids, but these would need to be even larger, with an estimate sample size of over 8000 people (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>).</P>

<SUP>1</SUP> Downgraded by 1 for serious risk of bias: Three out of four studies were at unclear risk of selection bias, as sequence generation and allocation concealment were not reported in sufficient detail. Blinding was adequate in two out of four studies. The only study that was at low risk of bias did not find an effect.<BR/>
<SUP>2</SUP> No serious inconsistency: Statistical heterogeneity was low. Three out of four studies found no evidence of a benefit with corticosteroids. Only the oldest study which was at unclear risk of bias suggested a benefit.<BR/>
<SUP>3</SUP> No serious indirectness: All trials were performed in children aged below 15 years in hospitals in Southeast Asia, and the data may not be easily generalizable to other populations or settings. All diagnoses were confirmed by a laboratory test, and an intravenous corticosteroid was used in all studies. Not downgraded.<BR/>
<SUP>4</SUP> Downgraded by 2 for very serious imprecision: The 95% CI is wide and includes a clinically important effect and no effect. The trials are too small to detect an effect. To confidently detect a 25% relative reduction in mortality would require a sample size of more than 1700 participants.<BR/>
<SUP>5</SUP> Downgraded by 1 for serious risk of bias: Sequence generation, allocation concealment and blinding was only reported adequately in one of the two studies. This study at low risk of bias did not find an effect.<BR/>
<SUP>6</SUP> No serious inconsistency. No statistical heterogeneity.<BR/>
<SUP>7</SUP> No serious indirectness: Both trials were conducted in children in referral hospitals in Thailand. They used viral and serologic diagnostic tests and a similar total dose of intravenous corticosteroids. The data may not be easily generalizable to other populations or settings. Not downgraded.<BR/>
<SUP>8</SUP> Downgraded by 2 for very serious imprecision: The 95% CI of RR was wide and the trials too small to detect an effect. To confidently detect a 25% relative reduction in need for transfusion would require a sample size of more than 1400 participants.<BR/>
<SUP>9</SUP> No serious risk of bias: The one trial in this comparison reported adequate sequence generation, blinding and allocation concealment.<BR/>
<SUP>10</SUP> Downgraded by 1 for serious indirectness: Only a single small study evaluated this outcome. Further studies in different patient groups are needed to have confidence in the results.<BR/>
<SUP>11</SUP> Downgraded by 2 for very serious imprecision: The 95% CI of the RR was wide and the trials too small to detect an effect. To confidently detect a 25% relative reduction would require a sample size of more than 10,000 participants.<BR/>

<SUP>3</SUP> Downgraded by 2 for very serious imprecision: No deaths were reported in either the intervention or placebo/no intervention group.<BR/>
<SUP>4</SUP> Downgraded by 1 for serious risk of bias: One study reported adequately on sequence generation, allocation concealment and blinding of participants, clinicians and outcome assessors. Another study was an open-label trial, and did not describe allocation concealment.<BR/>
<SUP>5</SUP> Downgraded by 1 for serious indirectness: These studies were conducted in different settings in India and Vietnam, which may not be easily generalizable to a variety of settings.<BR/>
<SUP>6</SUP> Downgraded by 2 for very serious imprecision: One trial reported that results for this outcome did not show a statistically significant difference and might be underpowered to detect an effect. Another trial reported no case of shock in either the treatment or control groups. The 95% CI of the RR was wide and the trials too small to detect an effect. To confidently detect a 25% relative reduction would require a sample size of more than 8000 participants.</P>

<SUP>9 </SUP>Downgrade by 1 for serious indirectness: The two trials that reported on this outcome were conducted in Sri Lanka and Vietnam. The studies used different diagnostic criteria for dengue and for the diagnosis of haemorrhage and gave different doses of Prednisolone.</P>
<P>

One of the two studies, conducted in Sri Lanka, did not report any events. The 95% CI of the RR was wide and the trials too small to detect an effect.

<SUP>1 </SUP>The sample size was calculated for binary outcomes for superiority trials. We estimated that a 25% reduction of risk to develop a complication in the intervention group when compared to the control group would be clinically important. The "assumed risk" is the risk in the control group. All calculations are based on: 2-sided tests, with a ratio of 1:1, power of 0.8, and confidence level of 0.95.<BR/>
<SUP>2 </SUP>All calculations were performed using the software available at http://www.sealedenvelope.com/power/binary-superiority/.</P>
