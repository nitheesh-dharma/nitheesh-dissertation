<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-07-10 10:59:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Valeria Marinho">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>The main question addressed by this review is how effective the use of fluoride varnish for the prevention of caries in children and adolescents is compared to placebo (a treatment without the active ingredient i.e. fluoride) or no treatment.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Tooth decay (dental caries) is a significant health problem worldwide. It affects not only the vast majority of adults but also children, from 60% to 90% of them. In other words, six to nine children in every 10 are affected by tooth decay. Levels of tooth decay vary both between and within different countries, but it is generally true that children in lower socio-economic groups (measured by income, education and employment) have greater levels of tooth decay. Untreated tooth decay causes progressive destruction of the tops of teeth (crowns) and this is often accompanied by severe pain and suffering. Repairing and replacing decayed teeth is extremely costly in terms of time and money and is a major drain on the resources of healthcare systems.</P>
<P>The prevention of dental caries in children and adolescents is regarded as a priority for dental services and considered more cost-effective than its treatment. Fluoride is a mineral that prevents tooth decay. Fluoride is added to the water supply in many areas. It can also be applied directly to teeth in the form of fluoride varnish. This is applied to first (baby) and permanent teeth (depending on the age of the child) usually by a dental professional from two to four times a year. Because it stays on the surface of the tooth for relatively long periods of time it releases fluoride in an efficient and effective way.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>This review of existing studies was carried out by the Cochrane Oral Health Group and the evidence is current up to 13 May 2013.<BR/>In this updated review there are now 22 trials published between 1975 and 2012 in which a total of 12,455 children were randomised to treatment with either fluoride varnish or placebo/no treatment. Study duration ranged from one to five years among included trials (12 of these lasted two years).</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence produced has been found to be of moderate quality due to issues with trial designs. However in the 13 trials that looked at children and adolescents with permanent teeth the review found that the young people treated with fluoride varnish experienced on average a 43% reduction in decayed, missing and filled tooth surfaces. In the 10 trials looking at the effect of fluoride varnish on first or baby teeth the evidence suggests a 37% reduction in decayed, missing and filled tooth surfaces. There was little information concerning possible adverse effects or acceptability of treatment.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence presented is of moderate quality due to issues with trial designs.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-07-10 14:27:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Topically-applied fluoride varnishes have been used extensively as an operator-applied caries-preventive intervention for over three decades. This review updates the first Cochrane review of fluoride varnishes for preventing dental caries in children and adolescents, which was first published in 2002.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2013-07-10 14:30:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Valeria Marinho">
<P>To determine the effectiveness and safety of fluoride varnishes in preventing dental caries in children and adolescents, and to examine factors potentially modifying their effect.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-07-10 14:31:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 13 May 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2013, Issue 4), MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 13 May 2013), EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 13 May 2013), CINAHL via EBSCO (1980 to 13 May 2013), LILACS and BBO via the BIREME Virtual Health Library (1980 to 13 May 2013), ProQuest Dissertations and Theses (1861 to 13 May 2013), and Web of Science Conference Proceedings (1945 to 13 May 2013). A search for ongoing trials was undertaken on <A HREF="http://clinicaltrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</A> on 13 May 2013. There were no restrictions on language or date of publication in the search of the electronic databases.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-07-10 14:31:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials with blind outcome assessment used or indicated, comparing topically-applied fluoride varnish with placebo or no treatment in children up to 16 years during at least one year. The main outcome was caries increment measured by the change in decayed, missing and filled tooth surfaces in both permanent (D(M)FS) and primary (d(e/m)fs) teeth.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-07-10 14:53:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>At least two review authors assessed all search results, extracted data and undertook risk of bias independently. Study authors were contacted for additional information. The primary measure of effect was the prevented fraction, that is the difference in mean caries increments between the treatment and control groups expressed as a percentage of the mean increment in the control group. The caries increments nearest to three years were used from each included study. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed where data could be pooled. Potential sources of heterogeneity were examined in random-effects meta-regression analyses. Adverse effects information was collected from the included trials.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-07-10 14:54:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Valeria Marinho">
<P>Twenty-two trials with 12,455 participants randomised (9595 used in analyses) were included. For the 13 that contributed data for the permanent tooth surfaces meta-analysis, the pooled D(M)FS prevented fraction estimate comparing fluoride varnish with placebo or no treatment was 43% (95% confidence interval (CI) 30% to 57%; P &lt; 0.0001). There was substantial heterogeneity, confirmed statistically (P &lt; 0.0001; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 75%), however this body of evidence was assessed as of moderate quality. The pooled d(e/m)fs prevented fraction estimate was 37% (95% CI 24% to 51%; P &lt; 0.0001) for the 10 trials that contributed data for the primary tooth surfaces meta-analysis, also with some heterogeneity (P = 0.009; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 59%). Once again this body of evidence was assessed as of moderate quality. No significant association between estimates of D(M)FS or d(e/m)fs prevented fractions and the pre-specified factors of baseline caries severity, background exposure to fluorides, application features such as prior prophylaxis, concentration of fluoride, frequency of application were found. There was also no significant association between estimates of D(M)FS or d(e/m)fs prevented fractions and the post hoc factors: whether a placebo or no treatment control was used, length of follow-up, or whether individual or cluster randomisation was used, in the meta-regression models. A funnel plot of the trials in the main meta-analyses indicated no clear relationship between prevented fraction and study precision. In both methods, power is limited when few trials are included. There was little information concerning possible adverse effects or acceptability of treatment.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-07-03 10:49:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The conclusions of this updated review remain the same as those when it was first published. The review suggests a substantial caries-inhibiting effect of fluoride varnish in both permanent and primary teeth, however the quality of the evidence was assessed as moderate, as it included mainly high risk of bias studies, with considerable heterogeneity.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-02-18 15:20:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Valeria Marinho">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-07-10 10:10:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Valeria Marinho">
<P>Dental caries is a highly prevalent chronic disease afflicting a significant proportion of the world population, including around 60% to 90% of school-aged children and the vast majority of adults (<LINK REF="REF-Petersen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petersen 2004</LINK>). In general, dental caries levels vary considerably between and within different countries, but children in the lower socio-economic status (SES) groups have higher caries levels than those in the upper SES groups (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reisine-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reisine 2001</LINK>). Untreated caries causes progressive destruction of the crowns of the teeth, often accompanied by severe pain and suffering. The repair and replacement of carious teeth is excessively time consuming and costly, representing a major drain of resources for healthcare systems.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-07-10 12:34:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Valeria Marinho">
<P>Professionally-applied fluoride varnishes, developed in the 1960s as a preventive intervention for dental caries, have been extensively used in Europe, Scandinavia and Canada and their use in other countries seems to be increasing, including the United States, where they can be used off-label as caries preventive agents (<LINK REF="REF-Bawden-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bawden 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Beltr_x00e1_n_x002d_Aguilar-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beltrán-Aguilar 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kallestal-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kallestal 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1994</LINK>). The use of fluoride varnishes is considered appropriate for at risk tooth surfaces in caries susceptible individuals and for moderate and high caries prevalence child populations in community-based preventive programmes (<LINK REF="REF-Petersson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petersson 1997</LINK>). Varnishes were originally developed to prolong the contact time between fluoride and dental enamel, as they adhere to the tooth surface for longer periods (12 hours or more) in a thin layer, and prevent the immediate loss of fluoride after application, thus acting as slow-releasing reservoirs of fluoride making acute toxicity unlikely (<LINK REF="REF-Ogaard-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ogaard 1994</LINK>). Although various different formulations of fluoride varnishes are available, there are two main preparations commercially known as Duraphat and Fluor Protector. Duraphat contains 5% sodium fluoride (NaF), or 22,600 parts per million fluoride ions (ppm F), in a natural resin carrier with some alcohol included as a solvent. Fluor Protector contains 0.9% difluorosilane by weight (1000 ppm F) in polyurethane-based varnish and sets to a thin transparent film (originally developed in 1975 by Arends and Schuthof with a fluoride concentration of 0.7%, the fluoride concentration was changed to 0.1% in 1987). Varnishes are usually applied with small brushes, syringes, or cotton pellets, with or without prior dental prophylaxis, at the frequency of two to four times a year. They are considered safe, despite the high fluoride concentration (in Duraphat for example), because the amount of varnish usually applied to treat one child is only 0.5 ml on average (<LINK REF="REF-Petersson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petersson 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ripa-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ripa 1990</LINK>), which delivers 3 to 11 mg of fluoride ion per dose. This is far below the probable toxic dose of 5 mg/kg body weight (<LINK REF="REF-Whitford-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitford 1992</LINK>), even with the potential exposure (ingestion) varying from 3.5 to 11.3 mg of fluoride ion (<LINK REF="REF-Johnston-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnston 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Numerous clinical trials evaluating the caries preventive effect of fluoride varnishes in children in both permanent and primary teeth have been reported, and these have been the subject of several narrative reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Beltr_x00e1_n_x002d_Aguilar-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beltrán-Aguilar 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clark-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-De-Bruyn-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Bruyn 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Petersson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petersson 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Petersson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petersson 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Primosch-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Primosch 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seppa-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seppa 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yanover-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yanover 1982</LINK>) and of systematic reviews and meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Bader-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bader 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Carvalho-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carvalho 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Helfenstein-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Helfenstein 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Petersson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petersson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rozier-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rozier 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Strohmenger-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strohmenger 2001</LINK>). It is evident from these reviews and meta-analyses that fluoride varnishes are caries-inhibitory agents. However, they either failed to fully report the quantitative approaches used for data synthesis, or did not include a comprehensive search for individual trials or a formal evaluation of the risk of bias in included trials, despite obvious drawbacks in study design and methods in the trials. Some reviews included trials, mainly carried out in the 1970s, that had adopted the 'split-mouth' design for example (i.e. used half-mouth controls). There is a general agreement against the use of the within-subject paired design for fluoride varnish trials in the literature; a major drawback is that the possibility of significant contamination of control sites cannot be excluded, regardless of the adhesiveness of the material to the tooth surface in the first hours after application (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-De-Bruyn-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Bruyn 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Petersson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petersson 1993</LINK>).</P>

<P>The most important anti-caries effect of fluoride is considered to result from its local action on the tooth/plaque interface, through promotion of remineralisation of early caries lesions and by reducing tooth enamel solubility (<LINK REF="REF-Featherstone-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Featherstone 1988</LINK>). Enamel demineralisation is markedly inhibited if fluoride is present at the time of the acid challenge because fluoride diffuses with the acid from plaque into the enamel and acts at the crystal surface to reduce mineral loss. When the pH rises following demineralisation, fluoride can combine with dissolved calcium and phosphate ions to precipitate or grow fluorapatite-like crystalline material within the tooth. Fluoride enhances this mineral gain and provides a material which is more resistant to subsequent acid attack (<LINK REF="REF-ten-Cate-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">ten Cate 1999</LINK>). This occurs with all forms and concentrations of topical fluoride although to a variable extent. Regular use of fluoride toothpaste or mouthrinse results in sustained elevated fluoride concentrations in the oral fluids during the demineralisation/remineralisation cycle, but with higher concentration topical fluoride vehicles (such as varnishes and gels), calcium fluoride is precipitated on the enamel surface and in the plaque. This calcium fluoride acts as a fluoride reservoir which is released when the oral pH falls (<LINK REF="REF-Horowitz-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horowitz 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ogaard-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ogaard 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Thus, varnishes deliver fluoride to the surface of enamel and to subsurface carious lesions, where it forms deposits of calcium fluoride and provides a reservoir of fluoride ions (<LINK REF="REF-Ogaard-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ogaard 1994</LINK>). The greatest release occurs during the first three weeks after application, with more gradual release thereafter (<LINK REF="REF-Shen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shen 2002</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-02-18 15:20:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Valeria Marinho">
<P>The prevention of dental caries in children and adolescents is generally regarded as a priority for dental services and considered more cost-effective than its treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Burt-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burt 1998</LINK>). Fluoride therapy has been the centrepiece of caries-preventive strategies since the introduction of water fluoridation schemes over five decades ago (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1991</LINK>). These were introduced when caries was highly prevalent and severe, and when even modest prevention activities led to considerable reductions in disease levels. In the last 30 years, with the substantial decline in dental caries rates in many western countries, an increase in dental fluorosis levels in some countries, and intensive research on the mechanism of action of fluoride highlighting the primary importance of its topical effect, greater attention has been paid to the appropriate use of other fluoride-based interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Featherstone-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Featherstone 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Featherstone-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Featherstone 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glass-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glass 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marthaler-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marthaler 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Mullane-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Mullane 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ripa-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ripa 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>The use of topically-applied fluoride products in particular, which are much more concentrated than the fluoride in drinking water, has increased over recent decades. By definition, the term 'topically-applied fluoride' is used to describe those delivery systems which provide fluoride to exposed surfaces of the dentition, at elevated concentrations, for a local protective effect, and are therefore not intended for ingestion. Fluoride-containing toothpastes (dentifrices), mouthrinses, gels and varnishes are the modalities most commonly used at present, either alone or in combination. Various products are marketed in different countries and a variety of caries preventive programmes based on these have been implemented. Toothpastes are by far the most widespread form of fluoride usage (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-1991a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1991a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ripa-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ripa 1991</LINK>) and although the reasons for the decline in the prevalence of dental caries in children from different countries has been the subject of much debate (<LINK REF="REF-de-Liefde-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Liefde 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Krasse-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krasse 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marthaler-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marthaler 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marthaler-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marthaler 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nadanovsky-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nadanovsky 1995</LINK>), it has been mainly attributed to the gradual increase in, and regular home use of fluoride in toothpaste (<LINK REF="REF-Bratthall-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bratthall 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glass-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glass 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marthaler-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marthaler 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Mullane-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Mullane 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ripa-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ripa 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rolla-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rolla 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>At the same time, the lower caries prevalence now prevailing in many countries and the widespread availability of fluoride from multiple sources have raised the question of whether topically-applied fluorides are still effective in reducing caries, and safe, mainly in terms of the potential risk of fluorosis (mottled enamel). This is particularly important as nearly all child populations in high-income countries are exposed to some source of fluoride, notably in toothpaste, and adverse effects may be rare (such as acute fluoride toxicity) or more subtle (such as mild dental fluorosis) (<LINK REF="REF-Marthaler-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marthaler 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murray-1991a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1991a</LINK>).</P>
<P>The evidence on the effect of topically-applied fluoride products on the prevention of dental caries in children has been extensively reviewed in traditional narrative reviews. A number of reviews focusing on the evaluation of specific fluoride active agents within specific delivery systems have used a quantitative meta-analytical approach to synthesise trials results (<LINK REF="REF-Ammari-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ammari 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bartizek-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bartizek 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chaves-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chaves 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Helfenstein-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Helfenstein 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Petersson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petersson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stamm-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stamm 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stamm-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stamm 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steiner-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steiner 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Strohmenger-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strohmenger 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Twetman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Twetman 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Rijkom-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Rijkom 1998</LINK>). However, there has been no systematic investigation evaluating and comparing the effects of the main modalities of topically-applied fluoride and examining formally the main factors that may influence their effectiveness.</P>
<P>This review is one in a series of systematic reviews of topical fluoride interventions and assesses the effectiveness of fluoride varnishes for the prevention of dental caries in children. It is an update of the review first published in 2002, which suggested a substantial caries-inhibiting effect of fluoride varnish in both the permanent and primary teeth of children, but based largely on a small number of relatively old trials of variable methodological quality (<LINK REF="REF-Marinho-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marinho 2002</LINK>).</P>

<P>At least two review authors undertook the assessment of the risk of bias in all of the included trials independently. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or the involvement of another review author. This was carried out using The Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias as outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic</I> <I>Reviews of Interventions</I> version 5.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>), but according to pre-defined criteria which were adapted and refined for the Cochrane topical fluoride reviews updates. Eight domains, namely sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, baseline balance, and free from contamination or co-intervention, were assessed according to the tool. Each domain included one or more specific entries in a 'Risk of bias' table. Within each entry, information reported in the study was described and a judgement relating to the risk of bias for that entry was assigned. Where the study clearly reported the methodology, a judgement of 'low risk of bias' or ' high risk of bias' was made. Where trial methodology was unclear, a domain was judged at 'unclear risk of bias' unless and until further information became available. After taking into account the additional information provided by the authors of the trials, the overall risk of bias in included trials was assessed over all eight domains. Studies were graded into the following categories.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk of bias (plausible bias unlikely to seriously alter the results: all eight domains assessed as at low risk of bias).</LI>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2013-07-10 10:48:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Prevented fraction (PF) was the measure of treatment effect presented for caries increment. The prevented fraction is calculated as the mean increment in the control group minus the mean increment in the intervention group divided by the mean increment in the control group. For an outcome such as caries increment (where discrete counts are considered to approximate to a continuous scale and are treated as continuous outcome), this measure was considered more appropriate than the mean difference or standardised mean difference since it allowed combination of different ways of measuring caries increment and a meaningful investigation of heterogeneity between trials. It is also simple to interpret.</P>
<P>For outcomes other than caries increment, continuous data were to be analysed according to differences in mean treatment effects and their standard deviations. Dichotomous outcome data were analysed by calculating risk ratios (RRs).</P>

<P>We decided that missing standard deviations for caries increments that were not revealed by contacting the original researchers would be imputed through linear regression of log standard deviations on log mean caries increments. This is a suitable approach for caries prevention trials since, as they follow an approximate Poisson distribution, caries increments are closely related (similar) to their standard deviations (<LINK REF="REF-van-Rijkom-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Rijkom 1998</LINK>). This approach was undertaken wherever possible. Where caries increment data were not reported but baseline and final mean caries scores were reported instead, mean caries increments were calculated and standard deviation of the increments estimated using a correlation coefficient between the baseline and final values of 0.5.</P>

We hypothesised that: (1) the effect of fluoride varnishes differs according to the baseline levels of caries severity, (2) the effect of fluoride varnishes differs according to exposure to other fluoride sources (in water, in toothpastes, etc.) and (3) the effect of fluoride varnishes differs according to characteristics of use (fluoride concentration or application features, such as frequency of use and prophylaxis).</P>
<P>For this update it was also hypothesised that trials could be categorised according to whether the teeth which the intervention had been applied to were within two years of eruption. This is important as newly erupted teeth are thought to be at higher risk of caries. If sufficient number of trials were included, the association of these factors with estimated effects (PF) would be examined by performing random-effects meta-regression analyses in Stata version 12.0 (Stata Corporation, USA) using the program 'Metareg'.</P>
<P>To allow such investigation, relevant data were dealt with as follows: data on 'baseline levels of caries' were calculated from the study sample analysed (final sample) unless otherwise stated, and were averaged among all relevant study groups. Data on 'background exposure to other fluoride sources' combined data on the use of fluoride toothpaste and the consumption of fluoridated water (or salt) and were grouped into two categories: one for trials which were based on samples provided with non-fluoride toothpaste and which were from non-fluoridated areas (non-exposed), and another for trials based on samples using fluoride toothpaste or trials in fluoridated communities or both. When use or non-use of fluoride toothpaste was not clearly indicated in trials carried out in high-income countries, it was assumed that fluoride toothpaste was widely used from the middle of the 1970s (<LINK REF="REF-Ripa-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ripa 1989</LINK>); this information was sought from authors (or obtained from other sources) when missing from trials carried out in other locations. When data on the year a study had begun were not provided, these were calculated as a 'probable date' by subtracting the duration of the study (in years) plus one extra year, from the publication date of the study. </P>
<P>Further potential sources of heterogeneity were investigated by meta-regression - for different types of control groups (placebo (PL) or no treatment (NT)), different types of randomisation (individual child or cluster) and time since eruption (permanent teeth only), but these post hoc analyses were reported as such, and findings should be treated with caution. It should be remembered that all the meta-regressions have low power and the findings should not be interpreted as no effect.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Design and methods</HEADING>
<P>All the included trials used parallel group designs (the split-mouth trials were excluded), five being cluster randomised trials (<LINK REF="STD-Borutta-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Borutta 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bravo-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bravo 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hardman-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hardman 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lawrence-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lawrence 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Milsom-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Milsom 2011</LINK>). Six trials had more than one fluoride varnish treatment group compared to a placebo or no treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Borutta-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Borutta 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Borutta-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Borutta 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sk_x00f6_ld-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sköld 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weintraub-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Weintraub 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2008</LINK>). With regard to type of control group used, 14 trials used a no treatment control group, and the remaining eight used a placebo control group, however five of these used an inactive treatment other than varnish ('placebo' solution/distilled water). The study duration (indicated by the total length of follow-up as well as the treatment duration) ranged from one to five years among the included trials (12 of these lasted two years). Studies were of moderate size with seven trials allocating less than 100 children to relevant study groups. The total number of children participating in the 22 included trials (given by the sample analysed at the end of the trial period) was 9595, and ranged from 95 in the smallest trial to 2604 in the largest trial (although this was a cluster trial). Eleven trials conducted the trials in schools or nurseries, eight in clinics and the setting was unclear in the remaining three trials.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>The ages of the children at the start of the trials ranged from 1 to 15 years, with similar numbers from both sexes (where these data were reported); 14 trials included participants who were over six years of age at the start, and eight trials included children from one to five (in which primary teeth have been assessed for caries development). Decayed, (missing) and filled permanent surfaces (D(M)FS) at baseline, reported in 11 of the trials, ranged from 0 to 29.2, and from 0 (ds) to 12.4 (dmfs) in the eight trials that reported data for primary dentition. With regard to 'background exposure to other fluoride sources', only three trials were conducted in water fluoridated communities (<LINK REF="STD-Holm-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Holm 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sk_x00f6_ld-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sköld 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weintraub-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Weintraub 2006</LINK>) and only one (<LINK REF="STD-Borutta-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Borutta 1991</LINK>) clearly reported no exposure to fluoride toothpastes; 13 trials reported some other exposure to fluoride (rinses, tablets), with one study mentioning fluoridated milk (<LINK REF="STD-Hardman-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hardman 2007</LINK>). Seven studies reported that both groups received oral hygiene advice or instruction (<LINK REF="STD-Arruda-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Arruda 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chu-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chu 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gugwad-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Gugwad 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lawrence-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lawrence 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tagliaferro-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Tagliaferro 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weintraub-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Weintraub 2006</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>Teeth were usually painted with a fluoride varnish using a small brush (10 trials), in other trials the use of a probe or cotton swab was reported. The use of NaF-based varnishes (Duraphat, Lawefluor, Bifluorid 12, 3M&#8482; CavityShield&#8482;, Fluoridin, Difluorsilane (Fluor Protector) was reported in all trials. The fluoride concentration in 18 trials was 22,600 ppm F; the other trials ranged from 7000 ppm F (Difluorsilane) to 56,300 ppm F (6% NaF + 6% calcium fluoride (CaF) (<LINK REF="STD-Borutta-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Borutta 1991</LINK>)). Two trials had arms with fluoride varnish applied with less than 5% fluoride (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2008</LINK>). The application frequency of twice a year was tested in 17 trials and that of four times a year in only three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Borutta-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Borutta 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chu-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chu 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Modeer-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Modeer 1984</LINK>). One study applied the varnish three times in one week with no other applications (<LINK REF="STD-Gugwad-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Gugwad 2011</LINK>). The amount of varnish applied was usually of around 0.5 ml per child (reported in five trials). Where the actual application time was reported it ranged from 1 to 4 minutes. The performance of some form of tooth prophylaxis prior to administering the varnish was reported in seven trials (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Frostell-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Frostell 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gugwad-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Gugwad 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holm-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Holm 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Koch-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Koch 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Modeer-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Modeer 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sk_x00f6_ld-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sköld 2005</LINK>), with four trials with no paste and three with a non-fluoride paste (if with a fluoride paste the trial would have been excluded). The prior tooth cleaning was considered by the review authors as a possible part of the technique of varnish application and not as a separate intervention on its own.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>All 22 included trials reported caries increment data at the tooth surface level with D(M)FS reported in 13 trials, 11 trials reporting d(e/m)fs, two trials reporting both D(M)FS and d(e/m)fs (<LINK REF="STD-Gugwad-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Gugwad 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hardman-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hardman 2007</LINK>). Five of the 11 trials reported caries increment data at the tooth level (D(M)FT) and only three trials reported caries increment data for primary teeth at the tooth level (dmft). With regard to the components of the DMFS index used (and types of teeth/surface assessed), 13 trials reported DMFS data (five trials for first molars only and six trials for all tooth surface types) and the other two reported DFS data (one trial for posterior approximal surfaces only and another for first molar fissures only), one also reported DS and FS data separately. (No choice had to be made between DMFS or DFS data in any one trial, but DFS data were chosen over DS/FS data in one of the trials.) All trials reported D(M)FS data on specific teeth or tooth surfaces - first molars, occlusal, mesio-distal (approximal) and/or buco-lingual - but three of these did not report data on all tooth surfaces (whole mouth). D(M)FS data were reported at more than one follow-up time in two trials only; follow-up of two years was the most common among all trials.</P>
<P>Details of all the caries outcomes reported for each trial are given in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table. The caries outcomes used in the meta-analyses are described. Twenty studies included a visual examination, three with the International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS) (<LINK REF="STD-Arruda-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Arruda 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salazar-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Salazar 2008</LINK>), three with fibre-optic transillumination (FOTI) (<LINK REF="STD-Borutta-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Borutta 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chu-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chu 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hardman-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hardman 2007</LINK>), and variable use of a probe was reported including tactile criteria. X-rays were used in addition to visual examination in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Frostell-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Frostell 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gugwad-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Gugwad 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Koch-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Koch 1975</LINK>). Two trials diagnosed approximal caries in permanent molars only from X-rays (<LINK REF="STD-Modeer-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Modeer 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sk_x00f6_ld-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sköld 2005</LINK>). Data at the dentine cavitation level of diagnosis were used in the analysis for 16 trials and that for non-cavitated plus cavitated in six trials (<LINK REF="STD-Arruda-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Arruda 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gugwad-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Gugwad 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lawrence-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lawrence 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sk_x00f6_ld-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sköld 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tewari-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Tewari 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2008</LINK>;). In seven of the 16 trials with dentine level data, the increment of non-cavitated lesions were also reported (<LINK REF="STD-Frostell-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Frostell 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hardman-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hardman 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holm-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Holm 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Koch-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Koch 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Modeer-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Modeer 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salazar-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Salazar 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tagliaferro-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Tagliaferro 2011</LINK>).

<P>Eight of the included trials (<LINK REF="STD-Gugwad-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Gugwad 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lawrence-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lawrence 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Milsom-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Milsom 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Modeer-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Modeer 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salazar-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Salazar 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tewari-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Tewari 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weintraub-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Weintraub 2006</LINK>) were assessed at low risk of bias for this domain. Six of these used computer generated randomisation sequences, one used the lottery method (<LINK REF="STD-Gugwad-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Gugwad 2011</LINK>), and one used random number tables (<LINK REF="STD-Modeer-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Modeer 1984</LINK>). The study by <LINK REF="STD-Hardman-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hardman 2007</LINK> was cluster randomised using a computer generated sequence but recruitment into the study was done after randomisation of the clusters and the high rate of pre-recruitment drop-outs (56%) may have led to selection bias so this study was assessed as at unclear risk of bias for this domain. Six trials (<LINK REF="STD-Arruda-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Arruda 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bravo-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bravo 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chu-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chu 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Frostell-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Frostell 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holm-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Holm 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tagliaferro-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Tagliaferro 2011</LINK>) used quasi-random allocation and were assessed at high risk of selection bias. The remaining seven trials provided insufficient information in the study report to enable a judgement to be made and so these were assessed at unclear risk of bias for this domain.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Allocation concealment</HEADING>
<P>Allocation was concealed from the investigators in six trials which were assessed at low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Gugwad-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Gugwad 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hardman-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hardman 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lawrence-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lawrence 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Milsom-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Milsom 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salazar-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Salazar 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weintraub-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Weintraub 2006</LINK>). Six trials reported insufficient information about allocation concealment but the poor randomisation methods used would have made adequate allocation concealment impossible in these trials (<LINK REF="STD-Arruda-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Arruda 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bravo-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bravo 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chu-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chu 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Frostell-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Frostell 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holm-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Holm 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tagliaferro-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Tagliaferro 2011</LINK>) and they were assessed at high risk of bias. In 10 of the included trials there was insufficient information, either in the study report or in response to our emails to study authors, to make a judgement about whether allocation concealment took place so these trials were assessed at unclear risk of bias.</P>
<P>In summary five trials were at low risk of selection bias (<LINK REF="STD-Gugwad-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Gugwad 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lawrence-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lawrence 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Milsom-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Milsom 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salazar-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Salazar 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weintraub-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Weintraub 2006</LINK>), six trials were at high risk of selection bias (<LINK REF="STD-Arruda-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Arruda 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bravo-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bravo 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chu-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chu 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Frostell-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Frostell 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holm-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Holm 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tagliaferro-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Tagliaferro 2011</LINK>) and the remaining 11 trials were at unclear risk of selection bias.</P>

<P>Five trials were described as double blind and reported the use of a placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Arruda-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Arruda 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Borutta-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Borutta 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salazar-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Salazar 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2008</LINK>), and we assumed that participants were blinded to allocated intervention and assessed these trials at low risk of performance bias.

These eight trials were assessed at low risk of performance bias. In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Gugwad-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Gugwad 2011</LINK> participant blinding was unclear and this study was assessed at unclear risk of performance bias. In the remaining 13 trials, there was no placebo used and no participant blinding so we assessed these trials at high risk of performance bias.</P>
<P>Blinding of outcome assessors to allocated treatment group was clearly reported in 20 of the 22 included trials (91%) and these were assessed at low risk of detection bias. In two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Holm-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Holm 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lawrence-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lawrence 2008</LINK>) blind outcome assessment was not reported, but deemed likely, and these were assessed at unclear risk of detection bias.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Baseline imbalance</HEADING>
<P>We also assessed whether there was a balance of important prognostic factors between the arms of the included trials. Eighteen trials (82%) were assessed at low risk of bias for this domain as the differences between groups in prognostic factors such as caries prevalence at baseline and toothbrushing habits or diet or both during the study were not clinically important. However, four trials were assessed at high risk of bias due to baseline imbalance (<LINK REF="STD-Arruda-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Arruda 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Borutta-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Borutta 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holm-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Holm 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Modeer-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Modeer 1984</LINK>) for at least one important prognostic factor.</P>

In <LINK REF="STD-Sk_x00f6_ld-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sköld 2005</LINK>, 95% of the study participants, including those in the no treatment control group, had at least one fluoride varnish treatment, so this trial was assessed at high risk of bias due to co-intervention.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Effect of fluoride varnish on caries increment</HEADING>
<P>The effects of fluoride varnishes on caries increment were reported in a variety of different ways in the included trials. One study was not able to be included in the meta-analysis because it was a cluster randomised trial with no standard deviations presented (<LINK REF="STD-Borutta-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Borutta 2006</LINK>) and was judged as part of the qualitative data synthesis only (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>).

</P>
<UL>
<LI>In the original version of this review, unreported standard deviations (SD) were estimated from an analysis of the 179 available treatment arms for the series of topical fluoride reviews with complete information (as of October 1999). This resulted in a regression equation of: log (SD caries increment) = 0.64 + 0.55* log (mean caries increment), (R<SUP>2</SUP> = 77%). This equation was applied to results of four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Frostell-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Frostell 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holm-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Holm 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Modeer-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Modeer 1984</LINK>) where the standard deviations were unreported.</LI>
<LI>Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Gugwad-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Gugwad 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2008</LINK>) did not report caries increment data, reporting instead baseline and final mean caries score. Mean caries increments were calculated and standard deviations of the increments estimated using a correlation coefficient between the baseline and final values of 0.5.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<B>Pooling of cluster randomised trials</B>
</P>
<P>In order to estimate the PF for the cluster randomised trials we calculated the effective sample size. One cluster randomised trial reported the results not accounting for clustering of the data (<LINK REF="STD-Bravo-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bravo 1997</LINK>). An intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.05 (using the value reported in a similar trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lawrence-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lawrence 2008</LINK>)) was used to estimate the design effect. This was then used to adjust the sample size of the control and intervention groups. One trial was not able to be included in the meta-analysis because it was a cluster randomised trial with no standard deviations presented (<LINK REF="STD-Borutta-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Borutta 2006</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Effect on tooth surfaces permanent dentition: D(M)FS prevented fraction</HEADING>
<P>For all 13 trials combined, the D(M)FS prevented fraction pooled estimate was 0.43 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30 to 0.57; P &lt; 0.0001), suggesting a substantial benefit from the use of fluoride varnish. The confidence intervals are relatively wide and substantial heterogeneity in the results could be observed graphically (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 48.38 on 12 degrees of freedom, P &lt; 0.0001, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 75%) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). The average treatment effect and its confidence interval do not directly provide information on the potential effectiveness of treatment when applied within an individual study setting. A 95% prediction interval was therefore calculated (<LINK REF="REF-Riley-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riley 2011</LINK>). This ranged from -0.02 to 0.89, indicative of a benefit of fluoride varnish.</P>

<P>Meta-regression results for potential effect modifiers specified a priori are given in Additional <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>: Random-effects meta-regression analyses of prevented fractions: D(M)FS.</P>
<P>Univariate meta-regression suggested no significant association between estimates of D(M)FS prevented fractions and the pre-specified factors: baseline caries severity, background exposure to fluoridated water, background exposure to fluoride toothpaste, or background exposure to any reported fluoride source, concentration of fluoride, length of follow-up (duration of study), prior prophylaxis or frequency of application. Further univariate meta-regression analyses showed no significant associations between estimates of D(M)FS prevented fractions and time since treated teeth had erupted (&lt;= two years), whether a placebo or no treatment control was used, and whether individual randomisation or cluster randomised design was used.</P>
<P>In order to determine the influence of data imputation and approximation a sensitivity analysis was undertaken, restricting the pooling of trials to those that were fully reported and suitable for analysis (eight trials). The results of this gave rise to greater PF values than the results of the full meta-analysis (PF = 0.55, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.68) and indicator of heterogeneity reduced from I<SUP>2</SUP> = 75% to 62%.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Effect on whole teeth permanent dentition: D(M)FT prevented fraction</HEADING>
<P>Five trials reported data which allowed the calculation of the D(M)FT prevented fraction. The pooled estimate of D(M)FT prevented fraction was 0.44 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.76; P = 0.009), suggesting a considerable benefit of fluoride varnish; the confidence intervals are wide, however (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>).

There was statistically significant heterogeneity between trials (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 21.83 on 9 degrees of freedom, P = 0.009, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 59%). A 95% prediction interval for the pooled trials was calculated and ranged from -0.01, 0.76, indicative of a benefit of fluoride varnish in the most part. One trial did not provide data in a format suitable for inclusion in the meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Borutta-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Borutta 2006</LINK>) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>).</P>

<P>Univariate meta-regression suggested no significant association between estimates of d(e/m)fs prevented fractions and the pre-specified factors: baseline caries severity and background exposure to fluoridated water. The effects of background exposure to fluoride toothpaste and background exposure to any reported fluoride source were inestimable due to collinearity in the data set. Further univariate meta-regression analyses showed no significant association between estimates of d(e/m)fs prevented fractions and concentration of fluoride varnish, length of follow-up (duration of study), frequency of application of varnish, whether a prophylaxis was undertaken prior to application of the varnish, use of a placebo rather than a no treatment control and which study design was used (individual randomisation or cluster randomisation).</P>

The results of this differed only slightly from the results of the full meta-analysis (PF = 0.45, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.62) and indicator of heterogeneity decreased to 52%.</P>

<P>A funnel plot of the pooled meta-analysis of 10 trials reporting d(e/m)fs prevented fractions indicated no clear relationship between prevented fraction and precision (it appears symmetric).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-07-10 14:56:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The main question addressed by this review is how effective the use of fluoride varnish for the prevention of caries in children is compared to placebo or no treatment. In this updated review there are now 22 trials published between 1975 and 2012 in which a total of 12,455 children were randomised to treatment with either fluoride varnish or placebo/no treatment. </P>
<P>The evidence from meta-analysis of the 13 trials assessing the effect of fluoride varnish on the permanent dentition is that the use of fluoride varnish is associated on average with a 43% (95% CI 30% to 57%) reduction in decayed, missing and filled tooth surfaces. The meta-analysis of the 10 trials assessing the effect of fluoride varnish on the primary dentition suggests a 37% (95% CI 24% to 51%) reduction in decayed, missing and filled tooth surfaces. There was considerable statistical heterogeneity in both these estimates.</P>
<P>We explored this heterogeneity in addressing the second, third and fourth objectives of this review which were to examine whether there was any relationship between the caries-preventive effectiveness of fluoride varnish and the initial level of caries severity, background exposure to fluoride (water supply, dentifrice, other fluoride sources), concentration of fluoride, frequency of application and whether prophylaxis was undertaken prior to the application of the varnish. The univariate meta-regressions found no significant associations between any of these pre-specified factors and the estimates of D(M)FS or d(m)fs prevented fractions, despite substantial variations between trials in these factors. As these meta-regression analyses include only a few trials, they have limited power to detect such relationships. However, it is possible that these multiple variations between the included trials is a cause of the substantial heterogeneity associated with both estimates. We also found no significant associations for three factors posed post hoc: time since eruption (for permanent dentition), placebo or no treatment control and study design (individual randomisation versus cluster randomisation).</P>
<P>We performed a sensitivity analysis for the main meta-analysis to take account of the uncertainty we have about the imputations for the missing standard deviations and to take the clustering into account where this had not been done in the cluster randomised trials. The sensitivity analysis showed results with larger effect estimate than the full meta-analysis, with a similar level of heterogeneity.  </P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-07-10 14:18:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found scarce information about the effects of fluoride varnishes on other outcomes such as the proportion of children developing caries or on acceptance of fluoride varnish treatment. Only three studies provided data, reporting no adverse effects. Even though fluoride varnishes are generally considered safe and well accepted, this lack of evidence makes it more difficult for clinicians and policy makers to weigh the benefits of fluoride varnishes in preventing caries against possible shortcomings of the procedure.</P>
<P>In the studies with more than one relevant intervention group and a common control group, such as those comparing different active fluoride agents or concentrations of fluoride ions to a placebo group, summary statistics from the studies (number of children analysed, mean caries increments and standard deviations) from all relevant intervention groups were combined in order to obtain a measure of treatment effect. This enabled the inclusion of all relevant data in the primary meta-analyses, but has limited a secondary investigation of dose-response.</P>
<P>Although we approached the manufacturers of fluoride varnishes requesting additional unpublished trial data, no such data were made available. However, we are aware that at least one additional study has been undertaken, and we have requested the data. If these data are made available to us it will be included in future updates of this review.</P>
<P>This review has evaluated the effects of fluoride varnish alone, versus either placebo or no treatment. We have excluded trials where fluoride varnish plus a complementary intervention, such as toothbrushing or provision of fluoride dentifrice are evaluated. Such trials would answer a different question which may be more relevant to current policy decisions.</P>
<P>The trials included in this review were conducted with participants at a range of caries risk as evidenced by the variability of the caries increments in the control groups. Trials were conducted in a variety of locations with variability in exposure to other sources of fluoride. The prevented fraction appears to be consistent across different populations, levels of caries risk and exposure to other factors. The absolute benefit from fluoride varnish will of course depend on the expected caries increment in the target population. Where expected caries increment is small the absolute benefit of fluoride varnish will be very small.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-07-10 14:19:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>None of the trials included in this review were assessed as at low risk of bias. In fact, 68% were assessed as at high risk of bias, with the remaining at unclear risk. In most of the trials allocation concealment was not reported. As with many long terms trials involving children, there was an average of 19% attrition in the included trials which was not clearly accounted for but is likely to be due to movement of families out of the study area. Overall the quality of the reporting of many of these trials was poor and we were unable to obtain further information from some trials because they were published many years ago.</P>
<P>There is substantial heterogeneity in the body of evidence which addresses the main question of this review. We were unable to find a conclusive explanation for this, but we note that there is substantial variability between the trials in this review with regard to factors which may influence the effect estimate in each study. While we have not been able to demonstrate a significant association between factors such as the initial level of caries severity, background exposure to fluoride (water supply, dentifrice, other fluoride sources), frequency of application, fluoride concentration and whether prophylaxis was undertaken prior to the application of the varnish, neither can we confidently exclude the possibility that one or more of these factors may account for the observed heterogeneity.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-07-10 14:56:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A sensitive search strategy was used to identify trials for inclusion in this review and there were no restrictions placed on publication status or language. Many references were translated in order to determine whether or not they reported trials eligible for inclusion in this review.</P>
<P>No clear relationship between prevented fraction and precision could be observed in the funnel plot of the 13 trials (it appeared asymmetric), but as for meta-regression methods, power is limited when the number of trials is small. We cannot eliminate the possibility that bias may have influenced the results of this review.</P>

<P>The findings of this updated Cochrane review do not differ from those of the initial review, published first in 2002. The general direction of findings presented is in keeping with those of other reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Carvalho-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carvalho 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Petersson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petersson 2004</LINK>) which also found evidence for the effectiveness of fluoride varnish. <LINK REF="REF-Carvalho-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carvalho 2010</LINK> evaluated the effectiveness of fluoride varnish in decreasing dental caries incidence in pre-school children and added two RCTs to the body of evidence assessed in the 2002 version of this review. <LINK REF="REF-Azarpazhooh-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Azarpazhooh 2008</LINK> added four RCTs and three cohort trials to the body of evidence assessed in the previous version of this Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Marinho-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marinho 2002</LINK>), to produce a body of evidence comprising 13 RCTs and three cohort trials. The review by <LINK REF="REF-Azarpazhooh-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Azarpazhooh 2008</LINK> concluded that there is "clear evidence of the efficacy of fluoride varnish in preventing dental caries in children and adolescents" but in the absence of a meta-analysis, no estimate of the magnitude of the expected benefit was reported, and we are unhappy about the methodological quality of this review. The systematic review by <LINK REF="REF-Petersson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petersson 2004</LINK> based their conclusions on 15 included trials (both RCTs and CCTs) and reported a mean prevented fraction of 30% (0% to 69%) when fluoride varnishes were compared to placebo or no treatment.</P>
<P>This updated Cochrane review includes an additional 13 RCTs compared to the previous version (<LINK REF="REF-Marinho-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marinho 2002</LINK>). None of the additional included trials is included in the <LINK REF="REF-Petersson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petersson 2004</LINK> review, four are included in the <LINK REF="REF-Azarpazhooh-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Azarpazhooh 2008</LINK> review, and two are included in the <LINK REF="REF-Carvalho-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carvalho 2010</LINK> review. The large body of evidence contained in this updated Cochrane review provided the best available evidence of the effectiveness of fluoride varnish compared to either placebo or no treatment.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-07-10 14:25:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review has found that the application of fluoride varnishes two to four times a year, either in the permanent or primary dentition, is associated with a substantial reduction in caries increment. We found that this relative effect applies in populations with different levels of caries risk and exposure to other sources of fluoride. We also found no evidence that this relative effect was dependent on frequency of varnish application, length of follow-up, whether a prophylaxis was undertaken prior to application of the varnish, concentration of fluoride in the varnish and use of a placebo rather than a no treatment control, although these results should be interpreted with caution. The review does not provide any information on the likelihood of side effects with this treatment and inconclusive information on acceptability.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-07-10 14:25:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review of 22 RCTs shows that fluoride varnish, compared to placebo or no treatment, is effective in the prevention of caries in children and adolescents. Despite the large number of trials identified, there is still a paucity of evidence from high quality randomised trials assessing the effectiveness of fluoride varnishes for the prevention of caries in children. It is also important that future trials should include the assessment of other relevant outcomes such as potential side effects (e.g. oral allergic reactions) and those related to acceptability of treatment. The reporting of caries at both the cavitated and non-cavitated level would improve interpretation. Also future trials should consider evaluating the effects of complex interventions incorporating fluoride varnish with other caries preventive strategies, conducted in either the setting of a dental practice or a community site such as a school.</P>
