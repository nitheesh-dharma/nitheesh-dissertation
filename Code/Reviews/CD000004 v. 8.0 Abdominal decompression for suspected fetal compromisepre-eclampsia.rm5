<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-29 16:35:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lynn Hampson">
<P>Abdominal decompression was first used to increase blood flow and the forward movement of the uterus during labour contractions as a way of relieving pain. A rigid covered dome is placed about the abdomen and the space around the abdomen is decompressed to -50 to -100 mm Hg for 15 to 30 seconds out of each minute for 30 minutes once to thrice daily, or continuously during labour. Observations that fetal wellbeing appeared to be improved led to its investigation for complications of pregnancy.</P>
<P>Three randomised controlled studies with a total of 356 pregnant women were identified from a search of the medical literature, all with the possibility of containing serious methodological limitations. The studies were reported on between 1967 and 1973. One study involved women with pre-eclampsia, essential hypertension, or chronic nephritis. The other two trials assigned women carrying babies that were small for their gestational age to abdominal decompression or no decompression.</P>
<P>Abdominal decompression appeared to have a beneficial effect on the progression of pre-eclampsia. This one trial also reported less fetal distress during labour and fewer low 1-minute Apgar scores in the group who received abdominal decompression. The apparent large improvement in birthweight and perinatal deaths reported in all three studies is sufficiently striking to warrant the further evaluation of abdominal decompression in cases of impaired fetal growth, and possibly for women with pre-eclampsia, by means of methodologically sound controlled trials. Because of the methodological shortcomings mentioned above, clinical use of abdominal decompression cannot be supported on the basis of the present trials.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Abdominal decompression was developed as a means of pain relief during labour. It has also been used for complications of pregnancy, and in healthy pregnant women in an attempt to improve fetal wellbeing and intellectual development. </P>

<P>The objective of this review was to assess the effects of antenatal abdominal decompression for maternal hypertension or impaired fetal growth, on perinatal outcome.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-10-29 16:50:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three studies were included, all with the possibility of containing serious bias. Therapeutic abdominal decompression was associated with the following reductions: persistent pre-eclampsia (relative risk 0.36, 95% confidence interval 0.18 to 0.72); fetal distress in labour (relative risk 0.37, 95% confidence interval 0.19 to 0.71); low birthweight (relative risk 0.50, 95% confidence interval 0.40 to 0.63); Apgar scores less than six at one minute (relative risk 0.26, 95% confidence interval 0.12 to 0.56); and perinatal mortality (relative risk 0.39, 95% confidence interval 0.22 to 0.71).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Due to the methodological limitations of the studies, the effects of therapeutic abdominal decompression are not clear. The apparent improvements in birthweight and perinatal mortality warrant further evaluation of abdominal decompression where there is impaired fetal growth and possibly for women with pre-eclampsia.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-10-29 09:48:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Abdominal decompression was developed initially as a method of enhancing the forward movement of the uterus during labour contractions with a view to relieving pain. Unanticipated apparent beneficial effects on fetal condition led to its investigation for this purpose. A rigid dome is placed about the abdomen and covered with an airtight suit. The space around the abdomen is decompressed to -50 to -100 mmHg for 15-30 seconds out of each minute for 30 minutes once to thrice daily, or continuously during labour. This is thought to 'pump' blood through the intervillous space. See also <LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 1989</LINK>.</P>

<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Blecher-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Blecher 1967</LINK>) does not exclude the possibility of selection and observer bias. Allocation of 160 women with pre-eclampsia, essential hypertension or chronic nephritis to study and control groups was by alternation. Observers were not blind to the allocation of each woman, and the assessment of outcome as 'unchanged' or 'worsening' pre-eclampsia is somewhat subjective.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-MacRae-1971" TYPE="STUDY">MacRae 1971</LINK> do not define their method of selecting 'at random' 28 women with fetuses estimated to be small for gestational age and with urinary oestriol levels below the normal range, for abdominal decompression, and 28 to serve as controls.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Varma-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Varma 1973</LINK> allocated 140 women with clinically 'small for dates' fetuses and biparietal diameters below the 10th percentile by alternation to decompression and control groups. The allocation of seven women from each group was changed because of non-acceptance of abdominal decompression. It has not been possible to reanalyse the data according to the original constitution of the groups. The observers were not blind to the allocation of each woman, and certain of the measures of outcome were to some extent subjective.</P>
<P>Interpretation of the results of these studies must be guarded because of the possibility of selection, observer and analysis bias outlined above.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>In the trial reported by <LINK REF="STD-Blecher-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Blecher 1967</LINK>, abdominal decompression appeared to have a beneficial effect on the progression of pre-eclampsia. In both of the other trials (<LINK REF="STD-MacRae-1971" TYPE="STUDY">MacRae 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Varma-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Varma 1973</LINK>), abdominal decompression appeared to be associated with a significantly greater increase in levels of urinary oestriol, although only <LINK REF="STD-Varma-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Varma 1973</LINK> actually presented data (1.68 [1.21] versus 0.91 [0.74] mg per week, mean values [SD]). In addition, <LINK REF="STD-Varma-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Varma 1973</LINK> found that abdominal decompression was associated with statistically significant faster weekly growth in the fetal biparietal diameter (2.08 [0.36] versus 1.49 [0.71] mm per week, mean values [SD]). <LINK REF="STD-Blecher-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Blecher 1967</LINK> did not report a reduction in the incidence of induction of labour, while <LINK REF="STD-Varma-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Varma 1973</LINK> showed a trend to fewer inductions of labour in the decompression group, the more so for inductions for 'placental insufficiency'. <LINK REF="STD-Varma-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Varma 1973</LINK> also reported significantly less fetal distress during labour and depressed 1-minute Apgar scores in the group who had received abdominal decompression. </P>
<P>Observer bias and possibly reporting bias may account for some or all of the putative effects of abdominal decompression noted above. The assessment of birthweight is less susceptible to observer bias, and data are available from all three trials. Abdominal decompression was associated with a substantial reduction in the incidence of low birthweight in two of the trials and an increase in mean birthweight and placental weight in the third (<LINK REF="STD-MacRae-1971" TYPE="STUDY">MacRae 1971</LINK>). Perinatal mortality was also reduced in all three trials.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>For outcomes assessed in more than one study, all results are compatible.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Because of the methodological shortcomings mentioned above, clinical use of abdominal decompression cannot be supported on the basis of these trials.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The large improvement in birthweight and perinatal mortality reported in all three studies is sufficiently striking to warrant the further evaluation of abdominal decompression in cases of impaired fetal growth, and possibly pre-eclampsia, by means of methodologically sound controlled trials.</P>

<P>Allocation was not stated to be randomized or quasi-randomized.  Women with fetal growth impairment at 32 to 34 weeks&#8217; gestation were divided into 2 groups.  Fourteen women received abdominal decompression to -50 to -70mmhg for 15-30 second per minute for 30 minutes, twice a week. Twelve women acted as controls (bedrest).  There appeared to be improved growth in the decompression group.</P>
