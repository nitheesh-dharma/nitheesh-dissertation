<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-04-19 09:33:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Alan B. Carr">
<P>In addition to the well-known harmful effects of smoking on respiratory and cardiovascular systems, tobacco use is associated with an increased risk for oral disease, including cancer and gum disease. Dental professionals are in a unique position to help tobacco users who present for dental care by providing assistance to help them stop smoking or using other tobacco products. Combined findings from 14 studies including over 10,500 participants showed that tobacco interventions by dental professionals helped tobacco users to quit. These findings are similar for smokeless tobacco users and smokers, and the body of evidence reveals a significant increase in demonstrated benefit compared to earlier findings of this review.</P>

<P>This review assesses the effectiveness of interventions for tobacco cessation delivered by oral health professionals and offered to cigarette smokers and smokeless tobacco users in the dental office or community setting.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-04-10 15:33:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Alan B. Carr">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialized Register (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1966-November 2011), EMBASE (1988-November 2011), CINAHL (1982-November 2011), Healthstar (1975-November 2011), ERIC (1967-November 2011), PsycINFO (1984-November 2011), National Technical Information Service database (NTIS, 1964-November 2011), Dissertation Abstracts Online (1861-November 2011), Database of Abstract of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE, 1995-November 2011), and Web of Science (1993-November 2011).</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2011-09-27 02:12:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomized and pseudo-randomized clinical trials assessing tobacco cessation interventions conducted by oral health professionals in the dental office or community setting with at least six months of follow-up.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-04-10 15:34:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsay Stead">
<P>Two authors independently reviewed abstracts for potential inclusion and abstracted data from included trials. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. The primary outcome was abstinence from smoking or all tobacco use (for users of smokeless tobacco) at the longest follow-up, using the strictest definition of abstinence reported. The effect was summarised as an odds ratio, with correction for clustering where appropriate. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I² statistic and where appropriate a pooled effect was estimated using an inverse variance fixed-effect model.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-04-11 10:08:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Alan B. Carr">
<P>Fourteen clinical trials met the criteria for inclusion in this review. Included studies assessed the efficacy of interventions in the dental office or in a community school or college setting. Six studies evaluated the effectiveness of interventions among smokeless tobacco (ST) users, and eight studies evaluated interventions among cigarette smokers, six of which involved adult smokers in dental practice settings. All studies employed behavioral interventions and only one required pharmacotherapy as an interventional component. All studies included an oral examination component. Pooling all 14 studies suggested that interventions conducted by oral health professionals can increase tobacco abstinence rates (odds ratio [OR] 1.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.44 to 2.03) at six months or longer, but there was evidence of heterogeneity (I² = 61%). Within the subgroup of interventions for smokers, heterogeneity was smaller (I² = 51%), but was largely attributable to a large study showing no evidence of benefit. Within this subgroup there were five studies which involved adult smokers in dental practice settings. Pooling these showed clear evidence of benefit and minimal heterogeneity (OR 2.38, 95% CI 1.70 to 3.35, 5 studies, I² = 3%) but this was a posthoc subgroup analysis. Amongst the studies in smokeless tobacco users the heterogeneity was also attributable to a large study showing no sign of benefit, possibly due to intervention spillover to control colleges; the other five studies indicated that interventions for ST users were effective (OR 1.70; 95% CI 1.36 to 2.11).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-04-19 10:28:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Alan B. Carr">
<P>Available evidence suggests that behavioral interventions for tobacco cessation conducted by oral health professionals incorporating an oral examination component in the dental office or community setting may increase tobacco abstinence rates among both cigarette smokers and smokeless tobacco users. Differences between the studies limit the ability to make conclusive recommendations regarding the intervention components that should be incorporated into clinical practice, however, behavioral counselling (typically brief) in conjunction with an oral examination was a consistent intervention component that was also provided in some control groups.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-04-11 10:21:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In addition to the well-known harmful effects of smoking on respiratory and cardiovascular systems, tobacco use has significant adverse effects on oral health (<LINK REF="REF-Warnakulasuriya-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warnakulasuriya 2010</LINK>). Cigarette smoking is associated with an increased risk for oral disease (<LINK REF="REF-Gelskey-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gelskey 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mecklenburg-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mecklenburg 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Salvi-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salvi 2000</LINK>). Tobacco exposes the oral cavity to toxic carcinogens that may have a role in initiation and promotion of cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Mirbod-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mirbod 2000</LINK>). Tobacco is the major inducer of oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and is considered to be responsible for 50% to 90% of oral cancer cases worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Epstein-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Epstein 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Holleb-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holleb 1996</LINK>). The incidence of oral SCC is four to seven times greater in smokers than non-smokers (<LINK REF="REF-Piyathilake-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Piyathilake 1995</LINK>). Oral cancer and pre-cancer occurs more frequently in smokers, and quitting smoking decreases the risk for oral cancer within 5 to 10 years (<LINK REF="REF-EU-Working-Group-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">EU Working Group 1998</LINK>). Tobacco exposure is also harmful to periodontal health, and smoking status is an important factor in the prognosis for periodontal therapy, oral wound healing, implant therapy, and cosmetic dentistry (<LINK REF="REF-Mecklenburg-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mecklenburg 1998</LINK>). Smoking results in discoloration of both teeth and dental restorations, and is associated with halitosis, diminished taste, and an increased prevalence and severity of periodontal disease (<LINK REF="REF-EU-Working-Group-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">EU Working Group 1998</LINK>). Cigarette smoking is causally associated with an increased prevalence and severity of periodontitis (<LINK REF="REF-Gelskey-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gelskey 1999</LINK>), even when adequate oral hygiene is practiced (<LINK REF="REF-Kerdvongbundit-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kerdvongbundit 2002</LINK>). Cessation of smoking may halt disease progression and improve outcomes of periodontal therapy (<LINK REF="REF-EU-Working-Group-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">EU Working Group 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Smokeless tobacco use has been reported to cause tooth decay (<LINK REF="REF-Tomar-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tomar 1999</LINK>) and discoloration of dental restorations (<LINK REF="REF-Walsh-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh 2000</LINK>). Chewing tobacco, in particular, is associated with an increased risk for dental caries due to high sugar content and increased gingival recession. Abrasive particles in chewing tobacco may contribute to significant dental attrition which may require dental restorations in advanced cases (<LINK REF="REF-Bowles-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bowles 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Milosevic-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Milosevic 1996</LINK>). Cross-sectional studies have suggested that smokeless tobacco users with co-existing gingivitis have high rates of gingival recession, mucosal pathology, and dental caries (<LINK REF="REF-Offenbacher-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Offenbacher 1985</LINK>). Smokeless tobacco use has also been associated with irreversible gingival attachment loss resulting in root exposure (<LINK REF="REF-Ernster-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ernster 1990</LINK>). Effects of smokeless tobacco use are typically observed at anatomical locations where the tobacco contacts the mucosa, such as the labial vestibule and adjacent periodontium. Both the prevalence and severity of tobacco-related oral lesions demonstrate a dose-response relationship with the amount, frequency and duration of smokeless tobacco exposure (<LINK REF="REF-Little-1992a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Little 1992a</LINK>). Chronic exposure can lead to leukoplakia (<LINK REF="REF-Hirsch-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirsch 1982</LINK>), a premalignant condition (<LINK REF="REF-Silverman-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silverman 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Silverman-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silverman 1976</LINK>). Smokeless tobacco use in the United States has been associated with an increased risk for oral cancer in a dose-response fashion (<LINK REF="REF-Stockwell-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stockwell 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Winn-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winn 1981</LINK>). Risk may vary depending upon the type of smokeless tobacco used, as the highest rates of oral cancer are observed in countries where smokeless tobacco is consumed with additives (e.g., areca nut) (<LINK REF="REF-Critchley-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Critchley 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The dental practice setting provides a unique opportunity to assist tobacco users in achieving tobacco abstinence (<LINK REF="REF-Christen-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Christen 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Needleman-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Needleman 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ramseier-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramseier 2010</LINK>). Widespread acceptance of tobacco use interventions in the dental setting have been lacking and limitations in primary care resources have curtailed further efforts (<LINK REF="REF-Warnakulasuriya-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warnakulasuriya 2002</LINK>). Compared to other health care providers, dentists more accurately estimate patient tobacco use (<LINK REF="REF-Block-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Block 1999</LINK>). However, dental practitioners are less consistent with and supportive of intervention, less likely to report having strong knowledge or skill levels regarding tobacco cessation, and more likely to perceive barriers to tobacco intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Block-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Block 1999</LINK>). More than 40% of dentists do not routinely ask about tobacco use and 60% do not routinely advise tobacco users to quit (<LINK REF="REF-Tomar-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tomar 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>While 61.5% of dentists believe their patients do not expect tobacco cessation services, 58.5% of their patients felt such services should be provided (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 1999</LINK>). Barriers to providing tobacco cessation service include concern for patient resistance (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 1994</LINK>), lack of knowledge, lack of time (<LINK REF="REF-Dolan-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dolan 1997</LINK>), lack of financial reimbursement (<LINK REF="REF-Fried-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fried 1992</LINK>), and a concern for poor co-ordination of care between dentistry and tobacco cessation services (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 1994</LINK>).</P>

<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2012-04-19 10:29:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We assess the effectiveness of interventions for tobacco cessation offered by oral health professionals to cigarette smokers and smokeless tobacco users in the dental office or community setting. We were interested in testing the following hypotheses in regards to increasing tobacco abstinence rates among tobacco users:</P>
<OL>
<LI>In dental settings, brief counselling cessation interventions are more effective than usual care.</LI>
<LI>Brief counselling cessation interventions conducted by dental professionals combined with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) are more effective than NRT alone.</LI>
<LI>Tobacco use interventions incorporating personalized feedback from an oral examination are more effective than interventions without personalized feedback from an oral examination.</LI>
<LI>Tobacco use interventions conducted by dental health professionals are more effective than interventions conducted by other healthcare professionals.</LI>

</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Patients or subjects of any age reporting tobacco use and receiving oral health interventions by dental professionals were included. Subject recruitment and participation included both those actively seeking treatment and those who did not express an interest in quitting. All tobacco users (cigarette, cigar, and pipe smokers, and smokeless tobacco users) were included.</P>

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2012-04-10 16:01:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included any intervention to promote tobacco use cessation (intervention versus usual care or placebo, and/or intervention versus other intervention) which included a component delivered by a dentist, dental hygienist, dental assistant or office staff in the dental practice setting and any combination of these, as well as the same individuals providing intervention as part of a community effort. Interventions could include brief advice to quit, provision of self-help materials, counselling, pharmacotherapy or any combination of these, or referral to other sources of support. Interventions that were directed at both smokers and smokeless tobacco users were included, as were interventions aimed at the training of dental health professionals.</P>

Keywords of the various oral specialties orthodont$, periodont$ and endodont$ were also searched. There were no language restrictions. In general, records were searched by conducting searches the following way: (participants OR outcomes) AND interventions. We contacted experts in the area to locate unpublished studies in an effort to minimise publication bias.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-04-19 10:29:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two authors screened the records retrieved by the searches for potential relevance against stated inclusion criteria: randomized/pseudo-randomized clinical trial, dental setting, tobacco cessation interventions, and cessation measures of six-month minimum follow-up. Two authors checked studies of possible relevance for inclusion or exclusion, and independently extracted and compared data. We resolved disagreements by discussion and consensus (referring to a colleague or Cochrane Review Group staff when necessary).</P>
<P>We extracted the following information about each study:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Site, including country and type of dental practice</LI>
<LI>Method of randomization and allocation concealment, and whether individual or cluster randomized</LI>
<LI>Method of participant selection</LI>
<LI>Characteristics of the intervention (behavioral/pharmacologic, delivered by whom)</LI>
<LI>Characteristics of participants (type of tobacco use, interest in quitting)</LI>
<LI>Outcome assessment (length of follow-up, definition of quitting, method for validation of self-report)</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>For each study we selected the outcome with the most rigorous definition available with regards to maintenance of abstinence (i.e., continuous versus point prevalence) and type of tobacco abstinence (i.e., all tobacco versus smokeless tobacco only) (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2003</LINK>). Rates were based on an intention-to-treat analysis with drop-outs and losses to follow-up assumed to be continuing tobacco users. We noted any difference in numbers lost to follow-up between intervention and control groups.</P>
<P>The risk of randomization and allocation concealment were judged to be low if the method was described in sufficient detail to ensure that allocation was blinded until after trial enrolment, unclear if there was insufficient detail with which to judge, and high if allocation was not concealed (as in use of patient record numbers, day of attendance, etc.). We also assessed the risk of attrition bias in included studies. Where there appears to have been a large loss to follow-up we assessed whether the findings were sensitive to the use of different denominators. In addition to the judgements above, we assessed bias impact on strength of the evidence by identifying trials with multiple sources of bias, and we comment on the potential impact of the bias on the overall treatment effect.</P>
<P>The outcome from each trial was expressed as an odds ratio (OR). Where cessation is the outcome this was defined as (number of quitters in treatment group/number of smokers in treatment group)/(number of quitters in control group/number of smokers in control group). The OR was greater than 1 if people were more likely to quit in the treatment group. For cluster randomized trials we adjusted for clustering using the reported intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and the average cluster size. We calculated the logarithm of the adjusted or natural OR and its standard error and pooled studies using the generic inverse variance method (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>, Section 16.3.4).

<P>The dental offices involved in the included studies were a heterogeneous group: six studies were conducted in private practice office settings (<LINK REF="STD-Andrews-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Andrews 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ebbert-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ebbert 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2010a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hanioka-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hanioka 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nohlert-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Nohlert 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Severson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Severson 1998</LINK>;); one study involved community public health dental clinics (<LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2010b" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2010b</LINK>); one was set in a hospital-based periodontal clinic (<LINK REF="STD-Binnie-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Binnie 2007</LINK>); two took place in managed care clinics (<LINK REF="STD-Lando-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lando 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stevens-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 1995</LINK>); and one took place in military clinics (<LINK REF="STD-Severson-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Severson 2009</LINK>). Three involved oral health professionals (dentists and dental hygienists) providing interventions to athletes within high school or college community settings (<LINK REF="STD-Gansky-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gansky 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walsh-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walsh-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 2003</LINK>). The school community studies included a dental professional intervention component as a major part of the intervention.</P>
<P>Eight studies targeted smokers (<LINK REF="STD-Binnie-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Binnie 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ebbert-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ebbert 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2010a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2010b" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2010b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hanioka-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hanioka 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lando-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lando 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nohlert-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Nohlert 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Severson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Severson 1998</LINK>). Five studies involved dental practice settings where adult smokers were provided at least brief behavioral counselling as part of the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Binnie-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Binnie 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ebbert-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ebbert 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hanioka-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hanioka 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2010b" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2010b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2010a</LINK>).

In the dental office studies, studies included tobacco users not actively seeking treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Andrews-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Andrews 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2010a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Severson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Severson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stevens-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 1995</LINK>) and those willing to participate (<LINK REF="STD-Binnie-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Binnie 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ebbert-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ebbert 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2010b" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2010b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hanioka-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hanioka 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lando-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lando 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nohlert-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Nohlert 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Severson-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Severson 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Interventions in the dental office setting occurred during hygiene visits in general dental practices (<LINK REF="STD-Andrews-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Andrews 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Binnie-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Binnie 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ebbert-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ebbert 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2010a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2010b" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2010b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hanioka-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hanioka 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lando-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lando 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nohlert-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Nohlert 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Severson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Severson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stevens-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 1995</LINK>), and involved either: 1) brief advice plus quitline referral (<LINK REF="STD-Ebbert-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ebbert 2007</LINK>), brief advice plus motivational interviewing (<LINK REF="STD-Lando-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lando 2007</LINK>), brief advice plus video-based cessation program with phone follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Andrews-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Andrews 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Severson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Severson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Severson-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Severson 2009</LINK>), or 2) counselling using the 5 A's plus nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) (<LINK REF="STD-Binnie-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Binnie 2007</LINK>), 5 A's plus NRT and population-specific printed material (<LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2010b" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2010b</LINK>), 3 A's plus pharmacotherapy and referral as needed (<LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2010a</LINK>). One study used target population-specific videos as an adjunct to counselling (<LINK REF="STD-Severson-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Severson 2009</LINK>). Two studies used a high intensity intervention where intensity was gauged as frequency of personal contact, and occurred five times or more (<LINK REF="STD-Hanioka-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hanioka 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nohlert-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Nohlert 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the school community studies, tobacco users had to agree to participate and informed consent was obtained (<LINK REF="STD-Gansky-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gansky 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walsh-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walsh-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 2003</LINK>). Some dental office studies restricted enrolment to 15 years of age or older (<LINK REF="STD-Andrews-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Andrews 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Severson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Severson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stevens-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 1995</LINK>), one of which placed gender restrictions on inclusion, while the remaining targeted adults. All of the school community studies based their intervention on the Cognitive Social Learning Theory (<LINK REF="REF-Bandura-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bandura 1986</LINK>), two of which reported that the Diffusion of Innovation Theory (<LINK REF="REF-Rogers-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rogers 1983</LINK>) was instrumental for incorporating the use of peer leaders. No such theoretical foundation was mentioned for the interventions applied to the dental office studies.</P>
<P>Nicotine replacement therapy in the form of gum (2 mg) was used in one of the school community studies (<LINK REF="STD-Walsh-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 1999</LINK>). The gum was reinforced with counselling by a dental professional. In the majority of the studies, dental professionals (dentists and dental hygienists) provided counselling interventions which most often included combinations of an oral examination, feedback from the examination as to oral effects of tobacco use, a message to quit, motivational counselling using printed material or media presentations, and self-help aids. In five dental office studies, the usual care group included was either not described (<LINK REF="STD-Hanioka-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hanioka 2010</LINK>) or involved no structured intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Andrews-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Andrews 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2010a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2010b" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2010b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stevens-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 1995</LINK>), and in all the school community studies the control schools received no formal training.</P>
<P>In five of the dental office studies, the dental office was the unit of randomization (<LINK REF="STD-Andrews-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Andrews 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ebbert-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ebbert 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2010a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2010b" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2010b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Severson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Severson 1998</LINK>), and in six studies, the patient was the unit of randomization (<LINK REF="STD-Binnie-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Binnie 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hanioka-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hanioka 2010</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lando-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lando 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Nohlert-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Nohlert 2009</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Severson-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Severson 2009</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Stevens-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 1995</LINK>). In the school community studies, the school was the unit of randomization following stratification based on baseline prevalence of tobacco use.</P>
<P>In the included trials, participants were followed for a maximum of six months (<LINK REF="STD-Ebbert-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ebbert 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Severson-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Severson 2009</LINK>), seven and a half months (<LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2010b" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2010b</LINK>), 12 months (<LINK REF="STD-Andrews-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Andrews 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Binnie-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Binnie 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gansky-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gansky 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2010a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hanioka-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hanioka 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lando-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lando 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nohlert-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Nohlert 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Severson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Severson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stevens-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walsh-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 1999</LINK>), and 24 months (<LINK REF="STD-Walsh-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 2003</LINK>, two year outcomes reported in <LINK REF="REF-Gansky-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gansky 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Of the studies targeting smokeless tobacco users, three reported all tobacco abstinence outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Andrews-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Andrews 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Severson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Severson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stevens-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 1995</LINK>).

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2012-04-19 10:58:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Alan B. Carr">
<P>When the 14 clinical trials of dental interventions compared to usual care, no contact, or less treatment intensive controls are pooled (including all tobacco users), a statistically significant increase in the odds of tobacco abstinence at 6 to 24 months is observed (odds ratio [OR] 1.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.44 to 2.03, <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>,) but with evidence of heterogeneity between the studies (I² = 61%).</P>
<P>Heterogeneity was explored by assessing the prespecified potential explanations.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Patients</HEADING>
<P>Heterogeneity is not fully explained by separating studies targeting cigarette smokers (I² = 51%)<SUP> </SUP>and smokeless tobacco (ST) users (I² = 74%). The estimated effect size was similar in both subgroups. In both groups the study contributing the greatest weight had a point estimate close to no effect, with confidence intervals ruling out large benefits or harms. In the subgroup of interventions for smokers, the largest trial, <LINK REF="STD-Severson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Severson 1998</LINK>, failed to detect any effect of an extended intervention compared to a brief intervention by dental hygienists. The same intervention showed a benefit in ST users recruited as part of the same study (<LINK REF="STD-Andrews-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Andrews 1999</LINK>). The next three largest studies amongst smokers did detect significant or near significant benefits and the pooled estimate indicated a clinically and statistically significant effect (OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.33 to 2.27, 8 studies, I² = 51%). In a sensitivity analysis using a random effects model the pooled estimate was similar and the confidence intervals still excluded one.</P>
<P>Heterogeneity may be due in part to type of practice. The included studies took place in dental settings characterized as either a specialty dental practice, general dental practices, federally funded dental practices, or managed care dental practices. Some targeted adolescents and adults while others focused only on adults. Recognizing these different features, we conducted a post hoc subgroup analysis of studies conducted in the settings most representative of typical dental environments (general dental practitioners seeing adult smokers). Dental practices providing, at a minimum, brief counselling to adult smokers showed a significant benefit of intervention when compared to usual care or less treatment intensive controls (OR 2.38, 95% CI 1.70 to 3.35, <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK> ) with no evidence of heterogeneity (I² = 3%).</P>
<P>In the ST use subgroup, <LINK REF="STD-Gansky-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gansky 2005</LINK> had narrow CIs ruling out large benefits or harms, but all other studies suggested benefit and three showed significant effects. As noted above, <LINK REF="STD-Gansky-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gansky 2005</LINK> is likely have been affected by spill-over of intervention to control groups. The estimate including <LINK REF="STD-Gansky-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gansky 2005</LINK> indicated a clinically and statistically significant effect (OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.36 to 2.11, 6 studies, I² = 74%). In a sensitivity analysis using a random effects model the pooled estimate was larger and the confidence intervals still excluded 1. A sensitivity analysis omitting <LINK REF="STD-Gansky-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gansky 2005</LINK> removed all evidence of heterogeneity and increased the effect estimate (OR 2.40, 95% CI 1.82 to 3.18).</P>
<P>Odds ratios were similar in a subgroup analysis comparing three studies in which participants were actively seeking treatment with three studies in which participants were not actively seeking treatment (actively seeking treatment: OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.86; not actively seeking treatment: OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.09, analysis not shown).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>Interventions in all studies were a team effort involving brief dental encounters plus additional behavioral interventions and/or pharmacotherapy. Interventions differed in intensity as measured by number of planned contacts but there was no clear indication of a dose-response relationship. <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2010a</LINK> had three arms: a '3 As' intervention using a 'fax-to-quit' referral form; a '5As' arm with Quitline referral at the provider's discretion; and a usual care control arm. Our analysis uses the '3As' intervention, but opting to use the '5As' intervention arm would not alter the findings.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>There was no evidence that the length of follow-up or definition of abstinence explained heterogeneity between studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Method of randomization</HEADING>
<P>The group of six trials that were individually randomized had lower heterogeneity (I² = 27%), although this may be due to chance, because the two studies contributing most to heterogeneity were both cluster randomized (<LINK REF="STD-Severson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Severson 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Gansky-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gansky 2005</LINK>). The effect estimate in the individually randomized study subgroup, although indicating significant benefit, was not clinically large (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.01, <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>).<BR/>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-04-19 10:59:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Alan B. Carr">
<P>The findings of our review are consistent with the hypothesis that dental interventions conducted in the dental office and school community setting are more effective than usual care for promoting tobacco use cessation. When dental interventions were compared to usual care, no contact, or less treatment intensive controls, the pooled odds ratio for abstinence at a follow-up of between 6 and 24 months was 1.71 (95% CI 1.44 to 2.03), although this estimate must be viewed cautiously because of unexplained heterogeneity (I² = 61%).</P>
<P>Current results are based on a much greater body of research on cigarette smokers when compared to the previous version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Carr-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carr 2006</LINK>), with eight studies of interventions for cigarette smoking now included compared to just one (<LINK REF="STD-Severson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Severson 1998</LINK>). Findings now suggest a significant benefit of intervention for increasing tobacco abstinence rates. Findings may be of particular interest to dental care providers whose practices focus on adult patients, as adult smokers may be particularly responsive to the effect of an intervention in this setting (OR 2.38, 95% CI 1.70 to 3.35, <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK> ).</P>
<P>Results should also be viewed cautiously due to the inability to blind, unclear methods of treatment allocation, a lack of biochemical validation of self reported tobacco cessation in most studies and inconsistent content and delivery of dental-specific interventions within the pooled studies. Although all of the included studies contained a dental intervention component, they involved varying dental settings, personnel, and interventions, and statistical heterogeneity was evident. The source of heterogeneity was unclear, and seemed largely attributable to null effects in two large trials. In one of these, the control communities may have been exposed to intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Gansky-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gansky 2005</LINK>). For the other (<LINK REF="STD-Severson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Severson 1998</LINK>), there was no clear reason for the lack of effect of the intervention.</P>
<P>All of the studies included in this review included brief advice to quit by an oral health professional. Brief advice from physicians has been shown to be an effective means to promote cessation (<LINK REF="REF-Lancaster-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lancaster 2008</LINK>), and this review suggests the same can be expected from dental professionals interacting with smokeless tobacco users. Clinical practice guidelines advise brief interventions in the clinical setting where patients are asked about their tobacco use and then advised to quit. If the user is ready to quit, the clinician can offer specific assistance and provide follow-up care. An insufficient number of studies are available to determine what specific assistance measures delivered by a dental professional provide additional effectiveness beyond brief advice.</P>
<P>The public health benefits of tobacco cessation interventions within the dental setting are potentially significant. The findings for both the smokeless tobacco users and smokers in this review suggest that there is an advantage of cessation interventions using dental professionals. However, the limited number of studies reviewed does not allow identification of intervention components most critical for cessation.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-04-19 11:00:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Alan B. Carr">
<P>Interventions for tobacco users delivered by oral health professionals, either in the dental office or in the school community, increase the odds of quitting tobacco. Insufficient evidence exists to make conclusions about the effectiveness of specific intervention components, but behavioral counselling (typically brief) is a consistent component.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-04-11 09:35:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Alan B. Carr">
<P>Additional study of interventions for tobacco cessation within the dental office setting is important to identify critical intervention components which are effective for this group of providers in this clinical setting.</P>

</TD>
<TD>
<P>A colourless, odourless highly poisonous gas found in tobacco smoke and in the lungs of people who have recently smoked, or (in smaller amounts) in people who have been exposed to tobacco smoke. May be used for biochemical verification of abstinence.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Cessation</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Also called 'quitting'<BR/>The goal of treatment to help people achieve abstinence from smoking or other tobacco use, also used to describe the process of changing the behaviour<BR/>

<TD>
<P>Lapse/slip</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Terms sometimes used for a return to tobacco use after a period of abstinence. A lapse or slip might be defined as a puff or two on a cigarette. This may proceed to relapse, or abstinence may be regained. Some definitions of continuous, sustained or prolonged abstinence require complete abstinence, but some allow for a limited number or duration of slips. People who lapse are very likely to relapse, but some treatments may have their effect by helping people recover from a lapse.</P>
