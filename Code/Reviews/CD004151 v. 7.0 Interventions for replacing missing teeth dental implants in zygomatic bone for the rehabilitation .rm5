<P>
<B>Review question </B>
</P>
<P>This review, carried out by authors of the Cochrane Oral Health Group, was produced to assess the beneficial and harmful effects of long tooth implants passing through the sinus and into cheekbone as an alternative to procedures designed to build up missing bone in the jaw such as bone grafting. The review question was intended to look at three options for this treatment.</P>
<P>(1) As a complete alternative to any procedures designed to build up missing bone in the jaw.<BR/>(2) As a partial alternative, for example some building up of the bone would still be needed in the front parts of the jaw.<BR/>(3) How long tooth implants can help retain any artificial palate (prosthesis or obturator) that may be needed after surgery to remove the roof and/or hard palate of the mouth (maxillectomy).</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Sometimes there is not enough bone in the upper jaw in which to secure dental implants. Sometimes bone is taken from somewhere else in the person's body, or bone substitutes are used. An alternative approach is to place one to three long screw-shaped implants into the sinus and the cheekbone (zygomatic implants). This may mean that bone grafting is unnecessary. The implants can then be used to build and secure artificial teeth.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>A search was done on 17 June 2013 and the review team found no trials comparing the outcomes of zygomatic implants with conventional bone grafting.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-08-30 16:29:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Dental implants are used for replacing missing teeth. Placing dental implants is limited by the presence of adequate bone volume permitting their anchorage. Several bone augmentation procedures have been developed to solve this problem. Zygomatic implants are long screw-shaped implants developed as a partial or complete alternative to bone augmentation procedures for the severely atrophic maxilla. One to three zygomatic implants can be inserted through the posterior alveolar crest passing through the maxillary sinus, or externally to it, to engage the body of the zygomatic bone. A couple of conventional dental implants may also be needed in the frontal region of the maxilla to stabilise the prosthesis. The potential main advantages of zygomatic implants could be that bone grafting may not be needed and a fixed prosthesis could be fitted sooner. Another specific indication for zygomatic implants could be maxillary reconstruction after maxillectomy in cancer patients.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2013-09-05 15:58:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-09-05 15:58:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-09-05 15:37:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Dental implants are now commonly used for replacing missing teeth in various clinical situations. Dental implants are surgically inserted in the jawbones. However, the possibility of placing dental implants is limited by the presence of adequate bone volume permitting their anchorage. In many clinical situations, in particular for edentulous patients with heavily resorbed jawbones and patients who underwent traumatic bone loss or resective surgery for oral cancer, there is insufficient bone to allow implant placement. Unfortunately, these people have more problems to adapt to conventional dentures, since dentures cannot be easily stabilised in the mouth due to lack of retention and therefore these people have serious difficulties in eating and speaking.</P>
<P>In order to solve this problem several bone augmentation procedures have been developed. In principle the missing bone is taken from a donor site (for example the iliac crest), transplanted where needed and then implants are placed. Sometimes, major bone grafting operations have to be undertaken under general anaesthesia requiring patients to be hospitalised for a few days. Some degree of morbidity related to the donor site must be expected and two to three surgical interventions may be needed before the implants can be functionally used. Sometimes patients have to wait more than one year before a denture can be fixed to the implants and the total cost of the treatment is high. More information about the effectiveness of various bone augmentation procedures can be found elsewhere (<LINK REF="REF-Esposito-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esposito 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Esposito-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esposito 2010</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-09-05 15:58:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>At the beginning of the 1990s a long screw-shaped implant was developed by Professor P-I Brånemark as an alternative to bone augmentation procedures: the zygomatic implant (<LINK REF="REF-Stevenson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevenson 2000</LINK>). Zygomatic implants are generally inserted through the alveolar crest and maxillary sinus to engage the body of the zygomatic bone (cheekbone). More recently, depending on the local anatomy, to favour an exit of the implant in a less palatal position and to minimise the risks of complications such as sinusitis, zygomatic implants are also placed laterally to the sinus without opening the maxillary sinus cavity (<LINK REF="REF-Aparicio-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aparicio 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mal_x00f3_-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maló 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dav_x00f3_-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davó 2013b</LINK>).</P>
<P>The placement of zygomatic implants require highly experienced and skilful surgeons, and often the opening of large windows in the maxillary sinus to properly visualise the correct implant placement. Implants are generally placed as posteriorly as possible (near the position of the second premolars) close to the alveolar crest, but they tend to be located more palatally than the actual position of the teeth. Up to three zygomatic implants can be placed on each side of the maxilla. The operation requires general anaesthesia or conscious sedation and local anaesthesia for pain control.</P>
<P>Zygomatic implants can be left to heal submerged for up to six months (<LINK REF="REF-Dav_x00f3_-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davó 2009</LINK>), though, more recently, it was shown that they could be successfully loaded immediately (<LINK REF="REF-Dav_x00f3_-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davó 2008a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dav_x00f3_-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davó 2008b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dav_x00f3_-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davó 2013a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dav_x00f3_-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davó 2013b</LINK>). The major potential advantages of zygomatic implants are that bone augmentation procedures may not be needed and patients can be rehabilitated with a fixed prosthesis within the same day. It is believed that two zygomatic implants are not sufficient to hold a fixed bridge, and that at least two additional conventional implants should be placed in the anterior portion of the maxilla (<LINK REF="REF-Bedrossian-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bedrossian 2001</LINK>). This can only be accomplished if there is sufficient bone in the anterior portion of the maxilla, otherwise bone grafting is still needed. An alternative is to place two or three zygomatic implants in each zygoma (<LINK REF="REF-Dav_x00f3_-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davó 2008a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dav_x00f3_-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davó 2013b</LINK>).</P>
<P>The most commonly and serious reported complications with zygomatic implants are: sinusitis (up to 21% of the patients in <LINK REF="REF-Dav_x00f3_-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davó 2009</LINK>); zygomatic implant failures (up to 11% of patients in <LINK REF="REF-Br_x00e5_nemark-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brånemark 2004</LINK>); and perforation of the orbit (up to 6% of patients in <LINK REF="REF-Dav_x00f3_-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davó 2013b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Indications for zygomatic implants could be the following.<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Treatment of severely atrophic fully edentulous maxillae without using any bone augmentation procedure. There may be two different clinical situations: (a) there is enough bone in the frontal maxillary region to allow the placement of at least two short implants; or (b) there is not enough bone in the frontal regions and two to three zygomatic implants can be used in each upper quadrant to hold a fixed prosthesis without using any conventional dental implants.</LI>
<LI>Treatment of severely atrophic partially edentulous maxillae avoiding sinus lifting or other grafting procedures.</LI>
<LI>Maxillary reconstruction after partial or total maxillectomy. Zygomatic implants can be used to fix maxillary obturators as an alternative to non-implant retained obturators, local and regional flaps, and microvascular free flaps (<LINK REF="REF-Schmidt-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmidt 2004</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>At the moment there are at least eight companies manufacturing fully or partially threaded titanium zygomatic implants: AS Technology, Conexão Sistemas de Pròtese, Brånemak Integration, Dentoflex, Neodent, Nobelbiocare, SIN Implant System, and Southern.<BR/>

For studies appearing to meet the inclusion criteria, or for which there were insufficient data in the title and abstract to make a clear decision, the full report was to be obtained and assessed independently by two review authors to establish whether the studies met the inclusion criteria or not. Disagreements were to be resolved by discussion. Where resolution was not possible, a methodologist from the Cochrane Oral Health Group was to be consulted. All studies meeting the inclusion criteria were to undergo risk of bias assessment and data were to be extracted.

<P>We intended to carry out risk of bias assessment following the recommended approach in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for</I> <I>Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). It is a two-part tool, addressing the six specific domains (namely sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and 'other bias'). Each domain includes one specific entry in a 'Risk of bias' table. Within each entry, the first part of the tool involves describing what was reported to have happened in the study. The second part of the tool involves assigning a judgement relating to the risk of bias for that entry, either 'low risk', 'high risk' or, where there is insufficient information on which to base a judgement, 'unclear risk'.</P>
<P>The risk of bias assessment of any included trials was to have been completed independently and in duplicate by two review authors as part of the data extraction process. On occasions when the review authors were also authors of trial reports that needed to be assessed, the reports were to be independently evaluated only by review authors who had not been involved in the trials, and duplicated by a methodologist from the Cochrane Oral Health Group.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-09-03 14:07:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>While the scarcity of long-term clinical data can be explained by the fact that zygomatic implants are a relatively new procedure, it is rather discouraging to observe that we were unable to identify even a single RCT testing the efficacy of zygomatic implants in comparison with traditional bone augmentation procedures. The placement of zygomatic implants requires very experienced surgeons as it is not risk-free since delicate anatomic structures such as the orbita may be involved. The main complication which seems to occur with zygomatic implants is sinusitis which may develop several years after their placement (<LINK REF="REF-Br_x00e5_nemark-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brånemark 2004</LINK>). In case of complications, it is rather difficult to remove zygomatic implants. Therefore, we foresee a great need to conduct high quality RCTs to investigate the potential advantages of zygomatic implants before recommending the routine use of this procedure.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-09-05 15:42:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Even recognising the fact that zygomatic implants are a relatively new treatment modality, it is disappointing that not even one published RCT, comparing zygomatic implants with any alternative augmentation techniques, could be identified. It is therefore suggested that multicentre, properly designed RCTs should be implemented in this area, before any evidence-based recommendation on the use of zygomatic implants can be given. In order to exploit the maximum potential advantages of zygomatic implants, it may be worth assessing their performance when loaded immediately to shorten the treatment time for the patients. Complications with zygomatic implants need also to be thoroughly assessed and compared with those occurring with alternative bone augmentation procedures. It is also important that long follow-up periods are considered (definitely more than five years), since some complications such as sinusitis seem to develop at a later stage. The research agenda should give priority to the evaluation of zygomatic implants as a complete alternative to bone augmentation procedures in the severely atrophic maxilla, and as retainers of obturators in maxillectomy cases.</P>
