<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-06-26 17:11:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Benign epilepsy with centro temporal spikes is one of the most common childhood seizure disorders . Treatment for this disorder has been controversial as almost all individuals achieve seizure freedom by adolescence. However, this seizure disorder may not be as benign as the name suggests as children may have specific cognitive impairment. Treatment is started if seizures are felt to be frequent and intrusive.</P>
<P>There were few studies found (searches conducted on 30th April 2013) with few antiepileptic drugs compared. One of the four studies included showed evidence that the antiepileptic drug, sulthiame, may have a positive effect in reducing seizure frequency in BECTS in the short term. There were no significant differences in the number of patients with adverse events apart from a higher risk of rash when carbamazepine was compared to topiramate. The number of patients who discontinued treatment as a result of adverse events was also not significant in the studies reviewed. There is insufficient evidence about whether or not treating with antiepileptic drugs has any effect on seizure freedom in the longer term or on a child&#8217;s cognition. The optimum treatment has yet to be identified. More research is needed to look into the effectiveness of treatment versus no treatment on seizure control and intellect, and compare the existing treatments.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-06-26 14:58:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Benign Epilepsy with Centro Temporal Spikes (BECTS) is a common epilepsy syndrome with onset in childhood which almost always remits by adolescence. It is characterised by focal seizures associated with motor signs and somatosensory symptoms, at times progressing to become generalised. The characteristic interictal EEG shows normal background activity with centrotemporal spikes which are more prominent in sleep. The prognosis is good though subtle cognitive impairment has been implicated. Antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment is used if seizures are frequent or occurring in the daytime.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-02-27 11:51:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>To evaluate whether or not treatment with AEDs changes the short- or long-term outcome of children with BECTS or both.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-02-27 11:51:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We searched the following databases: the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register (30 April 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, <I>The Cochrane Library </I>2013, Issue 4: (April 2013)), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 30 April 2013), SCOPUS (30 April 2013), ClinicalTrials.gov (30 April 2013) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ICTRP (30 April 2013). We also handsearched the reference lists of articles that were considered for inclusion in the review.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2014-02-27 11:51:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the use of different AEDs, or compared the use of AEDs with no treatment, or placebo in children with BECTS.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2011-12-23 02:50:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Data were independently extracted by all four of the review authors and discrepancies were resolved by discussion.

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-06-26 17:09:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There were six eligible studies but only four had sufficient data at the time of this review. The four RCTs included in this review reported on a total of 262 participants. One study, a placebo-controlled trial with a low risk of bias, found that individuals on sulthiame were significantly more likely to remain in seizure remission during the three and six months from commencement of treatment than those on placebo (3 months: RR 2.26, 95% CI 1.48 to 3.44; 6 months: RR 2.63, 95% CI 1.43 to 4.86, 66 participants, moderate quality evidence). The other three trials, all open-labelled studies, had a high risk of bias and did not show any significant differences in terms of seizure remission between AEDs. One compared levetiracetam with oxcarbazepine (3 months: RR 1.13, 95% CI of 0.93 - 1.36; 12 months: RR of 1.29 with 95% CI of 0.89 - 1.86, 39 participants, low to very low quality evidence), one clobazam with carbamazepine (4-40 weeks: RR of 1.04, 95% CI of 0.67 - 1.62; last 9 months: RR of 1.06 with 95% CI of 0.84, 1.34, 45 participants, low quality evidence), and one carbamazepine with topiramate (28 weeks: RR 1.02 with 95% CI of 0.8 - 1.3, 112 participants, low quality evidence).</P>
<P>Other outcome measures assessed included time to first seizure after randomisation which was only obtained in the sulthiame versus placebo study as a hazard ratio of 7.8 (95% CI 2.66 - 22.87). There were no significant differences between the proportion of participants who had adverse events, apart from a higher incidence of rash in the carbamazepine group (14.8%) when compared with topiramate (1.7%), or the proportion who withdrew from treatment due to adverse events, when this was reported. Two trials (carbamazepine versus topiramate, and clobazam versus carbamazepine) evaluated the effects on cognition. The studies were of low to very low quality evidence showing no clear difference in cognition at the end of the study periods between the AEDs compared. A meta-analysis was not performed as the RCTs evaluated different therapies.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-06-26 15:40:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>There is evidence from one trial reviewed that sulthiame is effective for seizure remission in the short term in children with BECTS although the precision of the effect estimate is uncertain due to its small sample size. There were no significant differences in the proportion of adverse events between treatment groups studied, including those resulting in withdrawal of treatment. There is insufficient evidence about the medium to longer term effects on seizure control, the optimum antiepileptic drug treatment and the effects of AED treatment on cognition. There is a need for more good quality randomised controlled trials to address these questions to aid the management of children with BECTS.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-02-27 11:52:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Benign Epilepsy with Centro Temporal Spikes (BECTS), also called Benign Rolandic Epilepsy, is one of the most common epilepsy syndromes in children, with an annual incidence between 6.2 and 10.7 per 100,000 children. BECTS is a well recognised seizure syndrome, with onset generally between the ages of four and 10 years (<LINK REF="REF-Luders-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luders 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>Children with BECTS have normal development, and no neurological deficits. However, as BECTS is very common, it can also coincidentally present in children with neurological problems. Seizures originate from the somatosensory and motor area in the lower rolandic region. Seizures tend to occur at night, and are brief.</P>
<P>An attack typically starts with a somatosensory aura around the mouth, with unilateral paraesthesia of the tongue and mouth, followed by unilateral twitching of face, mouth, pharynx and larynx (<LINK REF="REF-Loiseau-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loiseau 1973</LINK>). These can be associated with drooling and dysarthria. The seizure can propagate and involve the upper limb, and Todd's paralysis can follow. Consciousness is usually maintained, unless there is secondary generalisation. Secondary generalisation is rare in the day, but common at night (<LINK REF="REF-ILAE-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">ILAE 1989</LINK>). The focal onset of seizures during sleep can easily be missed. Seizures are generally brief, lasting from a few seconds to a few minutes. Seizure frequency is low and around 10% to 20% cases experience only a single seizure. However, in about 20% of cases, seizures occur frequently (<LINK REF="REF-Bouma-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bouma 1997</LINK>). Although in general children do not have long-term problems associated with the seizures, some children show subtle cognitive problems (<LINK REF="REF-Deonna-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deonna 2000</LINK>). The transient, cognitive impairment seems to correlate with epileptic activity on the electroencephalogram (EEG) (<LINK REF="REF-Massa-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Massa 2001</LINK>). Some people consider BECTS as a mild form of epileptic encephalopathy in the spectrum of Landau-Kleffner syndrome, and Electrical Status Epilepticus in Slow Wave Sleep.</P>
<P>The EEG background is normal, though slower rhythms can be seen in the same areas as spikes. The characteristic EEG shows high voltage spikes in the centro temporal region on the left, right or bilaterally. These spikes can also be seen in children with no epilepsy, and tend to disappear spontaneously. A family history of epilepsy is common, and siblings and parents can show sharp waves or focal epileptiform activity on their EEGs, indicating a genetic predisposition in these children.</P>
<P>Treatment is controversial, as the prognosis is deemed to be good. Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) may control generalised seizures, but do not always help with the focal seizures. In most children with BECTS the epilepsy will resolve, whether treated or not. By 12 years 92% of children are in remission, and by 18 years 99.8% (<LINK REF="REF-Bouma-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bouma 1997</LINK>). Many parents and children will choose not to start medication, especially if the seizures are infrequent or only occur at night. If treatment is required, most clinicians will choose carbamazepine as a first drug of choice, although clinical experience suggests that other AEDs may be effective.</P>
<P>In this review, we planned to address the following questions.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Does AED treatment make a difference to seizure remission rate and cognition?</LI>
<LI>Which AED is the most effective in controlling seizures in children with BECTS?</LI>

<P>
<B>Data analysis plan<BR/>
</B>The primary analysis was intention-to-treat, and we included all randomised participants analysed in the treatment group to which they were allocated, irrespective of the treatment they actually received. The studies were assessed as to their risk of bias according to The Cochrane Collaboration's tool. The domains assessed were: selection bias (random sequence generation, allocation concealment), performance bias (blinding of participants and personnel), detection bias (blinding of outcome assessment), and attrition bias (incomplete outcome data).</P>
<P>Clinical heterogeneity was assessed by reviewing clinical and methodological differences across trials, for example age and sex distribution, differences in seizure frequency/severity, and recruitment of participants in a general paediatric versus tertiary neurology setting. Subgroup regression analysis for heterogeneity was planned if there were at least 10 studies in a meta-analysis and the pre-specified characteristics included differences in age, drug dosages and length of treatment. The trial level treatment effect was analysed using risk ratio for dichotomous outcomes, difference in means for continuous outcomes and hazard ratio for time to event outcomes. Each estimate was presented with 95% confidence intervals. Meta-analysis was performed for dichotomous outcomes using the Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect methods, for continuous outcomes using the mean difference (MD) approach, and time-to-event data using the generic inverse variance method. In the case of missing data, a sensitivity analysis was performed for dichotomous outcomes where 'best-case' and 'worst-case' scenarios are considered with calculation of their respective relative risks.</P>

<P>The literature search of the databases retrieved 77 references as follows: 19 from the Cochrane Epilepsy Group's Specialized Register, 29 from CENTRAL, 19 from MEDLINE, seven from SCOPUS, two from Clinical Trials, and one from WHO ICTRP. After eliminating duplicates, we found nine references to six studies that met our inclusion criteria. Out of these six studies, two studies were categorised as "awaiting further classification" and will be reviewed at the next update if sufficient information is obtained. Both these studies, <LINK REF="STD-Bourgeois-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bourgeois 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Pelliccia-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pelliccia 2006</LINK>, were published abstracts which appeared suitable for inclusion. However, the information given was limited and the studies were not subsequently published as full-length original articles. We contacted the authors for information about the study methodology and patient information required for this review but did not receive a reply. We intend to contact the authors before the next update of this review. This gave a total of four RCTs for inclusion in this present review with a total of 262 participants treated with six different AEDs, which were clobazam, carbamazepine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, sulthiame, and topiramate.</P>

</P>
<P>Andrade 2009 was a randomised, open-label, parallel trial of 45 children with a diagnosis of BECTS following the clinical and electrographical criteria of the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) (<LINK REF="REF-ILAE-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">ILAE 1989</LINK>). Children with six seizures per month or those in whom there was parental anxiety necessitating treatment were included. Exclusion criteria included children with metabolic conditions; those with a specific neurological diagnosis different to BECTS; pseudoseizures; patients on psychotropic medication; patients with active infection or cancer; and patients in whom previous treatment with either clobazam or carbamazepine was discontinued due to an adverse event (AE). Patients were randomised to treatment with either clobazam or carbamazepine. The study duration was 96 weeks, with an initial six weeks when medication was gradually increased, followed by 90 weeks on a maintenance dose. Patients were randomised to either receive clobazam with a starting dose of 1 mg/kgm/day, increased as tolerated to a maximum of 2 mg/kgm/day, or carbamazepine starting at 10 mg/kgm/day divided in three doses, and increased up to a maximum of 30 mg/kgm/day. Doses were reduced in the presence of non-tolerable adverse effects. There were no significant differences in age or weight between the two groups. The criteria for exit from the study included patients on the maximum dosage without control of seizures, inability to tolerate the lowest dose required, recurrence of seizures after reducing the dose because of side effects, or patients/families wishing to discontinue the study. Non-adherent patients also had the doses of the treatment drug gradually reduced until discontinuation after four weeks. Forty-five patients (31 male, 14 female) were eligible but two were not randomised for reasons that were unclear. One of the patients randomised to clobazam, and three patients randomised to carbamazepine did not complete the study. Outcomes reported included seizure freedom during the first four weeks, between week four and week 40, and at nine months of treatment. Other outcomes were the number of patients with a reduction in seizure frequency of 50% or more at four weeks, adverse events, educational, neuropsychological, and behavioural assessments, and satisfaction with treatment.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Coppola-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Coppola 2007</LINK>
</P>
<P>Coppola 2007 was a randomised, open-label, parallel, multicentre group trial involving 39 children. The inclusion criteria were patients between three and 12 years of age with a new diagnosis of BECTS according to the ILAE classification and who had not been previously treated. All participants had frequent or recurrent partial motor seizures, with or without generalisation during wakefulness in the last six months, an EEG consisting of focal or multifocal centrotemporal spikes increasing in frequency during sleep with normal background activity, and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with normal or slightly abnormal findings, and no neurological or mental deficits. Exclusion criteria included: poor compliance by parents/caregivers in keeping records of seizure frequency; adverse events or in undergoing requested clinical controls; progressive neurological and/or systemic disease; and associated pseudoseizures. Patients were seen every three months prior to randomisation for recording of awake and sleep EEGs, monitoring of drug levels, haematological, renal and liver function tests. Randomisation to levetiracetam or oxcarbazepine monotherapy was performed and the dose initiated at 5 mg/kg/day, followed by titration at 5 mg/kg every three days up to a dose of 20 mg/kg/day according to tolerance. Additional increments were allowed up to 30 mg/kg once or twice daily for levetiracetam and 35 mg/kg once or twice a daily for oxcarbazepine. From additional data supplied by the authors, two participants (one from each group) were lost to follow-up after three months without any specified reasons, but they did not have any seizures during the treatment period. These patients' data were imputed as seizure occurrences by the authors. Patients were followed up for a mean period of 18.5 months (range three to 24 months). Outcomes reported were the percentage of patients with complete seizure freedom after the follow-up period (mean time of 18.5 months, range 12 - 24 months), and adverse effects of drug treatment. The authors provided us with details regarding the proportion of patients who were seizure free three and 12 months after randomisation.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Kang-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kang 2007</LINK>
</P>
<P>Kang 2007 was a randomised, observer-blinded, open-label, parallel, multicentre trial of 112 patients. Participants, aged between five to 15 years old, were eligible if they had clinical and EEG findings compatible with benign rolandic epilepsy, at least two partial-onset seizures during six months at baseline, a normal MRI which confirmed the absence of a progressive lesion, and at least one of the following criteria: parent and/or patient wanted to take AEDs; daytime seizures; one or more episodes of a convulsive seizure during six months. Amongst the exclusion criteria were patients previously on topiramate or carbamazepine; cognitive impairment interfering with the cognitive testing procedure; history of poor compliance with AED treatment or inability to maintain a seizure calendar. The study included a baseline phase of six months followed by a one week screening phase during which eligibility was determined. The AED doses were then escalated to the minimum target doses over a period of four weeks. Topiramate was introduced at a dose of 12.5 mg/day with the minimum target dose of 50 mg/day in patients &lt; 30 kg and 75 to 100 mg/day in patients &gt; 30 kg. Carbamazepine was started at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day and the minimum target dose was 20 mg/kg/day. Additional dose increments were allowed up to a maximum of 4 mg/kg/day for topiramate and 30 mg/kg/day for carbamazepine until 22 weeks. The drugs were maintained at a stable dose until completion of the study at 28 weeks. Patients in both groups were similar with regard to known prognostic factors. Thirteen participants dropped out from the topiramate group (six due to adverse effects, seven due to non-drug-related causes) and 11 from the carbamazepine group (five due to adverse effects, six due to non-drug-related causes). For patients who withdrew early from the study, the last observation reported was carried forward in the analysis. The primary study objective was to evaluate cognitive and behavioural effects of these AEDs by measuring changes in neuropsychological test batteries and behaviour-rating scales performed at baseline and 28 weeks after treatment. Data regarding treatment-emergent adverse effects and the percentage of patients who were seizure free after 28 weeks were recorded. This study was supported by a grant of Janssen, Korea Limited, manufacturers of topiramate.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Rating-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Rating 2000</LINK>
</P>
<P>Rating 2000 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicentre trial of 66 patients with a diagnosis of BECTS. The case definition was not specifically defined. All patients were between three and 11 years of age, weighed 10 to 50 kilograms, and had experienced two or more seizures six months prior to the study admission. Amongst the exclusion criteria were patients with severe organic diseases; a history of mental illness; relevant hypersensitivity; or relevant renal, thyroid, or hepatic dysfunction; as well as those who had prior treatment for epilepsy after the sixth month of life. Eligible patients were randomised to receive either sulthiame or a placebo. The study consisted of a six-month historic baseline period and a six-month double-blind treatment phase. The dose of sulthiame was approximately 5 mg/kg/day in three divided doses and this was given without titration. Patients in the treatment and control groups were similar with regard to known prognostic factors. Both the recipients and assessors were blinded. Two patients withdrew from the sulthiame group whilst four withdrew from the placebo group. Two from the placebo group withdrew within the first week due to parental wishes and in four patients (two from each group), the trial was terminated in advance after a planned adaptive interim analysis demonstrated superiority of the intervention. This analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis after 60 patients had completed the trial with an alpha value of 0.05 and P values of &lt;= 0.0299 or &gt; 0.3. The missing data were imputed as seizure reoccurrences. On top of this, four patients from the sulthiame group and one patient from the placebo group had final data from the last visit assessed just days prior to the end of the experimental period. These patients were seizure free but their data have also been imputed as seizure occurrences by the authors. Outcomes reported were 1) the treatment failure events (TFEs) during the period of the trial, defined as first seizure after a seven-day run-in period post randomisation, intolerable adverse events, development of another epileptic syndrome, and termination from the trial by their parents or themselves, and 2) changes in EEG recordings over time.</P>

<P>The overall risk of bias in three of the four included studies for the outcomes of seizure remission, adverse effects and cognition was judged to be high. Only one of the three included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Rating-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Rating 2000</LINK>) was found to have a low risk of bias for the outcomes of seizure remission and adverse effects. Although there was an adequate method of randomisation described, the results in the <LINK REF="STD-Coppola-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Coppola 2007</LINK> study showed that the ages at seizure onset and at randomisation were greater in those receiving levetiracetam (mean age of 10.5 years) than oxcarbazepine (mean age of 8.4 years) probably due to the small sample size. This could lead to an overestimation of the effects of levetiracetam on seizure remission.</P>

<P>There was one study (<LINK REF="STD-Andrade-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Andrade 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Effects on seizure remission from 4 - 40 weeks after randomisation: 12 (66.7%) of 18 patients treated with clobazam were seizure free during this period compared with 16 (64%) of 25 patients treated with carbamazepine, giving an RR (relative risk) of 1.04 with 95% CI of 0.67 - 1.62.</P>
<P>Effects on seizure remission in the last nine months of the study period (total 96 weeks): 16 (88.9%) of 18 patients treated with clobazam had no seizures during this period of the study compared to 21 (84%) of 25 patients treated with carbamazepine, giving an RR of 1.06 with 95% CI of 0.84 - 1.34.</P>
<P>Time to first seizure after randomisation was not reported as an outcome in this study.</P>

<P>Adverse effects of medication:three (16.7%) of the 18 patients on clobazam and eight (32%) of the 25 patients on carbamazepine reported 35 and 76 different adverse effects respectively. For clobazam and carbamazepine groups respectively, these include vertigo (16.7% vs. 20%), headaches (11.2% vs. 20%), somnolence (16.7% vs. 12%), nausea/vomiting (16.7% vs. 12%), diarrhoea (5.6% vs. 4%), tremor (16.7% vs. 4%), and fatigue (16.7% vs. 8%). One patient each from the clobazam (5.6%) and carbamazepine groups (4%) withdrew from the study due to rash and somnolence respectively.</P>
<P>Effects on cognitive functioning: Neuropsychometric evaluation was performed using the Weschler intelligence scale for children at baseline and at the end of the study. The numbers of patients categorised as having no, mild, moderate or severe learning difficulties were reported at both time points though three patients in the group assigned to carbamazepine did not have an evaluation. At baseline, there were three (16.7%) of 18 patients in the clobazam group with moderate to severe learning difficulties and three (14.3%) of 21 in the carbamazepine group. This difference was not significant (Mann Whitney test, p=0.4). There was no significant difference observed at the end of study between groups, although an improvement was noted: none of 17 patients assessed in the clobazam group assessed and one (4.8%) of 21 patients in the carbamazepine group were shown to have moderate to severe learning difficulties.</P>

<P>Adverse effects of medication: six (10.3%) of the 58 patients treated with topiramate and five (9.3%) of the 54 patients treated with carbamazepine discontinued medication because of adverse effects. The adverse effects in the six on topiramate were anhidrosis (3), anorexia (1), enuresis (1), and rash (1), whilst the adverse effects in the five on carbamazepine were rash (4) and tiredness (1). Amongst all 58 patients treated with topiramate, seven had somnolence, three anhidrosis, two psychomotor slowing, two anorexia, two gastrointestinal disturbance, two paresthesia, and one each had dizziness, tiredness, enuresis, and rash. Amongst all 54 patients treated with carbamazepine, eight had a rash, five somnolence, five tiredness, five increased appetite, and one dizziness.</P>
<P>Effects on cognitive functioning: a neuropsychological test battery consisted of Bender Gestalt Test (BGT) and KEDI-WISC (Korean Educational Developmental Institute &#8211; Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children), the Korean version of WISC-R. Eighty eight patients completed the trial and had neuropsychological testing; 45 in the topiramate group and 43 in the carbamazepine group.The results were reported as either an improvement or a worsening of scores from baseline to end point with comparisons made between topiramate and carbamazepine. Statistical analyses was made using the Student's t-test to compare changes over time for the two treatment groups. The authors reported p values and 95% confidence intervals based on the t-distribution and pooled estimate of variance. Although there were negative and positive trends in the cognitive variables measured for the two AEDs, only two out of twelve subtests showed statistical significance. The arithmetic subtest showed more deterioration in those on topiramate (p = 0.037; 95% CI: 0.07&#8211;2.12) whilst the maze test showed a greater improvement in those on carbamazepine (p = 0.026; 95% CI 0.20-3.10). When the 30 patients on topiramate and the 40 on carbamazepine who had maintained the minimum target doses were compared, the scores were similar between the two groups, with only object assembly showing statistically significant improvement in those on topiramate compared to worsening scores in those on carbamazepine (p=0.006; 95% CI: 0.20-4.10).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2014-06-26 17:47:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Despite the fact that BECTS is one of the most common epilepsy syndromes in school-aged children, we found only four RCTs suitable for our analysis containing 262 participants.</P>
<P>All four RCTs in this review used different methodologies. The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low quality. Only the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Rating-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Rating 2000</LINK> was judged to be of a sufficient quality. However, the weakness in <LINK REF="STD-Rating-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Rating 2000</LINK> was its small sample size (66 patients) which affects the precision of the result. The other three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Andrade-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Andrade 2009</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Coppola-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Coppola 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kang-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kang 2007</LINK>) did not have or report allocation concealment and were not double-blinded. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Andrade-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Andrade 2009</LINK> had a small sample size (43 patients) and was an open-label unblinded trial with some inaccuracies in the reporting. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Coppola-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Coppola 2007</LINK> had a small sample size (39 patients) and was an open-label unblinded trial without a fixed follow-up period. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Kang-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kang 2007</LINK> was an open-label, observer-blinded study with a high drop-out rate. All three trials compared different AED treatments. Due to the varying treatments and methodologies, a meta-analysis could not be performed.</P>
<P>After extracting the required data, the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Rating-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Rating 2000</LINK> comparing sulthiame with placebo found that significantly more patients on sulthiame were seizure free for three and six months after treatment compared to those on placebo. The time to first seizure after randomisation was also longer for patients on sulthiame. Sulthiame was well tolerated with no significant difference between sulthiame and placebo for withdrawal due to adverse effects.</P>
<P>The other three trials comparing carbamazepine with clobazam, levetiracetam with oxcarbazepine, and topiramate with carbamazepine, were of a low to very low quality. The wide confidence intervals in the point estimates for seizure remission show that there is insufficient information about the superiority of the AEDs compared. The effects on cognitive functioning were assessed in the trial between topiramate and carbamazepine and in the study between carbamazepine and clobazam. In the former, this found changes in a few subtests to be significantly worse in those on topiramate but outcomes were similar when only individuals on minimum target doses were compared. This study did not report the actual differences between the neuropsychometric scores. In the latter study, there was no significant difference found between the groups in the moderate/severe categories of learning disability and neuropsychometric scores were not reported.</P>
<P>The assessment of adverse events reported whilst on AEDs taken from RCTs alone, as performed in this review, does not provide a comprehensive range of adverse events especially those that may be rare but important. The possibility of AEDs resulting in worsening of seizures was not examined in this review. Reliable data about cognitive effects is currently lacking. When considering the cognitive effects in BECTS, it would be useful to assess data from studies which compare no treatment/placebo with an effective AED. There was a lag-time of more than one year between the search date and the publication of the review. This may introduce some bias as there may be additional studies not included in this review. However, it is our aim to perform frequent updates as we expect an increase in research in this area in the coming years.</P>
<P>In summary, there is some evidence that sulthiame is effective in controlling seizures in the short-term in children with BECTS. However, the study had a small sample size which can affect precision of the results. Currently, use of sulthiame is uncommon in many parts of the world thus limiting its applicability. The trials which compared two AEDs did not inform us of which AED was superior as far as seizure remission in BECTS is concerned. There is still no evidence from the RCTs reviewed regarding whether choice of AED treatment in BECTS makes a difference to seizure remission in the medium or longer term. Regarding the area of cognitive effects, there is also insufficient evidence comparing those on different AED treatments and to date no RCTs have been performed comparing the effects of treatment with no treatment/placebo.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-06-26 18:33:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-06-26 17:57:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hui Jeen Tan">
<P>Treatment with antiepileptic drugs can be effective in producing seizure remission in children with BECTS and there is some evidence for remission in the short term with sulthiame. There were no significant differences in adverse effects which resulted in discontinuation of treatment. Currently, there is insufficient evidence about the use of AEDs upon which to base practice. The decisions about when to treat and which antiepileptic drugs to use need careful consideration for each individual patient and an informed discussion with parents and care-givers. Until further research is conducted, this decision should take into account the intrusiveness of seizures, whilst acknowledging the uncertainties of the effects of treatment on cognition.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-06-26 18:33:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>There is a need for good quality randomised-controlled trials to provide evidence for the optimum management of children with BECTS. Factors that reduced the quality of studies in this review included inadequate blinding of participants and/or personnel, inconsistencies in the reporting of results, large numbers of patients lost to follow-up (in one study), and small sample sizes. There are difficulties with arranging RCTs of longer duration. However, future trials could aim at measuring seizure remission in the medium term to longer term, including after withdrawal of antiepileptic drugs. Cognitive function is an important outcome measure due to the concerns of cognitive impairment with BECTS. Antiepileptic drugs can contribute positively or negatively towards cognitive performance and this effect would be best measured in placebo-controlled trials performed over a period of at least 12 months.</P>

<P>The title of the review was altered from that of the original proposal. In the protocol, we had set out to compare the use of different AEDs, or the use of AEDs and placebo. In writing the review, we decided to include studies which compared AEDs with no treatment as well. This did not alter our search methods and did not lead to the inclusion of any new study.</P>
<P>The protocol had stated that the review would include children up to the age of 12 years old who have presented with BECTS. Due to the small number of RCTs found, we decided that the criteria for the age of participants could be extended to include children up to the age of 15 years old.</P>
<P>The protocol had also stipulated that studies would be included if the case definition of participants included a history suggestive of BECTS and an EEG showing centro temporal spikes. As not all studies had a clear case definition of participants or reported compatible EEG changes, we accepted the diagnosis of BECTS made.</P>
<P>We also carried out a sensitivity analysis for dichotomous data by looking at 'best-case' and 'worst-case' scenarios and considered if missing data influenced the results.</P>
<P>We did not carry out searches on the EMBASE, Pharmline, and Micromedex databases as initially reported in our protocol.</P>

<P>Prior to the publication of this review, the literature searches were re-run (28th June 2014). One potentially relevant study was identified (<LINK REF="REF-Borggraefe-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borggraefe 2013</LINK>). Due to time constraints we were unable to consider this for inclusion in this review version. We will address it for the next update.</P>

<P>The missing data were imputed as seizure occurrence. However, there were some inconsistencies in the reporting of numbers of patients who had dropped out. Five patients were reported to have been excluded and these were not accounted for in the groups to which they had been allocated.

<P>Comment: Even though seizure freedom was analysed on an intention-to-treat basis, there is a risk of bias with carrying forward the last observation. The significant proportion of missing outcomes compared to observed event risk would be enough to induce clinically relevant bias in measurement of seizure remission. See sensitivity analysis Table 1.</P>
<P>Quote: "none of the 25 patients that dropped out had cognitive complaints".</P>
<P>Comment: The proportion of patients who had missing cognitive outcome measures is significant and although these patients had no complaints, cognitive testing detects some of the subtle domains of cognitive function.</P>

<SUP>1 </SUP>The proportion of patients who were seizure free between 4 - 40 weeks of the trial were 64% for those on carbamazepine and 66.7% for those on clobazam. We have rounded these off to 64 and 68 per 100 respectively.</P>
<P>
<SUP>2 </SUP>The study had 45 eligible participants but two were not randomised (no reasons given).</P>
<P>
<SUP>3</SUP>The study was an open-label study. There were inconsistencies in the reports regarding the numbers of excluded subjects e.g. in the carbamazepine group.</P>
<P>
<SUP>4 </SUP>The proportion of patients who had seizure remission during the last 9 months of the trial were 84% for those on carbamazepine and 88.9% for those on clobazam. We have rounded these off to 89 and 84 per 100 respectively.</P>
<P>
<SUP>5 </SUP>The study was an open-label study. There were inconsistencies in the reports regarding the numbers of excluded subjects e.g. in the carbamazepine group.</P>
<P>
<SUP>6 </SUP>The proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse events was 4% for those in the carbamazepine group and 5.6% for those in the clobazam group. We have rounded these off to 40 and 56 per 1000 respectively.</P>
<P>
<SUP>7 </SUP>Reporting of adverse effects may have been affected as participants were not blinded. Elsewhere in the paper (footnotes of Table 1 in original paper), it was reported that five patients were excluded due to adverse events: three due to a severe rash, and two due to a combination of increasing seizures, the appearance of cognitive deficits, and reports from parents and teachers on a change in behaviour. It was not mentioned which arm of treatment these patients were randomised to, if this was done, and we were uncertain about whether they were considered to have dropped out.</P>
<P>
<SUP>8 </SUP>The proportion of patients who reported adverse events were 32% for those on carbamazepine and 16.7% for those on clobazam. We have rounded these off to 32 and 17 per 100 respectively.</P>
<P>
<SUP>9 </SUP>The proportion of patients reporting specific adverse events are listed under the subtitle Effects of Interventions in this review.</P>
<P>
<SUP>10</SUP> The neuropsychometric evaluation explain how the patients were grouped into no, mild, moderate and severe learning difficulties. Four of 25 patients randomised to carbamazepine did not have baseline evaluations which could affect the estimates of the results. The results show that three patients of 18 in the clobazam and three of 21 in the carbamazepine groups had moderate to severe learning difficulties at baseline. At the end of the trial, no patients of 17 evaluated in the clobazam group and one of 21 in the carbamazepine group had moderate to severe learning difficulties. Unfortunately, this interesting report of an improvement in cognition did not benefit from adequate reporting and there were no mean cognitive scores provided. The cause of the apparent improvement was not corroborated with seizure remission.</P>

<P>In the sensitivity analysis, "best outcome" imputes an outcome for missing data with replacement values favouring the intervention reported to have the higher relative risk of seizure remission, whilst "worst outcome" imputes values for missing data favouring the intervention reported to have the lower relative risk of seizure remission. The analysis shows that seizure remission was not influenced by the withdrawal of participants in the studies by <LINK REF="STD-Andrade-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Andrade 2009</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Coppola-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Coppola 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rating-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Rating 2000</LINK>. This was because the numbers were small and were balanced between the groups. In <LINK REF="STD-Kang-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kang 2007</LINK>, the excessive drop-out rate in this study could affect the estimate of seizure remission in the topiramate and carbamazepine groups.</P>
