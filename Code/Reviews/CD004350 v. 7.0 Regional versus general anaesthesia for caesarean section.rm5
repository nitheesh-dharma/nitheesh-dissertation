<P>Caesarean section is when a baby is born through an incision in the mother's abdomen and uterine wall. This requires effective anaesthesia which can be regional (epidural or spinal) or a general anaesthetic. With regional epidural anaesthesia, the anaesthetic is infused into the space around the mother's spinal column, whilst with regional spinal anaesthesia, the drug is injected as a single dose into the mother's spinal column. With the two types of regional anaesthesia, the mother is awake for the birth but numbed from the waist down. With general anaesthesia, the mother is unconscious for the birth with the anaesthetic affecting her whole body. As well as women having a view as to whether they might wish to be awake or asleep for the caesarean birth, it is important to know the balance of the benefits and adverse effects of these different types of anaesthesia. This review of trials sought to assess these benefits and harms. Twenty-two out of 29 included studies (1793 women) contributed data to this review. There were some differences that favoured regional anaesthesia, for example, less blood loss. The evidence on the differences in pain relief was difficult to evaluate. There were not enough participants to assess the very rare outcome of mortality for the mother, which may be an important aspect. None of the trials addressed important outcomes for women such as recovery times, effects on breastfeeding, effects on the mother-child relationship and length of time before mother feels well enough to care for her baby. As there is insufficient evidence on benefits and adverse effects, women are most likely to choose anaesthesia for caesarean section, depending on whether they wish to be awake or asleep for the birth.</P>

<P>Compared to women who had GA, women who had either epidural anaesthesia or spinal anaesthesia were found to have a significantly lower difference between pre and postoperative haematocrit. For epidural, the mean difference (MD) was 1.70% and 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.47 to 2.93 (one trial, 231 women) and for spinal anaesthesia, the MD was 3.10% and 95% CI 1.73 to 4.47 (one trial, 209 women). Compared with GA, women having either an epidural anaesthesia or spinal anaesthesia had a lower estimated maternal blood loss (epidural versus GA: standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.32 mL; 95% CI -0.56 to -0.07; two trials, 256 women; spinal versus GA anaesthesia: SMD -0.59 mL; 95% CI -0.83 to 0.35; two trials, 279 women). There was evidence of a significant difference in terms of satisfaction with anaesthetic technique -  compared with the epidural or spinal group, more women in the GA group stated they would use the same technique again if they needed CS for a subsequent pregnancy (epidural versus GA: risk ratio (RR) 0.80; 95% CI 0.65 to 0.98; one trial, 223 women; spinal versus GA anaesthesia: RR 0.80; 95% CI 0.65 to 0.99; one trial, 221 women).</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-09-03 09:02:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>Caesarean section refers to the procedure where a baby is delivered through an incision on the abdominal wall and uterus of the mother. It is often life-saving and aims to preserve the health of the mother and her baby. Although the operation has become very safe over the years, it is still associated with greater maternal mortality and morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Enkin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Enkin 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Liu-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2007</LINK>). The risk of maternal death with caesarean section is four times that associated with all types of vaginal birth, which is one per 10,000 births (<LINK REF="REF-Enkin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Enkin 2000</LINK>). It is known that there is a greater risk of neonatal respiratory distress with caesarean section than vaginal delivery, regardless of gestational age (<LINK REF="REF-Zanardo-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zanardo 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kol_x00e5_s-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kolås 2006</LINK>). This has been described as mild and transient (<LINK REF="REF-Danforth-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Danforth 1985</LINK>) however, and caesarean section is usually considered safe for the fetus. Caesarean section is often described as elective (when it is planned) or emergency.</P>
<P>The type of anaesthesia used and the care with which it is administered is an important determinant of the outcome of caesarean section (<LINK REF="REF-Andersen-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andersen 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Enkin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Enkin 2000</LINK>). Regional and general anaesthesia are commonly used for caesarean section and both have their advantages and disadvantages (<LINK REF="REF-Thorp-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorp 2009</LINK>). General anaesthesia refers to the loss of ability to perceive pain associated with loss of consciousness produced by intravenous or inhalation anaesthetic agents. For caesarean section, this involves the use of thiopentone for induction, tracheal intubation facilitated by suxamethonium, positive-pressure ventilation of the lungs with a nitrous oxide/oxygen mixture plus a volatile agent, and a muscle relaxant (<LINK REF="REF-Thorburn-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorburn 1998</LINK>). The risks include the aspiration of stomach contents, awareness of the surgical procedure (due to inadequate anaesthesia), failed intubations, and respiratory problems for both mother and baby (<LINK REF="REF-Thorp-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorp 2009</LINK>). When supplemented with halogenated volatile agents, general anaesthesia has also been associated with a greater risk of maternal blood loss compared with regional anaesthesia (<LINK REF="REF-Andrews-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andrews 1992</LINK>). However, it is a more quickly administered procedure and is often preferred in cases where speed is important (<LINK REF="REF-Thorp-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorp 2009</LINK>). Also recent studies have found no incidence of failed intubation in some large series where general anaesthesia was carried out or supervised by experienced anaesthetists (<LINK REF="REF-Djabatey-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Djabatey 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ajmal-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ajmal 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Regional anaesthesia refers to the use of local anaesthetic solutions to produce circumscribed areas of loss of sensation. The types of regional anaesthesia used for caesarean section (that is, spinal (subarachnoid) and epidural (extradural) anaesthesia) involve the infiltration of a local anaesthetic agent, usually bupivacaine, into the surroundings of the spinal cord through the lower back of the woman. With spinal anaesthesia, the drug is injected directly into the subarachnoid space while, with epidural, it is injected through a catheter that has been introduced into the extradural space (<LINK REF="REF-Thorburn-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorburn 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Spinal and epidural anaesthesia cause a substantial drop in maternal blood pressure, which may affect both mother and fetus (<LINK REF="REF-Visalyaputra-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Visalyaputra 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Macarthur-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macarthur 2007</LINK>), and may be dangerous when the woman has a bleeding complication (<LINK REF="REF-Enkin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Enkin 2000</LINK>). They are also contraindicated in women with coagulation (clotting) disorders since the insertion of the block may precipitate a bleed. They may cause a severe postdural puncture headache although the incidence of this is now reduced with the use of special needles (<LINK REF="REF-Kestin-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kestin 1991</LINK>). The advantages of regional anaesthesia include the reduction of the incidence of general anaesthetic complications and that of early bonding between the mother and the newborn, since the mother is awake during the procedure (<LINK REF="REF-Enkin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Enkin 2000</LINK>). Specifically, spinal and epidural anaesthesia are similar in their safety profiles with a few differences. Spinal anaesthesia has a faster onset of action and requires less of the drug, but causes more hypotensive episodes than epidural anaesthesia (<LINK REF="REF-Ng-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ng 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Regional anaesthesia is the preferred method for caesarean section in the United Kingdom and the United States of America (USA) (<LINK REF="REF-Gibbs-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibbs 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hibbard-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hibbard 1996</LINK>). In the USA in particular, regional anaesthesia was used for caesarean section in over 80% of cases as of 1992, regardless of the indication (<LINK REF="REF-Hawkins-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawkins 1997a</LINK>), and in over 50% of cases as far back as 1981 (<LINK REF="REF-Hawkins-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawkins 1997a</LINK>). The reasons for this trend have been attributed to the fact that maternal mortality with regional anaesthesia has been reducing steadily over the years while that of general anaesthesia remains the same (<LINK REF="REF-Hawkins-1997b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawkins 1997b</LINK>), and to the greater familiarity of anaesthesia residents with the procedure (<LINK REF="REF-Hawkins-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawkins 1997a</LINK>). However, general anaesthesia is still frequently used in some countries, also largely due to greater familiarity with it (<LINK REF="REF-Stamer-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stamer 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Furmanik-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furmanik 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ajmal-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ajmal 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>The effect on neonates is less clear with some studies showing no difference in neonatal outcome between the two groups (<LINK REF="REF-Fox-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fox 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zagorzycki-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zagorzycki 1982</LINK>) and others maintaining that neonatal outcome is better with regional than with general anaesthesia (<LINK REF="STD-Abboud-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Abboud 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ong-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ong 1989</LINK>). Most of the studies that report no difference are those done on women who had elective operations (<LINK REF="STD-Korkmaz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Korkmaz 2004</LINK>) while those done on emergencies tend to report a positive difference in neonatal outcome with regional anaesthesia compared with general (<LINK REF="STD-Dyer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dyer 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Given the benefits and risks of the different techniques, it is important to clarify what type of anaesthesia is more efficacious in terms of various maternal and neonatal outcomes for the different types of, and indications for, caesarean section.</P>

<P>BA and AL independently assessed risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We resolved all disagreements by discussion.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(1) Random sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We describe for each included study the method used to generate the allocation sequence in sufficient detail to allow an assessment of whether it should produce comparable groups.</P>
<P>We assessed the method as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="4"> (2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We describe for each included study the method used to conceal allocation to interventions prior to assignment and assessed whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, or changed after assignment.</P>
<P>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);</LI>

<P>We describe for each included study the methods used, if any, to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We consider studies to be at low risk of bias if they were blinded, or if we judge that the lack of blinding would be unlikely to affect results. We assessed blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes.</P>

<P>We describe for each included study, and for each outcome or class of outcomes, the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We state whether attrition and exclusions were reported and the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information is reported, or was supplied by the trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses which we undertook.</P>

<P>We describe for each included study how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found.</P>
<P>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (where it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s prespecified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (where not all the study&#8217;s prespecified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not prespecified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</LI>

<P>We describe for each included study any important concerns we have about other possible sources of bias.</P>
<P>We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias:</P>

<P>We made explicit judgements about whether studies were at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the <I>Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). With reference to (1) to (6) above, we assessed the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we considered it was likely to impact on the findings.  We explored the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses - <I>see </I>

<P>For included studies, we noted levels of attrition. We planned to explore the impact of including studies with high levels of missing data in the overall assessment of treatment effect by using sensitivity analysis. For all outcomes, we carried out analyses, as far as possible, on an intention-to-treat basis, i.e. we attempted to include all participants randomised to each group in the analyses, and all participants were analysed in the group to which they were allocated, regardless of whether or not they received the allocated intervention. The denominator for each outcome in each trial was the number randomised minus any participants whose outcomes were known to be missing.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2012-09-03 12:53:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>). We use fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials examined the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods were judged sufficiently similar. If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary was treated as the average range of possible treatment effects and we discussed the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect was not clinically meaningful, we did not combine trials.</P>

In the remaining five trials, two were said to have been either emergency or elective, two were emergency only and the last one was said to be for &#8216;proven uteroplacental insufficiency'.</P>
<P>Bupivacaine was used for regional anaesthesia in 17 of the trials; other local anaesthetic agents used include lidocaine, levobupivacaine and ropivacaine. For general anaesthesia thiopentone, suxamethonium and a mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen were used for induction in 15 of the trials. Five trials used thiopentone and succinyl choline. Other combinations used include thiopentone and rocuronium, propofol and succinylcholine and propofol and cis-atracurium. Six of the papers reported the use of halothane as well, six used isoflurane, another six-sevoflurane, one-enflurane and two did not report the use of any volatile agent for anaesthesia.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-09-03 12:57:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>No trial reported on maternal or neonatal deaths. This attests to the relative safety of caesarean section, especially in the countries where most of the trials in this review were conducted. Larger sample sizes would be needed to detect such outcomes but many of the included studies were underpowered. Also, as a result of the massive shift to the use of regional anaesthesia for caesarean section for maternal reasons (<LINK REF="REF-Hawkins-1997b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawkins 1997b</LINK>), it is unlikely that such studies will be performed in future.</P>
<P>From the results, epidural and spinal anaesthesia appears to be associated with less blood loss than general anaesthesia. Although this did not translate into a reduction in the need for blood transfusion, it may be clinically significant especially as anaemia is detrimental to postoperative wellbeing and healing.</P>
<P>The finding of less intraoperative pain with general anaesthesia compared with both forms of regional is not surprising as this method is characterised by the abolishment of all sensation. The time to request analgesia, an index of postoperative pain requirements, appeared longer when mothers were given epidural anaesthesia. This is probably because drugs administered into the epidural space last longer and the epidural catheter can be left in situ and topped up for several hours after surgery. However, there was a big difference in standard deviation between the epidural and general anaesthesia groups. This suggests differing distribution of data and some degree of skewing, rendering the mean difference comparisons invalid. Thus, firm conclusions cannot be drawn from these data. With spinal anaesthesia, the longer time to request analgesia was also found in one study. Despite the relatively small sample size, this is an expected advantage of regional anaesthesia as its anaesthetic effect usually persists after the surgical procedure.</P>
<P>One of the big issues in healthcare delivery is client satisfaction; only one trial reported on this and did not find any differences in satisfaction between regional and general anaesthesia. It is clear that this aspect would need to be addressed in the design of new trials. In terms of preference of the same technique again, however, based on the results of one study, women who had general anaesthesia appeared to favour it over regional anaesthesia (both spinal and epidural) for caesarean sections. The reasons for this preference could not be determined from the study.</P>
<P>Regarding neonatal outcomes, neither umbilical artery or vein pH was affected by spinal or epidural anaesthesia when the indications for surgery are not urgent. This differs from the findings of a recent meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Reynolds-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reynolds 2005</LINK>) that showed that spinal anaesthesia resulted in lower umbilical cord pH results than general, but showed no difference when epidural anaesthesia was compared with general anaesthesia. The authors however included both randomised and non-randomised trials and combined both umbilical artery and vein pH data in their analysis of cord pH. Umbilical blood sampling is one of the parameters used in defining and deciding how aggressively one should resuscitate any baby with severe birth asphyxia. Although umbilical artery pH appeared to be favoured by the use of general as compared with combined spinal and epidural anaesthesia, the differences found in this review may not be clinically significant as the mean figures were within normal neonatal limits (7.11 to 7.45). They were also well above the cut-off for defining acidosis (pH less than 7.0) (<LINK REF="REF-Stoll-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>The Apgar score is a composite measure of the clinical and cardio-respiratory status of the baby at birth. It is measured usually at one minute (to determine the extent of resuscitation required) and at five minutes (to determine the response to resuscitation and to diagnose asphyxia). Apart from a higher mean Apgar score at one minute in epidural versus general anaesthesia groups, there were no other differences in Apgar score measurements between the three intervention comparison groups. We can thus conclude that practically, one form of anaesthesia has not been shown to be superior to the other, as far as the determination of asphyxia is concerned.</P>
<P>The neonatal neurological adaptive score is an attempt to measure the neurological status of the babies on the assumption that the drugs used in inducing anaesthesia may depress the central nervous system. Overall, the results suggest that regional anaesthesia conveys a more favourable outcome than general anaesthesia, especially when babies are categorised based on a cut-off point of less than 35 and particularly when spinal anaesthesia is used. However, the study which showed a significant effect with spinal anaesthesia was a small one with 30 participants in each arm (<LINK REF="STD-Mahajan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Mahajan 1992</LINK>). Also, there was significant heterogeneity between the two studies that showed a difference in the mean score within two to four hours using epidural anaesthesia (<LINK REF="STD-Lertakyamanee-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lertakyamanee 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bengi-Sener-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bengi Sener 2003</LINK>), which could be because the former study (30 women) was much smaller than the latter (223 women). The larger study did not show a significant difference in the mean score between epidural and general anaesthesia.</P>

<P>There is not enough evidence from this review to show that either regional or general anaesthesia is superior to the other in terms of major maternal or neonatal outcomes. Thus, the choice of one over the other lies with other criteria such as estimated blood loss which appears to be reduced with the use of regional anaesthesia. This may assume greater importance depending on the context in which one is operating.</P>

<P>Bosede Afolabi (BA) selected potentially relevant trials from those identified by the search strategy and retrieved the full articles. She ensured that multiple publications from the same data set were only used once. BA and Afolabi Lesi (AL) independently assessed each trial for inclusion in the review using the information described in the section 'Criteria for considering studies for this review'. Studies that did not meet the inclusion criteria were excluded and the reason was stated in the table of 'Characteristics of excluded studies'.</P>
<P>BA and AL independently assessed the methodological quality of the included trials. Generation of allocation sequence, allocation concealment, blinding and loss to follow-up are the quality components that were used. For each trial, each quality component apart from blinding was classed as adequate, inadequate or unclear (<LINK REF="REF-Juni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juni 2001</LINK>). For allocation concealment, the letters A to D were used: where A = adequate, B = unclear, C = inadequate and D = not used. For loss to follow-up, inclusion of 90% of participants was considered adequate. Blinding was assessed using the following criteria: blinding of participants, blinding of caregiver and blinding of outcome assessment. Blinding was assessed as open or single blind. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. Where the method used was unclear, the trialists were contacted to clarify the issue. Nkihu Merah (NM) helped resolve disagreements, commented on and helped revise the draft of the review.</P>
<P>BA and AL extracted data from each included trial independently. BA entered data into Review Manager (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>). For binary outcomes we recorded the number of participants experiencing the event in each group of the trial. For continuous outcomes for each group we extracted information to allow calculation of arithmetic means and standard deviations. If the data were reported using geometric means, we extracted information to calculate standard deviations on the log scale. Medians and ranges were extracted and reported in tables. Statistical analyses were carried out using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>). Binary data were presented as odds ratio. For continuous data, we used the mean difference.</P>
<P>We assessed heterogeneity amongst trials by inspecting the forest plots and using the I-squared test for heterogeneity, where a figure greater than 50% indicates substantial heterogeneity.</P>
<P>We explored the following potential source(s) of heterogeneity using subgroup analysis:</P>
<OL>
<LI>elective and emergency caesarean section;</LI>
<LI>different criteria for the use of the terms 'elective' and 'emergency' caesarean section;</LI>
<LI>different indications for caesarean section.</LI>
</OL>
<P>After including all eligible studies in the primary analysis, we conducted sensitivity analyses for each of the quality factors, where possible, using the subgroups adequate, inadequate, or unclear. We also conducted sensitivity analyses for the different outcome criteria.</P>
