<TITLE MODIFIED="2008-07-22 09:50:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">Chloroquine as a steroid sparing agent for asthma</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Asthma can be treated with drugs which aim to reduce inflammation in the airways. Inhaled corticosteroids are frequently used, but occasionally individuals require oral steroids for adequate control. However, oral steroids are frequently associated with severe side-effects. Chloroquine has been suggested as a useful 'add-on' therapy to oral steroid treatment with the aim of reducing the dose requirement in such asthma. This review found one small cross-over study but this did not provide adequate evidence to decide whether chloroquine should be offered to reduce or eliminate oral steroid treatment. There is a need for well-designed trials addressing this question before recommendations can be made.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2011-03-09 11:15:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>For the majority of chronic asthmatics, symptoms are best controlled using inhaled steroids, but for a small group of asthma sufferers, symptoms cannot be controlled using inhaled steroids and instead continuous use of high dosage oral steroids (corticosteroids) are required. However, using high dosage oral steroids for long periods is associated with severe side effects. Steroid-sparing treatments have been sought and one of these is chloroquine. Chloroquine is an anti-inflammatory agent, also used in the treatment of malarial infection and as a second-line therapy in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis and systemic lupus erythematosus. All these diseases are associated with immunologic abnormalities hence the speculation that chloroquine might be used to control severe, poorly controlled bronchial asthma. There is a need to systematically evaluate the evidence regarding its use to reduce or eliminate oral corticosteroid use in asthma.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The object of this review was to assess the efficacy of adding chloroquine to oral corticosteroids in patients with chronic asthma who are dependent on oral corticosteroids with the intention of minimising or eventually eliminating the use of these oral steroids.</P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2011-03-09 16:41:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>The recognition that asthma is a consequence of airway inflammation has focused treatment objectives towards anti-inflammatory agents. Whilst inhaled corticosteroids are of proven benefit, there are, however, a group of asthmatics who continue to have symptoms despite high doses of inhaled steroids and require maintenance treatment with oral corticosteroids. Whilst these patients are in the minority, in the order of 1-2%, they constitute a significant number and consume a considerable and disproportionate fraction of the health care resources. Furthermore those patients are at risk from the unwanted effects of long term treatment with systemic corticosteroids. These include osteoporosis, diabetes, hypertension and neuropsychiatric disorders. As a result of this clinical dilemma there have been a number of clinical trials examining the use of 'second-line' steroid-sparing agents. The concept that these drugs may be of benefit in asthma has arisen from studies showing their benefits in other inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. Various medications have been used included methotrexate, cyclosporin, and chloroquine. Methotrexate and cyclosporin have already been the subject of a systematic review. To date, the evidence to support the use of chloroquine with chronic oral steroid dependent asthma has not been established.</P>
<P>Chloroquine is a member of the anti-inflammatory agents known as the "antimalarials" so named because this group of drugs was first applied to the treatment of malarial infection. It is also used as a second-line therapy in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis and systemic lupus erythematosus. All these diseases are associated with immunologic abnormalities hence the speculation that they might be used to control severe, poorly controlled bronchial asthma. </P>
<P>The drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are known to be immuno modulators that stabilize lysosomal membranes in inflammatory cells and act as inhibitor of phospholipase A2, an enzyme involved in the release of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids. Its anti-inflammatory properties might be a result of its ability to decrease leukotriene and prostaglandin synthesis. <LINK REF="REF-Goldstein-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldstein 1983</LINK> reported a case study which suggested that hydroxychloroquine had corticosteroid- sparing properties in the treatment of asthma. In an open study (<LINK REF="REF-Charous-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Charous 1998</LINK>) there were small but significant improvements in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> and FVC together with a decrease in mean IgE levels. The importance of IgE reduction for asthmatic patients and the mechanism by which it occurs remains to be established (<LINK REF="REF-Ruhl-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruhl 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Chloroquine is usually well tolerated and appears to have greater safety in long-term use than oral corticosteroids. The major adverse effect, whilst rare, is related to the selective accumulation of the drug in the retina which may subsequently result in irreversible, progressive visual impairment and even blindness. The risk is usually dose-related and exceedingly rare or nonexistent with doses of hydroxychloroquine of 5 to 6 mg/kg/d or less. </P>
<P>Whilst narrative reviews of the use of chloroquine in asthma suggest that it is of benefit, evidence from open and randomised controlled trials give conflicting results. To date, no systematic review has been carried out to evaluate the evidence regarding chloroquine as an adjunct to oral corticosteroids in asthma.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this review was to assess the effects of adding chloroquine to oral corticosteroids in adults with stable asthma who are dependent on oral corticosteroids.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-02-13 10:52:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>The findings of this review are limited by the paucity of data available from randomised studies. One small study (N = 9) met the inclusion criteria of the review. Whilst the population recruited to the study were not well-defined by the trialists in terms of severity or diagnosis, the concomitant therapies, baseline lung function and their need for oral steroids, indicated that they represented the target population of this review. </P>
<P>The steroid-sparing effects of gold have been assessed elsewhere in order to see whether they confer similar or improved asthma control whilst avoiding the serious side-effects associated with oral steroids (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 2000</LINK>). There has been very little recent interest in whether chloroquine offers such a role, as all the references identified were published before 1998. However, new inhaled steroids have been shown to be effective in terms of their oral steroid tapering efficacy, although the side-effect profile of inhaled fluticasone remains unclear in the long-term (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2008</LINK>). Equally, the assembled evidence in this review does not indicate whether long-term use of chloroquine is associated with side-effects, as they were not extensively reported in the non-randomised studies (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). There have been concerns that chloroquine is associated with ocular disturbances, and steps were taken in both the included and excluded trials to ascertain whether this was so (<LINK REF="STD-Roberts-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tennenbaum-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Tennenbaum 1966</LINK>). </P>
<P>In order for Chloroquine to be considered as an additional treatment to oral steroids, it must be shown to be effective over placebo in terms of steroid-tapering. Furthermore the side-effect profile of the drug should be established before its use as a possible adjuvant treatment can be recommended. Whilst further trials could be done to better establish the efficacy and safety of chloroquine, it is possible that more recent developments of potent inhaled steroids, such as inhaled fluticasone, or novel antibody treatment such as anti-immunoglobulin E (<LINK REF="REF-Walker-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 2006</LINK>) may have superceded the need for agents such as chloroquine in a steroid tapering capacity. However, for those who do not respond to any other steroid tapering agents, further trials could be warranted.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The current evidence base does not lend support for the use of chloroquine as an oral steroid-sparing agent.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further trials are necessary to establish whether chloroquine is a safe and effective steroid-sparing agent. Such trials should be adequately powered, and should take account of new, potent inhaled steroids and active concomitant treatments such as ß<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists, which may also have a steroid-sparing effect. Run-in phases should look to optimise steroid dosage rather than to stabilise it, in order to ensure that any steroid-sparing effects may be more readily attributable to the addition of chloroquine. Entry criteria should then look to exclude those patients adequately controlled without the need for additional steroid-sparing treatment. Side-effects should also be carefully monitored.</P>
