<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-02-05 16:19:01 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>Medicines are the most common intervention in most health services. People taking medicines need good quality information: to enable them to take and use the medicines effectively, to understand the potential harms and benefits, and to allow them to make an informed decision about taking them. Written medicines information is provided in some countries as a leaflet accompanying medicines, and is available via the Internet. Our review examined if written information about individual medicines can improve knowledge or attitudes, or change behaviours relating to taking a medicine. </P>
<P>The findings of this review were inconclusive for a number of reasons. First, because the included trials measured different outcomes in different ways, we were unable to combine their results. Second, these trials presented the written information for patients in different ways, and most did not design the leaflets in a way that made them easy to read. Third, in many cases trials were not clearly reported, so we do not know if they were carried out correctly. Despite these limitations several trials, while using different types of information and different measures, found written information improved knowledge. This is encouraging for people who want to learn about their medicines from leaflets. None of the studies showed that written information was harmful.</P>
<P>Future research needs to use improved methods, and needs to examine the same measures on many occasions. It is important that medicines information be well written and designed to maximise the possibility of improving knowledge. Consumers are increasingly seeking out health information, including information about medicines, on the internet, but we found no trials examining whether internet-based medicines information changed people's knowledge, attitudes, or behaviour.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2009-02-18 11:06:19 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>To assess the effects of providing written information about individual medicines on relevant patient outcomes (knowledge, attitudes, behaviours and health outcomes) in relation to prescribed and over-the-counter medicines.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-10-29 14:08:00 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, PsycINFO and other databases to March 2007. We handsearched five journals' tables of contents, and the reference lists of included studies, and contacted experts in the field. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-11-10 22:53:02 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of medicine users, comparing written medicines information with no written medicines information; or trials that compared two or more styles of written medicines information. We only included trials that measured a knowledge, attitudinal or behavioural outcome. There were no language restrictions.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-11-11 03:09:23 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently extracted data relating to the interventions, methods of the trials, and outcome measures; and reconciled differences by discussion. Heterogeneity of interventions and outcomes measured meant that data synthesis was not possible. The results are presented in narrative and tabular format.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-11-12 01:11:00 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 25 RCTs involving 4788 participants. Six of twelve trials showed that written information significantly improved knowledge about a medicine, compared with no written information. The inability to combine results means we cannot conclude whether written information was effective for increasing knowledge. The results for attitudinal and behavioural outcomes were mixed. No studies showed an adverse effect of medicines information.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-11-12 01:26:31 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The combined evidence was not strong enough to say whether written medicines information is effective in changing knowledge, attitudes and behaviours related to medicine taking. There is some evidence that written information can improve knowledge. The trials were generally of poor quality, which reduces confidence in the results. Trials examining the effects of written information need to be better designed and use consistent and validated outcome measures. Trials should evaluate internet-based medicines information. It is imperative that written medicines information be based on best practice for its information design and content, which could improve its effectiveness in helping people to use medicines appropriately.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Medicines and medicines information</HEADING>
<P>Medicines are the most common intervention in most health services. As with all treatments, those taking medicines need sufficient information: to enable them to take and use the medicines effectively, to understand the potential harms and benefits, and to allow them to make an informed decision about taking them (<LINK REF="REF-Raynor-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raynor 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Evidence-based policy and practice in providing written medicines information (WMI) for patients is a priority for several important reasons. As a European Commission statement (<LINK REF="REF-EC-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">EC 2003</LINK>) noted: "People are demanding and using health information on an unprecedented scale&#8230;linked to a change from the individual as a passive recipient of healthcare and advice, to that of a more empowered and more proactive consumer of healthcare. The aim should be to provide a realistic and practical framework for the provision of information to patients on medicines."</P>
<P>It is estimated that around half of all patients do not take medicines as prescribed (<LINK REF="REF-Haynes-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haynes 2008</LINK>), leading to wasted resources and sub-optimal health care. Concern with medicine non-compliance was the main stimulus in the 1970s and 1980s for research into patient information needs, and the development of a range of information materials to meet these needs. The assumption was that simply increasing patients' knowledge of treatment would be an effective means of reducing non-compliance, as evidenced by Ley's review (<LINK REF="REF-Ley-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ley 1988</LINK>). More recently, an understanding of the complexity of factors underlying patients' use of medicines has developed. It is now recognised that in many cases non-compliance is intentional rather than the result of ignorance, the inability to recall the information, or a misunderstanding (<LINK REF="REF-RPSGB-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">RPSGB 1997</LINK>). It also appears that self-regulation of medicine-taking by patients is frequently not shared with doctors (<LINK REF="REF-Lowe-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lowe 2000</LINK>). Increasingly, patients are recognised as active managers of their own health care, and need to be able to make reasoned decisions about medicine taking in accordance with wider goals and aspirations (<LINK REF="REF-Donovan-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donovan 1992</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Evidence base and legislation</HEADING>
<P>Along with developments in the understanding of patients' use of medicines, legislation and guidelines linked to WMI have emerged in the developed world since the 1990s (<LINK REF="REF-Raynor-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raynor 2003</LINK>). Different models have been developed, notably in Europe, the US and Australia. European Union (EU) legislation introduced in the 1990s and fully implemented in 1999 requires that a comprehensive medicines information leaflet for patients be supplied inside the pack of every medicine (<LINK REF="REF-EC-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">EC 1992</LINK>). The leaflets defined by this law are written and supplied by the manufacturer, according to the detail of the legislation, and delivered as a package insert. A key feature of these leaflets is that all information in the Summary of Product Characteristics (intended for health professionals) must be included in the patient leaflet, but in a form comprehensible to the patient. Thus, all warnings, precautions and contra-indications must be included in the leaflet. The result is often a small, thin, folded leaflet, dense with information. More recently, studies have shown that people do not feel that the leaflets meet their needs (<LINK REF="REF-Consumers-Assoc-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Consumers Assoc 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Raynor-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raynor 2004</LINK>), and most patients do not read the leaflet after the first time of being prescribed a medicine (<LINK REF="REF-Raynor-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raynor 2007a</LINK>). A subsequent EU Guideline on readability of the leaflets (<LINK REF="REF-EC-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">EC 1998</LINK>) included recommendations on describing the risk of side effects, and what to do about them, which have since been shown to be ineffective and possibly detrimental (<LINK REF="STD-Berry-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Berry 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Berry-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Berry 2004</LINK>). Importantly, the Guideline for the first time recommended testing leaflets with patients.</P>
<P>In Australia, law requires that a manufacturer's leaflet is available with all new medicines. A collaborative approach was adopted in the development of the regulations. The leaflets are computer-generated in the pharmacy and can run to five pages (<LINK REF="REF-Parker-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2001</LINK>). In the US a voluntary system has prevailed since the 1970s, despite pressure from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and consumers (<LINK REF="REF-Nightingale-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nightingale 1995</LINK>). The leaflets are again computer-generated, but are, at one page long, generally briefer than those produced in Australia and Europe. FDA-funded research across eight US states has given the best overview of any of the national initiatives (<LINK REF="REF-Svarstad-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Svarstad 2003</LINK>). In 1996 the US legislated a target for the provision of 'useful written information' to 95% of people receiving new prescriptions, by 2006 (<LINK REF="REF-Congress-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Congress 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steering-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steering 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>The legislated format is not the only form of information about individual medicines available to (and used by) patients (<LINK REF="REF-Raynor-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raynor 1998</LINK>). Patients may be given additional written information by health professionals, or may access it themselves from other sources including the internet (<LINK REF="REF-Dickinson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickinson 2003</LINK>). Our aim was to include research on all such sources of information about individual medicines in the review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Right to information and concordance</HEADING>
<P>Health policy priorities generally aim to develop higher quality and more responsive services, where patients' wishes and autonomy are respected (<LINK REF="REF-NHS-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHS 2000</LINK>). More pragmatically, they also aim to increase efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Providing good quality information about medicines is a prerequisite for informed consent to treatment. It is also seen to underpin genuine choice of treatment for patients and active involvement in managing illness. This characterises the concordant (or partnership) model of medical consultations (<LINK REF="REF-RPSGB-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">RPSGB 1997</LINK>). Concordance aims to achieve a shared understanding between the patient and prescriber on treatment choices. Patients may be more likely to take medicines when they have been actively involved in treatment decisions. However, there is no evidence that written information alone will increase compliance in long-term therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Raynor-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raynor 1998</LINK>). Increased knowledge about medicines may support patients' decisions not to take them, as well as to accept them. The goal of concordance is not primarily to increase compliance (though this may be an outcome), but rather to improve the quality of health care by achieving mutual understanding between patients and prescribers, enabling patients to take a more active part in decisions about treatment and illness management when they wish to do so.</P>
<P>A review of existing leaflets revealed many to be medico-centred and biased toward the biomedical model of illness (<LINK REF="REF-Dixon_x002d_Woods-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dixon-Woods 2001</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Coulter-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coulter 1999</LINK> noted that patients expressed a need for information about: what was wrong; the justification and outcomes of tests and treatments; likely illness prognosis; promotion of self care; awareness of services and self-help support; coping strategies; informing others; legitimising help seeking; how to access further information; as well as reassurance. Mental health service users have expressed the need for information in order to understand what medicines they are taking and why, how the medicines act, as well as possible side effects of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 1998</LINK>). This review sought to cover all such eligible research that focuses on patient outcomes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">New methods of information delivery</HEADING>
<P>The impact of medicines information produced electronically is starting to be felt. In Australia and the US computer-generated information in the pharmacy is the mainstay and consumers can also now access both official and unofficial information from the internet. In the UK many mandatory leaflets can be viewed online (at <A HREF="http://www.emc.vhn.net">www.emc.vhn.net</A>), and new internet-based medicine 'leaflets' called Medicine Guides have been piloted (<A HREF="http://www.medicines.org.uk">www.medicines.org.uk</A>). Computer-generated leaflets are promoted as advantageous in terms of being easily updated, individualised and made usable for people with special needs. Any eligible research of electronically generated information about individual medicines was to be included in this review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Secondary research evidence</HEADING>
<P>This review is based on a larger systematic review of the role, value and effectiveness of WMI for patients which was published as a Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Report (<LINK REF="REF-Raynor-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raynor 2007b</LINK>). A Cochrane review by Haynes and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Haynes-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haynes 2008</LINK>) on interventions to improve adherence to medication included WMI interventions, but only in a much wider context. The reviews by Buck (<LINK REF="REF-Buck-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buck 1998</LINK>) and Koo (<LINK REF="REF-Koo-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koo 2003</LINK>) are also relevant to this topic, but neither examines the effectiveness of information provision. Over the last 20 years, a number of non-systematic reviews including policy-related documents (<LINK REF="REF-Consumers-Assoc-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Consumers Assoc 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Detmer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Detmer 2003</LINK>) have been conducted. Each tends to provide detailed information about specific aspects of providing written information about medicines, including the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Psychological approaches (<LINK REF="REF-Ley-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ley 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wright-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 1999</LINK>), impact on knowledge and compliance (<LINK REF="REF-Morris-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 1979</LINK>), electronic generation (<LINK REF="REF-Kenny-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kenny 1998</LINK>), graphical representation (<LINK REF="REF-van-der-Waarde-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Waarde 1993</LINK>), user testing (<LINK REF="REF-Sless-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sless 2001</LINK>), information design (<LINK REF="REF-Hartley-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hartley 1994</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Particular professional perspectives, such as nursing and pharmacy (<LINK REF="REF-Arthur-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arthur 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Aslani-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aslani 2000</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Wider health information (<LINK REF="REF-Detmer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Detmer 2003</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>None of this research, however, brings together these separate elements to draw general conclusions about the provision of WMI. This was the aim of the current review.</P>

<P>We included trials involving patients of any age who had received written information about a prescribed or over-the-counter medicine, including hospital in-patients and out-patients, or those who received their prescription in primary care. We would also include trials where patients received their medicine from sources other than a pharmacy, such as via the internet, since this increasingly reflects trends in provision. Trials were included regardless of whether or not patients were using a medicine for the first time. We took care to report the context of each trial, particularly in relation to patients included or excluded from participation.</P>

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2009-02-18 11:07:27 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>We included trials of interventions using written information about an individual medicine, such as information contained in a medicine pack insert or a supplementary leaflet intended for the medicine user. We would also include non-print written information about an individual medicine, such as information contained on websites. The (often mandatory) information on dosage and warnings that normally appear on medicine labels were not the focus of the review.</P>
<P>We excluded trials of:</P>
<UL>
<LI>interventions where medicines information was not the main focus of the intervention,</LI>
<LI>information provided that aimed to help a patient choose between two or more medicines,</LI>
<LI>information provided to a patient in the form of an individualised illness management plan, and</LI>
<LI>information intended to assist doctors or others to prescribe medicines.</LI>
</UL>
<P>We slightly revised the approach we had outlined in the protocol for this review, and instead interpreted 'medicines information' as information fulfilling at least one of the five European Union requirements of mandatory leaflets supplied with medicines (<LINK REF="REF-EC-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">EC 2004</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>What the medicine is and how it works,</LI>
<LI>Before taking the medicine (contraindications and precautions),</LI>
<LI>How to take the medicine,</LI>
<LI>Possible side effects,</LI>
<LI>How to store the medicine.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The information might have been given to the patient in isolation, or as one component of a more complex intervention. However, for a trial to be included in the review, it had to be possible to separate the effect of the written information from that of the other intervention(s).</P>
<P>Throughout the review we use the term 'spoken information'. Trials and other publications in this area variously use the terms 'oral information', 'verbal information' and 'spoken information' to describe information communicated other than in a written form. The term 'verbal information' is potentially confusing because it is used in some WMI research to describe information presented using words (rather than numbers). In the interest of clarity the term 'spoken information' is used throughout this review to describe information communicated other than in a written form, and 'verbal information' to describe the information presented using words (rather than numbers).</P>

</UL>
<P>We acknowledge that increased knowledge about the medicine does not automatically mean the patient is more likely to take the medicine; indeed an effect in the opposite direction is possible.</P>
<P>The reporting of adverse events was also relevant, given that the WMI might include information on potential side effects of the treatment, and this might have an effect on symptom recognition, classification and reporting by patients.</P>

<P>Terms from the strategy developed by the Review Group Trials Search Coordinator for searching the Specialised Register were used as the basis of an MEDLINE (Ovid) search strategy for the review, which was amended following publication of the protocol. Search terms from another review (<LINK REF="REF-Forster-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forster 2001</LINK>) were added and a comprehensive search strategy, using a mixture of thesaurus terms and keywords, was developed iteratively in MEDLINE. We scrutinised the results of preliminary searches and the title, abstract and MeSH terms from relevant papers were used to improve the search strategy.

<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-02-18 11:37:01 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Selection of studies</HEADING>
<P>One review author (PS) conducted the search and a second author (DJN) initially screened the studies, by titles and abstracts only for possible inclusion. The full text versions of all possibly-relevant studies not excluded at this stage were independently assessed by two review authors (DJN and PK). Agreement on inclusion of all studies was reached via consensus.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Data extraction and management</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors (DJN and PK) independently extracted data from included studies using a standardised data extraction form, reconciling differences by discussion. We sought missing data and clarification of methods and results from study authors, as well as copies of the written medicines intervention (if it was not published). Data were entered into RevMan by one review author (DJN) and checked by a second review author (PK). When a review author was also author of an included study, the other review author extracted data with a third party.</P>
<P>Studies were combined according to the difference between the interventions compared: specifically trials comparing the effect of WMI against no WMI, and trials comparing the effect of different ways of providing WMI content. We present a structured narrative review of the studies.</P>
<P>We had intended to conduct subgroup analyses looking at preventive and treatment medicines, different population groups and the quality of the information intervention if possible. We had also intended to assess the quality of the WMI intervention using a validated rating scale, if available, and to conduct sensitivity analyses based on the intervention quality. These were not possible due to a lack of comparable studies or data.</P>
<P>Methods of data combination are presented at <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK> for application in a future update of the review, if possible.</P>
<P>When P values were not reported and the raw data were available, a Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test of association was conducted, using software data available from http://www.quantpsy.org. We used the same method when we aggregated data from studies. For example, in trials with a 2x2 factorial design with four intervention groups where participants received both written information or not, and spoken counselling or not; we aggregated over those receiving spoken counselling or not, for the purpose of the analysis. We then recalculated the P values using the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test. Aggregation assumes that there is no interaction between the two variables. In the case of the two relevant trials, in <LINK REF="STD-Peveler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Peveler 1999</LINK> no interaction calculation is reported, and in <LINK REF="STD-Little-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Little 1998</LINK> the two variables interact on some of the outcome measures and not on others.<BR/>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Assessment of methodological quality of included studies</HEADING>
<P>We assessed methodological quality in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2006</LINK>). The extent of concealment of randomisation (allocation) was the key methodological quality assessment, since this has been shown to influence the reported size of treatment effect (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>) and is likely to be relevant to trials of information provision. We reported whether trials adequately concealed allocation, for example by using third party randomisation. If concealment was not adequate, we noted if the method was inadequate; was not clearly reported; or if randomisation was not concealed.</P>
<P>Another key issue in assessing trial quality, that of masked outcome assessment, was less relevant to this area of research since patient and assessor masking are both difficult to achieve for the provision of written information. We recorded if the outcome assessor was masked.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Consumer participation</HEADING>
<P>The Cochrane Consumers and Communication Review Group's editorial process for the protocol involved two anonymous consumer referees, one from Australia and one from the United Kingdom. A further two consumer referees were included in the editorial process for the full review.</P>

<P>We included 25 trials. The trials were conducted in nine countries: eight in the USA; eight in the UK; two in Belgium; two in Canada; and one each in Finland, France, Hong Kong, Switzerland and Turkey. The earliest trial was published in 1972 (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1972</LINK>), and the most recent in 2004 (<LINK REF="STD-Knapp-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Knapp 2004</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>The 25 included trials enrolled 4788 participants; ranging from 34 (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1986</LINK>) to 719 (<LINK REF="STD-Gibbs-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Gibbs 1989</LINK>). All participants were currently taking a medicine, (an inclusion criterion of this review). The overall mean age of participants, reported in 17 trials, was 43 years (16 to 88 years). In the 20 trials which reported the sex of the participants, 34% were men. <LINK REF="STD-Little-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Little 1998</LINK> enrolled only women (636), as it examined the effects of information about a contraceptive medicine. Excluding <LINK REF="STD-Little-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Little 1998</LINK> the overall proportion of men enrolled in the trials rises to 41%. Two trials reported the ethnic background of participants (<LINK REF="STD-Morris-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Morris 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vander-Stichele-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Vander Stichele 1992</LINK>). Of the 333 participants in these two trials, 69% were from a non-white ethnic group. However, none of the participants in the trial of <LINK REF="STD-Vander-Stichele-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Vander Stichele 1992</LINK> were from a non-white group. Most trials were poorly reported; the reason participants were offered particular medications could not always be ascertained.<BR/>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Trial categorisation</HEADING>
<P>We categorised the trials by their experimental intervention and comparison:</P>
<OL>
<LI>WMI compared to no WMI: this included trials of WMI versus no intervention, and WMI and spoken information versus spoken information alone.</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Information content</HEADING>
<P>The content of the written information provided in the trials was matched to the five content categories of information mandated in the EU (see <LINK TAG="BACKGROUND" TYPE="SECTION">Background</LINK>). Eighteen of the 25 trials (72%) published a full or partial copy of the WMI intervention (or later provided one on request), which allowed content analysis. In seven studies, few details of the intervention or its delivery were provided, making problematic the assessment of intervention quality. We noted a considerable amount of heterogeneity in content of the WMI; most interventions, however, included information about 'What this medicine is and what it is used for?' (19 trials); and 'Possible side effects' (19 trials). Six trials provided information pertaining to all five EU categories (<LINK REF="STD-Gibbs-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Gibbs 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peveler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Peveler 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Regner-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Regner 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Haecht-1991" TYPE="STUDY">van Haecht 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vander-Stichele-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Vander Stichele 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vesco-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Vesco 1990</LINK>).</P>

Measures of knowledge and satisfaction were often developed for individual trials and appeared to measure different components of these outcomes. Some studies reported few details of the intervention or its delivery, making problematic an assessment of intervention quality.

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Knowledge</HEADING>
<P>Most of the studies measuring knowledge did so in a way that was unique to that trial (see table <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). Findings were mixed, although most studies measuring knowledge found that either the WMI intervention increased knowledge, including recall of the information and recall of side effects, or made no difference. Twelve trials examined the effect of WMI compared to no information on knowledge: six found a statistically significant effect favouring WMI (<LINK REF="STD-Arthur-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Arthur 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Little-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Little 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Savas-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Savas 2001</LINK>); three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Kumana-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Kumana 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McBean-1982" TYPE="STUDY">McBean 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strydom-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Strydom 2001a</LINK>) did not.

In the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Gibbs-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Gibbs 1989</LINK>, more participants receiving written information gave the correct answer to questions about the medicine, for four of nine questions. Significantly more people who received no WMI knew the name of the medicine compared to those who received WMI. (These results were statistically significant). Participants receiving WMI had significantly greater awareness of side effects (aggregated over all study drugs) than those receiving nothing. In the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Pope-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pope 1998</LINK>, two of 11 knowledge outcomes were statistically significant: one favouring the written information, and one favouring the control. The trial by <LINK REF="STD-Dolinsky-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Dolinsky 1983</LINK> reported no significant difference in correct recognition of the two study drugs between those given one of two WMI interventions and those receiving no intervention, but did not report individual statistical comparisons between groups.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Recall of information about the medicine</HEADING>
<P>Four trials examined participants' recall of the information they were given about the medicine (<LINK REF="STD-Baker-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dodds-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Dodds 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Little-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Little 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peura-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Peura 1993</LINK>). The trial by <LINK REF="STD-Dodds-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Dodds 1986</LINK> found significantly higher recall among those given WMI compared with those who were not. Two studies found a significant difference for only half of the questions asked (<LINK REF="STD-Baker-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peura-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Peura 1993</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Little-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Little 1998</LINK> used a factorial design to compare the effectiveness of an experimental evidence-based summary leaflet, a standard leaflet and no leaflet, on women's knowledge of an oral contraceptive. This was in addition to an assessment of the effect of questioning by their doctor or nurse. Outcomes (measured by a validated questionnaire) were aggregated by whether or not the participants were questioned. The trial reported that recall was greater for patients given the &#8216;summary leaflet&#8217; (33%) than those given no WMI (19%), (P &lt; 0.05). However, patients given the full Family Planning Association leaflet did not have better recall than the no WMI group.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Recall of side effects</HEADING>
<P>Six trials measured knowledge about side effects (<LINK REF="STD-Baker-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gibbs-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Gibbs 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morris-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Morris 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peura-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Peura 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pope-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pope 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Regner-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Regner 1987</LINK>). Four of these trials found that patients given WMI had higher knowledge of side effects compared with those given no WMI; these results were statistically significant in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Baker-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peura-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Peura 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Regner-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Regner 1987</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Morris-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Morris 1982</LINK> found that the group given WMI were able to name more side effects at follow-up, but also named more incorrect side effects than the control group. Tests for statistical significant were not reported by this study, and there was not enough data reported to calculate P value. In contrast, <LINK REF="STD-Pope-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pope 1998</LINK> found that patients given the information sheet/leaflet listed fewer side effects (P = 0.02), although the number of correct side effects listed was not statistically significant between the two groups (P = 0.09).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Attitudes</HEADING>
<P>Three trials comparing the provision of WMI with no WMI assessed participants' attitudes towards the information given; specifically whether or not they felt satisfied with the information provided (<LINK REF="STD-Baker-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gibbs-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Gibbs 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McBean-1982" TYPE="STUDY">McBean 1982</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Baker-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 1991</LINK> examined participants' attitudes regarding the usefulness and ease of comprehension of the WMI (both groups received spoken information, with one group receiving additional WMI). Significantly more participants receiving the WMI felt it was easy to understand (84%) compared with those receiving only spoken information (33%). There was also a significant difference in perceptions of the information's usefulness: 84% receiving WMI thought it was useful or extremely useful, compared with 33% of those in the control group (P &lt; 0.001). Additionally, significantly more people receiving WMI felt that they had been given sufficient information (74%) compared with those in the control group (14%; P &lt; 0.001).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Baker-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 1991</LINK> also examined whether the provision of WMI in addition to spoken information reduced worry about drug treatment, and found a statistically significant effect: 53% of those given additional WMI reported less worry, compared to 25% in the control group (P &lt; 0.05). Participants given no WMI were more likely to feel that information about medicines given to them could be improved: 64% compared with 27% among those who had been given WMI (P &lt; 0.001). Similarly <LINK REF="STD-Gibbs-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Gibbs 1989</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-McBean-1982" TYPE="STUDY">McBean 1982</LINK> reported that participants given WMI expressed greater satisfaction with the information provided.

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Behaviour</HEADING>
<P>Eight trials assessed the effects on behaviour of providing WMI versus not providing WMI (<LINK REF="STD-Dodds-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Dodds 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dolinsky-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Dolinsky 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McBean-1982" TYPE="STUDY">McBean 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morris-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Morris 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peveler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Peveler 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vander-Stichele-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Vander Stichele 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vesco-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Vesco 1990</LINK>). Six trials examined compliance with the medicines' instructions: compliance was found to be higher among people given WMI. However no difference was found when biological markers were used to assess compliance. Three studies found that compliance was greater for those who had received WMI (<LINK REF="STD-Dodds-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Dodds 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McBean-1982" TYPE="STUDY">McBean 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1986</LINK>), although one of these studies did not report statistical tests (<LINK REF="STD-McBean-1982" TYPE="STUDY">McBean 1982</LINK>). There was no difference in compliance between the groups in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Vander-Stichele-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Vander Stichele 1992</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-McBean-1982" TYPE="STUDY">McBean 1982</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Dodds-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Dodds 1986</LINK> performed a tablet count; but <LINK REF="STD-Dodds-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Dodds 1986</LINK> also interviewed patients. <LINK REF="STD-Vander-Stichele-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Vander Stichele 1992</LINK> used a monitored dose system; while <LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1986</LINK> measured compliance as rated by the psychiatrists (based on a combination of patient report; tablet count; and clinical judgement).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Morris-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Morris 1982</LINK> examined the mean number of health problems reported by participants. They found that the group given WMI reported on average slightly more side effects at follow-up: 4.1 out of a possible 17, compared to 3.6 out of 17 for the control group. Tests for statistical significant were not reported by this study, and there was not enough data reported to calculate a P value. In the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Peveler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Peveler 1999</LINK> we aggregated the effect of information against none by combining the groups receiving counseling or no counseling. No difference was found in the self-reported continuation of the medication for those receiving written information, and those receiving none. <LINK REF="STD-Vesco-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Vesco 1990</LINK> confirmed compliance - or adherence to the treatment regime - through assayed blood levels, and found no difference between those given WMI and those not given it, although this result was not significant. The study also found no significant differences between intervention and control groups in the proportion who stopped taking their medication, but did find that significantly more people in the WMI group reported a side effect (P &lt; 0.05).</P>
<P>The trial by <LINK REF="STD-Dolinsky-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Dolinsky 1983</LINK> reported no significant difference in correct application of information about the two study drugs between those given one of two WMI interventions and those receiving no intervention, but did not report individual statistical comparisons between groups.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-02-19 09:35:32 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-02-19 09:35:32 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>Most of the 25 studies included in this review did not report their methods clearly; and where reporting was transparent, we often judged that the studies had not been conducted in such a way as to reduce bias. Several studies did not conduct statistical tests on the study results, and there was considerable heterogeneity in terms of the types of WMI interventions used and the outcomes measured. These are not necessarily barriers to meta-analysis as some heterogeneity between interventions is inevitable. The heterogeneity of outcome measures was large however, which negated the possibility of a meta-analysis. We could not combine the results of trials to determine if WMI was effective in changing knowledge, attitudes or behaviour related to medicine taking. Furthermore, a number of recent trials were not included in this review because they assessed condition-based information, rather than medicines-based information, and therefore did not meet the inclusion criteria. We found no trials that evaluated the effects of WMI on health outcomes. Despite systematic searching, we were not able to identify relevant trials published later than 2004 for inclusion. We would welcome information on trials that we may have inadvertently missed.</P>
<P>Some individual trials showed improved knowledge about a medicine for people receiving WMI compared to those who did not. For example, the trials measuring recall of information (<LINK REF="STD-Baker-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dodds-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Dodds 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Little-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Little 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peura-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Peura 1993</LINK>) tended to favour the provision of written information, as did those measuring recall of side effects (<LINK REF="STD-Baker-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gibbs-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Gibbs 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morris-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Morris 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peura-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Peura 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pope-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pope 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Regner-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Regner 1987</LINK>). In around half of the trials these results were statistically significant.</P>
<P>To determine whether one way of presenting WMI was more effective than another, we evaluated trials that compared different ways of presenting information. Again the evidence was inconclusive. One trial examining understanding of the risk of side effects found that written information provided numerically was significantly more effective than written information provided verbally (<LINK REF="STD-Knapp-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Knapp 2004</LINK>). This is consistent with the findings of a series of trials that evaluated risk descriptor information in hypothetical scenarios using homogenous interventions and outcome measures (for example <LINK REF="REF-Berry-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berry 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Berry-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Berry 2004</LINK>). These trials were not eligible for inclusion in this review, but were included in the UK Health Technology Assessment (HTA) report (<LINK REF="REF-Raynor-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raynor 2007b</LINK>), which found, contrary to EU guidance, that giving information about the risk of a side effect as a numerical descriptor was more effective than a verbal risk descriptor for improving people's understanding of the risk.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Knapp-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Knapp 2004</LINK> also found that providing information about the risk of a side effect numerically can significantly affect people's attitudes to taking a medicine. However, the overall evidence of the impact of WMI on attitudes was unclear. In addition, the general difficulty in quantifying an attitude (<LINK REF="REF-Littlewood-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Littlewood 2005</LINK>) can cast some doubt on the validity of several trials which used this as an outcome measure.</P>
<P>Five of the six trials measuring compliance found that the provision of WMI helped to achieve compliance, but the results were significant for only two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Dodds-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Dodds 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1986</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Dodds-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Dodds 1986</LINK> relied on self-reported compliance with antibiotic treatment over three to five days. <LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1986</LINK> measured follow-up of unnamed drugs for treating mental health problems for a fortnight only. It is debatable whether these findings of compliance relating to short-term medicine use can be generalised to more chronic conditions. Overall there was no strong evidence that providing WMI on its own will improve adherence to medicine instructions. Furthermore, it is important to recognise that an informed decision may lead someone <I>not </I>to take a medicine (<LINK REF="REF-Raynor-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raynor 2007b</LINK>).</P>
<P>We hoped to examine the effects of internet-based medicines information, but found no trials evaluating this form of WMI. Users of medicines have expressed the need for evaluation of internet-based medicines information (<LINK REF="REF-Raynor-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raynor 2007b</LINK>) and the lack of studies of WMI provided on the internet identifies a gap between the themes examined in reviews of medicines information and the needs of users (<LINK REF="REF-Nicolson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicolson 2006</LINK>). This evidence gap highlights the need to put the evaluation of internet-based medicines information firmly on the research agenda (<LINK REF="REF-Nicolson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicolson 2007</LINK>).</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2009-02-18 11:10:34 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>Because of the large degree of heterogeneity in the design of the interventions, the outcomes chosen and the way the outcomes were measured, we were unable to perform a meta-analysis. For example, comparing the WMI to the EU categorization, we noted wide differences in the specific content presented. This examination was further hampered by a number of papers not providing a copy of the intervention, or not adequately describing the intervention. The outcomes measured differed widely, and when trials reported the same outcome (e.g. knowledge), this was often done using a trial-specific tool. In addition to these problems, we found several trials lacked statistical tests, and provided insufficient information to enable us to perform these. Our inability to conduct a meta-analysis meant that we were unable to undertake sub-group analyses, or test for heterogeneity of the results. Future trials should use common outcomes (perhaps using standardised measures), so as to enable a quantitative synthesis. Furthermore the evaluation of interventions containing medicines information under standard headings or criteria would also enable a quantitative synthesis.</P>
<P>The overall mean age of the participants in the trials reporting age was 43 years, yet most people who take medicines long-term, and so perhaps have the greatest need for effective information, will be older. This suggests that study participants may not be representative of the target audience of WMI.</P>
<P>Some older trials in the review, particularly those comparing WMI with no WMI, might be seen as less relevant in the context of current health care. Patients can now access information about medicines and other aspects of health care on the internet, and so trials including comparison groups given no WMI are likely to be less convincing. The evaluation of WMI by trials therefore necessarily reflects the regulatory context that determines its provision. For example, in the USA, Japan, Australia, Israel, and in the EU, there are specific laws that govern the use of WMI. This presents a challenge for research: EU legislation means that research evaluating the effects of WMI compared with no WMI is no longer possible. Instead research compares the impact of presenting WMI in different formats, to evaluate their relative effectiveness. Future versions of this review will contain more trials comparing the effect of two or more formats of WMI, and it is likely that the number of included trials examining the relative effect of WMI will eventually outnumber the trials examining the absolute effect (i.e. WMI vs. nothing).</P>
<P>We also found it rare for information in the included trials to be provided in accordance with all five EU medicines information categories; only six trials provided information reflecting all five categories. The evidence has therefore largely been derived from trials examining interventions that do not reflect current standards for WMI (in the EU); for example most trials did not provide information relevant to 'before taking the medicine' or 'how to store it'. This can again be considered an historical effect, as many of the trials were conducted before this legislation was enacted.</P>
<P>Enabling medicine users to be involved in making an informed choice about taking their medicines is a fundamental principle of concordance (also known as 'partnership in medicine taking'), and promoted in policy documents across many countries; for example in the EU by <LINK REF="REF-EC-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">EC 1992</LINK>. It is disappointing then that there is no clear evidence to show the effectiveness of WMI for changing knowledge, attitudes and behaviours relating to medicine taking.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2008-11-11 20:15:17 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The conduct of the trials as a whole was poor, and this casts doubt on their results. For example only ten trials confirmed adequate blinding of the outcome assessor. Furthermore, at least three trials inadequately concealed the allocation sequence (and a further 17 trials did not report how this was conducted). Inadequate concealment is the greatest source of overestimation of treatment effects (<LINK REF="REF-Juni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juni 2001</LINK>), therefore doubt may be cast on the validity of the results of these trials.</P>
<P>The poor quality of many of the included trials has limited our capacity to provide a conclusive answer to the research question. One explanation is that this represents an historical effect, as most studies were conducted before the CONSORT statement, when there was less consensus on what constituted best practice in trial conduct.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2008-11-11 00:10:39 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are few systematic reviews relevant to the area of medicine information for consumers, with which to compare our findings. <LINK REF="REF-Haynes-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haynes 2008</LINK> evaluated interventions to help patients follow prescriptions for medicines. Of the 78 trials they included, 18 examined the provision of verbal, written, or visual material for patients. Of these, we included one which met our inclusion criteria: <LINK REF="STD-Peveler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Peveler 1999</LINK>. <LINK REF="REF-Haynes-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haynes 2008</LINK> was able to distinguish between the short-term and long-term effectiveness of different methods to improve adherence to medications; whereas we were unable to determine if written information is effective per se.</P>
<P>Our review is one component of a wider review of the role, value and effectiveness of WMI (<LINK REF="REF-Raynor-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raynor 2007b</LINK>). This review found medicine users do not value WMI as it is currently provided, and a key element in providing effective WMI is the application of the principles of plain writing and information design. Leaflets that are well written and designed, with a sound theoretical basis for their wording and design, stand a better chance of getting their message across effectively. Research is needed to determine how far information derived from these principles affects knowledge and attitudes. To date this has been the exception rather than the norm; more than half the trials included in our review had no explicit theoretical or evidence base for the design and content of the medicines information. Essentially these studies examined a stimulus-response relationship; they can show an association, but cannot explain why the design of the information was effective or not. The importance of appropriate wording and design of WMI is acknowledged by European legislation which stipulated that from 2005 medicines information had to be tested on target groups to ensure legibility, clarity, and ease-of-use (<LINK REF="REF-EC-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">EC 2001</LINK>). This paved the way for the usability testing of all medicine information leaflets (<LINK REF="REF-EC-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">EC 2004</LINK>), which affects the design and provision of WMI, as well as how subsequent research will evaluate WMI.</P>

<P>WMI should be available, not only because of legislation, but because this review has found evidence, albeit from poorly conducted studies, to show that it may improve knowledge of the medicine. Furthermore, no studies showed an adverse effect from WMI.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-02-18 18:34:24 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The review identified the need for research to assess the links between information provision, behaviour, and health outcomes. We included trials which measured a behavioural outcome, for example complying with the instructions for taking the medicine, because it is important to know whether people are taking prescribed medications as directed. However, the use of behavioural change as an outcome measure of the effectiveness of written information about medicines can be doubted. We say this for two reasons. First, the relationship between medicines information and behaviour is probably far from direct, with many potential intervening variables. Second, some of the outcomes measured may not be relevant to people taking medicines; compliance is an example, which reflects the goals of those prescribing the medicines and not necessarily the goals of those taking them. Similarly, drawing a possible link between WMI and health outcomes may be difficult to assess because of the indirect relationship, and numerous extraneous variables to be considered. Still, an aim of information provision is to improve health outcomes, albeit modified by knowledge, attitudes and behaviours. Therefore there is a need for well-designed research to examine this relationship.</P>
<P>Other research implications are as follows.</P>
<UL>
<LI>First, future trials examining the effectiveness of WMI should use consistent and validated outcome measures to enable statistical comparison between studies.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Second, future trials need to apply recognised standards to their design, conduct and reporting.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Third it may be worthwhile to define and apply an optimal length of follow-up to evaluate the effectiveness of WMI over the longer term. This is particularly important for medicines used for chronic conditions.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Fourth, there is a need for research to evaluate the effect of applying best practice in the design of the leaflet on knowledge and attitudes. In particular, there is a need to examine how understandable the information in the leaflets actually is to users.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Fifth, trials will benefit from greater input from qualitative research, to help examine the role of WMI and the value that people place on it.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Finally, more research to evaluate internet-based medicines information is needed.</LI>

<P>Analysis of outcomes will be based on intention-to-treat results where possible. A weighted mean treatment effect will be calculated across trials using Cochrane RevMan software. The results will be expressed as Peto odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes, and weighted mean differences and 95% CIs for continuous outcomes. Sensitivity analysis will be performed on the basis of methodological quality and to test for heterogeneity in the results.</P>
