<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Napkin dermatitis is a common condition that occurs in otherwise healthy infants. It causes discomfort to infants, anxiety to parents and caregivers and contributes to the load on the health care system. A large variety of napkins, both disposable and non-disposable, are available. Evidence is required to assist carers and health care workers in making informed decisions when balancing the pros and cons of different napkin choices.</P>

<P>To Assess whether disposable napkins prevent napkin dermatitis in infants.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Skin Group Specialised Register (up to June 2003), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in (<I>The Cochrane Library</I>, Issue 3, 2004), MEDLINE (from 1966 to November 2004), EMBASE (from 1980 to February 2003) and CINAHL (from 1982 to November 2004). We searched reference lists of articles. We contacted lead investigators in the area and companies that manufacture disposable napkins for access to unpublished trials. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials in which disposable napkins were compared with other types of disposable napkins or non-disposable napkins, in infants up to two years of age, for preventing napkin dermatitis.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors independently extracted data. The same two authors independently assessed trials for methodological quality. Attempts were made to contact trial authors of the trials identified for clarification of methods and results of published trials.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>We identified 28 studies of the effects of various napkin types on napkin dermatitis. Seventeen studies from nine reports were included. Eleven studies were excluded due to methodology that did not fit the inclusion criteria of this review. Due to the poor reporting of methodology and results of the studies found in this review, there were no quantitative data available for analysis (or meta-analysis). Although the included studies appeared to favour cellulose-core disposable napkins over cloth, absorbent gelling material over cellulose-only core napkins, breathable outer shell over occlusive outer shell napkins and linings impregnated with formulations over plain linings, all of these studies were open to bias due to flawed methodology. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is not enough evidence from good quality randomised controlled trials to support or refute the use and type of disposable napkins for the prevention of napkin dermatitis in infants.<BR/> </P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Definition and epidemiology</HEADING>
<P>Napkin dermatitis (also known as nappy rash or diaper rash) is a non-specific term used to describe any inflammatory eruption of the skin in the napkin area (this is the definition that will be used for the purpose of this review). Rashes in the napkin area can be classified into three main groups: </P>
<UL>
<LI>conditions that occur whether napkins are worn or not (e.g. skin conditions like epidermolysis bullosa or acrodermatitis enteropathica);</LI>
<LI>latent predisposition to dermatitis exacerbated by napkins (e.g. psoriasis, seborrhoeic dermatitis);</LI>
<LI>dermatitis directly attributable to the napkin (e.g. allergic contact dermatitis, direct irritant contact dermatitis) (<LINK REF="REF-Koblenzer-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koblenzer 1973</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>The majority of napkin dermatitis occurs in otherwise healthy children and is caused by direct irritant contact, therefore this is the group of major focus in this review.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Jordan-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Jordan 1986</LINK> demonstrated the regressive nature of napkin dermatitis, with severe rashes tending to improve and mild rashes tending to deteriorate towards the mean. This supports the need for properly controlled studies when dealing with this condition.</P>
<P>Irritant contact napkin dermatitis is a relatively modern affliction of the developed world, resulting from widespread napkin use. The use of modern day cloth napkins developed over the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and only became widespread in Europe and the USA in the early twentieth century (<LINK REF="REF-Levin-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levin 1970</LINK>). In 1963 Pampers (Procter &amp; Gamble Co, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA) was the first nationally marketed disposable napkin released in the USA, after which disposable napkin use became widespread in the USA and Europe.</P>
<P>The incidence and prevalence of napkin dermatitis varies greatly between reports, and with new developments in napkins, older studies may not reflect the current situation (<LINK REF="REF-Odio-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Odio 2000</LINK>). Clinical observation suggests that it remains a relatively frequent occurrence. <LINK REF="STD-Jordan-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Jordan 1986</LINK> reported a frequency of 50% of infants studied (but the recruitment method was unknown), with 5% meeting the criteria for severe rash, with a peak frequency at age 9 to 12 months. Their data suggested that 7% of all rash episodes were drawn to the attention of physicians. In a large population study in the UK, the incidence of any grade of napkin rash (as self-reported by mothers) in infants during the first 4 weeks of life was 25%, with 6% reporting 'very' or 'quite' bad rashes (<LINK REF="REF-Phillipp-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillipp 1997</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Causes</HEADING>
<P>Napkin dermatitis is caused by a combination of factors. Moist occlusion following urination in the napkin causes over-hydration of the skin which predisposes it to mechanical injury by increasing the coefficient of skin friction - i.e. prolonged wetness of the skin makes it more prone to damage. Skin pH is increased in the napkin area as faecal bacteria produce ammonia from urinary urea, thereby increasing skin permeability to low molecular weight irritants and increasing the activity of faecal enzymes. These factors predispose the skin to opportunistic infection by faecal microbes such as <I>Candida albicans </I>thereby causing a more severe and chronic napkin dermatitis (<LINK REF="REF-Berg-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berg 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>The vulnerability of newborn infants (especially pre-term infants) skin to mechanical injury and napkin dermatitis makes this group worthy of separate consideration. Pre-term infants have a relatively thin stratum corneum (the outermost layer of the skin), a smoother epidermal-dermal interface lacking the projections of mature skin, and a thinner, less collagenised dermis. Their skin is therefore more fragile and they have a lower threshold for irritant contact dermatitis, including napkin dermatitis (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2001</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Impact</HEADING>
<P>Although the incidence varies between populations with different environments and napkin practices, napkin dermatitis continues to be a common condition. Although it is rarely serious enough to have long-term or life-threatening effects, napkin dermatitis causes a large amount of discomfort to infants, as well as anxiety to carers and contributes to the load on the health care system.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Prevention</HEADING>
<P>Napkins that maintain normal skin pH and hydration should theoretically prevent the development of napkin dermatitis (<LINK REF="REF-Berg-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berg 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>Napkins can be categorized into two main categories: disposable and non-disposable (or reusable). Both come in a large variety of forms and new napkins continue to evolve. The basic components of napkins are an inner lining, an absorbent core and an outer shell.</P>
<P>Disposable napkins can have a variety of inner linings, with recent variants even delivering topical dermatological formulations. The core of disposable napkins was conventionally an absorbent cellulose pulp, however in the 1980s the addition of super-absorbent gel to the core has produced a new generation of disposable napkins. The outer layer can be either breathable fabric or a waterproof material (<LINK REF="STD-Odio-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Odio 2000a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Reusable napkins come in a large variety of shapes and compositions. Commonly they consist of multi-layered cloth, but varieties include cloth with a fiber-filled centre. Reusable napkins may be lined with disposable inner cloths. They may also have a waterproof shell but more commonly are covered by a waterproof over pant. A variety of pins, ties, self-adhering closures or clasps are available to secure the cloth in place.</P>
<P>Wilson and colleagues studied the effect of a wide variety of available napkins on skin hydration using adult skin and found that disposable napkins containing super-absorbent gel kept the skin driest and that conventional and reusable napkins were comparably inferior in terms of skin dryness (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 1990</LINK>). Campbell and colleagues studied a smaller variety of napkins used in infants and had also demonstrated superior dryness with super-absorbent gel napkins, as well as less increase in skin pH and less napkin dermatitis when compared to conventional and cloth napkins (<LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1987a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Other methods of preventing napkin dermatitis such as topical skin treatments, nappy-free time and frequent changing of nappies are not directly addressed in this review.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-07-24 11:32:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>The best choice of napkin for use in infants is a controversial issue. It is a commonly held belief that disposable napkins are more likely to prevent napkin dermatitis than reusable napkins, but this needs to be established. This will allow carers and health care workers to make informed decisions when balancing the pros and cons of different napkin choices. Other considerations used when comparing relative advantages of the variety of napkins available may include: accuracy of measurement of urine output, infection control, environmental and safety considerations, time and cost (<LINK REF="REF-Wong-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wong 1992</LINK>). Parents also consider convenience, napkin failure, availability of different sizes and whether the napkins can be removed by the child to be important aspects of napkin choice.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Baldwin-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Baldwin 2001</LINK> reported a randomised trial on infants evaluating the change in the severity of napkin dermatitis using a disposable napkin that had an inner lining impregnated with a petrolatum, stearyl alcohol and zinc oxide formulation compared with an otherwise identical control disposable napkin. The report also included results of studies evaluating the ability of the napkin to transfer the formulation onto infant skin and to prevent skin irritation in an adult forearm model, outcomes not relevant to this review. Children in good health who routinely used disposable napkins were recruited to the study. Children found to have severe napkin rash (as defined by appearing to require physician treatment) were excluded from the study. The recruitment method and targeted age range were not specified. The initial six days of the study, all children used the control product. Following this, 304 children were randomised with stratification by sex and severity of napkin dermatitis, with results presented for 268 of these. The children were evaluated twice weekly for four weeks and a napkin rash scale was used to record the severity of rash in four different anatomical regions. Five of the six study authors were of Procter &amp; Gamble Co.</P>

<P>Campbell and colleagues reported four separate studies (<LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1987a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1987b" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1987b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1987c" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1987c</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1987d" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1987d</LINK>) in a single report. All four studies had a similar design but it was impossible from the single report to separate the data. The studies compared the effects on infant skin condition of a variety of disposable napkins (nine in total) and cloth napkins. The napkins were grouped into categories: absorbent gelling material disposables, conventional disposables, home laundered cloth. One thousand six hundred and fourteen healthy infants (weighing 12 to 20 lbs) were recruited from the local community, assessed fortnightly for 4 to 6 weeks in their usual napkins, then placed in a test product and assessed fortnightly for 8 weeks and then followed up for a further 4 weeks of fortnightly assessments. Infants were assessed using a rash severity score by trained nurses to give an overall 'subjective rash grade'. The recruitment method and age range were not reported. The study also evaluated transepidermal water loss and skin pH, outcomes irrelevant to this review. The study authors were of Procter &amp; Gamble Co.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Davis-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 1989</LINK> performed a randomised cross-over study on 150 infants 4 to 12 months old (weighing 12 to 24lbs) evaluating the effects on infant skin condition of 4 different disposable napkins (2 containing cellulose fluff cores and 2 with cellulose fluff combined with absorbent polymers). The infants used one of the cellulose fluff napkins for one week at the beginning, middle and end of the study, and underwent two six week blocks using a randomly allocated one of the three other napkins. The assessment involved grading any napkin rash on a rating scale. Parents/caretakers were also requested to keep a daily diary. The study also gathered data on infant skin pH, transepidermal water loss and skin electrical conductance, none of which were relevant outcomes to this review. The infants were withdrawn from the study while diaper dermatitis was being treated. Two of the four study authors were of Kimberly-Clark Corporation.</P>
<P>Jordan and Blaney reported four separate studies (<LINK REF="STD-Jordan-1982a" TYPE="STUDY">Jordan 1982a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jordan-1982b" TYPE="STUDY">Jordan 1982b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jordan-1982c" TYPE="STUDY">Jordan 1982c</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jordan-1982d" TYPE="STUDY">Jordan 1982d</LINK>) in a single report. All four studies had a similar design. They were randomised studies on healthy infants 3 to 24 months age comparing cloth napkins with cellulose core disposable napkins. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Jordan-1982a" TYPE="STUDY">Jordan 1982a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jordan-1982b" TYPE="STUDY">Jordan 1982b</LINK>) were performed in the United States and compared multilayered cotton cloth napkins with plastic or rubber over pants with cellulose core disposable napkins with plastic outer shells. Results from 147 (<LINK REF="STD-Jordan-1982a" TYPE="STUDY">Jordan 1982a</LINK>) and 163 (<LINK REF="STD-Jordan-1982b" TYPE="STUDY">Jordan 1982b</LINK>) infants were reported for these studies. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Jordan-1982c" TYPE="STUDY">Jordan 1982c</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jordan-1982d" TYPE="STUDY">Jordan 1982d</LINK>) were performed in Japan and compared cloth napkins with porous water-repellent synthetic fabric over pants with cellulose core disposable napkins with plastic outer shells.

The infants in all studies were evaluated fortnightly using a rash severity score. An initial observation period of four weeks was used to evaluate baseline rash, while the infant used a 'control' napkin that was not described. This was followed by randomisation to a test product and further fortnightly evaluations for a study period of four to six weeks. The study authors were of Procter &amp; Gamble Co.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Seymour-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Seymour 1987</LINK> reported a randomised trial on infants with atopic dermatitis and infants without atopic dermatitis less than 20 months old comparing the effects on napkin rash and skin microbiology of napkins with cellulose core with and without absorbent gelling material. The studies also included a comparison with cloth napkins, however this allocation was not randomised and therefore the results of this comparison were not considered in this review. The study included 61 infants with atopic dermatitis and 57 infants without atopic dermatitis. The infants were assessed fortnightly for 6 weeks, then 4 weekly up until 26 weeks. The assessment involved one of two dermatologists grading the napkin area on a napkin rash scale and an atopic dermatitis scale. Swabs were also collected for microbiological culture, but these results were not relevant to this review. Three of the five authors were of Procter &amp; Gamble Co.</P>

<P>The results of <LINK REF="STD-Baldwin-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Baldwin 2001</LINK> were presented as mean napkin rash scores and proportion of visits with napkin rash. Mean napkin rash scores were found to be significantly reduced in the children allocated test napkins relative to those using the controls napkins. Mean rash scores were not an outcome considered in the method of this review; they are not consistently defined across studies and the data are not distributed normally. It is impossible to determine the proportion of babies with any nappy rash or with severe nappy rash from mean rash scores. The authors noted a marked variation in individual rash scores over time, further evidence that mean rash scores are not an appropriate outcome measure. Between 127 and 141 children from each group were evaluated at each visit, even though the methodology suggests each group contained only 134 children. The proportion of visits where the children were assessed as not having 'no napkin rash' was reported as being significantly less for the children allocated test napkins in three of the four anatomical areas, however actual results were only presented for two of the anatomical areas. In the absence of knowledge of how many infants from each group were assessed at each visit, and whether each individual infant had rash or not, none of these results could be presented numerically. These results must be treated with caution as they are prone to bias. No other results considered relevant for this review were reported.</P>
<P>The results of <LINK REF="STD-Odio-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Odio 2000a</LINK> were presented as mean erythema scores in the perianal and genital areas covered by the napkin. Evaluation of different anatomical areas was not described in the study methodology and results from other anatomical areas covered by the napkin were not reported.

A significantly lower mean rash score was found in the children using the test product relative to the control on almost all visits.

The results of the cloth napkin group are not relevant to this review as this group was not randomised. The ranges of percent of babies with subjective rash grade &gt; 1.0 was lower for the absorbent gelling material napkins than the conventional napkins in 3 out of the 4 studies. However, no absolute figures were reported and no calculation of statistical significance was possible. The overall subjective rash grade average (results of all studies combined graphically) was lower for absorbent gelling material napkins than conventional disposable napkins, which was reported as a significant difference, however, average rash scores were not an outcome considered in the method of this review for reasons stated above.

Follow-up was complete for 73% of the 204 infants enrolled. The results at 2, 10, and 14 weeks demonstrated higher frequency of napkin rash for infants in conventional napkins, while at 6 weeks there was a higher frequency in the absorbent gel group.

The findings in infants with normal skin demonstrated significantly lower mean rash scores in infants wearing disposable napkins with cellulose cores relative to cloth and cellulose with absorbent gelling material napkins at one of the eight grading visits.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-07-24 12:16:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>In studies comparing various napkin types for the prevention of napkin dermatitis, there will always be some limitations in methodology. For example, in a randomised controlled trial comparing cloth and disposable napkins many parents/caregivers would have a personal preference that may limit compliance and create bias. It would also be difficult to fully blind the intervention given that the parent/caregivers handle the napkins. The need for an adequate control group is important given the regressive nature of napkin dermatitis. For that reason, it would be important that an outcome measure of napkin dermatitis be fully blinded to limit any bias. Assessing napkin dermatitis in an objective way also would need careful consideration. As with any study of prevention of harm, adequate follow-up and accounting for drop outs would be necessary to remove the chance of this biasing results.</P>
<P>In general, the sub-optimal methodology descriptions, and poor follow-up and outcome data, limited the interpretation of the included studies for the purposes of this review. None of the studies gave any quantitative data comparing the study groups at baseline. All of the studies contained reasonable rash grading systems to define rash to some reproducible degree, however, averaging the results of these scores was not logical, especially as the distribution of napkin dermatitis does not follow the normal curve.</P>
<P>Due to the poor reporting of methodology and results of the studies, no quantitative data was available for analysis (or meta-analysis) in this review. This is an important point for investigators to consider when designing, implementing and reporting future studies. Although missing data was sought to improve the results available from these studies by contacting trial authors, no further data was obtained. This emphasizes the importance of reporting results thoroughly on initial publication.</P>
<P>Although the included studies appeared to favour cellulose-core disposable napkins over cloth; absorbent gelling material over cellulose-core napkins; breathable outer shell over occlusive outer shell napkins; and linings impregnated with formulations over plain linings: all of these studies were open to significant bias. Any interpretation of the results of the studies included in this review would be extremely unreliable.</P>
<P>It is particularly important to consider the possibility of publication bias, given that negative studies and results (particularly those done by companies that manufacture disposable napkins) are less likely to be published. The under-reporting of RCTs due to publication bias has been well described (<LINK REF="REF-Dickersin-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickersin 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dickersin-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickersin 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dickersin-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickersin 1993</LINK>). In a systematic review of pharmaceutical industry sponsorship and research outcome <LINK REF="REF-Lexchin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lexchin 2003</LINK> found that research funded by drug companies was less likely to be published.</P>
<P>The generalisability of the available results is also limited. Internationally there is a wide variety of available disposable napkins and an even wider variety of reusable napkins. The included studies were all performed in the USA, and although there were some Japanese data and a few European studies in the excluded studies, the majority of the literature on the topic is generated in the USA. Therefore, the results will have only a limited application internationally, where there is a huge range of napkin practices and alternative infant toileting techniques. After all, no napkin is the best prevention for napkin dermatitis.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is not enough evidence from good quality randomised controlled trials to support or refute the use and type of disposable napkins for the prevention of napkin dermatitis in infants. The implications of this for practice are that health care workers, parents and infant caregivers are left to balance the many considerations in napkin choice without this evidence.<BR/> </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>A good quality, adequately powered randomised controlled trial needs to be done assessing the use of disposable napkins in the prevention of napkin dermatitis. With the continuing evolution of disposable napkins, ongoing comparative research will be required. Outcomes in such a study would ideally include the presence and severity of napkin dermatitis as well as cost analysis, parent/caregiver satisfaction and environmental impact .</P>

<EXCLUDED_CHAR STUDY_ID="STD-Berg-1994">
<CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION>
<P>Not a randomised controlled trial. The authors reported four separate clinical trials comparing the effects on infant skin wetness, pH and napkin dermatitis of a number of disposable napkins and cloth napkins. The disposable napkins used were not described. The report did not describe any randomization, thereby excluding the studies from this review. The study authors were of Procter &amp; Gamble Co.</P>

</EXCLUDED_CHAR>
<EXCLUDED_CHAR STUDY_ID="STD-Campbell-1988">
<CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION>
<P>The authors reported a study comparing disposable napkins with and without absorbent gelling material on napkin dermatitis associated with diarrhoea and antibiotic use in children in day-care centers. The children were only evaluated for napkin dermatitis if they had an episode of antibiotic use or diarrhoea, so only a subset of the children who entered the study were evaluated, thereby excluding the study due to incomplete evaluation of an outcome relevant to this review. Two of the four study authors were of Procter &amp; Gamble Co.</P>
</CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION>
</EXCLUDED_CHAR>
<EXCLUDED_CHAR STUDY_ID="STD-De-Prost-1987">
<CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION>
<P>Not a randomised clinical trial. The authors reported the results of a clinical trial comparing the effects on skin condition, transepidermal water loss and skin pH of two disposable napkins (cellulose core with or without absorbent gelling material) in 102 infants in French day-care centres. The study was not reported to be randomised and the outcome of skin condition was not defined, two reasons the study was excluded from this review.</P>

<EXCLUDED_CHAR STUDY_ID="STD-Jordan-1986">
<CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION>
<P>Not a randomised clinical trial.

</EXCLUDED_CHAR>
<EXCLUDED_CHAR STUDY_ID="STD-Longhi-1992">

The study was excluded as it did not address napkin rash as an outcome. The study demonstrated that use of disposable napkins reduced the rate of faecal contamination of the environment relative to cloth.</P>
