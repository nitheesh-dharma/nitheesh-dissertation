<P>Migraine is a common, disabling headache disorder. Feverfew (<I>Tanacetum parthenium L.</I>) is a herbal remedy used for the prevention of migraine attacks. For this update of a previous Cochrane review, we reviewed the available evidence up to January 2015 for or against feverfew in the prevention of migraine and found six studies including 561 participants. Generally the studies were heterogeneous and their results were mixed. The previous version of this review showed no clear benefit of feverfew compared with placebo. We added a new study, which is larger and was carried out to high standards, to this review. It showed that feverfew reduced migraine frequency by a little more than half a migraine (0.6) per month compared to placebo. There was no difference in how severe the pain was, or how long it lasted. These results come from a single study of moderate size, therefore they must be viewed with caution until they are confirmed in other rigorous studies. No major adverse effects were associated with feverfew in the included studies.</P>

<P>This review is an update of a previously published review in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews on 'Feverfew for preventing migraine' (2004, Issue 1). Feverfew (<I>Tanacetum parthenium L.</I>) extract is a herbal remedy, which has been used for preventing attacks of migraine.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-06-01 09:50:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To systematically review the evidence from double-blind randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the clinical efficacy and safety of feverfew monopreparations versus placebo for preventing migraine.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-03-25 12:56:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For this updated version of the review we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and AMED to January 2015. We contacted manufacturers of feverfew and checked the bibliographies of identified articles for further trials.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2015-03-25 12:56:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind trials assessing the efficacy of feverfew monopreparations for preventing migraine in patients of any age. We included trials using clinical outcome measures, while we excluded trials focusing exclusively on physiological parameters. There were no restrictions regarding the language of publication.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-03-25 12:56:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We systematically extracted data on patients, interventions, methods, outcome measures, results and adverse events. We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool and evaluated methodological quality using the Oxford Quality Scale developed by Jadad and colleagues. Two review authors (BW and MHP for this update, MHP and EE for the original version) independently selected studies, assessed methodological quality and extracted data. We resolved disagreements concerning evaluation of individual trials through discussion.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-03-25 12:56:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified one new study for this update, resulting in six trials (561 patients) meeting the inclusion criteria. Five of the six trials reported on the main outcome, migraine frequency. Although five of the trials were generally of good methodological quality, all studies were either of unclear or high risk of bias with regards to sample size. Pooled analysis of the results was not possible due to the lack of common outcome measures and heterogeneity between studies in terms of participants, interventions and designs.</P>
<P>The most recent trial added to this version of the review is rigorous and larger (n = 218), using a stable feverfew extract at a dose determined by a previous dose-finding trial. It reports that feverfew reduced migraine frequency by 1.9 attacks from 4.8 to 2.9 and placebo by 1.3 from to 4.8 to 3.5 per month, resulting in a difference in effect between feverfew and placebo of 0.6 attacks per month. For the secondary outcome measures intensity and duration of migraine attacks, incidence and severity of nausea and vomiting, and global assessment no statistically significant differences were reported. Results of previous trials are not convincing: three trials reporting positive effects of feverfew are all of small sample size (17 to 60 participants), while two rigorous trials (n = 50, 147) did not find significant differences between feverfew and placebo. Only mild and transient adverse events, most commonly gastrointestinal complaints and mouth ulcers, were reported in the included trials.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-03-25 12:56:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Since the last version of this review, one larger rigorous study has been included, reporting a difference in effect between feverfew and placebo of 0.6 attacks per month. This adds some positive evidence to the mixed and inconclusive findings of the previous review. However, this constitutes low quality evidence, which needs to be confirmed in larger rigorous trials with stable feverfew extracts and clearly defined migraine populations before firm conclusions can be drawn. It appears from the data reviewed that feverfew is not associated with any major safety concerns.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-03-26 15:58:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is an update of a previously published review in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004, Issue 1) on feverfew for preventing migraine (<LINK REF="REF-Pittler-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pittler 2004</LINK>).</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-03-26 15:58:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Migraine is a common, incapacitating primary headache disorder. According to the International Headache Society it can be classified into two major sub-types: migraine without aura and migraine with aura (previously called common and classical migraine) (<LINK REF="REF-IHS-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">IHS 2013</LINK>). Migraine without aura manifests in attacks lasting 4 to 72 hours; the headaches are characterised by their unilateral location, pulsating quality, moderate or severe intensity, aggravation by routine physical activity and association with nausea and/or photophobia and phonophobia. Migraine with aura is primarily characterised by the focal neurological symptoms that usually precede the headache. Aura usually develops gradually over 5 to 20 minutes and last for less than 60 minutes. Headache with or without the features of migraine may accompany or follow the aura symptoms within 60 minutes (<LINK REF="REF-IHS-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">IHS 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-World-Health-Organization-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">World Health Organization 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Apart from presenting a considerable personal burden with regards to pain, functional health and well being, the prevalence and socio-economic impact of migraine are also significant. The Global Burden of Disease Study classified migraine as the third most common disorder to affect individuals globally in 2010, with a prevalence of 14.7% (<LINK REF="REF-Vos-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vos 2012</LINK>). Migraine was also ranked seventh highest among specific causes of disability globally (<LINK REF="REF-Steiner-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steiner 2013</LINK>). A cross-sectional survey of eight European Union (EU) countries representing 55% of the adult population estimated the average annual direct and indirect cost per person to be EUR 1222, and a total annual cost for the EU of EUR 111 billion for adults aged 18 to 65 years (<LINK REF="REF-Linde-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Linde 2012</LINK>). The economic burden of migraine in the US has been estimated at an average annual direct and indirect cost of USD 1757 for episodic migraine and USD 7750 for chronic migraine per person (<LINK REF="REF-Munakata-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munakata 2009</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-03-25 12:56:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Feverfew (<I>Tanacetum parthenium</I>) is an herbaceous perennial native to Asia Minor and common in the Balkans, now also naturalised throughout most of Europe, the Americas and the rest of the world. It is a member of the Asteraceae family. The dried leaves or aerial parts are used for medicinal purposes. It has traditionally been used for fever, women's ailments, inflammatory conditions, psoriasis, toothache, insect bites, rheumatism, asthma and stomach-ache. Today feverfew extract is predominantly used for preventing migraine attacks and alleviating accompanying symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Ernst-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ernst 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Natural-Standard-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Natural Standard 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pareek-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pareek 2011</LINK>). It is available in different forms and preparations such as fresh feverfew leaves, powdered dried feverfew leaves, alcoholic feverfew extracts and CO<SUB>2</SUB>-feverfew extract. Concerning the safety of feverfew, toxicity studies have shown that chronic prophylactic use of feverfew does not affect the frequency of chromosomal aberration in lymphocytes or urine mutagenicity (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 1988</LINK>). Anecdotal reports describe contact dermatitis (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Burry-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burry 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hausen-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hausen 1983</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-03-25 12:56:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The exact mechanisms of action of feverfew remain unknown. Its anti-migraine action is probably related to its principally known bioactive ingredient, parthenolide, a sesquiterpene lactone (<LINK REF="REF-Knight-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knight 1995</LINK>). Parthenolide comprises up to 85% of the total sesquiterpene content of feverfew and is found in the leaves but not the stems (<LINK REF="REF-Pareek-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pareek 2011</LINK>). Parthenolides probably inhibit prostaglandin production, interfere with both contractile and relaxant mechanisms in blood vessels and perhaps inhibit the secretion of serotonin (5-HT) (<LINK REF="REF-ESCOP-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESCOP 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heptinstall-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heptinstall 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heptinstall-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heptinstall 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Makheja-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Makheja 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pugh-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pugh 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2011</LINK>). However, one study has suggested only a secondary role for serotonin in the aetiology of migraine (<LINK REF="REF-Goadsby-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goadsby 1997</LINK>). Assuming whole-leaf preparations are effective, this would direct attention more towards other components of the feverfew leaf (<LINK REF="REF-Awang-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Awang 1998</LINK>). This is also suggested by a Dutch study (<LINK REF="STD-de-Weerdt-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Weerdt 1996</LINK>), which indicates that the essential oil constituent of feverfew, chrysanthenyl acetate, may be important. This component inhibits prostaglandin synthetase in vitro and seems to possess analgesic properties (<LINK REF="REF-Pugh-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pugh 1988</LINK>). Other investigators agree that parthenolide is not the only pharmacologically active constituent in feverfew (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hendriks-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hendriks 1996</LINK>). A link between the relatively high concentration of melatonin in different feverfew varieties (<LINK REF="REF-Murch-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murch 1997</LINK>) and a decrease in melatonin excretion during migraine attacks has been suggested (<LINK REF="REF-Brun-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brun 1995</LINK>). In conclusion, a definitive chemical link between the aetiology of migraine and parthenolide or any other of the feverfew constituents has still not been established (<LINK REF="STD-Kuritzky-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kuritzky 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>As clinical trials of feverfew for the prevention of migraine attacks published in the 1980s and 1990s produced inconsistent results, wide variations in the strength of the parthenolides (<LINK REF="REF-Willigmann-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Willigmann 1999</LINK>) and differences in the stability of feverfew preparations (<LINK REF="STD-Pfaffenrath-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pfaffenrath 2002</LINK>) were suggested as explanations. One trial using an extract of feverfew with a standardised and constant concentration of parthenolide to treat migraine did not show any beneficial effect (<LINK REF="STD-de-Weerdt-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Weerdt 1996</LINK>). This lack of efficacy might have been due to the absence of essential therapeutic components of the granulated feverfew leaves, which were either not sufficiently extracted, or perhaps degraded during the preparation (<LINK REF="STD-de-Weerdt-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Weerdt 1996</LINK>). Subsequently, a new, more stable feverfew extract (MIG-99) was developed, which was used in the trials by <LINK REF="STD-Pfaffenrath-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pfaffenrath 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Diener-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Diener 2005</LINK> but trial results were not fully consistent.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-03-25 12:56:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Some of the existing standard prophylactic treatments, such as propranolol, metoprolol, flunarizine, valproic acid and topiramate, which reduce attack frequency in some patients, are associated with adverse effects (<LINK REF="REF-Dodick-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dodick 2007</LINK>). Furthermore, patients might find long-term treatment of migraine with drugs unacceptable. An effective, safe and well-tolerated prophylactic alternative would therefore be desirable. Herbal supplements are very popular and generally available over the counter. Although no specific prevalence data are available for feverfew, a 2013 systematic review of surveys of herbal medicine use in the UK reported a rate of 37.1% across a range of time periods. (<LINK REF="REF-Posadzki-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Posadzki 2013</LINK>). Given the high prevalence of use and the demand for non-drug treatments, it is important to know about the safety and efficacy of herbal products including feverfew.</P>

<P>As stated in the 'Methods' section above, we did not conduct planned meta-analyses of data on the frequency, intensity and duration of migraine attacks, the incidence and severity of nausea/vomiting and the global assessment of efficacy due to the lack of common outcome measures and heterogeneity between studies in terms of participants, interventions and designs. The methods and results of each of the six included studies are summarised below to provide an indication of the benefits and harms of feverfew for the prevention of migraine.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Efficacy</HEADING>
<P>Johnson et al conducted a study including 17 patients who had taken raw feverfew leaves every day for the previous three to four years (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1985</LINK>). Patients described as having a history of "common or classical migraine" (diagnostic criteria not specified by the authors) for a duration of at least two years, with eight or fewer attacks per month, were randomised to receive either two capsules of powdered, freeze-dried feverfew leaves (50 mg total) daily or an identical placebo for 24 weeks. Diary cards were used to assess the frequency of migraine and the incidence of nausea and vomiting. The results showed a significant increase (P value &lt; 0.02) in the number of attacks per month in the placebo group (mean 3.1; standard error (SE) 0.8) compared with baseline, while attack frequency remained constant in patients receiving feverfew (mean 1.7; SE 0.6). Forty-two per cent and 79% of attacks were associated with nausea and vomiting in the feverfew and placebo groups, respectively (P value &lt; 0.05). The incidence of bouts of nausea/vomiting was significantly lower in the feverfew group (P value &lt; 0.05) than in the placebo group (39 and 116, respectively). The global assessment of efficacy by patients indicated a significant difference (P value &lt; 0.01) in favour of feverfew: six of eight patients in the feverfew group rated the overall treatment effect as moderately good to excellent, while this result was reported by only three of nine patients in the placebo group. Due to the small sample size (n = 17), caution is advised with regards to the reliability and value of the data.</P>
<P>Murphy et al randomised 72 patients with common or classical migraine (as defined by <LINK REF="REF-Blau-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blau 1984</LINK>) to receive either one capsule of dried feverfew leaves (mean weight, 82 mg) or placebo for four months after a one-month placebo run-in period (<LINK REF="STD-Murphy-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 1988</LINK>). Patients were then transferred into the other group for the second four-month period. There was no wash-out period between the treatment periods. Outcomes were assessed using a diary of migraine symptoms provided every two months. The results suggested a significant difference (P value &lt; 0.005) in the number of attacks per two-month period during feverfew treatment (mean 3.6; SE 0.2) compared with placebo (mean 4.7; SE 0.3). Among patients with classical migraine (migraine with aura) (n = 17), the number of attacks per two-month period was significantly lower (P value &lt; 0.05) with feverfew (mean 2.9; SE 0.4) than with placebo (mean 4.3; SE 0.5); among patients with common migraine (n = 42), headache frequency was similar during the feverfew (mean 3.9; SE 0.3) and placebo (mean 4.9; SE 0.4) periods (P value = 0.06). In the study population as a whole, the total number of attacks rated as severe or very severe was 178/424 (42%) with feverfew and 258/559 (46%) with placebo. Nausea and vomiting accompanied the attacks in 207/424 (49%) and 313/559 (56%) cases treated with feverfew and placebo, respectively (P value &lt; 0.02). The global assessment of efficacy, measured on a 100 mm visual analogue scale with 'worst ever' and 'best ever' as the two extremes, indicated a significant difference (P value &lt; 0.0001) in favour of feverfew compared with placebo (mean 74; SE 2 versus mean 60; SE 3, respectively). Among patients with classical migraine, global assessment scores were significantly higher (P value &lt; 0.01) during treatment with feverfew (mean 78; SE 4) than during treatment with placebo (mean 57; SE 5); among patients with common migraine, scores for the two treatment periods were similar (mean 72; SE 2 for feverfew and mean 61; SE 3 for placebo).</P>
<P>De Weerdt et al (<LINK REF="STD-de-Weerdt-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Weerdt 1996</LINK>) assessed 50 patients diagnosed according to the criteria of the International Headache Society (<LINK REF="REF-IHS-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">IHS 1988</LINK>). Patients suffering from migraine with or without aura received either one capsule of an alcoholic feverfew extract (143 mg) or placebo daily in a randomised cross-over trial. A one-month placebo run-in phase was followed by two two-month treatment periods. There was no wash-out period between the treatment periods. The investigators reported that no significant effects on the number or intensity of headaches were observed. Again this study has a small sample size with only 44 patients being included in the final analysis and the results therefore need to be interpreted with caution.</P>
<P>The cross-over trial conducted by Palevitch et al included 57 patients with migraine diagnosed by medical examination (diagnostic criteria not specified) (<LINK REF="STD-Palevitch-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Palevitch 1997</LINK>). Participants as young as nine years old (age range 9 to 65 years) were included despite migraine having different characteristics in young individuals. During the preliminary, open phase of the trial, each patient received 100 mg of powdered, dried feverfew leaves daily for two months. Thereafter, in the double-blind, cross-over phase, one group received placebo for 30 days, while the other continued taking feverfew. Patients in the active treatment group were then transferred to the placebo arm and vice versa. There was no wash-out period between the treatment periods. The intensity of migraine attacks was measured by patients on a numerical scale of 0 ('no pain') to 10 ('most severe pain'), and the severity of nausea and vomiting was assessed using a numerical analogue scale and by questionnaire. The results of the preliminary, open phase showed a significant decrease by 4.27 points on a 10-point scale in migraine intensity after treatment with feverfew compared with baseline (P value &lt; 0.001). In the first cross-over phase there was a further reduction of migraine intensity in the feverfew group (mean 1.5; SE 0.7), and an increase in intensity in the placebo group (mean 1.6; SE 0.9) (P value &lt; 0.01). In the second phase of the cross-over, these trends continued: migraine intensity decreased among patients taking feverfew (mean 4.0; SE 1.1) and increased among patients taking placebo (mean 1.4; SE 1.1). In addition, there was a significant difference (P value &lt; 0.001) in the severity of nausea and vomiting in favour of feverfew.</P>
<P>Pfaffenrath et al conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT) (<LINK REF="STD-Pfaffenrath-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pfaffenrath 2002</LINK>). Three dosage regimens (2.08 mg versus 6.25 mg versus 18.75 mg, each administered three times daily for 12 weeks) of a novel CO<SUB>2</SUB>-feverfew extract were compared with placebo. One hundred and forty-seven patients with migraine with or without aura according to the IHS criteria (<LINK REF="REF-IHS-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">IHS 1988</LINK>) were enrolled. The primary endpoint was pre-defined as the total number of migraine attacks during the last 28 days of treatment compared to the four-week baseline period. Secondary endpoints included total and average duration and intensity of migraine attacks, number of days with accompanying migraine symptoms and responder rates. There were no statistically significant effects for either primary or secondary outcomes measures. Accordingly, a dose-response relationship could not be observed. Subgroup analysis including patients with at least four migraine attacks during baseline evaluations (n = 49) showed a significant effect when the 6.25 mg dose was compared with placebo (P value = 0.02).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Diener-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Diener 2005</LINK> conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre RCT in patients with a diagnosis of migraine with or without aura according to the IHS criteria (<LINK REF="REF-IHS-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">IHS 2000</LINK>). After a four-week screening period without migraine prophylaxis, 218 participants were randomised to receive either 6.25 mg of a feverfew CO<SUB>2</SUB>-extract (MIG-99, n = 108) or placebo (n = 110) three times daily for 16 weeks. Patients documented each migraine attack in a diary. The primary outcome measure was the total number of migraine attacks within 28 days during the second and third 28-day treatment period (mean of P2 and P3) compared with baseline (prophylaxis-free period P0). Secondary efficacy parameters related to frequency, intensity and duration of migraine attacks, clinical global impression of efficacy, medication requirements, number of drop-outs due to lack of effect of the study medication and responder rate (% of patients with a greater than 50% decrease of migraine attacks per 28 days). Data from 170 patients were available for efficacy analysis in the intention-to-treat (ITT) sample (feverfew n = 89, placebo n = 81). The migraine frequency decreased by 1.9 from 4.8 to 2.9 attacks per month in the MIG-99 group and by 1.3 from 4.8 to 3.5 attacks per month in the placebo group in the weeks 5 to 12 (P value = 0.0456). For the secondary outcome measures, significant differences were reported for responder rates (30.3% in the MIG-99 group versus 17.3% in the placebo group, P value = 0.047), number of migraine days per 28 days (P value = 0.0353), and global assessment of efficacy by patients (P value = 0.024) and investigators (P value = 0.035). No statistically significant differences were seen for any of the other outcome measures.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse events/safety</HEADING>
<P>Five out of the six studies reported on adverse events; only Palevitch did not assess these. The proportion of participants experiencing adverse events varied considerably between studies but there were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of adverse events between the feverfew and placebo groups. Three studies reported a higher incidence of adverse events during treatment with placebo than with feverfew (<LINK REF="STD-Diener-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Diener 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Murphy-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 1988</LINK>). De Weerdt stated that none of the participants completing the study (one withdrawal) reported adverse events (<LINK REF="STD-de-Weerdt-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Weerdt 1996</LINK>). In the <LINK REF="STD-Diener-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Diener 2005</LINK> study, 8.4% of participants in the feverfew group and 10.2% in the placebo group experienced adverse events. The percentages in the <LINK REF="STD-Pfaffenrath-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pfaffenrath 2002</LINK> study were between 12.8% and 30.6% in the high-dose and low-dose feverfew groups respectively and 28.6% in the placebo group. In the withdrawal study by <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1985</LINK>, 74% of participants in the feverfew group reported adverse events and 100% in the placebo group (see below). <LINK REF="STD-Murphy-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 1988</LINK> did not report numbers of patients experiencing adverse events but reported the incidence of adverse events, which were 28/72 in the feverfew group and 36/72 in the placebo group.</P>
<P>Adverse events were generally mild and reversible. Most common were gastrointestinal problems but a wide range of adverse events in the feverfew and placebo groups were reported. <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1985</LINK> reported a high incidence of aches, pains and stiffness in joints and muscles, as well as central nervous system symptoms of nervousness, anxiety and poor sleep (in 13 out of 17 patients) during the placebo phase of their withdrawal study. The authors consider these effects occurring together with a rebound of migraine symptoms to constitute a genuine "post-feverfew syndrome", which has been reported in long-term users of feverfew.</P>
<P>No serious adverse events related to the study medication occurred in any of the included trials. In total, 13 withdrawals were necessitated by adverse events associated with feverfew, compared with eight withdrawals due to adverse events associated with placebo. Again, adverse events leading to withdrawals were mainly of a gastrointestinal nature. Feverfew did not appear to affect blood pressure, heart rate, body weight or haematological and biochemical safety parameters in any of the included studies.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-03-25 14:08:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Overall the results from the six included trials are mixed and provide low quality evidence. With the addition of the most recent and largest study, <LINK REF="STD-Diener-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Diener 2005</LINK>, to this updated Cochrane review, there is evidence from one medium-sized, rigorous randomised controlled trial (RCT) that feverfew may reduce migraine attacks by 0.6 headaches per month compared to placebo. Results for the secondary outcome measures remain unconvincing.</P>
<P>In terms of the main outcome measure, frequency of migraine attacks, statistically significant reductions were reported in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Diener-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Diener 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1985</LINK>), as well as in subgroups described by the authors as suffering with classical migraine (with aura) but not common migraine (with aura) (<LINK REF="STD-Murphy-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 1988</LINK>), and in the confirmatory subset but not the intention-to-treat (ITT) sample in the <LINK REF="STD-Pfaffenrath-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pfaffenrath 2002</LINK> study. One study found no differences (<LINK REF="STD-de-Weerdt-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Weerdt 1996</LINK>), and one did not report frequency (<LINK REF="STD-Palevitch-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Palevitch 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Of the five studies assessing intensity of migraine attacks (<LINK REF="STD-de-Weerdt-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Weerdt 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Diener-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Diener 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Murphy-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Palevitch-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Palevitch 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pfaffenrath-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pfaffenrath 2002</LINK>), only <LINK REF="STD-Palevitch-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Palevitch 1997</LINK> reported significant improvements. The three studies that assessed duration of migraine attacks did not report any significant differences between groups (<LINK REF="STD-Diener-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Diener 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Murphy-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pfaffenrath-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pfaffenrath 2002</LINK>). Global assessment was improved in the studies by <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1985</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Diener-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Diener 2005</LINK>, as well as in the subgroup with classical migraine (with aura) in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Murphy-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 1988</LINK> (not assessed/reported in the other studies). The incidence of nausea and vomiting was reduced in the studies by <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1985</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Murphy-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 1988</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Palevitch-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Palevitch 1997</LINK>, while <LINK REF="STD-Pfaffenrath-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pfaffenrath 2002</LINK> did not observe any differences.</P>
<P>Two of the three trials at low risk of bias did not report statistically significant improvements for any outcomes in their main analysis (<LINK REF="STD-de-Weerdt-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Weerdt 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pfaffenrath-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pfaffenrath 2002</LINK>), while only one did (<LINK REF="STD-Diener-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Diener 2005</LINK>). The two studies reporting positive results for all pre-defined outcome measures were both withdrawal studies (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Palevitch-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Palevitch 1997</LINK>); the first is limited by a small number of participants (n = 17) (<LINK REF="REF-Tfelt_x002d_Hansen-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tfelt-Hansen 1987</LINK>), and the latter was of unclear/high risk of bias and scored only two points on the Oxford Quality Scale. Generally the studies are of small sample size with four studies including fewer than 100 participants (<LINK REF="STD-de-Weerdt-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Weerdt 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Murphy-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Palevitch-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Palevitch 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the included trials the adverse events reported were generally mild and reversible. Mouth ulceration and gastrointestinal symptoms were reported most frequently and were also experienced by long-time feverfew users. Such problems can be avoided through the use of more carefully prepared formulations of feverfew. A post-feverfew syndrome was reported by long-time feverfew consumers after discontinuation of feverfew intake (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1985</LINK>). Collectively these data imply that oral feverfew medication is relatively safe. However, more information is needed to detect serious or rare adverse events, and on long-term clinical use.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-03-26 16:09:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is considerable variation in the six included trials of 561 participants in terms of designs, participants, interventions and outcome measures, which might explain the inconsistent results. This variation makes it difficult to apply these findings to the general population.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Participants</HEADING>
<P>In terms of participants, the diagnostic criteria varied. While three studies used the International Headache Society (IHS) criteria (<LINK REF="STD-de-Weerdt-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Weerdt 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Diener-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Diener 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pfaffenrath-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pfaffenrath 2002</LINK>), one used Blau (<LINK REF="STD-Murphy-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 1988</LINK>), and two did not specify the criteria used (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Palevitch-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Palevitch 1997</LINK>). In some studies participants were feverfew-naive (<LINK REF="STD-de-Weerdt-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Weerdt 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Palevitch-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Palevitch 1997</LINK>), while in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1985</LINK> feverfew consumption for the last three to four years was an inclusion criterion. <LINK REF="STD-Palevitch-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Palevitch 1997</LINK> included participants as young as nine years old (age range 9 to 65 years) despite migraine having different characteristics in young individuals.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Design</HEADING>
<P>Most studies had small numbers of participants, particularly in the subgroups. The sample size of studies ranged between 17 and 218; four trials had 72 or fewer participants and one thereof (n = 17) had fewer than 10 patients per treatment group (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1985</LINK>), which has an influence on effect sizes. Their statistical analyses therefore need to be interpreted with caution. Small sample size can expose studies to the hazards of random chance; at the same time studies with small sample sizes are more likely to overestimate results (<LINK REF="REF-N_x00fc_esch-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nüesch 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>The trials included treatment and withdrawal studies as well as parallel-group and cross-over studies. In order to reduce carry-over effects the IHS recommends a wash-out phase of at least one month. The two parallel-group treatment studies by <LINK REF="STD-Pfaffenrath-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pfaffenrath 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Diener-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Diener 2005</LINK> used a treatment-free/placebo run-in phase before the start of the trial.</P>
<P>Particularly in cross-over trials carry-over effects can present a significant problem. The effects of feverfew given in the first period might persist into the subsequent placebo period (or vice versa), thus interfering with the effects of the subsequent intervention. However, none of the three cross-over studies used wash-out phases between the two intervention phases. Two of them included a one-month run-in phase but no wash-out before cross-over (<LINK REF="STD-de-Weerdt-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Weerdt 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Murphy-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 1988</LINK>), and one did not employ any wash-out phase (<LINK REF="STD-Palevitch-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Palevitch 1997</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Murphy-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 1988</LINK> discussed the possibility of a carry-over effect but concluded that their data did not support this. <LINK REF="STD-de-Weerdt-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Weerdt 1996</LINK> states that the average response to the two treatments was the same regardless of the order in which they were received. Similarly, no taper was used in the withdrawal studies to reduce the risk of a 'post-feverfew syndrome', which has been described in long-term users who abruptly discontinue use of feverfew (<LINK REF="STD-Pfaffenrath-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pfaffenrath 2002</LINK>). Post-feverfew syndrome includes among others a rebound of migraine symptoms, which is consistent with the results in the two withdrawal studies by <LINK REF="STD-Palevitch-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Palevitch 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1985</LINK>. Treatment periods ranged from 60 days (<LINK REF="STD-Palevitch-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Palevitch 1997</LINK>) to nine months (<LINK REF="STD-de-Weerdt-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Weerdt 1996</LINK>). The IHS recommends at least three months for phase II trials.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Intervention</HEADING>
<P>Different types of medication were used in the studies: three trials administered dried, powdered feverfew extract (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Murphy-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Palevitch-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Palevitch 1997</LINK>), one used an alcoholic feverfew extract (<LINK REF="STD-de-Weerdt-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Weerdt 1996</LINK>), and two used a CO<SUB>2</SUB>-extract (<LINK REF="STD-Diener-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Diener 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pfaffenrath-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pfaffenrath 2002</LINK>). In these two most recent trials care was given to using a stable extract of feverfew highly enriched with parthenolide. Furthermore the most recent trial by <LINK REF="STD-Diener-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Diener 2005</LINK> used a dosage of 6.25 mg three times a day, which had shown the most promising results in the earlier dose-finding study by the same author team (<LINK REF="STD-Pfaffenrath-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pfaffenrath 2002</LINK>),</P>
<P>Patients were asked to stop any other medication for migraine prevention but use of analgesics to treat acute attacks was allowed and reported in four studies (<LINK REF="STD-de-Weerdt-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Weerdt 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Diener-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Diener 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pfaffenrath-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pfaffenrath 2002</LINK>). Higher consumption of analgesics in the placebo groups was reported by two studies (<LINK REF="STD-de-Weerdt-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Weerdt 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1985</LINK>), one study found no differences between groups (<LINK REF="STD-Pfaffenrath-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pfaffenrath 2002</LINK>) and one did not report any results (<LINK REF="STD-Diener-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Diener 2005</LINK>). One study did not record concomitant medication (<LINK REF="STD-Palevitch-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Palevitch 1997</LINK>) and one stated that all migraine medication was stopped but did not specify whether analgesics were allowed as rescue medication (<LINK REF="STD-Murphy-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 1988</LINK>). It is unlikely that the use of analgesics to treat acute attacks will have influenced the results for the incidence of migraine attacks.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Evaluation/outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>Generally the trials used headache diaries to record a variety of outcomes. Although frequency, duration and intensity of migraine attacks, as well as incidence and severity of nausea and vomiting, were the most commonly used outcome measures, the individual studies varied in the outcome measures used and some did not report results for frequency (<LINK REF="STD-Palevitch-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Palevitch 1997</LINK>), duration (<LINK REF="STD-de-Weerdt-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Weerdt 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Palevitch-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Palevitch 1997</LINK>), intensity (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1985</LINK>), or nausea and vomiting (<LINK REF="STD-de-Weerdt-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Weerdt 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Diener-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Diener 2005</LINK>). Migraine attacks were reported differently (e.g. as migraine days, migraine attacks, days with a certain attack intensity, use of analgesics, etc.) and over a range of time frames (e.g. last four weeks of the trial period, over total trial duration). They were also presented differently (values at a certain time interval with or without measures of variance, per cent change compared to baseline, etc.).</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-03-25 14:08:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Generally the quality of the evidence was good with five studies being of low risk of bias for most criteria and scoring four to five points on the Oxford scale. Only one study scored only two points on the Oxford scale and we considered it of unclear risk of bias for all criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Palevitch-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Palevitch 1997</LINK>). However, four out of the six studies had fewer than 100 participants; two studies are of high risk of bias due to small sample size (<LINK REF="STD-de-Weerdt-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Weerdt 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1985</LINK>), the others are of unclear risk of bias. Their results therefore need to be interpreted with caution. The two latest and largest trials, <LINK REF="STD-Diener-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Diener 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Pfaffenrath-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pfaffenrath 2002</LINK>, follow the IHS guidelines for controlled trials of drugs in migraine prevention (<LINK REF="REF-Tfelt_x002d_Hansen-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tfelt-Hansen 2012</LINK>).</P>

<P>By carrying out a thorough search for relevant studies and following Cochrane review methods we aimed to minimise the risk of bias in the review process itself.</P>
<P>One trial is available as an abstract only (<LINK REF="STD-Karimooy-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Karimooy 2011</LINK>). It is a controlled clinical trial (n = 168) of feverfew for the treatment of migraine headache compared to dihydroergotamine and placebo. Relevant data about methods and results are missing in the abstract, which makes it impossible to assess the study. We contacted the authors who confirmed that the study has not been published in full but were unable to provide any further details of the trial. It therefore remains unclear whether the study assessed migraine prevention and was randomised. The use of dihydroergotamine suggests that treatment rather than prevention of migraine was investigated. We have therefore excluded the study and are confident that its results would not have changed the overall outcome of this review.</P>

The most recent systematic review of feverfew for migraine, published in 2009, also includes six trials (<LINK REF="REF-Saranitzky-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saranitzky 2009</LINK>). The authors do not include the <LINK REF="STD-Palevitch-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Palevitch 1997</LINK> study, which is published in a journal not indexed by MEDLINE, but include a RCT of a feverfew combination product (<LINK REF="STD-Maizels-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Maizels 2004</LINK>), which we excluded from this Cochrane review as it does not allow any conclusions about the role of feverfew alone. The review concludes that "currently available research examining feverfew for migraine is promising especially with the dried feverfew leaf formulations.

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-03-25 14:08:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Overall there is low quality evidence that feverfew is effective in migraine prevention. The most recent study, a medium-sized, rigorously executed study, demonstrated a decrease in migraine frequency of 0.6 attacks per month with feverfew compared with placebo. Results from previous studies, which were smaller and used different designs and interventions, were mixed and not convincing. Use of feverfew appears to be well tolerated and no major safety issues have been reported.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-03-25 14:08:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>These cautiously positive results need to be confirmed in larger trials, which need to be rigorously executed and reported. Efforts should be undertaken to minimise heterogeneity between trials by using clearly defined outcome measures and methods to capture them as described in the International Headache Society (IHS) guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Tfelt_x002d_Hansen-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tfelt-Hansen 2012</LINK>). Future trials should use stable, standardised feverfew extracts and clearly defined migraine populations.</P>
