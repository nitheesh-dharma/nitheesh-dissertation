<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-05-09 11:46:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tatyana Abakumova">
<P>Tuberculosis is an infectious disease caused by <I>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</I> bacteria. Over two billion people worldwide are believed to be latently infected with TB and approximately 10% of these people will develop active TB later in life. The World Health Organization currently only recommend treatment with fluoroquinolones for patients who cannot take standard first-line drugs. In this review, we examined the effect of including fluoroquinolones in first-line treatment regimens on people with presumed drug-sensitive tuberculosis.</P>
<P>We examined the research published up to 6 March 2013 and we identified five randomised controlled trials (1330 people) that met the inclusion criteria. The trials were performed in low- and middle-income countries located in geographically diverse areas but there was a lack of studies conducted in Asia. We found no studies that examined the effect of including fluoroquinolones in a standard six month TB treatment regimen on treatment failure. We do not know whether adding fluoroquinolones or substituting fluoroquinolones for ethambutol in a standard six month TB treatment regimen reduces treatment failure, relapse, death, or adverse events. Substituting fluoroquinolones for isoniazid in a standard six month TB treatment regimen may have little or no difference upon death and adverse events. Currently, there are nine randomised controlled trials ongoing.</P>
<P>HIV-positive participants were relatively well-represented in the included trials but none of the included trials stratified outcomes by HIV status. Also, the primary outcomes of all the included trials were reached before initiation of antiretroviral treatment. Evidence is generally lacking on the safety and efficacy of fluoroquinolone additions or substitutions in children (&lt; 18 years) and in pregnant and lactating women.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-05-03 10:18:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by <I>Mycobacterium tuberculosis </I>and more than two billion people, one third of the world&#8217;s total population, are believed to be latently infected (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2012</LINK>). Latently infected, immunocompetent people have an estimated lifetime risk of developing TB disease of 10% (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2012</LINK>). Although the incidence of TB has declined since 2004, the global burden of the disease remains high with an estimated 8.8 million people falling ill with TB each year (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2011a</LINK>). In 2010, 60% of new cases globally occurred in Asia while sub-Saharan Africa had the highest incidence with over 270 cases per 100,000 population per year (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2012</LINK>). Pulmonary TB is the commonest clinical presentation and sputum smear-positive cases are the most important source of ongoing infection in the community (<LINK REF="REF-Grzybowski-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grzybowski 1975</LINK>).</P>
<P>TB remains the most common opportunistic infection and a leading cause of death among people living with HIV and AIDS (<LINK REF="REF-Corbett-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corbett 2003</LINK>). Those co-infected with HIV and TB are between 21 to 34 times more likely to develop active TB disease than HIV-negative people infected with <I>M. tuberculosis</I> (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2012</LINK>) and nearly a quarter of deaths among people with HIV are due to TB. In 2010, 82% of new active TB cases among HIV-positive people were in Africa (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2012</LINK>) where it has been the single most important factor determining the increased incidence of TB since 1990 (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2010a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Active TB disease may be fatal if left untreated or if treated inappropriately. In 2010, 1.4 million people died from TB (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2012</LINK>). It caused more adult deaths each year than any other single infectious disease in the twentieth century (<LINK REF="REF-Kochi-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kochi 1991</LINK>) and remains second only to HIV/AIDS as the greatest infectious killer worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2012</LINK>). Multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB: defined as resistance to both rifampicin and isoniazid) threatens the success of TB programmes with up to 510,000 people worldwide in need of specialised treatment with second-line drugs and much lower rates of treatment success.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-05-09 11:45:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Effective pharmacological treatment for TB has been available since the 1940s. The first-line antituberculous drugs are the most active agents with proven clinical efficacy that form the core of initial standardized treatment regimens. The recommended first-line antituberculous regimen consists of isoniazid (H, 5 mg/kg, 300 mg daily or 10 mg/kg, 900 mg three times weekly), rifampicin (R, 10 mg/kg or 450 mg to 600 mg daily), pyrazinamide (Z, 25 mg/kg daily or 35 mg/kg three times weekly), and ethambutol (E, 15 mg/kg daily or 30 mg/kg three times weekly) (ie HRZE) (<LINK REF="REF-Blumberg-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blumberg 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2007a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2010b" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2010b</LINK>). Streptomycin, although used less commonly, is also a first-line drug on the World Health Organization's (WHO's) list of essential anti-TB drugs (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2007a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2011b</LINK>). The efficacy of regimens containing rifampicin and isoniazid is well established for treatment and prevention (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2007b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ziganshina-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ziganshina 2011</LINK>), even in HIV-positive people (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Woldehanna-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woldehanna 2004</LINK>). Rates of cure (defined for drug-sensitive TB as negative sputum culture at two months and at the end of treatment) with six to nine month rifampicin-containing regimens can approach 100%, provided the bacteria are drug-sensitive, there are no additional co-morbidities (especially HIV infection and diabetes), and that patients adhere to treatment (<LINK REF="REF-STS_x002f_BMRC-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">STS/BMRC 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Anonymous-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anonymous 1983</LINK>). However, pyrazinamide is also essential to the current first-line regimen and a duration of therapy of six months is not adequate for cure without it. Ethambutol is believed to be a weak drug used primarily to prevent the emergence of resistance.</P>
<P>WHO considers fluoroquinolones (other than ciprofloxacin) together with injectable medicines as forming the backbone of treatment for MDR-TB and consistently recommends fluoroquinolones for drug-sensitive TB in cases of intolerance of standard first-line drugs, particularly hepatotoxicity (<LINK REF="REF-Gillespie-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillespie 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Blumberg-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blumberg 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2010b" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2010b</LINK>). Ofloxacin is on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines as a reserve second&#8208;line drug for the treatment of MDR-TB to be used in specialized centres adhering to WHO standards for TB control. Levofloxacin is included as an alternative based on availability and programme considerations (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2011b</LINK>). These recommendations for MDR-TB are supported by expert opinion (<LINK REF="REF-Falzon-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Falzon 2011</LINK>) and by systematic reviews of observational data (<LINK REF="REF-Johnston-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnston 2009</LINK>) showing an association of fluoroquinolone use with treatment success (OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.19 to 4.09) in MDR-TB. Hence equipoise has been disturbed despite the lack of randomized evidence in this area and it is unlikely that placebo-controlled trials in MDR-TB will be performed.</P>
<P>There is currently no consensus on the potential efficacy of fluoroquinolones as additions to or substitutions for established first-line drugs in the standard regimen. Studies of substitution of ciprofloxacin for pyrazinamide and ethambutol in the first-line regimen were associated with higher rates of treatment failure and relapse at a duration of six months in previous versions of this review (<LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ziganshina-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ziganshina 2008</LINK>). Hence the research questions for this update focus on substitution of newer fluoroquinolones for either isoniazid or ethambutol, which are thought to be more dispensable components of the first-line regimen. Some small or uncontrolled studies have suggested that substituting ofloxacin for ethambutol in an established first-line antituberculous regimen might make it possible to shorten TB chemotherapy from six months to five or even four months (<LINK REF="STD-Kohno-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kohno 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TRC-2002" TYPE="STUDY">TRC 2002</LINK>). More recently, additional conflicting data suggest unclear efficacy when fluoroquinolones are included in first-line antituberculous regimens (<LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Sadr-1998" TYPE="STUDY">El-Sadr 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Burman-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Burman 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rustomjee-2008a" TYPE="STUDY">Rustomjee 2008a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Conde-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Conde 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dorman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dorman 2009</LINK>). The rationale for fluoroquinolone substitution/addition in any first-line antituberculous regimen is that the modified regimen might improve efficacy at a duration of six months or produce similar efficacy at a reduced duration of, for example, four months. SInce the long-term outcomes of current first-line therapy are excellent, with 95% or greater rates of cure, most attention has been given to developing shorter regimens.</P>

<P>Fluoroquinolones are fluorine-containing nalidixic acid derivatives characterized by broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. The mechanism of action is inhibition of the DNA gyrase enzyme which is responsible for supercoiling of nucleic acid, an essential process for all bacteria. This mechanism is distinct from that of other antituberculous drugs, raising the possibility of synergistic activity. While initially fluoroquinolones were most useful for infections caused by gram-negative bacteria, extensive modification of the basic pharmacophore has steadily increased the <I>in vitro</I> activity of newer fluoroquinolones against <I>M. tuberculosis</I>.</P>
<P>The favourable combination of pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic characteristics of fluoroquinolones (<LINK REF="REF-Ginsburg-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ginsburg 2003</LINK>) could give the following benefits when added to antituberculous regimens:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Add to the bactericidal and sterilizing effect of combination therapy.</LI>
<LI>Increase penetration into chronic TB lesions.</LI>
<LI>Improve adherence to treatment due to potentially better tolerability than first-line drugs and by shortening treatment.</LI>
</UL>
<P>On the other hand, fluoroquinolones also have the potential to do harm. They may:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Increase liver and central nervous system (CNS) toxicity of antituberculous drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Yew-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yew 2001</LINK>) and cause clinically significant drug interactions with antituberculous (<LINK REF="REF-Yew-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yew 2001</LINK>), anti-HIV (<LINK REF="REF-Burman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burman 1999</LINK>), and other drugs, resulting in reduced efficacy and potential toxicity (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Cause additional adverse drug reactions, such as musculoskeletal damage, gastrointestinal problems (pseudo-membranous colitis), cardiac arrhythmias, infections from fungi or bacteria, psychosis, and convulsions (<LINK REF="REF-Martindale-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martindale 1996</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Induce resistance in <I>M. tuberculosis</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Alangaden-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alangaden 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jacobs-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobs 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2006</LINK>), which may rapidly become cross-resistant to all members of the fluoroquinolone class (<LINK REF="REF-Ginsburg-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ginsburg 2003</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>The problem of resistance to fluoroquinolones is further complicated by the broad indications of this class of antimicrobials in treatment of various lower respiratory tract and other infections. This may at least be partially responsible for the rising resistance rates among <I>M. tuberculosis</I> strains to fluoroquinolones (<LINK REF="REF-Ginsburg-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ginsburg 2003</LINK>). Retrospective studies have shown that empiric antituberculous treatment with fluoroquinolones or fluoroquinolone use for misdiagnosed pneumonia delayed diagnosis of TB in an endemic area and impaired outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Yoon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Yoon 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2006</LINK>).</P>

<P>In the light of these uncertainties, we have conducted a systematic review of trials of fluoroquinolones in people with presumed drug-sensitive TB. These drugs are likely to be used as substitutes for existing drugs or as an addition to current treatment regimens in regimens based on rifampicin and pyrazinamide of six months duration or less. A shorter first-line TB regimen would improve individual outcomes for TB sufferers and greatly reduce the operational burden on TB programmes.</P>

<P>For binary efficacy outcomes, we extracted the number of participants with the event and the number analyzed to allow for complete case analysis in each treatment group. Where possible, we extracted data to allow an intention-to-treat analysis (including all the participants in the groups to which they were originally randomly allocated). We used these data for safety outcomes and for the worst-best case analyses used as sensitivity analyses. We calculated the percentage loss to follow-up and exclusions from final analyses and we presented it in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' section when the numbers randomized and the numbers analyzed were inconsistent.

<P>Where data from the trial reports were insufficient, unclear, or missing, we attempted to contact the trial authors for additional information. We aimed to do an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis but as there were missing data we did a complete case analysis (ie including all patients with a measured outcome). Where the number of people with a measured outcome was not reported, we extracted the number of patients in the per-protocol analysis. The complete case analysis does not make an assumption about the outcome of missing patients. The potential effects of missing data were explored through a series of sensitivity analyses (<LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>). As a sensitivity analysis, we did a best-worst case analysis; the best case analysis assumed missing patients had a positive outcome; the worst case analysis assumed they had a negative outcome.</P>
<P>
<B>Efficacy outcomes: </B>The analysis of efficacy outcomes drew on the WHO's guidelines for treatment of TB (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2010b" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2010b</LINK>). Due to the length of time needed for bacteriological confirmation of active TB disease, a high number of randomized participants are excluded from the final efficacy outcome as losses to follow-up or exclusions for not meeting inclusion criteria, or voluntary or involuntary withdrawals. For this reason we conducted a sensitivity analysis which aimed to restore the integrity of the randomization process (as is usual in trial analysis) and test the robustness of the results to this methodology. For a summary of the methodology and sensitivity analysis see <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>.<BR/>

<B>Complete case analysis: </B>We extracted the total numbers of failures, relapses, deaths, and sputum culture conversions and we used them as numerators.

<P>WHO treatment guidelines recommend fluoroquinolones for treating MDR-TB based on observational cohort data and expert opinion (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnston-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnston 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2010b" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2010b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Falzon-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Falzon 2011</LINK>) and it is now unlikely that randomized placebo-controlled trials to support their use will be forthcoming. However, equipoise remains concerning the potential of fluoroquinolones to improve or reduce the duration of first-line therapy. Hence, this systematic review focuses on trials conducted in the context of drug-sensitive TB since this area is currently of greatest research interest. This review assesses the benefits and harms of fluoroquinolones when added to or substituted for isoniazid or ethambutol in the first line regimen, focusing on clinically relevant and widely accepted outcomes, and specifically excludes quantitative bacteriological methods.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-05-28 14:56:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this review, we restricted inclusion of trials to those that recruited new cases of TBwith presumed drug-sensitive TB. We also restricted the scope of the review to trials in which the intervention contained at least rifampicin and pyrazinamide, the drugs on which the current duration of first-line treatment depends. The trial sites were geographically diverse but there was a lack of studies conducted in Asia. The trials were conducted in low-income and middle-income countries, which means the results of this review are likely to be applicable to situations where the burden of TB is high and new revised treatment strategies are most urgently needed. HIV-positive participants were relatively well-represented in the included trials (29.8% of included participants overall). However, one trial explicitly excluded them and the primary outcomes of all the included trials were reached before initiation of ART. None of the included trials stratified outcomes by HIV status. Given the poor prognosis of HIV-positive patients with TB (<LINK REF="REF-Daley-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daley 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Telzak-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Telzak 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-El_x002d_Sadr-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">El-Sadr 2001</LINK>), further evidence relating to use of fluoroquinolones in conjunction with ART in this group would be welcome. Evidence is generally lacking on the safety and efficacy of fluoroquinolone additions or substitutions in children (&lt; 18 years) and in pregnant and lactating women who were excluded from all of the included trials.</P>
<P>Within the included studies, reporting of the selected outcomes was inconsistent and at times incomplete. All of the trials that we included were Phase II trials. Most trials did not report follow-up even to the end of the treatment regimen and only one trial reported on relapse after treatment was discontinued. While this was not unexpected, it made reporting of the combined endpoint of treatment failure/relapse impossible in the current review. Furthermore, variable reporting of data on time to culture or smear conversion and safety made meaningful data synthesis of these outcomes difficult. Harmonized reporting standards for these and other outcomes in TB trials would be welcome, given that nine ongoing trials have been identified and will soon expand the evidence base addressing the questions of this review.</P>
<P>All the included studies were small Phase II studies the power of this analysis for long term efficacy and safety outcomes is bound to be limited. However, this will be addressed by the ongoing Phase III trials we identified.</P>
<P>None of the trials reported on fluoroquinolone-specific adverse effects, such as tendinopathy or rupture, dysglycaemia, or dysrhythmias due to QTc prolongation. However, they did report the number of adverse events, including those considered serious enough to discontinue or change treatment, and no difference in the number of patients with adverse effects in fluoroquinolone regimens was detected. Substitution of moxifloxacin for ethambutol (<LINK REF="STD-Burman-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Burman 2006</LINK>) or for isoniazid (<LINK REF="STD-Dorman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dorman 2009</LINK>) in first-line regimens was reported by the trial authors to result in higher incidences of nausea.

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2013-05-03 11:48:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We asked whether fluoroquinolones have a role in the closely related goals of improving the efficacy or shortening duration of first-line therapy in newly diagnosed TB patients with presumed drug-sensitive organisms. The original surpassed version of this review provided clear evidence that substitution of ciprofloxacin for pyrazinamide and ethambutol did not improve efficacy or tolerability compared to the current first-line regimen. Culture conversion during treatment appeared slower and observed relapse rates were higher (<LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ziganshina-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ziganshina 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ziganshina-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ziganshina 2008</LINK>). Another study replacing rifampicin with ciprofloxacin reported similar smear conversion but a higher incidence of combined treatment failure and relapse using this regimen, though these endpoints were not based on culture (<LINK REF="STD-Saigal-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Saigal 2001</LINK>). These unfavourable results argue against a useful role for ciprofloxacin in treatment of new cases of TB and we have hence removed these trials from the review.</P>
<P>In this updated review, we found little evidence to support use of ofloxacin as a substitute for ethambutol in the first-line regimen. Estimates from one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Rustomjee-2008a" TYPE="STUDY">Rustomjee 2008a</LINK>) suggest that culture conversion is not improved compared to ethambutol, and observed numbers of adverse events were not lower. Another trial, which was excluded from this review, though reported definitive outcomes, found estimates of efficacy and safety outcomes to be similar (<LINK REF="STD-Kohno-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kohno 1992</LINK>). Thus ofloxacin may be an acceptable alternative to ethambutol for individual patients in cases of individual poor tolerability of the drug but would not appear to have enough advantages to routinely replace it in first-line regimens. Neither does addition of levofloxacin to the standard first-line regimen improve efficacy or tolerability.</P>
<P>We did not find evidence to support use of the newer fluoroquinolones gatifloxacin or moxifloxacin as a component of the first-line regimen. Four Phase II trials have to date evaluated substitution of these drugs for ethambutol or isoniazid and as yet any evidence of efficacy rests on surrogate endpoints such as different measures of culture conversion which are not universally accepted and reported inconsistently by investigators. In our meta-analysis, we observed no statistically significant differences in culture conversion at eight weeks, the most widely supported surrogate endpoint,. Though overall numbers of adverse events were similar, two trials based on similar safety reporting protocols reported more frequent nausea in participants randomized to moxifloxacin.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-05-03 11:49:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tatyana Abakumova">
<P>Four fluoroquinolones &#8722; ofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, and gatifloxacin &#8722; have been tested in RCTs for treating presumed drug-sensitive TB in a standard six month regimen. None of the tested fluoroquinolones when added to or substituted into the first-line regimen, either separately or in pooled meta-analysis, improved any of the review outcomes: relapse, treatment failure, death, TB-related death, sputum culture conversion at eight weeks, or serious adverse events. Moxifloxacin consistently contributed to more nausea in trial participants. Data are currently lacking regarding use of fluoroquinolones with early ART. Currently there is no high-quality evidence to change existing WHO recommendations relating to fluoroquinolones.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-05-09 11:50:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified several on-going trials that have been designed to further evaluate the potential of fluoroquinolones to shorten the duration of first-line treatment, the results of which are likely to become publicly available in the next few years. These trials are currently predicated on the inconsistently reported and variable results of time-to-event data which could not be meaningfully synthesized in this review and on data from quantitative bacteriology which is not well-supported as a surrogate endpoint and was therefore not included in the scope of the review. In the absence of preliminary proof of efficacy on commonly accepted early endpoints, these trials will provide important data on the definitive endpoint of treatment failure and relapse and emerging safety concerns such as dysglycaemia for gatifloxacin, QT prolongation for moxifloxacin, or tendon rupture for high-dose levofloxacin.</P>
<P>In this review, we noted that the reporting standards in these recently conducted TB trials was variable and lacking in quality. In addition, there were significant differences in terms of inclusion criteria relating to HIV-seropositivity, initial drug resistance, and in the definition of outcomes, and the power of studies. A move towards more standardized approaches to measuring and reporting efficacy outcomes, adverse events, and more high powered studies would greatly improve comparability between TB trials and facilitate subsequent meta-analysis.</P>
<P>Though HIV seropositive participants were represented in the current trials, new trials looking at the efficacy and safety of fluoroquinolones that stratify results by HIV status and use of ART would provide valuable information for future deployment of putative new fluoroquinolone-containing regimens in high burden countries. The most vulnerable populations (pregnant women and children) were excluded from all trials, and represent a critical gap in current knowledge.</P>

<P>2005, Issue 3 (first review version): We did not search SIGLE because we searched for conference proceedings using alternative sources. We added "sputum smear positive" to the definition of the relapse outcome, and added "total number of adverse events" to the list of outcome measures.</P>
<P>2008, Issue 1 (second review version): We did not incorporate changes to the structure of the previously published version of the review.</P>
<P>2013, Issue 1 (third review version): We focused on drug-sensitive TB and excluded trials and comparisons for MDR-TB. We restructured intervention comparisons to better address immediate clinical questions. We renumbered outcomes and abandoned subdivision into primary and secondary ones. We reworded "total number of adverse events" for "total number of people with adverse events". We removed methods for continuous data.

<P>Inclusion criteria: provide written, informed consent prior to all trial-related procedures including HIV<BR/>testing (if an HIV test was performed within 1 month prior to trial start, it should not be repeated as long as documentation can be provided (ELISA, or Western blot, or both); body weight (in light clothing and with no shoes) between 40 kg and 90 kg, inclusive; sputum smear-positive pulmonary TB (at trial appointed laboratory). For drug sensitive TB treatment arms, subjects should be newly diagnosed and previously untreated. Exception: participants can be included in the trial if they were diagnosed and treated for TB greater than 5 years prior to screening and can provide documentation of cure for that episode. Additionally, participants who have previously received H prophylactically can be included as long as that treatment is/was discontinued at least 7 days prior to randomization into this trial. Drug-sensitive status to be confirmed with fluoroquinolone, rifampicin, and isoniazid susceptibility testing at screening using Hain Plus rapid sputum test.<BR/>For the MDR-TB treatment arm only: subjects with smear-positive MDR infection, defined as confirmed resistance to at least both R and H confirmed at screening for entry into this trial. Resistance to R and H will be determined using the rapid screen test (Hain Plus).<BR/>If the first spot sputum shows an indeterminate result, the test must be repeated on freshly collected spot sputum or overnight sputum and that result may be used.<BR/>Subjects with newly diagnosed MDR-TB are defined as a) subjects with MDR-TB who have never been treated for TB before, or b) subjects with MDR-TB who have previously been treated with only one course of first-line TB drugs (H, R, E, Z and/or S) and that treatment is/was discontinued at least 7 days prior to randomization into this trial. Additionally, MDR-TB participants who have previously received H prophylactically can be included as long as that treatment is/was discontinued at least 7 days prior to randomization into this trial; a chest X-ray picture which in the opinion of the Investigator is compatible with TB; sputum positive (at site laboratory) on direct microscopy for acid-fast bacilli (at least 1+ on the IUATLD/WHO scale); ability to produce an adequate volume of sputum as estimated from a spot assessment (estimated 10 ml or more overnight production); females may participate if they are: 1) of non-childbearing potential (have had a bilateral oophorectomy, tubal ligation or hysterectomy or both, or have been postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months), 2) if they are using effective<BR/>birth control methods and are willing to continue practicing birth control methods throughout treatment, or 3) be non-heterosexually active, practice sexual abstinence or have a vasectomized partner (confirmed sterile). Therefore to be eligible for this study women of childbearing potential should either: 1) use a double barrier method to prevent pregnancy (i.e. use a condom with either diaphragm or cervical cap) or 2) use hormonal-based contraceptives in combination with a barrier contraceptive, or 3) use an intrauterine device in combination with a barrier contraceptive. They must also be willing to continue these contraceptive measures until one week after the last dose of study medication or one week after discontinuation from study medication in case of premature discontinuation. (Note: hormone-based contraception alone may not be reliable when taking IMP; therefore, hormone-based contraceptives alone cannot be used by female participants to prevent pregnancy); male participants who are having heterosexual intercourse with females of child-bearing potential are required to use one of the following birth control methods during their participation in the trial and for 12 weeks after their last dose of study medication to prevent pregnancy: a double barrier method which can include a male condom, diaphragm, cervical cap, or female condom; or a barrier method combined with hormone-based contraceptives or an intra-uterine device for the female partner.<BR/>The use of the above mentioned birth control method does not apply if the male participant has been vasectomized or has had a bilateral orchidectomy minimally three months prior to screening, or is not heterosexually active, or practices sexual abstinence, or if the female sexual partner has had a bilateral oophorectomy, tubal ligation or hysterectomy or both, or has been postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months.</P>

<P>Authors did not present data on the most frequent adverse events by study group or on cause of death by study group, or time of death: one death was due to haemoptysis, the other to epileptic seizures and two deaths were attributed to progression of AIDS. Presentation of adverse events in the text and in the table was confusing.</P>
