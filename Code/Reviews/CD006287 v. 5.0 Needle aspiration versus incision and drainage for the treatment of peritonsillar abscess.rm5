<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-12-21 15:42:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>This review compared the effectiveness of the two main treatment options for peritonsillar abscess: needle aspiration and incision and drainage.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Peritonsillar abscesses are infections at the back of the throat in which a collection of pus (abscess) has formed next to the tonsil. The condition is characterised by a severe sore throat, difficulty in swallowing and pain on swallowing, fever and malaise, and trismus (inability to open the mouth completely). Treatment is usually by one of two methods. The first is needle aspiration (sucking the pus out using a syringe and needle) and the second 'incision and drainage' (putting a small knife into the abscess to let the pus drain out). It remains unclear whether one type of treatment is better than the other.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We included 11 studies with a total of 674 participants. The participants in the studies were aged from 8 to 79. The studies were conducted in a number of countries (six from Pakistan, two from the USA, one from Taiwan and two from South Africa). All but one of the 11 studies reported the difference in recurrence rate between needle aspiration and incision and drainage. Four studies compared symptom scores associated with the procedure and two studies compared time to resumption of normal diet. Three studies reported adverse effects/events associated with the intervention. Two studies reported complications of the disease process itself.</P>
<P>The evidence is current to August 2016.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Ten studies reported on the recurrence of peritonsillar abscess (our main outcome). Most of them did not clearly define 'recurrence' and they varied in the timing of its assessment, however we were able to combine (pool) the data from these studies. When we pooled the data the recurrence rate was higher in the needle aspiration group compared with incision and drainage. It is important to note that the evidence for this outcome was of <I>very low quality</I>. Some studies found that patients had more pain when they had incision and drainage.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>We identified problems or potential problems in all of the included studies. The most important of these was that the studies did not all assess recurrence in the same way, at the same time, using the same criteria. The quality of the evidence for all of the outcomes that we looked at was <I>very low</I>.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-12-21 11:45:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Peritonsillar abscess is a common infection presenting as a collection of pus in the peritonsillar area. The condition is characterised by a severe sore throat, difficulty in swallowing and pain on swallowing, fever and malaise, and trismus. Needle aspiration and incision and drainage are the two main treatment modalities currently used in the treatment of this condition. The effectiveness of one versus the other has not been clearly demonstrated and remains an area of debate.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-08-30 11:25:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the ENT Trials Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2016, Issue 7); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials.

<P>Randomised controlled trials comparing needle aspiration with incision and drainage.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-12-21 11:45:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were recurrence rate (proportion of patients needing repeat intervention) and adverse effects associated with the intervention. Secondary outcomes were time to resumption of normal diet, complications of the disease process and symptom scores. We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in <I>italics</I>.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-12-21 15:39:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>We included 11 studies (674 participants). The risk of bias was high or unclear in all of the included studies. All studies compared needle aspiration to incision and drainage.</P>
<P>All but one of the 11 studies reported on the primary outcome of <B>recurrence</B>. When we pooled data from the 10 studies the recurrence rate was higher in the needle aspiration group compared with incision and drainage: risk ratio (RR) 3.74 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.63 to 8.59; 612 participants). We detected moderate heterogeneity in this analysis (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 48%). In interpreting the pooled result it is important to note that the evidence for this outcome was of <I>very low quality</I>.</P>
<P>None of the other outcomes (<B>adverse effects</B> of the intervention, <B>time to resumption of normal diet</B>, <B>complications of the disease process</B> and <B>symptom scores</B>) were consistently measured across all studies.</P>
<P>Only three studies reported on <B>adverse effects/events associated with the intervention</B> and only one such event in a single patient was reported (post-procedure bleeding following incision and drainage: 1/28, 3.6%) (<I>very low-quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>
<B>Time to resumption of normal diet</B> was compared in two studies; neither found an obvious difference between needle aspiration and incision and drainage (<I>very low-quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>Only three studies stated that they would report <B>complications of the disease process</B>. In these three studies, the only complication reported was admission to hospital for dehydration in two patients who underwent incision and drainage (2/13, 6.7%).</P>
<P>
<B>Symptom scores</B> were measured in four studies; three evaluated pain using different scales and one other symptoms. The data could not be pooled in a meta-analysis. Two studies evaluating procedural pain reported this to be lower in the needle aspiration groups. One study found comparable rates of pain resolution at five days post-intervention between groups. The quality of the evidence for symptom scores was <I>very</I> <I>low</I>.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-12-21 11:51:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Although a number of studies have sought to evaluate whether or not needle aspiration or incision and drainage is more effective in patients with peritonsillar abscess, there is no high-quality evidence to allow a firm conclusion to be drawn and the answer remains uncertain. <I>Very low-quality</I> <I>evidence</I> suggests that incision and drainage <I>may</I> be associated with a lower chance of recurrence than needle aspiration. There is some <I>very low-quality</I> <I>evidence</I> to suggest that needle aspiration is less painful.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-12-21 13:16:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Quinsy, better known as peritonsillar abscess, is one of the most common abscesses treated by otolaryngologists. It is one of the most common ear, nose and throat (ENT) emergencies seen in acute ENT clinics and emergency departments in hospitals. Peritonsillar abscesses are a collection of pus between the fibrous capsule of the tonsil and the superior constrictor muscles of the pharynx. A peritonsillar abscess tends to be unilateral (on one side) and is believed to arise from obstructed Weber glands within the superior pole of the tonsil or from acute tonsillitis (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2005</LINK>). In the United States, the incidence is estimated to be 30 people per 100,000 per year, which accounts for about 45,000 cases per year (<LINK REF="STD-Herzon-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Herzon 1995</LINK>). Peritonsillar abscess affects people of all ages (<LINK REF="STD-Herzon-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Herzon 1995</LINK>), and has a significant resource cost (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Powell-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powell 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Patients with a peritonsillar abscess present with fever, dysphagia, trismus, otalgia, a change in the voice and ipsilateral throat pain. On examination there is a swelling in the oropharynx with medialisation of the tonsil. Physical examination usually reveals uvular deviation to the contralateral side, tonsillar exudate, trismus and jugulodigastric lymphadenopathy. Patients with peritonsillar abscesses are at risk of extension of the abscess into deeper neck spaces and airway obstruction. A combination of symptoms and signs is the accepted basis for diagnosis. Further diagnostic investigations are not generally used unless the peritonsillar abscess presents with neck involvement (<LINK REF="REF-Powell-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powell 2012</LINK>). In these circumstances the most common diagnostic test is the computed tomography (CT) scan. CT scans can accurately diagnose peritonsillar abscesses with 100% sensitivity and help to determine the extent of the disease. Ultrasound is less useful, with a diagnostic accuracy of 89% to 95% sensitivity and 79% to 100% specificity, based on level 3 evidence (<LINK REF="REF-Powell-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powell 2012</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-02-22 05:38:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Treatment commonly involves drainage of the abscess together with antibiotics, but there is no agreement on the optimal technique for initial drainage of a peritonsillar abscess (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Herzon-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Herzon 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2003</LINK>). Physicians generally have a choice between needle aspiration and incision and drainage, although quinsy tonsillectomy and antibiotic therapy alone are also less commonly used treatment options. Needle aspiration uses a large-bore needle inserted through the palatoglossus muscles into the abscess. Several insertions of the needle in different locations may be performed during a single treatment episode. The incision and drainage method uses a guarded scalpel to incise the palatoglossus muscle and enter the peritonsillar space/abscess. The peritonsillar space is then opened widely by dissection with blunt forceps to promote drainage of the abscess. A patient with a peritonsillar abscess is sometimes treated with a combination of these methods.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-12-21 11:45:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Patients with a quinsy often present 'out of hours' and in many healthcare settings are first assessed and managed by doctors in training. A survey in the UK showed that 60% of otolaryngologists would use needle aspiration as their primary method for draining a peritonsillar abscess. If the needle aspiration failed, 52% would then perform scalpel incision and drainage. The survey also showed geographic differences in the management of peritonsillar abscess (<LINK REF="REF-Mehanna-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mehanna 2002</LINK>). In Singapore, a retrospective review showed that most patients were treated with scalpel incision and drainage (66%) (<LINK REF="REF-Ong-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ong 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is no consensus regarding the best drainage procedure and each method has risks and benefits. Needle aspiration may potentially be less painful, cheaper and technically easier to perform; it can also double as a diagnostic method. Incision and drainage that includes blunt dissection theoretically promotes more effective drainage of the abscess by dissecting through the tissue barriers (septations) that divide the abscess cavity into micro-cavities or loculations. The resulting wide pathway to the oral cavity allows air to enter the depths of the abscess cavity, increasing the oxygen tension that in turn reduces the survival of anaerobic bacteria exposed to air. However, it is a more invasive method and it has been suggested that it may carry a risk of aspiration of purulent material or incisional injury to underlying structures (<LINK REF="STD-Khayr-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Khayr 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spires-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Spires 1987</LINK>). The method of drainage used may be associated with varying degrees of abscess recurrence, pain and haemorrhage. A review performed by Johnson et al concluded that needle aspiration was the best initial treatment, followed by incision and drainage if needle aspiration failed (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2003</LINK>). Since then, additional studies on this subject have been undertaken, making it important to re-evaluate the available evidence. If there is an optimal drainage procedure for peritonsillar abscesses, then it should be adopted widely.</P>

<P>We used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool in RevMan 5.3 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>), which involves describing each of these domains as reported in the trial and then assigning a judgement about the adequacy of each entry: 'low', 'high' or 'unclear' risk of bias. Each review author independently determined whether a study was sufficiently free of bias in each domain and a majority decision determined the ratings given.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">GRADE and 'Summary of findings' table</HEADING>
<P>Two authors independently used the GRADE approach to rate the overall quality of evidence. The quality of evidence reflects the extent to which we are confident that an estimate of effect is correct and we applied this in the interpretation of results. There are four possible ratings: high, moderate, low and very low. A rating of high quality of evidence implies that we are confident in our estimate of effect and that further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. A rating of very low quality implies that any estimate of effect obtained is very uncertain.</P>
<P>The GRADE approach rates evidence from RCTs that do not have serious limitations as high quality. However, several factors can lead to the downgrading of the evidence to moderate, low or very low. The degree of downgrading is determined by the seriousness of these factors:</P>
<UL>
<LI>study limitations (risk of bias);</LI>
<LI>inconsistency;</LI>
<LI>indirectness of evidence;</LI>
<LI>imprecision; and</LI>
<LI>publication bias.</LI>
</UL>
<P>We included a 'Summary of findings' table, constructed according to the recommendations described in Chapter 10 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Handbook-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handbook 2011</LINK>). We included the following outcomes in the 'Summary of findings' table: recurrence rate, adverse effects/events associated with the intervention, time to resumption of normal diet, complications of the disease process and symptom scores.</P>

<P>Ten out of 11 of the included studies reported recurrence rate following needle aspiration versus incision and drainage (<LINK REF="STD-Chi-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Chi 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khan-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Khan 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khan-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Khan 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khokhar-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Khokhar 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maharaj-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Maharaj 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nwe-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Nwe 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rafi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rafi 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sheikh-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Sheikh 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spires-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Spires 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stringer-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Stringer 1988</LINK>). There was wide variability in the recurrence rate in both groups. Recurrence in the needle aspiration group ranged from 4.9% to 80.0%. In the incision and drainage group recurrence ranged from 0% to 20%. The studies that reported recurrence all reported a comparable or higher recurrence rate with needle aspiration.</P>
<P>Timing of assessment for recurrence was inconsistent. Specifically, timing of assessment for recurrence ranged from one day to seven days for initial post-intervention assessment. The timing of follow-up was not actually specified in four of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chi-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Chi 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khan-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Khan 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khan-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Khan 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rafi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rafi 2007</LINK>). One study did not specifically report recurrence rate (<LINK REF="STD-Younas-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Younas 2015</LINK>). An "initial success rate" was reported; however, this was not defined.</P>
<P>When we pooled data from the 10 studies the recurrence rate was higher in the needle aspiration group compared with incision and drainage: risk ratio (RR) 3.74 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.63 to 8.59; 612 participants). We detected moderate heterogeneity in this analysis (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 48%). In interpreting the pooled result it is important to note that the quality of evidence for this outcome was <I>very low</I>.</P>

They found that 87% of patients treated with needle aspiration returned to semisolid food within two days and solid food within four days. Comparatively, they found that 88% of patients treated with needle aspiration returned to semisolid food by two days and solid food by four days. Two studies described "duration of symptoms" (<LINK REF="STD-Stringer-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Stringer 1988</LINK>) or "period of recovery" (<LINK REF="STD-Rafi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rafi 2007</LINK>), but did not specifically define these terms.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Complications of the disease process</HEADING>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Pain</HEADING>
<P>Two studies reported on pain associated with the intervention. <LINK REF="STD-Chi-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Chi 2014</LINK> reported pain intensity one hour after the procedure with visual analogue scores (out of 10) and found a statistically lower amount of pain in the needle aspiration group (4.5 ± 0.8 in the needle aspiration group versus 5.3 ± 1.1 in the incision and drainage group; mean difference (MD) -0.8, 95% CI -1.16 to -0.44, 10-point scale). <LINK REF="STD-Khan-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Khan 2012</LINK> compared postoperative pain as measured by a "mild/moderate/severe" subjective grade. They reported a statistically significant higher proportion of patients with higher pain scores in the incision and drainage group (needle aspiration: 50.0% mild, 28.6% moderate, 21.4% severe; incision and drainage: 17.9% mild, 21.4% moderate, 60.7% severe; P &lt; 0.01). Outcome measures for these two studies were not comparable and, therefore, meta-analysis was not possible. <LINK REF="STD-Younas-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Younas 2015</LINK> reported on pain five days after the intervention: 75% of patients in the needle aspiration group had no pain, whereas 78% of patients treated with incision and drainage had no pain.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Other symptoms</HEADING>
<P>One study reported symptom scores that were not directly related to procedural pain (<LINK REF="STD-Stringer-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Stringer 1988</LINK>). This study reported symptom scores at presentation and 48 hours (1 = eating normally, minimal to moderate pain; 2 = eating impaired, moderate pain; 3 = unable to eat solids, moderate to severe pain; 4 = unable to eat solids or liquids, severe pain; 5 = unable to eat solids or liquids, severe pain, volume depletion). They found averages of 3.4 (needle aspiration) versus 3.3 (incision and drainage) at presentation and 1.3 (needle aspiration) versus 1.4 (incision and drainage), and complete resolution of symptoms at 10 days post-treatment in all groups (no statistics or confidence intervals provided).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-12-21 13:16:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Peritonsillar abscess is one of the most common ear, nose and throat (ENT) emergencies presenting to acute ENT services and more often than not requires a procedural intervention as the mode of treatment. Despite this, there remains uncertainty about which technique - needle aspiration or incision and drainage - is more effective. There is an absence of high-quality evidence to show whether or not one technique is superior to the other. There is <I>very low-quality</I> evidence to suggest that there is a lower recurrence rate with incision and drainage compared with needle aspiration. At the same time, <I>very low-quality</I> evidence also suggests that needle aspiration may be less painful than incision and drainage. There is an absence of evidence to answer questions about adverse effects/events associated with the intervention, time to resumption of normal diet, complications of the disease process and symptom scores for factors other than pain.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-12-21 13:19:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Data from the studies identified are insufficient to allow us to address all of the objectives of this review and produce a clear and decisive answer. The included studies have enrolled the relevant types of participants. Whilst the studies do evaluate the interventions we sought to include, in some cases those interventions were part of a treatment plan involving periods of hospitalisation and courses of intravenous or oral antibiotics (or both) of varying length. This is relevant because in some healthcare settings patients are almost invariably managed as outpatients without being admitted to hospital. Not all outcomes that we felt were important had been investigated in the included studies. More significantly, the failure to define 'recurrence' and to include comprehensive information about the timing of any recurrence or its identification makes the evidence base incomplete. In all cases, for those outcomes for which we found data, the evidence was of <I>very low quality</I>.</P>
<P>There are likely to be geographic or institutional differences in the presentation of peritonsillar abscess. Six out of 11 studies originated from the same country (Pakistan) (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). Different microbial patterns and choice of antimicrobial agents in different geographic areas could theoretically influence recurrence rates. The different settings in which patients were treated in the included studies highlights the potential for variation through different management protocols; over half of the included studies managed patients in an inpatient setting. Other factors of relevance include the likelihood of seeking medical attention, access to medical care and costs or thresholds for performing a repeat intervention.</P>
<P>In this review, we have not compared other treatment options for the management of patients with a peritonsillar abscess. So called 'quinsy tonsillectomy' or 'hot tonsillectomy' is another option available for treatment. We have not compared quinsy tonsillectomy, given that it is less commonly performed as a first-line treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Qureshi-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Qureshi 2015</LINK>), and that different practical considerations guide the decision to perform it (such as patient age and operating room resources). We have also not compared non-interventional options, such as antibiotic therapy alone. This was done in order to answer a specific clinical question of interest, as opposed to exploring all the available options for treating peritonsillar abscesses.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-12-21 13:24:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Overall, the quality of evidence is <I>very low</I> for all the included outcomes (assessed using the GRADE criteria, see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). The high risk of bias and flawed design of the studies reviewed is apparent when they are analysed using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). The descriptions of the methods used in most studies lacked the detail required to assess risk of bias completely. None of this review's predetermined outcome measures were well assessed by any of the trials. The specific criteria for determining recurrence were poorly defined in all of the studies.</P>
<P>A number of studies included in this review had recurrence rates higher than we might normally expect from day-to-day practice. In one study, the needle aspiration group had a recurrence rate as high as 80% (<LINK REF="STD-Rafi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rafi 2007</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Khan-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Khan 2012</LINK> had a recurrence rate as high as 64% in the needle aspiration group. Several studies had recurrence rates over 20% in the needle aspiration group (<LINK REF="STD-Khan-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Khan 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nwe-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Nwe 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sheikh-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Sheikh 2012</LINK>). These recurrence rates differ significantly from the recurrence rates reported in other published studies and from our experience. In the review by <LINK REF="REF-Powell-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powell 2012</LINK>, an overall recurrence rate for peritonsillar abscess of ~10% was estimated with either needle aspiration or incision and drainage. This raises the question of the competence of the clinician or practitioner managing the condition and the criteria for defining recurrence, as well as the question of regional differences in peritonsillar abscess presentation and management. Ideally, recurrence should be confirmed by evidence of pus at a repeat incision or needle aspiration procedure. The absence of clearly stated diagnostic criteria for peritonsillar abscess recurrence in the studies makes it impossible to determine whether the same patients presenting to another clinician would be diagnosed as suffering from a recurrence or the more common post-inflammatory oedema associated with a recent abscess.</P>
<P>The heterogeneity encountered in our assessment of recurrence rate, whilst only moderate (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 48%), merits further discussion. As mentioned earlier, most of the studies did not clearly define 'recurrence' and varied widely in the timing of post-intervention recurrence assessment. Only four of the 10 studies that measured recurrence provided a definition for what constituted 'recurrence' or specified criteria for re-intervention. Definitions of recurrence included visual evidence of swelling (<LINK REF="STD-Stringer-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Stringer 1988</LINK>), persistence of pyrexia/trismus (<LINK REF="STD-Nwe-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Nwe 2000</LINK>), or persistent odynophagia (<LINK REF="STD-Sheikh-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Sheikh 2012</LINK>). Only one study defined recurrence with reference to the review's definition of an abscess, that is as "reaccumulation of pus" (<LINK REF="STD-Maharaj-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Maharaj 1991</LINK>). This study did not describe how the presence of pus was determined. Therefore, 'recurrence' in the studies reviewed could be anything along a spectrum from simply some residual symptoms to true reaccumulation of pus. Additionally, the timing of post-treatment assessment for recurrence was not stated in four of the studies and was variable amongst the remaining studies (ranging from post-procedure day 1 to 7). The inter-study variation in the timing of post-treatment review and the criteria used to diagnose peritonsillar abscess recurrence raises the question of whether 'recurrence' &#8211; unless much more clearly defined &#8211; is a valid outcome metric. Inter-study methodological variation could account for the majority of the heterogeneity in recurrence rates. However, other factors may have contributed; it would be reasonable to postulate that clinical variability also contributed to the heterogeneity, given that there was wide inter-study variation in treatment setting and adjunctive variables.</P>
<P>There is inherent operator variability in the delivery of the primary intervention itself. In many settings care for patients with quinsy is delivered by relatively junior doctors. We have defined the interventions as above (<LINK TAG="CRIT_INTERVENTIONS" TYPE="SECTION">Types of interventions</LINK>). However, differences in operator skill may partly explain differences in the outcome of the interventional studies. Variation in the timing of patient presentation for health care, co-treatment factors such as antibiotic choice, and access and compliance with the prescribed antibiotic regimen in these studies, which are drawn from countries with divergent healthcare resources, may also account for heterogeneous outcomes. Limited methodological descriptions and our inability to gain further information from the authors make it difficult to explore these possible explanations.</P>
<P>One of the theoretical arguments against incision and drainage is that it is a more painful procedure for patients. Given that incision and drainage often involves a diagnostic needle aspiration in addition to further procedural intervention, it is understandable that this theory exists. In our review, two studies (n = 166) did suggest that subjective pain scores were higher in patients who underwent incision and drainage compared to needle aspiration (<LINK REF="STD-Chi-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Chi 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khan-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Khan 2012</LINK>). One study showed comparable resolution of pain at five days post-treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Younas-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Younas 2015</LINK>). Given that this was assessed at five days after the procedure, it is difficult to separate the pain associated with the procedure from the resolution of pain associated with improvement of the disease process. Different measurement scales made pooled analysis impractical. However, the data are of limited quality for the reasons mentioned above and, therefore, this remains unclear.</P>

<P>We think it is unlikely that there have been significant biases in the review process itself. Whilst it is likely that all or most relevant studies have been identified, our failure to identify useable data from each included study has been universal. A few minor post hoc changes to the methods we had planned at protocol stage (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2014</LINK>) are described in <LINK TAG="PRO_REV_DIFF" TYPE="SECTION">Differences between protocol and review</LINK>.</P>

<P>Currently, only <I>very low-quality</I> <I>evidence</I> is available to determine whether needle aspiration or incision and drainage is most effective for treating peritonsillar abscess. This suggests that incision and drainage is associated with a lower recurrence rate. The absence of high-quality evidence results in a dilemma for practitioners and patients. Through shared and informed decision-making, practitioners and patients must balance the potential - but uncertain - benefit of an incision and drainage procedure, which <I>may</I> be more painful, against needle aspiration, which may have of a greater chance of recurrence but be potentially less painful.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-12-12 10:38:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>A sufficiently powered, well-designed, high-quality study is required to compare the effectiveness of needle aspiration with incision and drainage for the treatment of peritonsillar abscesses. If a randomised controlled clinical trial were conducted, it would be useful to compare recurrence (in a strictly defined manner), adverse events/effects associated with the intervention, time until resumption of normal diet, complications of the disease process and symptom scores.</P>

Given that adolescents and older children with peritonsillar abscess are often managed similarly to adults, we thought that the review would also be applicable to this age group. Younger patients typically require a general anaesthetic for management and, therefore, have different practical considerations for intervention. We therefore made a decision to include trials with older children (age <U>&gt;</U> 8), adolescents and adults.</P>
<P>We added the methods for the creation of a 'Summary of findings' table and GRADE assessment to the review after the protocol was published.</P>
<P>We also added a standard statement to clarify the role of outcomes in the review (<LINK TAG="CRIT_OUTCOMES" TYPE="SECTION">Types of outcome measures</LINK>).</P>
