<P>Inhaled steroids help control inflammation in the airways of the lung. There are numerous different preparations available, and we have assessed how varying the dose of beclomethasone (BDP) affects asthma in this review. There was a limited amount of evidence that 800mcg/d was superior to 400mcg/d in improving morning and evening peak flow. More research into the effects of different doses of BDP is required. </P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) is available in a wide range of daily doses for the treatment of long-term asthma.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the evidence for a dose response relationship for BDP in the treatment of long-term asthma.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Airways Group trial register, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (The Cochrane Library issue 1 1999) and references lists of articles. Authors and Glaxo Wellcome UK were contacted to identify eligible studies. We also hand searched the proceeding from relevant respiratory society meetings, the British Journal of Clinical Research and the European Journal of Clinical Research for studies.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Prospective, randomised trials comparing two or more daily doses of BDP in patients over the age of two years with long-term asthma.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Trials were selected for inclusion and scored for quality by two reviewers. Data were extracted by one reviewer. Authors were contacted to clarify details of study design and retrieve missing data.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-07-21 13:30:23 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>15 trials were included. Methodological quality was variable. Studies rarely gave a clear indication of the degree of asthma control at baseline. Less than two-fold to five-fold dose differences were assessed by different studies. The results are reported as weighted mean differences (WMD) with 95% confidence limits (95% CI). The number of trials (N) contributing to each outcome is stated. In non-oral steroid treated asthmatics a small advantage of BDP 800 mcg/d over 400 mcg/d was apparent for improvement in morning peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) compared to baseline, WMD 11 L/min (95% CI 4 to 19 L/min) N=2; improvement in forced expired volume in one second (FEV1) compared to baseline, WMD 9 ml (95% CI 3 to 140) N=1; and reduction in night-time symptom score compared to baseline, WMD 0.13 (95% CI 0.04 to 0.22) N=1. Studies that assessed BDP 1000 v 500 mcg/d and BDP 1600 v 400 mcg/d demonstrated significant advantage of higher dose over lower dose for histamine bronchial hyper-responsiveness (BHR) and percentage improvement in FEV1 compared to baseline. No differences between higher and lower daily doses of BDP were apparent for daytime symptoms, withdrawals due to asthma exacerbation, oropharyngeal side effects or measures of hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function. No difference in prednisolone sparing effect was apparent when comparing high dose and low dose BDP in oral corticosteroid (OCS) dependent patients.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>BDP appears to demonstrate a shallow dose response effect in long-term asthma for a small number of efficacy outcomes over range of daily doses from 400 mcg/d to 1600 mcg/d, although the clinical significance of the improvements afforded by higher doses is questionable.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-07-21 13:31:51 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) was introduced in the early 1970's for the treatment of chronic asthma. Extensive experience has been gained in its use on a world-wide basis; it is generally acknowledged to be safe and effective. BDP is available in a range of formulations by metered dose inhaler (MDI) and various dry powder inhaler (DPI) devices. The nominal daily dose that a patient can be prescribed falls over a 40 fold difference in dose from 50 mcg/d to 2000 mcg/d. The term 'dose response' refers to significant improvements in the size of a given outcome with increasing dose. When considering inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) the issue of whether an important dose response effect exists can be framed as two clinical questions: a) Do patients with poorly controlled asthma gain additional benefit by starting ICS treatment at higher as opposed to lower doses? b) For patients in whom asthma is not adequately controlled on a given dose of ICS, are additional benefits gained by increasing the dose? Current asthma guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-GINA-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-NHLBI-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHLBI 1997</LINK>) recommend higher starting doses in patients with more severe symptoms and increasing the daily dose if symptoms are uncontrolled. This advice is based on the assumption that beneficial effects increase with dose. However, a systematic review recently undertaken comparing BDP to placebo did not provide evidence for a dose response effect that would support this approach (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2000</LINK>). This review concluded that BDP was significantly more effective than placebo in improving measures of airway calibre, bronchial hyper-responsiveness and symptoms in patients who were not receiving oral corticosteroid (OCS) tablets such as prednisolone. BDP also had a significant OCS sparing effect in OCS treated asthmatics when compared to placebo. However higher daily doses of BDP (1000 mcg/d or greater) appeared to be no more effective than lower doses (400 mcg/d or less) for any measure of efficacy. Inferences concerning dose response effect in this review need to be interpreted with caution however because the studies included did not directly compare different doses of BDP. Dose response is ideally assessed by trials in which patients are randomised to two (or more) doses of inhaled corticosteroid within the same trial. The purpose of this review was to systematically assess the studies in which two or more doses of BDP were compared.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>1. To assess efficacy and safety outcomes in studies that compared inhaled BDP at different nominal daily doses in the treatment of chronic asthma.</P>
<P>2. To test for the presence of a dose response effect.</P>

<METHODS MODIFIED="2008-07-21 13:16:48 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Only prospective randomised studies were considered. Double, single or unblinded studies were eligible for inclusion. Studies could either be of parallel group or crossover design.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Studies including children and/or adults with a clinical diagnosis of asthma. Only patients over the age of 2 years were included. Studies that recruited patients with both asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were considered if the data for asthmatic patients were available separately. Studies conducted in primary care, hospital outpatient or institutional care setting were considered.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>BDP at one nominal daily dose delivered by oral inhalation compared to at least one other daily dose of BDP. Treatment periods had to be for at least one week. Delivery could be by either pressurised-metered dose inhaler (MDI) with or without holding chamber/spacer, breath-actuated metered dose inhaler or dry powder inhaler. Studies using nebuliser were excluded. Any co-intervention was acceptable, including the use of oral corticosteroids.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>Most outcome measures were considered. Those of particular interest included:<BR/> <BR/>1. Measures of airway calibre: forced expired volume in one second (FEV1), morning and evening diary card peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), diurnal variability in diary card PEFR, clinic PEFR<BR/>2. Symptom scores<BR/>3. Rescue beta2 agonist use<BR/>4. Bronchial hyper-responsiveness (BHR): using either methacholine or histamine challenge<BR/>5. Health status/Quality of life assessment<BR/>6. Asthma exacerbations: hospital admission rates, days off work or school, unscheduled doctor visits or emergency department attendance due to exacerbation.<BR/>7. Safety outcomes: hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function assessed by serum and urinary cortisol measures.<BR/>8. Oropharyngeal side effects: hoarseness, sore or dry mouth/throat, oropharyngeal Candidiasis</P>
<P>Outcomes that were not considered included growth assessment in children, bone densitometry and biochemical markers of bone turnover.</P>

<P>The bibliographies of all papers retrieved in full text form and relevant narrative reviews were searched for additional publications. The British Journal of Clinical Research and the European Journal of Clinical Research (journals not currently indexed on Medline or EMBASE), were hand searched. Authors of included studies were contacted and asked if they were aware of further studies that had been missed. The UK headquarters of Glaxo Wellcome, manufacturers of Becotide and Becloforte were contacted to obtain details of studies that had been sponsored. Finally, the proceedings of meetings of the European Respiratory Society (1997/1998), British Thoracic Society (1997/1998) and American Thoracic Society (1997 to 1999) were searched for relevant trials. This was undertaken in an attempt to identify relevant trials that may have been completed but not yet reached peer reviewed journal publication.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2008-07-21 13:15:50 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Studies were categorised based on the presence or absence of treatment with a regular OCS such as prednisolone tablets at the point of enrolment. It was expected that most trials in patients receiving a regular OCS would use a 'steroid-sparing' design in which the daily dose was progressively reduced. In such studies the principal outcome is the daily dose OCS required to maintain asthma control unchanged. Conversely, studies in which patients were not treated with a regular OCS are more likely to have a design aimed at detecting improvements in asthma control. It would be inappropriate to combine trials with these different designs and aims.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Populations</HEADING>
<P>Studies were mainly undertaken in Western Europe (Denmark, Italy, The Netherlands and the UK), North America (USA and Canada). One study (<LINK REF="STD-So-1986" TYPE="STUDY">So 1986</LINK>) was conducted in Hong Kong. Only one study was conducted in primary care (<LINK REF="STD-Drepaul-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Drepaul 1989</LINK>); all others were conducted in a hospital outpatient setting. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Verberne-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Verberne 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wolthers-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Wolthers 1993</LINK>) were conducted in children, the remainders were in adults.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Study design</HEADING>
<P>Six studies (40%) were of parallel group design, nine (60%) of crossover design. Nine studies had a treatment period of 1-4 weeks, three (20%) a treatment period of 1-6 months. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hummel-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hummel 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Verberne-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Verberne 1998</LINK>) had treatment periods of between six and 12 months.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>A range of nominal daily doses was compared, ranging from a less than two-fold dose difference to five-fold dose difference. In 11 studies, different daily doses of BDP were administered using identical delivery device (MDI, MDI+spacer or DPI). In four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chatterjee-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Chatterjee 1980</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Drepaul-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Drepaul 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lal-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Lal 1980</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-So-1986" TYPE="STUDY">So 1986</LINK>) different delivery devices were used, however the lower comparison dose of BDP was consistently delivered via MDI, higher dose via DPI.</P>

In one study (<LINK REF="STD-De-Marzo-1988" TYPE="STUDY">De Marzo 1988</LINK>) patients had occupational asthma defined by sensitivity to toluene diisocyanate (TDI). In seven studies (47%), diagnosis was supported by significant reversibility of FEV1 or PEFR in response to inhaled beta2 agonist.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This review has evaluated the small number of RCT's that have assessed the relative efficacy of BDP at different doses in long-term asthma. Interpretation is complicated by the fact that a wide range of dose comparisons were made in studies, spanning less than two-fold to five-fold dose differences. The majority of studies assessing different doses of BDP in non-oral steroid treated asthmatics were crossover studies, with small patient numbers. No significant differences between doses compared were found for most outcomes assessed by these trials. Because almost all assessed different daily dose combinations of BDP and could not be pooled in a meta-analysis, these studies do not allow any firm conclusions to be drawn regarding dose response effect. However, the following conclusions can be made when considering the parallel design studies. </P>
<P>In non-oral steroid treated asthmatics BDP does appear to exhibit a shallow dose response effect for a number of clinically relevant outcomes. Evidence for this comes from two large, fair quality parallel group studies, one undertaken in children, one in adults. Both were undertaken in subjects already receiving an ICS. Higher dose BDP appears to be more efficacious than lower dose BDP when assessed by a number of outcomes. When two fold (800 v 400 mcg/d) and four fold (1600 v 400 mcg/d) dose differences were compared, a small improvement in favour of higher dose was evident for change in FEV1 compared to baseline, WMD 9ml (95% CI 3 to 140ml), and percentage change in FEV1 compared to baseline (+16% v +7% p&lt;0.03) respectively. BDP 800 mcg/d also resulted in small advantages over BDP 400 mcg/d for improvement in morning PEFR compared to baseline: WMD 11 L/min (95% CI 4 to 19 L/min); evening PEFR: WMD 8 L/min (95% CI 0 to 16 L/min); reduction in night-time symptoms compared to baseline: WMD 0.13 (95% CI 0.04 to 0.22), and reduction in daytime beta2 agonist use, WMD 0.49 puffs/d (95% CI 0.02 to 0.96 puffs/d). Current asthma management guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-GINA-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-NHLBI-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHLBI 1997</LINK>) recommend an increase in dose of BDP when control of symptoms, exacerbations and lung function cannot be achieved at lower daily doses. This is based on the assumption that higher doses lead to improved asthma control. These results provide some support for this approach, although the improvements seen in FEV1 and PEFR are of questionable clinical benefit. These studies did not provide any evidence for dose dependent differences in the experience of daytime symptoms or withdrawal rates due to asthma exacerbation. A dose response effect for histamine BHR was demonstrated in a single low quality crossover study where BDP 1000 mcg/d led to significant improvements compared to BDP 500 mcg/d (<LINK REF="STD-Carpentiere-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Carpentiere 1990</LINK>). This outcome was not reported in any other trial. </P>
<P>The evidence concerning the relative efficacy of BDP as an oral steroid sparing agent in oral steroid dependent asthma comes from two relatively large parallel group studies of fair methodological quality. Because different doses of BDP were compared and different outcomes were reported, results could not be pooled. Different dose comparisons were made in individual studies (300 v 1500 mcg/d, 800 v 2000 mcg/d), but throughout these ranges no significant difference in oral prednisolone use (reduction compared to baseline or absolute daily dose) or number of patients able to reduce their oral prednisolone dose were apparent. </P>
<P>Methodological limitations:</P>
<P>Few studies met the inclusion criteria for review and individual studies assessed different BDP dose comparisons. The results of most studies could not therefore be pooled in a meaningful way. The majority of studies were crossover trials of small numbers of patients and may not have had sufficient power to detect clinically meaningful treatment differences. Many did not have ICS free washout periods between doses and significant carryover effects cannot be excluded. The strength of evidence from these individual studies is therefore low, and conclusions regarding relative effectiveness of the different BDP doses compared in these trials cannot be made. </P>
<P>Because few trials could be pooled subgroup analyses to explore the influence of asthma severity, prior inhaled corticosteroid use, patient age, delivery device and treatment duration could not be undertaken.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>A previous systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2000</LINK>) has shown that BDP results in clinically significant improvements in FEV1, PEFR and symptoms with reductions in rescue beta2 agonist use and likelihood of exacerbation when compared to placebo, although no evidence for a dose response was found for doses above 400 mcg/d. The evidence available from this review in which doses of BDP were directly compared does suggests a shallow dose response effect exists over a dose range of 400 to 1600 mcg/d in children and adults with non-oral steroid treated asthma. Current guidelines recommend increasing the dose of BDP when asthma control is inadequate on lower daily doses. The findings of this review are consistent with the rationale for such an approach. However the improvements seen in FEV1 and PEFR are small, of questionable clinical significance and there is no evidence that doses over 400 mcg/d lead to reductions in symptoms or the likelihood of asthma exacerbations.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There is a place for further studies assessing the relative benefits of different doses of BDP in the treatment of long-term asthma. Drawing meaningful conclusions from this review was hampered by the fact that small, under-powered crossover studies that could not be aggregated accounted for a high proportion of included trials. Further studies are needed to confirm the findings of the few studies that could be evaluated . A number of clinically important outcome measures were not reported in any of the studies included in this review, including health status/quality of life assessment, days lost from work/school due to exacerbations, GP attendance rates due to exacerbation and hospital admissions. These types of outcome can only be assessed in longer-term (&gt; 6 months) parallel group studies with sufficiently large numbers of patients such that clinically meaningful differences can be detected, if they truly exist. There is a place for such trials in the future. </P>
<P>In considering the issue of dose response two distinct questions can be posed. Firstly, do patients with poorly controlled asthma achieve greater benefit from higher as opposed to lower starting doses of BDP. Secondly, do patients with suboptimally controlled asthma already treated with BDP achieve better control if dose is increased. In order to fully answer these questions studies comparing different doses need to be conducted in both ICS naive and ICS treated asthmatics with clearly defined levels of baseline control in terms of FEV (% predicted), PEFR variability, symptoms, rescue beta2 agonist use and frequency of exacerbations. Although this review provides some evidence of a relative difference in efficacy between higher and lower doses, further studies with these design considerations are needed in order to gain a clearer picture of dose response in these separate clinical situations. Such studies should also allow an assessment as to whether dose response effects vary significantly with the degree of underlying asthma severity.</P>
