<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-05-10 12:35:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Endometrial (womb) cancer is the most common genital tract cancer in developed countries. Progestagen (a hormone) therapy is sometimes used following initial surgery to reduce the risk of recurrence. However, progestagens have been found to reduce one of the protective factors against heart disease and may also make tumours more resistant to radiotherapy. This review found no evidence to support the use of progestagen as an addition to surgery for newly diagnosed endometrial cancer. Progestagen can, however, prevent or delay recurrence of cancer in some patients.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-05-10 15:22:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>Seven trials assessing 4556 women were identified. Three trials included women with stage one disease only, whereas four included women with more advanced disease. Meta-analysis of four trials showed that there was no significant difference in the risk of death at five years between adjuvant progestagen therapy and no further treatment (RR = 1.00, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.18). This conclusion is also robust to single trial analyses at 4 and 7 years and in one trial across all points in time using a hazard ratio (HR). There was also no significant difference between progestagen therapy and control in terms of the risk of death from endometrial cancer, cardiovascular disease and intercurrent disease. Relapse of disease appeared to be reduced by progestagen therapy in one trial (HR = 0.71, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.97 and 5 year RR = 0.74, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.96), but there was no evidence of a difference in disease recurrence in another trial at 7 years (RR = 1.34, 95% CI 0.79 to 2.27).</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-11-20 11:36:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is no evidence to support the use of adjuvant progestagen therapy in the primary treatment of endometrial cancer. There have now been several RCTs which have failed to establish a role for adjuvant progestagen therapy after primary treatment for endometrial cancer and therefore, further trials in this field are probably not justified.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-05-10 15:23:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>Endometrial (womb) cancer encompasses a group of tumours affecting the lining of the womb (or uterus), known as the endometrium. It is the most common genital tract carcinoma in women in developed countries; the age-standardised incidence is 9.1 per 100,000 women per year in more developed countries, compared with 1.7 per 100,000 per year in less developed countries (<LINK REF="REF-GLOBOCAN-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">GLOBOCAN 2008</LINK>).
 
The incidence of endometrial cancer in the EU is 16 per 100,000 with approximately 7200 British women diagnosed each year (<LINK REF="REF-Baekerlandt-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baekerlandt 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cancer-Research-UK-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cancer Research UK 2010</LINK>). Worldwide it is the seventh most common cancer in women and occurs predominately in postmenopausal women (91% of cases in women over 45 years old) (<LINK REF="REF-Baekerlandt-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baekerlandt 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>A large proportion of women (approximately 70%) present with stage 1 disease <LINK REF="REF-SEER-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">SEER 2011</LINK>. The overall unadjusted five year survival for stage 1 disease is 96% <LINK REF="REF-SEER-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">SEER 2011</LINK>, but women with advanced disease can have a survival expectancy as low as 23% (<LINK REF="REF-SEER-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">SEER 2011</LINK>). In Europe, just over a fifth of women with endometrial cancer have died five years after diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-EUROCARE-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">EUROCARE 2003</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-05-04 17:37:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Adjuvant progestagen therapy has been advocated following primary surgery to reduce the risk of recurrence of disease. Progestagens have been demonstrated in observational studies to have a limited role in palliation in recurrent and extensive endometrial cancer. Clinicians used to think that administering progestagens in the adjuvant setting prolonged survival.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-05-10 12:37:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>We have reviewed the published RCTs evaluating the effectiveness of this therapy. In the 1970s and 1980s several small observational studies suggested a survival advantage if progestagens were administered in a palliative setting in endometrial cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Kauppila-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kauppila 1984</LINK>). Many surgeons believed that progestagens would benefit women in an adjuvant setting following surgery for endometrial cancer. The aim of this review was to evaluate evidence from RCTs.</P>

<P>Seven trials, randomising a total of 4556 women, met the inclusion criteria. In all trials, except that of <LINK REF="STD-Lewis-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Lewis 1974</LINK>, patients had surgery (total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy) and then adjuvant radiotherapy if indicated by standard pathological criteria. In the trial by Lewis, patients with stage I disease were divided into two groups irrespective of pathological criteria; the first group had pre-operative intracavitary radiotherapy and surgery, while the second group was treated by surgery alone.</P>
<P>In some trials, only patients with stage 1 disease were recruited (<LINK REF="STD-Lewis-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Lewis 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Malkasian-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Malkasian 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DePalo-1993" TYPE="STUDY">DePalo 1993</LINK>), while the remaining studies included patients with more severe disease (<LINK REF="STD-MacDonald-1988" TYPE="STUDY">MacDonald 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vergote-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Vergote 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Urbanski-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Urbanski 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-COSA_x002d_NZ_x002d_UK-1998" TYPE="STUDY">COSA-NZ-UK 1998</LINK>). Tumour stage, degree of differentiation and depth of myometrial invasion of disease are important prognostic variables which should be equally distributed between treatment and control groups. This appeared to be the case in all but one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Urbanski-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Urbanski 1993</LINK>), where the treatment group had systematically better prognostic features. Furthermore, in 26% of patients in the control group the depth of myometrial invasion was not known, compared to 11% in the treatment group. The trial by <LINK REF="STD-Vergote-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Vergote 1989</LINK> was the only other trial to have incomplete data on the degree of myometrial invasion. However the difference in the proportion of missing data was not great; 7% and 5% in the treatment and control groups respectively.</P>
<P>In theory, prolonged progestagen therapy predisposes to cardiovascular disease as it potentially increases the proportion of saturated fats in the blood stream. However, <LINK REF="STD-Malkasian-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Malkasian 1978</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-COSA_x002d_NZ_x002d_UK-1998" TYPE="STUDY">COSA-NZ-UK 1998</LINK> were the only trials that gave information about pre-trial risk factors such as diabetes, hypertension or obesity.</P>

<P>All seven trials documented the total number of deaths in both treatment and control groups, but the time frame in which the data were analysed is incompletely reported. In the <LINK REF="STD-Urbanski-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Urbanski 1993</LINK> trial, adjuvant progestagen therapy appeared to have a large and significant reduction in the rate of deaths at five years (RR = 0.10, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.30), with an overall survival rate at five years in the treatment group of 97% compared to 69% in the control group. However, analysis of patients' risk factors demonstrated an imbalance favouring the treatment group and all treated patients with stage II and III disease survived, whereas only 55% of such patients in the control group survived. These extreme results are completely out of keeping with the much more modest effects observed in the remaining six trials.</P>
<P>The I<SUP>2</SUP> test confirmed that the trials were highly heterogeneous for overall survival at five years if <LINK REF="STD-Urbanski-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Urbanski 1993</LINK> was included (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 79%) but the amount of heterogeneity was substantially reduced when this trial was excluded in a sensitivity analysis (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 7%). Exclusion of the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Urbanski-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Urbanski 1993</LINK> from the meta-analysis thus appears justified by the substantial heterogeneity induced by its inclusion.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-05-10 13:39:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>A review of the currently available published trials suggested that the OS of patients with endometrial cancer is not influenced by adjuvant progestagen therapy. Adjuvant progestagen therapy may be expected to have an adverse effect on deaths from intercurrent disease, particularly cardiovascular related deaths as blood bourne saturated fats increase with progestagens therefore potentially putting patients at risk. However in the two trials by <LINK REF="STD-MacDonald-1988" TYPE="STUDY">MacDonald 1988</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-DePalo-1993" TYPE="STUDY">DePalo 1993</LINK> in which long term therapy was used, there was similar risk of such deaths in the treatment and control groups. Furthermore, the trial of <LINK REF="STD-Vergote-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Vergote 1989</LINK> demonstrated no increased risk of hypertension.</P>
<P>Within FIGO stage I disease, subgroups of patients can be identified by surgico-pathological staging who have a much worse five year survival. It is among these high risk patients that progestagen treatment (or any other adjuvant treatment) has the most scope to act. Thus, inclusion of all endometrial cancers could dilute the effect of progestagens in more severe cases. It might also dilute potential harm if, for example, progestagens make those tumours more resistant to radiotherapy. It is therefore a pity that only the <LINK REF="STD-DePalo-1993" TYPE="STUDY">DePalo 1993</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-COSA_x002d_NZ_x002d_UK-1998" TYPE="STUDY">COSA-NZ-UK 1998</LINK> trials gave sufficient data for analysis of results in a subgroup with adverse prognostic factors. However, only the <LINK REF="STD-COSA_x002d_NZ_x002d_UK-1998" TYPE="STUDY">COSA-NZ-UK 1998</LINK> trial suggests a non-significant benefit for high risk cases. While inclusion of patients with predominantly good prognostic factors might obscure the effects of progestagens on endometrial cancer related deaths, the effect of progestagens on intercurrent deaths is much less likely to be influenced by the severity of the original disease.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-05-10 13:39:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>All of these trials with the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Urbanski-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Urbanski 1993</LINK> demonstrated no evidence of a difference between adjuvant progestagen therapy after surgery and no further treatment for endometrial cancer. All RCTs of progestagen therapy included in the review were conducted prior to the year 2000 and demonstrated limited benefit of adjuvant radiotherapy. Therefore many of the patients included in the six RCTS would have had adjuvant radiotherapy in contrast to current 2011 consensus guidelines. It is unlikely that the current limited use of radiotherapy would influence the efficacy of progestagens.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2011-05-10 13:39:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Seven trials were included in this review. In total 4351 women participated. We have used a pragmatic approach to RCTs included in the comparisons. The trials used variations in the dose and route of administration of progestagens. The individual trials used different time points to measure survival and used different endpoints regarding intercurrent deaths. The RCTs were conducted during a time period when the reporting of RCTs was not standardised and many of the reports did not declare certain details regarding methodological quality and risk of bias components. As these RCTs were large multi-centre RCTs, it is likely they employed optimal methodology but this can not be assumed.</P>
<P>Many of the outcomes analysed included meta analyses of only a small number of RCTs or the results of single trials due to the incomplete reporting of outcome measures and heterogeneous time points chosen which limits the conclusions which may be drawn.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2011-05-10 11:27:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>This review used extensive electronic literature databases searches and hand searching of journals. Two review authors extracted the data with a third person settling any disagreements. We restricted the included studies to RCTs as they provide the strongest level of evidence available. Hence we have attempted to reduce bias in the review process.</P>
<P>The greatest threat to the validity of the review is likely to be the possibility of publication bias i.e. studies that did not find the treatment to have been effective may not have been published. We were unable to assess this possibility as the analyses were restricted to meta-analyses of a small number of trials or single trials.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2011-05-03 15:55:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are no other systematic reviews in this field. All the individual RCTs except <LINK REF="STD-Urbanski-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Urbanski 1993</LINK> demonstrated the lack of effect of adjuvant progestagens. The outcomes of this update are consistent with previous versions of this review.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-05-10 13:40:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Progestagens have an established place in the palliative treatment of women with advanced endometrial cancer. However, a review of the currently available trials failed to demonstrate that adjuvant progestagen therapy has a significant beneficial effect on survival. The trials included in this review are predominantly based on low risk patients where adequate statistical precision is hard to attain as the survival of early disease is extremely good. However, the available evidence points towards the conclusion that progestagens may have no role in the primary treatment of endometrial cancer.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-05-10 12:35:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>There have now been several RCTs which have failed to establish a role for adjuvant progestagen therapy after primary treatment for endometrial cancer. Therefore, further trials in this field are probably not justified.</P>

<P>Funnel plots corresponding to meta-analysis of the primary outcome will be examined to assess the potential for small study effects such as publication bias. If these plots suggest that treatment effects may not be sampled from a symmetric distribution, as assumed by the random effects model, further meta-analyses will be performed using fixed effects models".</P>
<P>None of the trials imputed missing data.

<P>We will perform sensitivity analyses, excluding trials which do not report adequate (i) concealment of allocation, (ii) blinding of the outcome assessor".</P>

The removal of the <LINK REF="STD-Urbanski-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Urbanski 1993</LINK> trial considerably reduced the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic meaning that there was less heterogeneity in the pooled trials.
