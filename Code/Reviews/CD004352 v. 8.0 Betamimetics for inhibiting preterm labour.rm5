<P>Preterm labour is when women go into labour before 37 weeks' gestation<B>.</B> Babies born before term (preterm birth) have poorer outcomes compared with babies who are born at term. The earlier the baby is born, the poorer the outcome. Most preterm births occur in low-income countries where medical help is less readily available. Preterm birth is a major cause of infant deaths and serious illness worldwide. Preterm birth can result in respiratory distress syndrome and chronic lung disease, bleeding into the fluid spaces (ventricles) within the brain (intraventricular haemorrhage)), generalised infection or infection of the blood stream (sepsis), cerebral palsy and other neuro-developmental impairments. Even short delays in preterm birth can enable women to reach specialist care and receive 'corticosteroid' drugs that are given to women before birth to improve their babies' lung function.</P>
<P>We assessed the benefits of betamimetics (drugs that inhibit contractions of the uterus) given to women with preterm labour against any adverse effects in randomised controlled trials. The betamimetics were administered, by any route or any dose, and compared with placebo, no treatment or other betamimetics. Twenty trials, testing the effect of betamimetics for inhibiting preterm labour, contributed data.The trials were published over a 44-year period between 1966 and 2010 and were conducted in tertiary care or university hospitals in high-income countries.</P>
<P>A total of 1367 women in preterm labour participated in the 12 trials that compared a betamimetic with placebo or no treatment. Betamimetics decreased the number of women giving birth within 48 hours and there was a decrease in the number of births within seven days.</P>
<P>The delay in the timing of birth did not translate into any improvements in neonatal outcomes but most women in the trials were 32 weeks' gestation or more. Betamimetics were not shown to reduce perinatal deaths or respiratory distress syndrome.</P>
<P>The side effects for the woman were considerable. These led to cessation of treatment and symptoms such as palpitations, chest pain, headache, difficulty breathing, nausea and/or vomiting.</P>
<P>There was not enough evidence from the included trials to suggest that one betamimetic agent was superior to another.</P>

<P>Twenty-eight trials were assessed as eligible for inclusion in the review, but eight did not report any outcome data relevant to the review. Results are based on the 20 trials that contributed data.</P>
<P>Twelve trials, involving 1367 women, compared betamimetics with placebo. Betamimetics decreased the number of women in preterm labour giving birth within 48 hours (average risk ratio (RR) 0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 0.88, 10 trials, 1209 women). There was a decrease in the number of births within seven days (average RR 0.80; 95% CI 0.65 to 0.98, five trials, 911 women) but there was no evidence of a reduction in preterm birth (before 37 weeks' gestation) (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.88 to 1.03, 10 trials, 1212 women). No benefit was demonstrated for betamimetics for perinatal death (RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.46 to 1.55, 11 trials, 1332 infants), or neonatal death (RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.27 to 3.00, six trials, 1174 infants). No significant effect was demonstrated for respiratory distress syndrome (RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.71 to 1.08, eight trials, 1239 infants). A few trials reported on cerebral palsy, infant death and necrotising enterocolitis; no significant differences between groups were identified for any of these outcomes. Betamimetics were significantly associated with the following outcomes: withdrawal from treatment due to adverse effects; maternal chest pain; dyspnoea; palpitation; tremor; headaches; hypokalaemia; hyperglycaemia; nausea or vomiting; nasal stuffiness; and fetal tachycardia.</P>
<P>Nine trials compared different types of betamimetics. Other betamimetics were compared with ritodrine in five trials (n = 948). Other comparisons were examined in single trials: hexoprenaline compared with salbutamol (n = 140), slow versus moderate release salbutamol (n = 52) and salbutamol compared with terbutaline (n = 200). Trials were small, varied, and of insufficient quality to delineate any consistent patterns of effect.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-01-08 14:30:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jill V Hampson">
<P>Betamimetics help to delay birth, which may give time to allow women to be transferred to tertiary care or to complete a course of antenatal corticosteroids. However, multiple adverse effects must be considered. The data are too few to support the use of any particular betamimetic.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-02-03 15:30:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Preterm birth is defined as birth occurring before 37 completed weeks of pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1977</LINK>). Of the four million estimated neonatal deaths in the world each year, 99% occur in low-income countries and around one-third are directly attributable to premature (preterm) birth (<LINK REF="REF-Lawn-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawn 2005</LINK>). Preterm birth is thus the leading cause of neonatal death (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2012</LINK>). There is considerable regional variation in the incidence of preterm birth; 6.2% in Europe, 10.6% in the US and higher rates in Africa (<LINK REF="REF-Beck-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beck 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Blencowe-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blencowe 2012</LINK>). Accurate assessment of gestational age is challenging in low-income countries but accurate ultrasound-based assessments in Malawi found an incidence as high as 17% (<LINK REF="REF-van-den-Broek-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">van den Broek 2009</LINK>). Preterm birth is also a leading cause of perinatal morbidity and of morbidities that persist into childhood. Preterm birth can cause respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (a chronic lung disease, which can follow respiratory distress syndrome), intraventricular haemorrhage (bleeding into the fluid spaces (ventricles) within the brain), sepsis (generalised infection or infection of the blood stream), cerebral palsy and other forms of neuro-developmental impairment (<LINK REF="REF-Gladstone-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gladstone 2011</LINK>), blindness and deafness. Preterm infants born in high-income settings often require intensive care, which is costly (<LINK REF="REF-Petrou-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petrou 2001</LINK>) and stressful. Intensive care is largely unavailable in those parts of the world with the greatest burden of preterm births, namely Africa and South Asia.<BR/>
<BR/>The mechanisms or pathogenesis of preterm labour are not well understood. The causes of spontaneous preterm labour may involve genetic factors, stress, inflammatory response, infection, mechanical factors and haemorrhage (<LINK REF="REF-Goldenberg-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldenberg 2008</LINK>). Antenatal strategies to try to prevent preterm birth have been largely disappointing, and the rate of preterm birth has not decreased (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Tocolytic drugs (drugs that inhibit contractions of the uterus) have been used to try to prolong pregnancy when preterm labour is diagnosed. Theoretically, tocolysis could improve perinatal outcomes by (a) allowing the fetus to mature further in utero before being born, (b) enhancing lung maturation in the fetus by giving corticosteroid treatment to the mother (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2006</LINK>), and (c) allowing time for in-utero transfer to a tertiary care centre with better facilities for care of the premature newborn, including neonatal intensive care facilities.</P>
<P>Betamimetics (isoxsuprine, hexoprenaline, orciprenaline, ritodrine, terbutaline, and salbutamol) have been used extensively in the past. Beta-adrenergic agonists activate adenyl cyclase to form cyclic adenosine 3',5' monophosphate (cAMP). The increased cellular levels of cAMP decrease myosin light-chain kinase activity, both by phosphorylation of the myosin light-chain kinase itself, and by reducing intracellular calcium through increasing calcium uptake by sarcoplasmic reticulum (<LINK REF="REF-Gabor-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gabor 1982</LINK>).</P>
<P>The ideal tocolytic agent is one which is effective in prolonging pregnancy but has no side effects for the woman or the baby. Betamimetics stimulate beta-adrenergic receptors and may cause palpitations, tremor, nausea, vomiting, headaches, nervousness, anxiety, chest pain, shortness of breath, and a range of biochemical disturbances such as hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar level) and hypokalaemia (low serum potassium level). Moreover, pulmonary oedema (fluid accumulation in the lungs) may occur (<LINK REF="REF-Mabie-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mabie 1983</LINK>) and has even been associated with maternal death. The occurrence of side effects may necessitate some women stopping the medication. Betamimetics cross the placenta and may cause fetal tachycardia (increase fetal heart rate), and hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar level) and hyperinsulinism after birth. When considering whether or not to use tocolytic agents in preterm labour, consideration needs to be given to the risks and benefits for both mother and infant, including the side effects of any medication used.</P>
<P>Although the use of betamimetics to inhibit preterm labour has lost popularity in high-income settings because of safety concerns, they are still used elsewhere, especially in resource-poor countries. We aim to review the evidence for benefits and harms of betamimetics in this review. The use of betamimetics to try to reduce the risk of preterm birth in twin pregnancies (<LINK REF="REF-Yamasmit-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yamasmit 2012</LINK>) and as maintenance therapy after acute treatment of preterm labour (<LINK REF="REF-Dodd-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dodd 2012</LINK>) are addressed in other Cochrane reviews.</P>
<P>In addition to betamimetics, several alternative tocolytic agents (that use different physiological mechanisms to inhibit labour) have been examined in trials and used in clinical practice. These include calcium channel blockers, cyclo-oxygenase (COX) inhibitors (prostaglandin inhibitors), magnesium sulphate, nitric oxide donors, progestational agents, relaxin and oxytocin receptor antagonists. The effectiveness and side effects of these agents have been examined in other Cochrane reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Bain-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bain 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Crowther-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowther 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Duckitt-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duckitt 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-King-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-King-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nardin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nardin 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Papatsonis-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papatsonis 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Su-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Su 2010</LINK>), and their relative effects have been explored in a recent network meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Haas-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haas 2012</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2014-02-03 15:31:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jill V Hampson">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We resolved any disagreement by discussion or by involving a third assessor.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(1) Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We have described for each included study the method used to generate the allocation sequence in sufficient detail to allow an assessment of whether it should produce comparable groups.</P>
<P>We assessed the method as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);</LI>
<LI>unclear.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We have described for each included study the method used to conceal the allocation sequence and determined whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, or changed after assignment.</P>
<P>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);</LI>
<LI>unclear.   </LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(3) Blinding (checking for possible performance and detection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We have described for each included study the methods used, if any, to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We considered that studies were at low risk of bias if they were blinded, or if we judged that the lack of blinding could not have affected the results. We assessed blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes.</P>
<P>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>high, low or unclear risk of bias for participants;</LI>
<LI>high, low or unclear risk of bias for personnel;</LI>
<LI>high, low or unclear risk of bias for outcome assessors.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations)</HEADING>
<P>We have described for each included study, and for each outcome or class of outcomes, the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We have stated whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes.  Where sufficient information was reported, or supplied by the trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses. We assessed methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias;</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias;</LI>
<LI>unclear.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Studies where more than 20% of the participants were lost to follow-up have been excluded. We also excluded outcomes where there was more than 20% missing data. We considered that serious sample attrition meant that studies were at high risk of bias and results would be difficult to interpret.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(5) Selective reporting bias</HEADING>
<P>We have described for each included study how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found.</P>
<P>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (where it was clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (where not all the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest were reported incompletely and so could not be used; study failed to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</LI>
<LI>unclear.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(6) Other sources of bias</HEADING>
<P>We have described for each included study any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias, such as baseline imbalance.</P>
<P>We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias:</P>
<UL>
<LI>high risk of other bias;</LI>
<LI>low risk of other bias;</LI>
<LI>unclear.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(7) Overall risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>We made explicit judgements about whether studies are at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the <I>Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). With reference to (1) to (6) above, we assessed the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we considered it was likely to impact on the findings. We explored the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses - <I>see </I>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cluster-randomised trials</HEADING>
<P>None of the trials in this version of the review randomised clusters. In future updates if such trials are identified we will include them in the analyses along with individually-randomised trials. We will adjust their<I> </I>sample sizes<I> </I>using the methods described in the <I>Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) using an estimate of the intra-cluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), from a similar trial or from a study of a similar population. If we use ICCs from other sources, we will report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identify both cluster-randomised trials and individually-randomised trials, we plan to synthesise the relevant information. We will consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit is considered to be unlikely.</P>
<P>We will also acknowledge heterogeneity in the randomisation unit and perform subgroup analysis to investigate the effects of the randomisation unit.</P>

<P>Where appropriate, in multi-arm trials with more than one arm examining the same betamimetic (e.g. different doses), we combined results for the betamimetics group to form a single pair-wise comparison.</P>
<P>If we had identified any multi-arm studies where two different betamimetics were compared with a control group (placebo or no treatment), we planned to divide the control group between the two experimental arms (dividing control event rate and sample size by two for dichotomous outcomes, and dividing the sample size by two and assuming the same mean and standard deviation for continuous outcomes).

<P>For included studies, we noted levels of attrition. We explored the impact of including studies with high levels of missing data in the overall assessment of treatment effect by using sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>For all outcomes, we carried out analyses, as far as possible, on an intention-to-treat basis, i.e. we attempted to include all participants randomised to each group in the analyses, and all participants were analysed in the group to which they were allocated, regardless of whether or not they received the allocated intervention. The denominator for each outcome in each trial was the number randomised minus any participants whose outcomes were known to be missing. </P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2014-02-05 14:13:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jill V Hampson">
<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2012</LINK>). We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials examined the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods were judged sufficiently similar. If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary, if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary was treated as the average range of possible treatment effects and we have discussed the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect was not considered clinically meaningful, we did not combine trials.</P>

<P>The participants included in these trials were reasonably homogeneous. The gestational age at inclusion ranged from 20 to up to 37 weeks. Preterm labour was reasonably consistently defined across the trials as the presence of uterine contractions documented by external tocography or cervical dilatation up to 4 to 5 cm, or both, except for three trials, which did not state the definition (<LINK REF="STD-Gummerus-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Gummerus 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lipshitz-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Lipshitz 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Von-Oeyen-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Von Oeyen 1990</LINK>).

<P>Nine trials compared ritodrine with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Barden-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Barden 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CPLG-1992" TYPE="STUDY">CPLG 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hobel-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Hobel 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Larsen-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Larsen 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leveno-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Leveno 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mariona-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Mariona 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scommegna-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Scommegna 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spellacy-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Spellacy 1979</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Tohoku-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Tohoku 1984</LINK>). Intravenous ritodrine was used initially and maintained orally in all trials except one (<LINK REF="STD-Larsen-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Larsen 1980</LINK>), which used intramuscular ritodrine initially. The dosage was consistent both intravenously and orally. Ritodrine was usually started at 100 mcg/minute and increased by 50 mcg/minute up to a maximum of 350 mcg/minute, or until contractions ceased, or there were intolerable adverse effects. Two trials compared terbutaline with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Cotton-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Cotton 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ingemarsson-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Ingemarsson 1976</LINK>); the same regimen for intravenous infusion was used but oral terbutaline was only given in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ingemarsson-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Ingemarsson 1976</LINK>). One trial compared isoxsuprine with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Adam-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Adam 1966</LINK>). Two trials compared terbutaline with ritodrine (<LINK REF="STD-Caritis-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Caritis 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Von-Oeyen-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Von Oeyen 1990</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(4) Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>There was some inconsistency across the trials with regards to the way in which outcomes were reported. Only three common primary outcomes were consistently reported: birth within 48 hours, perinatal death, and respiratory distress syndrome. However, the definition of respiratory distress syndrome was not stated. Only the biggest trial reported neonatal outcomes both in the short- and long-term (<LINK REF="STD-CPLG-1992" TYPE="STUDY">CPLG 1992</LINK>). Secondary outcomes were less consistently reported and definitions were not stated. Mainly cardiovascular adverse effects from betamimetics were reported, particularly when treatment was stopped due to adverse reactions. Other adverse effects were less consistently reported.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-02-04 10:04:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Betamimetics were shown to be effective in delaying birth for 48 hours and up to seven days. This is sufficient time to allow transfer of a woman to a tertiary care unit or to complete a course of antenatal corticosteroid. However, there was no evidence that this delay in the timing of birth translated into any improvements in neonatal outcomes, and the side effects for the woman are considerable.</P>
<P>It may be that health gains have not been demonstrated for several reasons.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Time gain in-utero: most participants were 32 weeks' gestation or more. Therefore, increased gestational age might have little or no effect on perinatal outcomes leading to no statistical significance in the pooled estimate of important outcomes such as respiratory distress syndrome, perinatal death, neonatal death and infant death. Also, prolongation of pregnancy itself may be disadvantage to the baby. If the eligibility criteria had been restricted to lower gestation groups, and had the number of participants been greater, an effect on clinical outcomes might have been detected.</LI>
<LI>Referral to higher care level: all trials in this review took place in tertiary care or University hospitals, that were likely to have neonatal intensive care facilities. If the trials had involved women who needed to be transferred to distant referral hospitals, again a difference in outcome might have been seen.</LI>
<LI>Antenatal corticosteroids administration: the majority of trials were conducted before 1990, when antenatal corticosteroids were not widely used. Even in <LINK REF="STD-CPLG-1992" TYPE="STUDY">CPLG 1992</LINK>, antenatal corticosteroids were prescribed only to one third of all women in each arm. Therefore, subgroup analysis to evaluate the effect of betamimetics to allow a complete course of antenatal corticosteroids (betamimetics alone and betamimetics combined with corticosteroids) on neonatal outcomes could not be assessed.</LI>
</OL>
<P>There is not enough evidence to suggest that one betamimetic agent is superior to another.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2014-02-03 15:39:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Betamimetics have been used for primary tocolysis and maintenance therapy for many years, and continue to be used throughout the world. However, alternative agents have been shown to be more effective in terms of pregnancy prolongation and have been associated with fewer and less severe side effects compared with betamimetics. The effects of different classes of tocolytics compared with placebo, and with each other (where different types of tocolytics have been compared directly in trials) have been set out in a series of Cochrane Reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Bain-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bain 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Crowther-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowther 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Duckitt-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duckitt 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-King-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-King-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Papatsonis-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papatsonis 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Su-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Su 2010</LINK>), and the effects of combinations of different tocolytic drugs to treat preterm labour is the subject of a review currently in development (<LINK REF="REF-Nardin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nardin 2006</LINK>). A recent review, which included both network and pair-wise meta-analysis, incorporated evidence from 95 trials examining a range of tocolytics (betamimetics, magnesium sulphate, calcium channel blockers, COX inhibitors, oxytocin receptor antagonists, nitric oxide donors and other drugs) (<LINK REF="REF-Haas-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haas 2012</LINK>). The results of this review suggest that all types of tocolytics were better than placebo in terms of prolonging pregnancy beyond 48 hours, but that betamimetics performed less well than other types of tocolytics (e.g. COX inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers). It was not clear that any class of tocolytic was effective in reducing respiratory distress syndrome compared with placebo. The evidence regarding side effects suggested that COX inhibitors and oxytocin receptor antagonists were associated with fewer maternal side effects compared with other types of tocolytics including betamimetics.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-10-22 13:02:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Betamimetics are widely used especially in resource-poor countries, and take effect rapidly. Betamimetics are effective in delaying birth for 48 hours, sufficient time to allow the transfer of a woman to a higher level of care and to allow completion of an antenatal corticosteroid to facilitate fetal lung maturation. However, this benefit is balanced by more frequent unpleasant and sometimes potentially serious adverse effects which significantly increase the likelihood of having to discontinue betamimetic treatment.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-01-08 15:16:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jill V Hampson">
<P>Any future studies should aim to improve diagnostic criteria for preterm labour and have sufficient power to detect clinically meaningful differences in important neonatal outcomes. However, given the less favourable adverse effect profile of betamimetics in comparison to other tocolytic drugs, it seems unlikely that further trials involving betamimetics will be conducted. </P>

<APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2014-02-03 15:41:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jill V Hampson">
<P>Review authors S Anotayanonth and N Subhedar independently assessed the trials against the eligibility criteria, using a standardised form. We resolved disagreement by discussion or by consulting P Garner and J Neilson. The trials that did not meet the inclusion criteria were excluded and the reasons given in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> table.</P>
<P>The methodological quality of each trial was assessed by at least two review authors. This process was completed without consideration of trial results and with no blinding of authorship. We would have resolved any differences of opinion by discussion. The information would have been displayed in an additional table and described in the section 'Methodological quality of included studies'.</P>
<P>The generation of the random sequence and the method of allocation concealment were assessed separately. This was then judged as adequate or inadequate using the criteria described in Section VI of the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook (Clarke 2002): A = adequate, B = unclear, C = inadequate, D = not used. Studies rated as a D were excluded.</P>
<P>In addition, quality scores were assigned to each trial for use of placebo, completeness of follow-up and blinding of outcome assessment as follows.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Use of placebo</HEADING>
<P>(a) Placebo used;<BR/>(b) attempt at a placebo (not identical);<BR/>(c) no placebo;<BR/>(d) unclear.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Completeness of follow-up</HEADING>
<P>(a) Less than 3% of participants excluded;<BR/>(b) 3% to 9.9% of participants excluded;<BR/>(c) 10% to 19.9% of participants excluded;<BR/>(d) 20% or more excluded;<BR/>(e) unclear.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Blinding</HEADING>
<P>Blinding was examined with regards to who was blinded in the trials, that is, participant, caregiver, outcome assessor or analyst. All levels were sought and categorised as below.<BR/>(a) Double blind: neither investigator nor participant knew or were likely to guess the allocated treatment.<BR/>(b) Single blind: either the investigator or the participant knew the allocation. Or, the trial is described as double blind, but side effects of one or other treatments mean that it is likely that for a significant proportion (at least 20%) of participants the allocation could be correctly identified.<BR/>(c) No blinding: both investigator and participant knew (or were likely to guess) the allocated treatment.<BR/>(d) Unclear.</P>
<P>We developed a standardised data extraction form and then piloted it for consistency and completeness. Data were extracted independently by two review authors and double entered. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion or consulting P Garner and J Neilson. If data from the trial reports were insufficient or missing, we contacted the study authors for additional information. The data were analysed using the Review Manager computer software (RevMan 2000). For continuous data, the weighted mean difference was used. For binary data, relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were calculated, and in the absence of heterogeneity (using the chi-square test for heterogeneity with a 10% level of statistical significance), results were pooled using a fixed-effect model. If significant heterogeneity was found a random-effects model was used. A funnel plot was done to assess publication bias, quality or heterogeneity.</P>
<P>A priori it was decided that all eligible trials would be included in the initial analysis and sensitivity analyses carried out to evaluate the effect of trial quality. This was done by excluding trials given a B or C rating for quality of allocation concealment, then B, C or D for use of a placebo, then D or E for completeness of follow-up and then C or D for blinding. There was only one trial left for inclusion in the analysis after applying all criteria of sensitivity analysis for betamimetics compared with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-CPLG-1992" TYPE="STUDY">CPLG 1992</LINK>). For betamimetics compared with other betamimetics, there was only one trial for each comparison. Therefore, all trials were included in the analysis.</P>
<P>Subgroup analysis was planned to explore steroid administration as a possible source of heterogeneity in subgroup analyses by stratifying all studies (inside and outside US):</P>
<OL>
<LI>studies before and after 1994 (year of the National Institutes of Health consensus development conference on the use of corticosteroids for fetal maturation and their effect on perinatal outcomes);</LI>
<LI>studies, which reported that steroids were routinely given, or the steroid administration rate was reported as higher than 50%.</LI>
</OL>
<P>We were unable to undertake the subgroup analysis since there was no antenatal corticosteroids usage at least 50% in any trials and all the trials were conducted before 1990.</P>
