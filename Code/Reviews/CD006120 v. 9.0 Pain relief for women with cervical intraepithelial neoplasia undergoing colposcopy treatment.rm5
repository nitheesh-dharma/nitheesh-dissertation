<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-06-21 13:03:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>
<B>What is the issue?</B>
</P>
<P>Treatment for CIN is usually undertaken in an outpatient colposcopy clinic to remove the pre-cancerous cells from the cervix (lower part of the womb). It commonly involves lifting the cells off the cervix with electrically heated wire (diathermy) or laser, or destroying the abnormal cells with freezing methods (cryotherapy). This is potentially a painful procedure.</P>
<P>
<B>The aim of the review</B>
</P>
<P>The purpose of this review is to determine which, if any, pain relief should be used during cervical colposcopy treatment.</P>
<P>
<B>What evidence did we find?</B>
</P>
<P>We identified 19 clinical trials up to March 2016 and these reported different forms of pain relief before, during and after colposcopy. Evidence from two small trials showed that women having a colposcopy treatment had less pain and blood loss if the cervix was injected with a combination of a local anaesthetic medicine and a medicine that causes blood vessels to constrict (narrow), compared with placebo (a pretend treatment). Although taking oral pain-relieving medicines (e.g. ibuprofen) before treatment on the cervix in the colposcopy clinic is recommended by most guidelines, evidence from two small trials did not show that this practice reduced pain during the procedure.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Most of the evidence was of a low to moderate quality and further research may change these findings.</P>
<P>Additionally, we were unable to obtain evidence with regards to how much of the local anaesthetic or method of administering local anaesthetic into the cervix.</P>
<P>
<B>What are the conclusions?</B>
</P>
<P>There is a need for high quality trials with sufficient numbers of women in order to provide the data necessary to determine which pain relief should be used during outpatient colposcopy treatment.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-06-14 17:18:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare E Jess">
<P>Pre-cancerous lesions of cervix (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)) are usually treated with excisional or ablative procedures. In the UK, the National Health Service (NHS) cervical screening guidelines suggest that over 80% of treatments should be performed in an outpatient setting (colposcopy clinics). Furthermore, these guidelines suggest that analgesia should always be given prior to laser or excisional treatments. Currently various pain relief strategies are employed that may reduce pain during these procedures.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-06-15 11:26:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>To assess whether the administration of pain relief (analgesia) reduces pain during colposcopy treatment and in the postoperative period.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-06-15 10:29:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2016, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1950 to March week 3, 2016) and Embase (1980 to week 12, 2016) for studies of any design relating to analgesia for colposcopic management. We also searched registers of clinical trials, abstracts of scientific meetings, reference lists of included studies and contacted experts in the field.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-06-14 17:20:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare E Jess">
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared all types of pain relief before, during or after outpatient treatment to the cervix, in women with CIN undergoing loop excision, laser ablation, laser excision or cryosurgery in an outpatient colposcopy clinic setting.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-06-14 17:21:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare E Jess">
<P>We independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We entered data into Review Manager 5 and double checked it for accuracy. Where possible, we expressed results as mean pain score and standard error of the mean with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and synthesised data in a meta-analysis.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-06-15 21:42:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 19 RCTs (1720 women) of varying methodological quality in the review. These trials compared a variety of interventions aimed at reducing pain in women who underwent treatment for CIN, including cervical injection with lignocaine alone, lignocaine with adrenaline, buffered lignocaine with adrenaline, prilocaine with felypressin, oral analgesics (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)), inhalation analgesia (gas mixture of isoflurane and desflurane), lignocaine spray, cocaine spray, local application of benzocaine gel, lignocaine-prilocaine cream (EMLA cream) and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS).</P>
<P>Most comparisons were restricted to single trial analyses and were under-powered to detect differences in pain scores between treatments that may or may not have been present. There was no difference in pain relief between women who received local anaesthetic infiltration (lignocaine 2%; administered as a paracervical or direct cervical injection) and a saline placebo (mean difference (MD) -13.74; 95% CI -34.32 to 6.83; 2 trials; 130 women; low quality evidence). However, when local anaesthetic was combined with a vasoconstrictor agent (one trial used lignocaine plus adrenaline while the second trial used prilocaine plus felypressin), there was less pain (on visual analogue scale (VAS)) compared with no treatment (MD -23.73; 95% CI -37.53 to -9.93; 2 trials; 95 women; low quality evidence). Comparing two preparations of local anaesthetic combined with vasoconstrictor, prilocaine plus felypressin did not differ from lignocaine plus adrenaline for its effect on pain control (MD -0.05; 95% CI -0.26 to 0.16; 1 trial; 200 women). Although the mean (± standard deviation (SD)) observed blood loss score was less with lignocaine plus adrenaline (1.33 ± 1.05) compared with prilocaine plus felypressin (1.74 ± 0.98), the difference was not clinically as the overall scores in both groups were low (MD 0.41; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.69; 1 trial; 200 women). Inhalation of gas mixture (isoflurane and desflurane) in addition to standard cervical injection with prilocaine plus felypressin resulted in less pain during the LLETZ (loop excision of the transformation zone) procedure (MD -7.20; 95% CI -12.45 to -1.95; 1 trial; 389 women). Lignocaine plus ornipressin resulted in less measured blood loss (MD -8.75 ml; 95% CI -10.43 to -7.07; 1 trial; 100 women) and a shorter duration of treatment (MD -7.72 minutes; 95% CI -8.49 to -6.95; 1 trial; 100 women) than cervical infiltration with lignocaine alone. Buffered solution (sodium bicarbonate buffer mixed with lignocaine plus adrenaline) was not superior to non-buffered solution of lignocaine plus adrenaline in relieving pain during the procedure (MD -8.00; 95% CI -17.57 to 1.57; 1 trial; 52 women).</P>
<P>One meta-analysis found no difference in pain using VAS between women who received oral analgesic and women who received placebo (MD -3.51; 95% CI -10.03 to 3.01; 2 trials; 129 women; low quality evidence).</P>
<P>Cocaine spray was associated with less pain (MD -28.00; 95% CI -37.86 to -18.14; 1 trial; 50 women) and blood loss (MD 0.04; 95% CI 0 to 0.70; 1 trial; 50 women) than placebo.</P>
<P>None of the trials reported serious adverse events and majority of trials were at moderate or high risk of bias (13 trials).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-06-15 21:42:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Based on two small trials, there was no difference in pain relief in women receiving oral analgesics compared with placebo or no treatment (MD -3.51; 95% CI -10.03 to 3.01; 129 women). We consider this evidence to be of a low to moderate quality. In routine clinical practice, intracervical injection of local anaesthetic with a vasoconstrictor (lignocaine plus adrenaline or prilocaine plus felypressin) appears to be the optimum analgesia for treatment. However, further high quality, adequately powered trials should be undertaken in order to provide the data necessary to estimate the efficacy of oral analgesics, the optimal route of administration and dose of local anaesthetics.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-06-14 17:35:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare E Jess">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-06-14 17:31:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare E Jess">
<P>Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women up to 65 years of age and is the most frequent cause of death from gynaecological cancers worldwide. A woman's risk of developing cervical cancer by the age of 65 years ranges from 0.69% in high income countries to 1.38% in low to moderate income countries (<LINK REF="REF-GLOBOCAN-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">GLOBOCAN 2008</LINK>). In Europe, about 60% of women with cervical cancer are alive five years after diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-EUROCARE-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">EUROCARE 2003</LINK>). Cervical screening has all the characteristics of a good screening programme. There are effective screening tests, such as the traditional cytological approach (Pap smear) for diagnosing pre-invasive and early invasive disease, or new methodologies, such as human papillomavirus (HPV) testing, which try to improve sensitivity and specificity. In addition, there are effective surgical treatments for pre-invasive and early invasive disease that dramatically alter prognosis. As cervical screening is relatively inexpensive, non-invasive and treatment of pre-invasive disease requires only simple surgical techniques, screening is cost-effective and has been clearly demonstrated to reduce mortality in countries with well-organised screening programmes (<LINK REF="REF-Peto-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peto 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>One previous Cochrane review examined the effectiveness of different modalities of treatment for pre-invasive disease (<LINK REF="REF-Martin_x002d_Hirsch-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin-Hirsch 2010</LINK>). In the review, each modality of treatment was assessed for its ability to eradicate disease and associated morbidity. Current treatment for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) is by local ablative therapy or by excisional methods, depending on the nature and extent of the disease. There is an international consensus that the majority of these procedures can be performed within the colposcopy clinic in an outpatient setting. In the UK, the National Health Service (NHS) cervical screening guidelines suggest that over 80% of treatments should be performed in a clinic setting (<LINK REF="REF-NHSCSP-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHSCSP 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NHSCSP-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHSCSP 2010</LINK>). Furthermore, these guidelines also suggest that analgesia should always be given prior to laser or excisional treatments.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-06-14 17:35:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare E Jess">
<P>Therapies that are available to treat pre-malignant lesions of the cervix in outpatient settings include loop diathermy excision, laser ablation or excision, and cryotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Martin_x002d_Hirsch-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin-Hirsch 2010</LINK>). Studies have reported variable outcomes with different types of pain relief for these procedures. The choice of pain relief in these studies varies from no analgesia to intracervical infiltration with anaesthetic agent (e.g. lignocaine - buffered and non-buffered - or prilocaine) with or without vasopressor agents (e.g. adrenaline or felypressin) (<LINK REF="STD-Lee-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kizer-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Kizer 2014</LINK>). Other methods studied are oral therapy with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (<LINK REF="STD-Frega-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Frega 1994</LINK>), local spray with cocaine (<LINK REF="STD-Mikhail-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Mikhail 1988</LINK>) or lignocaine (xylocaine) spray (<LINK REF="STD-Vanichtantikul-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Vanichtantikul 2013</LINK>), topical benzocaine gel (<LINK REF="STD-Lipscomb-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lipscomb 1995</LINK>), inhalation of gas mixture of isoflurane and desflurane (<LINK REF="STD-Cruickshank-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cruickshank 2005</LINK>), local anaesthetic cream (EMLA cream) (<LINK REF="STD-Sarkar-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sarkar 1993</LINK>), and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) (<LINK REF="STD-Crompton-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Crompton 1992</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-08-30 13:11:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>The possible mechanisms proposed in the literature to explain pain during cervical laser vaporisation includes pain mediated through peripheral pain fibres in the cervix, stimulated by heat energy, with or without pain caused by increased uterine contractions, probably because of the release of prostaglandins. The interventions may work by blocking the pain pathways. The nerve supply to the cervix is unclear, but the richest supply appears to be at the level of internal os. The ectocervix appears to be relatively insensitive to extremes of temperature with few specialised nerve fibres (<LINK REF="REF-Jordan-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jordan 1976</LINK>). Pain stimuli from the cervix and vagina are conducted by visceral afferent fibres to the S2 to S4 spinal ganglia via the pudendal and pelvic splanchnic nerves, along with parasympathetic fibres (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2006</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-06-14 17:35:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare E Jess">
<P>There now appears to be a consensus that analgesia should be administered before treatment to the cervix. Currently, there is no systematic review or meta-analysis evaluating whether administering analgesia reduces the pain experienced by women undergoing outpatient treatment. Most guidelines are also not explicit on the nature of optimum analgesia for intra- and postoperative pain relief. Analgesia is commonly administered intra- or para-cervically using fine dental needles. Other routes of administering analgesics evaluated are TENS, peri-operative NSAIDs and inhalation analgesia.</P>

<P>All trials were conducted as single centre trials in a colposcopy clinic setting. Various pain relief interventions were reported in the 19 included trials. Two trials investigated cervical injection (intracervical block (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1989</LINK>) and paracervical block (<LINK REF="STD-Rogstad-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rogstad 1992</LINK>)) with anaesthetic agent (lignocaine 2%) compared with saline (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rogstad-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rogstad 1992</LINK>). Three trials used preparations made up of local anaesthetic plus vasoconstrictor (<LINK REF="STD-Duncan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Duncan 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sammarco-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sammarco 1993</LINK>). One of these three trials used cervical injection with lignocaine 1% mixed with 1:100,000 dilution of adrenaline given submucosally and compared it with no treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Sammarco-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sammarco 1993</LINK>), while the two other trials reported cervical injection with a different anaesthetic agent (prilocaine 30 mg/ml) mixed with vasoconstrictor (felypressin 0.03 IU/ml) compared with no treatment or placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Duncan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Duncan 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1986</LINK>). One trial investigated lignocaine 1% plus vasoconstrictor (1:30 of ornipressin in lignocaine 1% solution) compared to lignocaine 1% alone to evaluate the effects on the blood loss during the procedure (<LINK REF="STD-Diakomanolis-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Diakomanolis 1997</LINK>). One trial evaluated pain relief during the loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ) procedure with buffered local anaesthetic with vasoconstrictor compared to non-buffered local anaesthetic with vasoconstrictor injected locally into the cervix (<LINK REF="STD-Kizer-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Kizer 2014</LINK>). A buffered solution of local anaesthetic was prepared immediately before use by mixing 9 ml of lignocaine 1% plus adrenaline 1:100,000 with 1 ml of a 1 mEq/ml (8.4%) solution of sodium bicarbonate buffer while the non-buffered solution contained 10 ml of lignocaine with adrenaline.</P>
<P>Three trials investigated the method of cervical injection. One trial compared local anaesthetic combined with vasoconstrictor (prilocaine 3% plus felypressin) administered by deep and superficial injection with deep injection alone (<LINK REF="STD-Winters-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Winters 2009</LINK>), while another trial compared paracervical injection of lignocaine 2% with direct injection (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1996</LINK>). One trial investigated two different preparations of anaesthetic agent with vasoconstrictor (prilocaine 30 mg/ml plus felypressin 0.03 IU/ml compared with lignocaine 2% plus adrenaline 1:80,000) (<LINK REF="STD-Howells-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Howells 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two trials reported the use of oral analgesia with NSAID (naproxen sodium 550 mg), given 30 minutes to one hour before treatment, compared to placebo or no treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Kurdi-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Kurdi 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Frega-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Frega 1994</LINK>), with one trial using a single dose of naproxen sodium 550 mg (<LINK REF="STD-Frega-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Frega 1994</LINK>) while the other trial used double the dose (1100 mg) (<LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Kurdi-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Kurdi 1985</LINK>).</P>
<P>One trial used a gas mixture (isoflurane 0.3% and desflurane 1%) as inhalation agent, in addition to standard cervical injection of local anaesthetic plus vasoconstrictor (prilocaine 30 mg/ml plus felypressin 0.03 IU/ml, also known as Octapressin) (<LINK REF="STD-Cruickshank-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cruickshank 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>A further five trials used topical application of gel, cream and sprays for their anaesthetic effects during the treatment on cervix (<LINK REF="STD-Connell-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Connell 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lipscomb-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lipscomb 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mikhail-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Mikhail 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sarkar-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sarkar 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vanichtantikul-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Vanichtantikul 2013</LINK>). One trial looked at the effects of benzocaine 20% gel compared to placebo gel (<LINK REF="STD-Lipscomb-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lipscomb 1995</LINK>) and the other trial compared EMLA cream, which is a local anaesthetic cream consisting of a mixture of lignocaine 2.5% and prilocaine 2.5% (<LINK REF="STD-Sarkar-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sarkar 1993</LINK>) to a placebo cream. <LINK REF="STD-Mikhail-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Mikhail 1988</LINK> compared 3 to 4 ml of a cocaine 10% spray as a surface anaesthesia to a placebo solution (preservative) for its effects on pain relief. Out of the two trials using 10% lignocaine hydrochloride spray on the cervix (<LINK REF="STD-Connell-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Connell 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vanichtantikul-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Vanichtantikul 2013</LINK>), one trial compared the effectiveness of 10% lignocaine spray with injection of 2% lignocaine with 1:100,000 adrenaline (<LINK REF="STD-Vanichtantikul-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Vanichtantikul 2013</LINK>). In the trial of <LINK REF="STD-Connell-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Connell 2000</LINK>, women were randomised to receive either lignocaine 10% spray or saline spray in addition to standard cervical infiltration using prilocaine 30 mg/ml plus felypressin 0.03 IU/ml.

Other common exclusion criteria were: various allergies, pregnancy and previous treatment to the cervix. Concomitant use of highly protein-bound drug was an exclusion criterion in one trial with oral analgesia using NSAID (<LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Kurdi-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Kurdi 1985</LINK>), while another trial using a gas mixture of isoflurane and desflurane excluded women taking monoamine-oxidase inhibitors or women driving themselves home from the clinic (<LINK REF="STD-Cruickshank-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cruickshank 2005</LINK>). The trial of <LINK REF="STD-Kizer-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Kizer 2014</LINK> excluded women using prescription analgesics within seven days of scheduled procedure.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-06-15 21:47:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nineteen RCTs (1720 women) met the inclusion criteria and were assessed in the review. These trials compared a variety of interventions aimed at reducing pain in women who underwent treatment for CIN in colposcopy clinic settings, including cervical injection with lignocaine alone, lignocaine plus adrenaline, lignocaine plus adrenaline in sodium bicarbonate buffer, prilocaine plus felypressin, oral analgesics (NSAID), inhalation analgesia (gas mixture of isoflurane and desflurane), lignocaine spray, cocaine spray, local application of benzocaine 20% gel, EMLA cream and TENS.</P>
<P>Use of lignocaine 2% for cervical injection (as direct injection or paracervical block) showed no overall benefit in pain relief as compared to placebo, with one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Rogstad-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rogstad 1992</LINK>) showing a beneficial effect while another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1989</LINK>) found no benefit. Use of the local anaesthetic prilocaine with a vasoconstrictor (felypressin) showed a reduction in pain on VAS (<LINK REF="STD-Duncan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Duncan 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1986</LINK>). However, one trial found no benefit when the pain was assessed with VRS (<LINK REF="STD-Lee-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1986</LINK>). This trial also reported no reduction in blood loss with prilocaine plus felypressin. However, the blood loss was not measured and it was the subjective impression of the operator. It is also worth noting that this trial, though randomised, was not a double-blind controlled trial and only had a small sample size (25 in the intervention arm and 25 in the placebo arm) (<LINK REF="STD-Lee-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1986</LINK>). The addition of a vasoconstrictor agent (ornipressin) to anaesthetic agent (lignocaine 1%) resulted in less measured blood loss and reduction of the duration of procedure (<LINK REF="STD-Diakomanolis-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Diakomanolis 1997</LINK>). Direct cervical injection with local anaesthetic (lignocaine 2%) resulted in better pain relief than placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Rogstad-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rogstad 1992</LINK>) and paracervical block (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1996</LINK>). Superficial injection of local anaesthetic in the cervix before deep injection did not result in any better pain relief (<LINK REF="STD-Winters-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Winters 2009</LINK>). Buffering of lignocaine with adrenaline did not give better pain relief as compared to non-buffered lignocaine 1% with adrenaline 1:100,000.</P>
<P>Oral analgesia with an NSAID before the procedure did not result in better pain relief, although one trial reported that the women were less likely to use oral analgesics at home within the first 24 hours of treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Kurdi-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Kurdi 1985</LINK>).</P>
<P>Inhalation of gas mixture (isoflurane and desflurane) in addition to standard cervical injection with prilocaine 30 mg/ml plus felypressin 0.03 IU/ml resulted in less pain during the LLETZ procedure with no effect on blood loss or HAD anxiety scores (<LINK REF="STD-Cruickshank-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cruickshank 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>EMLA local anaesthetic cream did not result in better pain relief compared to placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Sarkar-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sarkar 1993</LINK>). Spraying of the cervix with cocaine spray before treatment resulted in better pain relief and less troublesome bleeding (<LINK REF="STD-Mikhail-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Mikhail 1988</LINK>). Use of topical gel (benzocaine 20%) (<LINK REF="STD-Lipscomb-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lipscomb 1995</LINK>) or lignocaine spray in addition to standard cervical injection prilocaine 30 mg/ml plus felypressin 0.03 IU/ml did not result in any benefit (<LINK REF="STD-Connell-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Connell 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>On comparison of different preparations of local anaesthetic mixed with vasoconstrictor, prilocaine with felypressin did not differ from lignocaine with adrenaline for its effect on pain control (<LINK REF="STD-Howells-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Howells 2000</LINK>). Mean observed blood loss was less in the lignocaine with adrenaline group compared with the prilocaine with felypressin group.</P>
<P>The use of TENS on its own or combined with local anaesthetic injection during cervical laser therapy did not appear to be of any benefit (<LINK REF="STD-Crompton-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Crompton 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>The trials reporting these outcomes noticed no serious adverse effects. The reported adverse effects were feeling faint, shaking, dizziness, abdominal cramps, sweating, feeling hot, weakness, and moderate, transient hypertension. Prilocaine with felypressin caused fewer adverse effects (mainly shaking and fainting) than lignocaine with adrenaline in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Howells-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Howells 2000</LINK>).</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-06-15 21:48:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review consisted of many single trial analyses of small numbers of women, which limits the conclusions that can be drawn. Some of the trials included use of more than one type of pain relief intervention such as preoperative oral analgesics in addition to cervical infiltration. In modern day colposcopy practice, commonly used interventions for pain relief are local anaesthetic infiltration with vasopressin followed by large loop excision of the cervix, cryotherapy, laser ablation or conisation with a knife. In order to improve quantification of the benefits of these interventions in relief of pain and other symptoms (blood loss, etc.) without adverse effects, larger RCTs are required.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Measurement of pain</HEADING>
<P>The trials used several validated scales for the measurement of pain, which may influence the accuracy of the outcome as complexity of the rating task for the measure influences the sensitivity and specificity. It is thought that a VAS reflects pain experienced during operative procedures more accurately (<LINK REF="REF-Huskisson-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huskisson 1983</LINK>). Fifteen trials used VAS to report pain relief (<LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Kurdi-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Kurdi 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Connell-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Connell 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cruickshank-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cruickshank 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Frega-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Frega 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kizer-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Kizer 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lipscomb-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lipscomb 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mikhail-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Mikhail 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rogstad-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rogstad 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sammarco-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sammarco 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sarkar-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sarkar 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vanichtantikul-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Vanichtantikul 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winters-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Winters 2009</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Sammarco-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sammarco 1993</LINK> reported VAS using an 11-point scale rather than 0 to 100 VAS scoring system. Similarly, <LINK REF="STD-Vanichtantikul-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Vanichtantikul 2013</LINK> reported pain scores on VAS using a 0 to 10 cm scale. In addition to VAS, two trials reported pain relief as an objective score given by the attending nurse and laser operator on a categorical scale of 0 to 2 (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1996</LINK>). The other trial scored pain by the attending colposcopist on a categorical scale (0 to 4) as well as by women undergoing treatment (0 to 5) (<LINK REF="STD-Howells-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Howells 2000</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Sarkar-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sarkar 1993</LINK> reported pain utilising McGill's pain questionnaire, on a categorical scale to grade pain, cramp and backache caused by the laser treatment. Five trials reported pain relief on VRS categorised as none, mild, moderate or severe (<LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Kurdi-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Kurdi 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Diakomanolis-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Diakomanolis 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Duncan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Duncan 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mikhail-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Mikhail 1988</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was an element of under reporting, especially where specific mean and SDs were not stated. Several trials reported pain as a graphical representation without numerical values, which is a form of under reporting. Such selective outcome reporting must be taken into consideration when interpreting the results. The trials of <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Connell-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Connell 2000</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Sarkar-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sarkar 1993</LINK> reported pain relief as VAS, but the values were median and IQR rather than mean and SD and, therefore, these data could not be converted to mean pain scores. Similarly, <LINK REF="STD-Vanichtantikul-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Vanichtantikul 2013</LINK> reported mean and SD only for pain scores for the subgroup with loop size of 2 cm or more. Four trials reported pain relief outcomes as a graphical representation that required calculation of mean and SD (<LINK REF="STD-Frega-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Frega 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mikhail-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Mikhail 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rogstad-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rogstad 1992</LINK>). Three trials used graphical representation of data without numerical values (<LINK REF="STD-Frega-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Frega 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mikhail-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Mikhail 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1986</LINK>). The major limitation of the review and interpretation of the results was the presence of selective outcome reporting.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-06-15 21:48:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We conducted GRADE assessments for the primary outcome. Overall, the quality of evidence was low for pain relief reported on a VAS. We downgraded the quality of evidence because of an unclear or high risk of bias with regards to allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, incomplete outcome data and other biases.</P>
<P>This review incorporated evidence from 19 RCTs that assessed 1720 women. Effective pain relief from local anaesthesia is dependent on various factors, including route of administration, concentration and classification of drug, and the time interval between the administration of the analgesic and start of the procedure. These factors differed between the trials. This review was unable to establish the time interval between administration of injection and start of the procedure from the trial data.</P>
<P>Owing to the heterogeneity of the outcomes and treatments considered, there were many single trial analyses and limited consistent data available to carry out comparisons between trials. The majority of the included trials were underpowered to demonstrate a significant effect and some trials did not include a power calculation in their methodologies. As the majority of comparisons relied on single trials that were underpowered, the treatment effects should ideally be examined by conducting further studies.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-06-15 09:55:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>We performed a comprehensive search, including electronic databases and a thorough search of the grey literature. Two review authors independently sifted all references and extracted data. We restricted the included studies to RCTs as they provide the strongest level of evidence available. Hence, we have attempted to reduce bias in the review process.</P>
<P>The greatest threat to the validity of the review is likely to be the possibility of publication bias (i.e. studies that did not find the treatments to have been effective may not have been published). We were unable to assess this possibility as the meta-analyses included a limited number of the included trials (two out of 17 included trials).</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-06-15 09:55:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-06-15 21:49:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Oral analgesia, EMLA cream (benzocaine gel, lignocaine-prilocaine cream), transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), lignocaine spray or benzocaine gel did not provide any benefit in pain relief during cervical colposcopy treatment. Spraying of the cervix with cocaine spray before treatment resulted in better pain relief during the procedure and also less troublesome bleeding. Local anaesthetic agent combined with a vasoconstrictor agent resulted in better pain control compared with placebo and was associated with less blood loss. Buffered injection of lignocaine with adrenaline was not superior to non-buffered lignocaine with adrenaline. Mean observed blood loss score was less with lignocaine plus adrenaline as compared with prilocaine plus felypressin. Direct cervical injection of local anaesthetic with a vasoconstrictor agent resulted in reduction in pain scores during treatment and should be considered for all cervical colposcopy treatment for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). However, we could draw no conclusions with regards to optimum number of sites to inject in the cervix, depth of injection in the cervix (superficial, deep, or both) and dose of the agent used. In terms of adverse effects, combination of prilocaine with felypressin caused fewer adverse effects than lignocaine with adrenaline. Inhalation of gas mixture in addition to standard pain relief injection appears to have additional pain relief benefit. In routine clinical practice, intracervical injection of analgesic with a vasoconstrictor, particularly those related to vasopressin, appeared to be the optimum analgesia for treatment.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-06-15 21:49:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Oral analgesia and the individual topical agents such as EMLA cream, lignocaine spray or benzocaine gel appeared to provide little benefit over placebo or no treatment for pain relief during colposcopy. However, this evidence came from small trials with methodological shortcomings, therefore, we consider this evidence to be of a low quality.</P>
<P>Further available evidence suggested that a local anaesthetic combined with a vasoconstrictor agent reduced pain and measured blood loss, therefore, this treatment should be offered to women undergoing colposcopy. This evidence was of moderate quality and further research will have an important impact on our confidence in these findings.</P>
<P>Further high-quality, adequately powered trials should be undertaken in order to provide the data necessary to estimate the optimal route of administration and dose of local anaesthetics.</P>

<P>Pain: research assistant asked the woman to rate her pain according to a standard 10 cm VAS at different points during the procedure.</P>
<P>This included pain scores at the beginning of the procedure immediately after speculum insertion (baseline pain score), immediately after administering anaesthetic agents (post-anaesthesia pain score), immediately after accomplishing cone excision before proceeding with the remaining steps of the entire procedure (excision pain score), and at 30 minutes after the excision (post-excision pain score). VAS consisted of a 10 cm line scaled from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain)</P>
<P>Primary outcomes: excision pain score and its difference from the baseline pain score</P>
<P>The pain scores on VAS for pain relief during the procedure reported as median and range rather than mean and SD. Pain scores further stratified for size of loop excision (&lt; 2 cm vs. &#8805; 2 cm). Results reported as mean and SD only for loop size &#8805; 2 cm, however, the study did not specify the number of participants in each group</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>"When expressing the 'present pain intensity', some patients indicated a score between categories, so extra categories were created, such as 1 to 5, 2.5 etc". Such analyses are therefore dubious. Furthermore, "When patients were asked to describe their present pain by choosing specific words from McGill&#8217;s pain questionnaire (Melzack, 1975), the EMLA treated group tended to select words from fewer categories. The average number of words selected by the EMLA group was 3.83, compared with 5.06 for the placebo group (P &lt; 0.05)". This probably applied to a mean ordinal score rating rather than mean number of words chosen, but this was unclear.</P>
