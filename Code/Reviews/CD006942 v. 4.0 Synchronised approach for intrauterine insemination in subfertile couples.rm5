<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-12-09 14:56:56 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>
<B>Review question. </B>Cochrane authors reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of different timing techniques for intrauterine insemination in subfertile couples.</P>
<P>
<B>Background.</B> Couples that have not reached pregnancy after trying for at least a year are defined as subfertile. This affects approximately 10% of couples trying to have a baby. A procedure that may assist couples is intrauterine insemination (IUI). This is an assisted reproduction procedure where sperm are placed directly into the uterus at a specific time in the woman's menstrual cycle (as close to ovulation as possible). It remains unclear which technique of timing for IUI results in the best treatment outcome, a healthy live birth. Timing of IUI is most frequently performed with hormone (luteinising hormone (LH)) detection in urine or blood, or human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) injection. The usefulness of urinary LH monitoring is hampered by the possibility of false-negative results which can cause inaccurate timing and significantly reduce pregnancy rates. On the other hand, the ease of performing a test at home, the lower costs and the non-invasiveness are advantages. Limitations of timing by ultrasound and hCG administration are frequent hospital visits and the occurrence of premature LH surges or the possibility of triggering ovulation in the presence of an immature follicle. The major advantage of this hCG method is the clinical predictability of the ovulation.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics. </B>We found 18 randomised controlled trials, all comparing different timing methods in one treatment cycle for IUI, with a total of 2279 couples. The evidence was current to October 2013.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results. </B>We found no evidence of a difference in live birth rates between timing methods. We also found no evidence of a difference between any of the groups in rates of pregnancy or adverse events (multiple pregnancy, miscarriage, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)).</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence. </B>Most of the evidence was of low or very low quality. The main limitations were poor reporting of study methods, imprecision and losses to follow up. More research is needed.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-05-26 15:33:09 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In many countries intrauterine insemination (IUI) is the treatment of first choice for a subfertile couple when the infertility work up reveals an ovulatory cycle, at least one open Fallopian tube and sufficient spermatozoa. The final goal of this treatment is to achieve a pregnancy and deliver a healthy (singleton) live birth. The probability of conceiving with IUI depends on various factors including age of the couple, type of subfertility, ovarian stimulation and the timing of insemination. IUI should logically be performed around the moment of ovulation. Since spermatozoa and oocytes have only limited survival time correct timing of the insemination is essential. As it is not known which technique of timing for IUI results in the best treatment outcome, we compared different techniques for timing IUI and different time intervals.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-11-07 09:52:33 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>We searched for all publications which described randomised controlled trials of the timing of IUI. We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (1966 to October 2014), EMBASE (1974 to October 2014), MEDLINE (1966 to October 2014) and PsycINFO (inception to October 2014) electronic databases and prospective trial registers.

<P>Eighteen RCTs were included in the review, of which 14 were included in the meta-analyses (in total 2279 couples). The evidence was current to October 2013.

<P>Ten RCTs compared different methods of timing for IUI. We found no evidence of a difference in live birth rates between hCG injection versus LH surge (odds ratio (OR) 1.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06 to 18, 1 RCT, 24 women, very low quality evidence), urinary hCG versus recombinant hCG (OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.68 to 2.03, 1 RCT, 284 women, low quality evidence) or hCG versus GnRH agonist (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.42 to 2.6, 3 RCTS, 104 women, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%, low quality evidence).</P>
<P>Two RCTs compared the optimum time interval from hCG injection to IUI, comparing different time frames that ranged from 24 hours to 48 hours.

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-12-04 12:24:35 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Subfertility is usually defined as the inability of a couple to conceive after at least one year of unprotected intercourse. This is approximately 10% of couples who try to conceive. Subfertility is considered to be unexplained when an infertility work up consisting of cycle analysis, semen analysis and analysis of at least one patent Fallopian tube was unable to detect any abnormality. Couples with male subfertility have repeated semen analyses below the criteria for normal semen as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2010</LINK>). Couples suspected of cervical hostility used to be diagnosed by a well-timed non-progressive postcoital test, defined as the absence of spermatozoa moving in a straight direction and at a functional speed. However, nowadays the accuracy of this test and the existence of the diagnosis have been questioned. Finally, mild endometriosis is defined as grade I or II at diagnostic laparoscopy. When one of these causes for subfertility has been identified and the probability of a spontaneous pregnancy is low, the first treatment option is often intrauterine insemination (IUI), although couples with a good prognosis might benefit from expectant management (<LINK REF="REF-Steures-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steures 2006</LINK>). The final goal of this treatment is to achieve a pregnancy and deliver a healthy (singleton) live birth. The probability of conceiving with IUI depends on various confounding factors including age of the couple, type of subfertility, ovarian stimulation and the timing of insemination (<LINK REF="STD-Rahman-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Rahman 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>As spermatozoa and oocytes survive for only a limited period of time, correct timing of IUI seems essential. Therefore, IUI should logically be performed as close to ovulation as possible.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-12-04 12:25:17 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are several options for timing IUI including luteinising hormone (LH) testing, ultrasound scanning, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) injection, recombinant LH and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist administration, and basal body temperature (BBT) charts.</P>
<P>LH levels in urine or blood are one of the most precise predictors of ovulation. According to the WHO, ovulation in natural cycles takes place from 24 to 56 hours after the onset of the LH surge, with a mean time of 32 hours (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1980</LINK>).</P>
<P>In stimulated cycles, when the dominant follicle(s) reaches a certain mean diameter hCG is given to induce ovulation; which occurs approximately 36 to 40 hours after hCG injection (<LINK REF="REF-Andersen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andersen 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>GnRH agonist can also be used for final oocyte maturation and ovulation. GnRH agonists induce an endogenous surge of LH and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), giving a more physiologic approach than with exogenous hCG. The use of GnRH agonists is less widespread because of the high costs (<LINK REF="STD-Andr_x00e9_s_x002d_Oros-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Andrés-Oros 2008</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-12-03 11:21:26 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Each of these interventions is seeking to predict or synchronise ovulation, or both, in order to time the IUI to provide the best pregnancy outcomes.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-12-04 12:25:54 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Difficulties exist with the different methods of prediction and synchronisation of ovulation. The usefulness of urinary LH monitoring is hampered by the possibility of false-negative results, which may occur in up to 23% to 35% of ovulatory cycles. The LH peak values may be below the limit of detection for the urine ovulation prediction kit, or the duration of the LH surge is too short to be easily detected. This can cause inaccurate timing and significantly lower pregnancy rates. On the other hand, the ease of performing a test at home, the lower costs and the non-invasiveness are advantages of urinary LH monitoring (<LINK REF="STD-Lewis-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lewis 2006</LINK>). Timing by ultrasound combined with hCG administration is time consuming and limited by the possible occurrence of premature LH surges and the possibility of triggering ovulation in the presence of an immature egg (<LINK REF="REF-Cantineau-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cantineau 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cohlen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohlen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martinez-1991a" TYPE="STUDY">Martinez 1991a</LINK>). The major advantage of this hCG method is the clinical predictability of the ovulation. A combination of LH surge and hCG administration may minimise the limitations mentioned above (<LINK REF="REF-Kosmas-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kosmas 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>This review investigates which approach for synchronisation of ovulation results in the highest pregnancy and live birth rates for subfertile couples undergoing IUI.</P>

<P>Subfertile couples were eligible for inclusion. We included all types of subfertility where IUI is the first treatment option (for example unexplained subfertility, male subfertility, mild endometriosis, cervical hostility and cycle disturbances).</P>
<P>Routine fertility evaluation should have consisted of confirmed ovulatory status (by a biphasic basal body temperature chart, mid-luteal progesterone, or sonographic evidence of ovulation), tubal patency (by hysterosalpingography or laparoscopy, or both) and normal results in semen analysis. Subfertility was regarded as due to male factor when at least two separate semen samples did not meet the WHO criteria of normality. A normal quality semen sample was described as having a sperm concentration of 20 x 10<SUP>6</SUP> per mL, total motility 50%, normal morphology in 50%, and no sperm antibodies (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1987</LINK>). In 1992, the WHO changed its criteria for sperm morphology from 50% to 30% (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1992</LINK>) and for recent trials we used the 1992 definition of normality. Trials before 1992 should have used the WHO criteria of 1987. When strict criteria for morphology were used &gt; 14% was considered normal (<LINK REF="REF-Kruger-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kruger 1993</LINK>). Since 2010 the reference values have been adapted and the most important changes are: semen volume of 1.5 mL, a sperm concentration of 15 x 10<SUP>6</SUP> per mL, total motility 40% and normal morphology in 4% (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2010</LINK>). For future trials these criteria will be applied.</P>
<P>Mild endometriosis was defined as grade I or II at diagnostic laparoscopy. Cervical factor was defined as a negative result with well-timed postcoital testing. We reported in the review the differences between trials in defining the types of subfertility. Slight differences did not lead to exclusion.</P>

<P>Data for trial characteristics which have been recognised as potential sources of bias, such as the method used in generating the allocation sequence, how allocation was concealed, comparability of participants' baseline variables, and differences in dropout rates between study arms, were independently determined by MJ Janssen and AEP Cantineau as part of the data collection process. The criteria outlined in the<I> Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> Version 5.1.0 (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) were used. Where there was uncertainty, authors were contacted to clarify aspects of study design. Differences in agreement between review authors were resolved as described above.</P>
<P>Two review authors independently assessed the included studies for risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool (www.cochrane-handbook.org) using the following domains:</P>
<UL>
<LI>selection bias (random sequence generation and allocation concealment);</LI>
<LI>performance bias (blinding of participants and personnel);</LI>
<LI>detection bias (blinding of outcome assessment);</LI>
<LI>attrition bias (incomplete outcome data);</LI>
<LI>reporting bias (selective reporting);</LI>
<LI>other bias.</LI>
</UL>
<P>These domains were assessed to have:</P>
<UL>
<LI>high risk of bias;</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias;</LI>
<LI>low risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Disagreements were resolved by discussion or by a third review author. We described all judgements fully and presented the conclusions in the risk of bias table, which was incorporated into the interpretation of review findings by means of sensitivity analyses.</P>
<P>We judged that blinding of the researcher, the personnel or the participants could not influence the outcomes live birth rate, clinical pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate or any of the other outcomes. All included trials were therefore assessed as low risk of bias for blinding.</P>
<P>According to the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I>, a trial with missing data was judged as low risk of bias if the missing data were addressed adequately, there was no imbalance between intervention groups and the missing data were not related to the outcome.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Urinary LH versus hCG injection</HEADING>
<P>The use of the technique for timing IUI was one of the comparisons of interest in this review. <LINK REF="STD-Lewis-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lewis 2006</LINK> included one group of women which used a home ovulation predictor kit once a day: in the afternoon, starting on day 12. Insemination was scheduled the morning after the first positive test. The women in the hCG group started ultrasound monitoring on day 12 and 10,000 IU hCG was given when there was at least one follicle with a mean diameter of 20 mm and the endometrial thickness was at least 8 mm. A single IUI was scheduled 33 to 42 hours later. Any woman who did not satisfy criteria for hCG administration was instructed to perform home monitoring for an LH surge until their next ultrasound, and to schedule an insemination if her predictor kit gave a positive result. There were no details on how often LH surges were detected in the ultrasound group before a follicle reached the size of 20 mm.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Martinez-1991a" TYPE="STUDY">Martinez 1991a</LINK> started daily ultrasound scanning when total urinary estradiol excretion exceeded 200 mmol/24 hours. When the largest follicle reached a diameter between 18 and 20 mm on ultrasound and the total estradiol excretion was between 300 and 1200 nmol/24 hours women received 10,000 IU hCG. LH detection in the urine was done twice daily from the moment the dominant follicle reached the size of 15 mm. A single IUI was performed 36 to 40 hours after hCG administration or 16 to 28 hours after urinary LH surge detection.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Martinez-1991b" TYPE="STUDY">Martinez 1991b</LINK> started urinary LH monitoring twice a day when the dominant follicle had reached 15 mm in diameter.

From 37 to 40 hours after hCG a single IUI was performed.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Zreik-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Zreik 1999</LINK> started urinary LH monitoring in the morning on day 10 of the cycle. Ultrasound monitoring in the hCG group started on day 10 and 10,000 IU hCG was given when a leading follicle with diameter 18 mm diameter was noted.

<LINK REF="STD-Kyrou-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Kyrou 2012</LINK> was the only study using serum LH testing instead of urinary LH testing. The daily monitoring of serum LH levels could start from day 6 of the cycle until the LH rise. When LH started to rise, a second assessment was performed the next day to confirm the LH rise. Criteria for detection were an LH rise of 180% above the latest serum value. In the hCG group women received 5000 IU of hCG as soon as a follicle reached a diameter of &#8805; 17 mm. A single IUI was performed 36 h after initiation of the LH rise or 36 h after the hCG injection. In the case where the serum LH suggested an imminent ovulation (LH rise and rise in progesterone) the insemination was performed after 24 h.</P>

<P>Claman and co-workers stated that the most important reasons for dropping out were a spontaneous LH surge or an inadequate follicular response. Lewis and co-workers noted failure to detect an LH surge in 23% of the participants in the LH group.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-11-29 22:03:05 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The aim of this review was to investigate the optimal synchronisation of ovulation with intrauterine insemination (IUI) in subfertile couples undergoing natural and stimulated cycles with regard to live birth rates. The trials in this review revealed that not one of the available methods is superior to another. However, the available evidence is scarce due to small sample sizes and lack of data concerning the primary outcome.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">hCG injection versus LH surge detection</HEADING>
<P>Although the dropout rate in the LH surge group was much higher than in the hCG group (due to no detection of a LH surge in 23% of the cycles) there was no evidence of a difference in live birth or pregnancy rates between these treatment groups (OR 1.5, 95% CI 0.73 to 3.1) (<LINK REF="STD-Lewis-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lewis 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The cause of dropouts in the LH surge group could be the absence of detection of LH surges in urine samples. This has been reported in other studies as well, due to a short LH surge or incorrect use of the intervention by the woman (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1996</LINK>). When counselling couples, the advantages of home ovulation predictor tests (no difference in pregnancy outcomes compared to hCG injection, convenience and low costs) and disadvantages (high number of false-negative results) should be considered in relationship to the advantages (low number of false-negative results) and disadvantages (expensive and time consuming) of ultrasound detection combined with hCG injection. No data on the occurrences of premature LH surges in the hCG group have been reported in the pooled studies. This might negatively influence the treatment outcome in the hCG group, resulting in lower pregnancy rates and no perceptible difference between timing using LH surge detection and hCG injection (<LINK REF="REF-Cantineau-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cantineau 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>The general quality of the evidence was estimated to be low or very low, meaning that further research is likely or very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change this estimate (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Urinary hCG (u-hCG) versus recombinant hCG (r-hCG)</HEADING>
<P>No evidence of a difference in pregnancy rates was found between u-hCG and r-hCG. Other reasons such as costs, injection site reactions and possible batch-to-batch inconsistencies should be considered in deciding which to use.</P>
<P>The general quality of the evidence was estimated to be low or very low (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Short (24 hours) versus long interval (36 hours)</HEADING>
<P>The evidence provided by prospective studies (<LINK REF="STD-AboulGheit-2010" TYPE="STUDY">AboulGheit 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rahman-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Rahman 2011</LINK>) comparing different hCG to IUI intervals after ovarian stimulation revealed more live births when an interval of 34 to 36 hours was used. However, this difference was not statistically significant. A higher number of pregnancies was reported when IUI was performed 34 to 36 hours after hCG compared to IUI 24 hours after hCG injection. This might be in part due to a significant difference in the duration of subfertility (significantly longer in the 24 hours group in the study of <LINK REF="STD-AboulGheit-2010" TYPE="STUDY">AboulGheit 2010</LINK>). This study and other studies that only reported pregnancy rate per cycle suggest a more flexible approach in timing IUI after hCG, which allows women to inject hCG in the early evening when pharmacies are still open, in case of problems (<LINK REF="STD-Claman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Claman 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The general quality of the evidence was estimated to be low or very low (<LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">hCG versus GnRH agonist (GnRH-a)</HEADING>
<P>No evidence of a difference was found, when analysing live birth rates and pregnancy rates, between the timing methods using hCG and GnRH-a. More evidence is needed to determine the place of GnRH-a as a timing method for IUI, also considering costs and secondary outcomes such as the OHSS rate.</P>
<P>The general quality of the evidence was estimated to be low or very low (<LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Early hCG versus late hCG depending on the size of the dominant follicle</HEADING>
<P>As well as the ITT analysis, the per protocol analysis reported no advantage of hCG injection with a dominant follicle between 16.0 and 16.9 mm compared to a dominant follicle between 18.0 and 18.9 mm (<LINK REF="STD-da-Silva-2012" TYPE="STUDY">da Silva 2012</LINK>). Significantly more dominant follicles and significantly higher estradiol levels were seen in the late group without significantly increased numbers of premature LH surges or clinical pregnancies. No information was reported on the exact sizes of the dominant follicles. For example, when a dominant follicle was 17 mm in the early group it was unclear whether it was stated as a major protocol deviation. Since the day of hCG administration and the total dose of HMG did not differ, it is questionable how different the groups really were.</P>
<P>The general quality of the evidence was estimated to be low or very low (<LINK REF="SOF-05" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 5</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Different dosages of hCG</HEADING>
<P>No evidence of a difference was found between 250 µg r-hCG and 500 µg r-hCG. Significantly more dominant follicles were seen in the 250 µg r-hCG group, which might be a confounding factor.</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence overall was estimated to be low or very low (<LINK REF="SOF-06" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 6</LINK>).</P>

<P>There is insufficient evidence to determine whether different methods of synchronization of ovulation and insemination differ in safety and effectiveness. More research is needed.</P>
<P>There is no evidence to advise one of the treatment options over another (ultrasound combined with hCG injection versus urinary LH surge detection, medication to time the insemination, dose of medication, time interval between medication and insemination) since live births and pregnancy rates do not differ significantly. The choice should be based on hospital facilities, convenience for the couple, medical staff, costs and dropout levels.</P>
<P>The choice of urinary hCG or recombinant hCG should be based on costs and couples' preferences since pregnancy rates are not significantly different.</P>
<P>Since the evidence suggested an advantage of insemination 34 to 36 hours after hCG, this could be advised until more reliable evidence is available from well-powered RCTs.</P>
<P>The results suggest that no advice could be given on the timing of hCG injection in relationship to the size of the dominant follicles nor on the dosages of recombinant hCG.</P>

<P>The protocol stated that women with ovulatory disturbances should not be included. Since the available evidence was scarce we decided to include studies where a proportion of the included women suffered from ovulatory disturbances. In the updated version we were more liberal towards whether a study was truly randomised; when the trial design did not mention the allocation concealment certain studies were included, identifying it as at high risk on bias in the table of included studies.</P>
<P>The protocol stated that if more than 10% of the cycles were cancelled, these data would not be incorporated in the meta-analysis. Since only a few studies were available, higher dropout rates and cancelled cycles were accepted in the published version as well as in the updated version of the review.</P>
<P>The protocol stated that we would report miscarriage and multiple pregnancy results per woman randomised. For the full review and this update we reported miscarriage and multiple pregnancy results per pregnancy.</P>
<P>2014 update: methods sections updated to current Cochrane recommendations.</P>
