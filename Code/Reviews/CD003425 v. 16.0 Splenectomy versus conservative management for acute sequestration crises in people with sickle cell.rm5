<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-09-15 11:18:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We reviewed the evidence to see whether removing all, of part of, the spleen to prevent acute splenic sequestration improved survival and decreased illness in people with sickle cell disease, as compared with regular blood transfusion. This is a 2017 update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2002, and previously updated, most recently in 2015.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>In some people with sickle cell disease, red blood cells become trapped and destroyed in the spleen. This damages the spleen, which may become enlarged leading to splenic sequestration crises. These crises consist of abdominal pain, rapid heart rate and other symptoms. Such an attack can be fatal without prompt treatment. All or part of the spleen (splenectomy) is often removed after a person has survived such a crisis to try and prevent another one. This surgery may leave the individual at a higher risk of infection. We looked for trials which compared surgery to blood transfusions.</P>
<P>
<B>Search date</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence is current to: 14 August 2017.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>We found no trials to provide reliable evidence about the risks or benefits of splenectomy for people with sickle cell disease after splenic sequestration. There is a need for a trial to assess the benefits and risks of splenectomy compared to transfusion programmes.</P>
<P>There are no trials included in the review and we have not identified any relevant trials up to August 2017. We will continue to run searches to identify any potentially relevant trials; however, we do not plan to update other sections of the review until new trials are published.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-08-30 20:36:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Acute splenic sequestration crises are a complication of sickle cell disease, with high mortality rates and frequent recurrence in survivors of first attacks. Splenectomy and blood transfusion, with their consequences, are the mainstay of long-term management used in different parts of the world. This is a 2017 update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2002, and previously updated, most recently in 2015.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess whether splenectomy (total or partial), to prevent acute splenic sequestration crises in people with sickle cell disease, improved survival and decreased morbidity in people with sickle cell disease, as compared with regular blood transfusions.</P>

</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-09-11 13:05:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Splenectomy, if full, will prevent further sequestration and if partial, may reduce the recurrence of acute splenic sequestration crises. However, there is a lack of evidence from trials showing that splenectomy improves survival and decreases morbidity in people with sickle cell disease. There is a need for a well-designed, adequately-powered, randomized controlled trial to assess the benefits and risks of splenectomy compared to transfusion programmes, as a means of improving survival and decreasing mortality from acute splenic sequestration in people with sickle cell disease.</P>
<P>There are no trials included in the review and we have not identified any relevant trials up to August 2017. We will continue to run searches to identify any potentially relevant trials; however, we do not plan to update other sections of the review until new trials are published.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2017-10-12 15:15:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-10-12 15:15:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-10-12 15:15:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a generic term for a group of inherited genetic disorders of haemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying protein contained in red blood cells. Under low oxygen tension the abnormal haemoglobin polymerises, distorting the red blood cells into a sickle shape. This sickling has two effects; firstly the sickled cells block small blood vessels resulting in tissue damage; and secondly the sickled cells are easily removed from circulation, resulting in anaemia. Common complications of SCD include increased severity of infections, pain episodes, stroke, kidney failure, chest infections and lung damage (acute sickle chest syndrome). In addition, growth and development may be delayed (<LINK REF="REF-Platt-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Platt 1984</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Sickle cell disease was originally a disease of African, Indian, and Middle Eastern heritage because the carrier state affords protection against severe malaria; but migration has now made it a global problem (<LINK REF="REF-Davies-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 1989</LINK>). The inheritance is in an autosomal recessive pattern, so individuals with SCD have inherited abnormal genes from both parents. The inheritance of the gene for sickle haemoglobin may be combined with those for other structurally abnormal haemoglobins, such as haemoglobin C, and also with abnormalities of haemoglobin production, such as beta thalassaemia.</P>
<P>Splenic sequestration occurs when red blood cells become entrapped in the spleen, which enlarges, pooling and then destroying the red blood cells. It is defined clinically as a fall of two grams per decilitre (g/dL) or more in blood haemoglobin concentration from the persons' normal levels, and an enlarging spleen (<LINK REF="REF-Topley-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Topley 1981</LINK>). Splenic sequestration crisis can be either acute or chronic. An acute splenic sequestration (ASS) is when splenic sequestration occurs rapidly. It manifests clinically as abdominal pain and distension, pallor, weakness, breathlessness, and rapid heart rate (<LINK REF="REF-Al_x002d_Salem-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al-Salem 1999</LINK>). Chronic sequestration (hypersplenism) has a gradual onset and can follow an attack of ASS (<LINK REF="REF-Topley-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Topley 1981</LINK>).</P>
<P>The incidence of ASS in homozygous SCD is highest in young children, ranging from 7% to 30% in children up to two years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Powell-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powell 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Topley-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Topley 1981</LINK>). After infection, ASS is the second most common cause of death in the first decade of life accounting for between 15% to 44% of deaths in this period (<LINK REF="REF-Emond-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emond 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Powell-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powell 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Topley-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Topley 1981</LINK>). The first attack can occur in infants as young as five weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Airede-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Airede 1992</LINK>), but attacks are uncommon after puberty. Most cases are seen in individuals with homozygous (SS) sickle cell anaemia, but have also been reported in S beta thalassaemia and sickle haemoglobin C (SC). Mortality can be reduced by the early detection of SCD by neonatal screening, followed by parental education (to detect splenic enlargement and pallor) and by early clinical intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Emond-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emond 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Powell-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powell 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Acute splenic sequestration crisis is a medical emergency that requires the immediate restoration of blood volume, usually with red cell transfusions. ASS recurs in about 50% of survivors of the first attack with diminishing intervals between subsequent crises (<LINK REF="REF-Emond-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emond 1985</LINK>). The mortality rate of the survivors who suffer a recurrence is approximately 20% (<LINK REF="REF-Topley-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Topley 1981</LINK>). Due to the frequency of recurrences, both long-term blood transfusion therapy and the surgical removal of the spleen (splenectomy) have been used as methods to prevent further ASS and death (<LINK REF="REF-Grover-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grover 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although transfusions have been used to reduce the frequency of attacks of ASS, they are expensive, time-consuming, and are associated with adverse effects including development of antibodies to red blood cells (alloimmunization), iron overload, transmission of blood-borne infections such as hepatitis and HIV, and allergic reactions (<LINK REF="REF-Rao-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rao 1985</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-08-30 20:37:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Splenectomy (full, partial, and embolisation) is also used to prevent ASS. The advantages of having a splenectomy include stopping blood transfusions and the absence of discomfort from mechanical pressure of the enlarged spleen (<LINK REF="REF-Al_x002d_Salem-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al-Salem 1999</LINK>). The main objection to performing a splenectomy in young children with SCD is the increased risk of infection. The risk of septicaemia after splenectomy is approximately 2% overall, 4% in children less than four years of age, and can be 30% or more in children in the first year of life (<LINK REF="REF-Idowu-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Idowu 1998</LINK>). Current UK guidelines recommend that people who have had a splenectomy should receive lifelong prophylactic penicillin, and be given pneumococcal vaccine before surgery with boosters every three years after splenectomy. <I>Haemophilus influenzae </I>(<I>H influenzae</I>) type b and meningococcal vaccines have also been recommended (<LINK REF="REF-WPBCSH-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">WPBCSH 1996</LINK>). There is also concern that children living in malaria endemic regions have an increased risk of malarial attacks following a splenectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-1945" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 1945</LINK>). The fear of loss of the immune protection the spleen gives to the body and of having to undergo surgery are disincentives for splenectomy. Partial splenectomies are performed as an alternative in children in order to try and retain some immune competence, which would otherwise have been lost (<LINK REF="REF-Idowu-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Idowu 1998</LINK>). Other problems associated with partial or full splenectomy include: the risk of having recurrences of ASS in the remnant spleen; and anaesthetic and surgical complications, such as left lower lung collapse.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-08-30 20:51:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>As there is continuing debate over the risks and benefits of splenectomy compared to repeated exchange transfusion as strategies to avoid recurrent attacks of ASS, we have reviewed the advantages and disadvantages of both full and partial splenectomy to prevent recurrence of ASS in people with SCD.</P>
<P>This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2002, and most recently updated in 2015 (<LINK REF="REF-Owusu_x002d_Ofori-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Owusu-Ofori 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Owusu_x002d_Ofori-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Owusu-Ofori 2015</LINK>).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2017-09-11 12:59:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>There is a paucity of evidence to support splenectomy, by whatever means, performed to improve survival and decrease morbidity from ASS.</P>
<P>Common practice for the initial management of ASS is red cell transfusion to manage shock (hypovolaemia) and to alleviate symptoms of anaemia. After this, the long-term management options are a splenectomy; a transfusion programme; or careful observation for early signs of ASS until the spleen gradually becomes non-functional (splenic atrophy). In certain places, the choice of treatment depends on the severity of the initial episode of ASS and the age of individual. In developing countries, where the regular supply of 'zero-risk' blood may not be constant, chronic transfusion programmes are hardly considered as part of management of ASS. Chronic transfusions have been advocated by some, to protect susceptible children from recurrent attacks of ASS until splenic atrophy has occurred (<LINK REF="REF-Topley-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Topley 1981</LINK>).</P>
<P>Splenectomies have also been suggested for children with a variety of presentations (<LINK REF="REF-Grover-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grover 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Topley-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Topley 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wright-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 1999</LINK>). The obvious advantage of having the spleen removed is that it prevents recurrent events, but the counter arguments are that splenectomy compromises their already impaired immune status and the operation being unnecessary in a condition in which the spleen is likely to become non-functional. Another debatable point is whether the spleen, after an attack of ASS, or in established hypersplenism (i.e. chronic enlargement of spleen with a persistent reduction in haemoglobin level), makes any contribution to the immune status of the individual. It is also prudent to bear in mind that the child with sickle cell anaemia after surgical splenectomy may have a similar risk as one in whom the natural phenomenon of 'autosplenectomy' (nature's own physiological spleen removal) has occurred.</P>
<P>Few people with SCD in high-income countries, who are known to have received prophylactic penicillin and pneumococcal and <I>H influenzae</I> vaccines after splenectomy, go on to suffer overwhelming infection (<LINK REF="REF-Emond-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emond 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kinney-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kinney 1990</LINK>). In the UK, guidelines for the prevention and treatment of infection in people with an absent or dysfunctional spleen (asplenia) recommend pneumococcal and <I>H influenzae </I>type b immunization, as well as life-long prophylactic antibiotics (<LINK REF="REF-WPBCSH-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">WPBCSH 1996</LINK>). The above prophylactic measures may reduce the risk of septicaemia but may not guarantee protection from penicillin-resistant organisms. Asplenic individuals are at risk of severe falciparum malaria and thus adherence to antimalarial prophylaxis in malaria endemic regions cannot be overemphasised (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-1945" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 1945</LINK>).</P>
<P>Different forms of splenectomy (such as partial splenectomy, splenic embolisation, and splenic irradiation) are employed in the management of chronic splenic enlargement in order to preserve splenic tissue and function (<LINK REF="REF-Idowu-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Idowu 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pinca-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pinca 1992</LINK>). The advantages of less invasive procedures include avoidance of large scars, and the absence of high platelet counts normally resulting from splenectomy. Disadvantages such as infections and the reappearance of hypersplenism could result. Laparoscopic splenectomy is also another described alternative (<LINK REF="REF-Hendricks-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hendricks 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Clinicians must, however, bear in mind that the risks of splenectomy should be compared with those of potential therapies such as blood transfusion and weighed against the dangers of their complications. It should also be considered that the natural history of ASS shows recurrence after the age of five years to be less likely.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-09-11 12:58:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>No randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of splenectomy for splenic sequestration were found for inclusion in this review. Therefore, the research evidence on which to base clinical decisions is limited to case series and other less robust trials.</P>
<P>There are no trials included in the review and we have not identified any relevant trials up to August 2017. We will continue to run searches to identify any potentially relevant trials; however, we do not plan to update other sections of the review until new trials are published.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-09-11 12:58:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>This systematic review has identified the need for a well-designed, adequately-powered RCT to assess the benefits and risks of splenectomy compared to transfusion programmes, as a means of improving survival and decreasing mortality from acute splenic sequestration in people with sickle cell disease.</P>
