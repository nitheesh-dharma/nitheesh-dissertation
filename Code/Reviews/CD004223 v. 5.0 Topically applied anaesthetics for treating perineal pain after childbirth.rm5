<P>Not enough evidence to say if local anaesthetics applied to the perineum help to relieve perineal pain after childbirth.</P>
<P>The perineum is the area between a woman's vagina and rectum, which may be traumatised during childbirth following a tear or a surgical cut (episiotomy). Local anaesthetics are easy to use and inexpensive, but their effectiveness needs to be assessed. This review of trials found eight studies using a variety of anaesthetics. There were not enough data to say if they helped with pain, and long-term effects were not assessed. More research is required to assess the effectiveness of topical anaesthetics on pain, longer-term outcomes, relationships and quality of life, as well as the effectiveness of different topical anaesthetics.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Perineal trauma is a major problem affecting millions of women around the world each year. The degree of perineal pain and discomfort associated with perineal trauma is often underestimated. Pain often interferes with basic daily activities for the woman such as walking, sitting and passing urine and also negatively impacts on motherhood experiences.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of topically applied anaesthetics for relief of perineal pain following childbirth whilst in hospital and following discharge. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (June 2007).</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials comparing topically applied anaesthetic with no treatment, placebo or alternative treatment.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility and quality and double-entered the data. We contacted study authors for additional information.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Eight trials made up of 976 women were included in the review. Five of these trials measured pain experienced up to 24 hours after birth but different methods to assess pain were used in each of the studies. All five trials showed no difference in pain relief when the topical anaesthetic was compared with placebo. One of these studies looked at topical anaesthetics compared with indomethacin vaginal suppositories but there was no significant difference in mean pain scores. All trials reported only short-term follow up (up to four days). Two trials looked at additional analgesia taken for perineal pain, with one trial finding that less additional analgesia was required with epifoam use in comparison with placebo (relative risk (RR) 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 0.84, one trial, 97 women). However, lignocaine/lidocaine showed no difference with regard to additional analgesia use. Adverse effects were not formally measured in the studies; however, some studies commented that there were no side-effects severe enough to discontinue treatment. One study found that the women in the treatment group were more satisfied than the placebo group (RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.65, one trial, 103 women).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Evidence for the effectiveness of topically applied local anaesthetics for treating perineal pain is not compelling. There has been no evaluation for the long-term effects of topically applied local anaesthetics. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND>
<P>Perineal pain from a tear or an episiotomy (surgical cut) is a major problem affecting women giving birth vaginally (<LINK REF="REF-Albers-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Albers 1999</LINK>). In resource-rich countries at least 65% of women suffer from perineal trauma (<LINK REF="REF-Albers-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Albers 1999</LINK>). In low- and middle-income countries data of this sort are scarce. However, it is apparent that about 35% to 45% of women who give birth in a hospital have an episiotomy (<LINK REF="REF-Maduma_x002d_Butsche-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maduma-Butsche 1998</LINK>). The extent of perineal trauma is often underestimated (<LINK REF="REF-Steen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steen 2000</LINK>) and so too is the impact of perineal trauma on experiences of motherhood (<LINK REF="REF-Glazener-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 1995</LINK>). Negative consequences include reduced mobility, urinary and faecal incontinence and sexual dysfunction. These may lead to mental exhaustion (<LINK REF="REF-Sultan-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sultan 1994</LINK>). Negative effects can influence the mother's relationship with her baby and her family, which may cause relationship disharmony and in extreme cases complete marital breakdown (<LINK REF="REF-Sleep-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sleep 1991</LINK>). </P>
<P>Perineal pain is strongly associated with perineal trauma following normal or instrumental vaginal birth. Pain is reported to be most severe in the immediate postnatal period, however, discomfort continues for up to two weeks postpartum in 20% to 25% of women (<LINK REF="REF-Albers-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Albers 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sleep-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sleep 1984</LINK>). For 10% of women pain continues for at least three months (<LINK REF="REF-Glazener-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sleep-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sleep 1984</LINK>). </P>
<P>Strategies to reduce perineal trauma and appropriate repair of perineal damage are the best primary methods for avoiding and alleviating pain. Provision of safe and effective treatment where perineal trauma cannot be prevented is important. It is also important to provide cost-effective treatment.</P>
<P>Numerous treatments to relieve perineal pain have been used in clinical practice, such as local anaesthetics, oral analgesics, therapeutic ultrasound, antiseptics and non-pharmacological applications such as ice packs and baths (<LINK REF="REF-Grant-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grant 1989</LINK>). Cochrane reviews have been prepared on some of these topics: 'Therapeutic ultrasound for postpartum perineal pain and dyspareunia' (<LINK REF="REF-Hay_x002d_Smith-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hay-Smith 1998</LINK>) and 'Rectal analgesia for pain relief from perineal trauma following childbirth' (<LINK REF="REF-Hedayati-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hedayati 2003</LINK>); and a Cochrane protocol has been published: 'Local cooling for relieving pain from perineal trauma sustained during childbirth' (<LINK REF="REF-East-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">East 2007</LINK>). This review will focus on topically applied anaesthetic agents for relief of perineal pain. </P>
<P>Anaesthetics can provide pain relief by blocking painful sensations either locally or systemically. Local anaesthetics may be grouped as aminoesters or aminoamide compounds (<LINK REF="REF-Berde-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berde 2000</LINK>) and they cause "a lack of sensation in a circumscribed area of the body" (<LINK REF="REF-Savarese-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Savarese 1986</LINK>). The routes of local anaesthetic administration include inhalation when volatile and can be applied topically in the form of sprays, gels and creams. Topical anaesthetics include cocaine, benzocaine, EMLA (lidocaine/prilocaine) and lidocaine and are advantageous in that they are inexpensive and easy to use (<LINK REF="REF-Sleep-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sleep 1988</LINK>).</P>
<P>Topical agents have been used for other types of pain such as for venous leg ulcers and for circumcision in newborn boys and found to be successful in reducing pain (<LINK REF="REF-Briggs-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Briggs 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taddio-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taddio 1999</LINK>). In addition, although topical anaesthetics enter breast milk they generally have no risk of affecting the baby at therapeutic dose levels (<LINK REF="REF-MIMS-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">MIMS 2001</LINK>). This suggests that topical anaesthetic agents may be a safe and effective treatment for perineal pain.</P>
<P>This review aims to systematically evaluate evidence currently available from randomised controlled trials on the effects of topically applied local anaesthetics for perineal trauma following childbirth.</P>

<P>We considered all studies identified by the search strategy outlined above for inclusion. We evaluated included trials for appropriateness and methodological quality without consideration of their results. Two authors independently assessed trials for inclusion. Any differences of opinion were resolved by discussion. Reasons for excluding trials were recorded and reported in the review. </P>
<P>We assigned quality scores for allocation concealment to each trial, using the criteria described in Section six of the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2003</LINK>): A = adequate; B = unclear; C = clearly inadequate.</P>
<P>Completeness of follow up:<BR/>(a) less than 3% of participants excluded;<BR/>(b) 3% to 9.9% of participants excluded;<BR/>(c) 10% to 19.9% of participants excluded;<BR/>(d) 20% or more excluded;<BR/>(e) unclear.</P>
<P>Where appropriate, we also assessed studies for blinding:<BR/>(a) neither investigator nor participant knew or were likely to guess the allocated treatment;<BR/>(b) either the investigator or the participant knew the allocation or side-effects of one or other treatment mean that it is likely that for a significant proportion of participants (at least 20%) the allocation could be correctly identified;<BR/>(c) no blinding, both investigator and participant knew (or were likely to guess) the allocated treatment;<BR/>(d) unclear.<BR/>Due to the nature of the interventions, studies that were not blinded were planned to be included in the review. </P>
<P>Where feasible, we planned to undertake the following subgroup analyses:<BR/>(a) type of topical anaesthetic used;<BR/>(b) dosage of topical anaesthetics;<BR/>(c) spontaneous vaginal birth versus operative vaginal birth;<BR/>(d) episiotomy compared with perineal tear;<BR/>(e) primiparous women compared with multiparous women.<BR/>None of these subgroup analyses were undertaken due to the limited data available from the trials.</P>
<P>Two authors independently extracted and double-entered the data. There was no blinding of authorship. Whenever necessary, we sought unpublished data from investigators. We performed statistical analyses using Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>).

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Harrison-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 1987a</LINK> measured pain before administration of the medication and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 hours after administration, using pain intensity scores, pain relief scores and global assessments.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Harrison-1987b" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 1987b</LINK> measured pain before a single dose of the spray and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 hours after administration of the spray, using pain relief scores and global assessments.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Hutchins-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchins 1985</LINK>, women recorded their pain for the first four days after birth, using a 10 cm visual analogue scale, ranging from no pain to extremely severe pain.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Minassian-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Minassian 2002</LINK>, the primary outcome was the amount of pain relief obtained from using the ointment during the first two days postpartum. This was measured by assessing the amount of ointment used and the total number of pain medication pills taken by the woman. A pain questionnaire with visual and linear analogue scales was used and completed by the women in the morning of postpartum day one or two.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Seckin-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Seckin 2002</LINK> measured perineal pain intensity using a verbal rating scale at time points 0, 15, 30, 60 and 90 minutes postepisiotomy.</P>
<P>The inclusion criteria for the eight individual studies varied. While <LINK REF="STD-Corkill-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Corkill 2001</LINK> included primiparous and multiparous women who had a normal birth of a healthy baby and had sustained a first- or second-degree tear, <LINK REF="STD-Hanretty-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Hanretty 1984</LINK> had more specific criteria of primigravida or secundigravida women between 18 and 30 years of age who had a normal vaginal birth. In comparison, <LINK REF="STD-Hutchins-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchins 1985</LINK> defined the inclusion criteria as women who had a normal vaginal birth without an episiotomy extension by more than 1 cm. The inclusion criteria for the two Harrison studies (<LINK REF="STD-Harrison-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 1987a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harrison-1987b" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 1987b</LINK>) were different and included women over 16 years of age, who had given birth 24 to 72 hours previously, and were experiencing moderate to severe pain in association with an episiotomy. The women were ambulant and had not received analgesia or sedation during the preceding 11 hours. <LINK REF="STD-Minassian-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Minassian 2002</LINK> included women who gave birth vaginally and had an episiotomy or a perineal laceration, while <LINK REF="STD-Seckin-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Seckin 2002</LINK> only included women with an episiotomy smaller than 4 cm. For inclusion in <LINK REF="STD-Greer-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Greer 1984</LINK> women needed to complain of episiotomy pain.</P>
<P>The exclusion criteria in the five studies varied greatly. The two Harrison studies (<LINK REF="STD-Harrison-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 1987a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harrison-1987b" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 1987b</LINK>) excluded women if they had perineal bruising, infection or haemorrhoids likely to be the source of pain, birth before 38 weeks, had postpartum pain of greater severity than their episiotomy pain, were suffering from significant medical or psychiatric conditions, were sensitive to local anaesthetics, were receiving medication likely to affect pain recording, had received epidural anaesthesia or had extended episiotomy or lacerations. <LINK REF="STD-Corkill-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Corkill 2001</LINK> excluded women who had suffered a postpartum haemorrhage or manual removal of placenta, inability to speak English, and significant medical or psychiatric disorders. Women with a known sensitivity to lignocaine, receiving treatment for gastric/duodenal ulcers or hypertension, and those taking beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs were also excluded. <LINK REF="STD-Hanretty-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Hanretty 1984</LINK> excluded women with any pre-existing medical or surgical disease which might have affected wound healing, eg diabetes, previous third degree tear. <LINK REF="STD-Hutchins-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchins 1985</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Greer-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Greer 1984</LINK> did not mention any exclusion criteria. <LINK REF="STD-Minassian-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Minassian 2002</LINK> excluded women with a history of adverse reactions to local anaesthetic or lidocaine, cardiac disease, class C diabetes or more on the White classification, or neurological disease affecting the lower extremities. <LINK REF="STD-Seckin-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Seckin 2002</LINK> excluded women with a perineal laceration, operative vaginal birth and episiotomy larger than 5 cm.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Corkill-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Corkill 2001</LINK> used consecutively numbered sealed envelopes to allocate women to one of two groups. Randomisation was in blocks of 10 and a central register of allocation was held in the hospital pharmacy. <LINK REF="STD-Minassian-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Minassian 2002</LINK> used identical jars dispensed from the pharmacy, according to a table of random numbers. These studies were both ranked as having adequate concealment of allocation. <LINK REF="STD-Greer-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Greer 1984</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hanretty-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Hanretty 1984</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hutchins-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchins 1985</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Seckin-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Seckin 2002</LINK> had unclear methods of randomisation. In these studies women were allocated to experimental or control groups immediately after birth. No further information was given regarding randomisation and how well treatment allocation was concealed. Harrison (<LINK REF="STD-Harrison-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 1987a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harrison-1987b" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 1987b</LINK>) allocated women at random into the different groups. Women received the next consecutively numbered set of trial medication, the containers being numbered previously so that the various treatments occurred at random. They provided no information regarding concealment of treatment allocation.</P>
<P>The placebo used in the studies ranged from inert lubricating gel (Aquagel) (<LINK REF="STD-Corkill-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Corkill 2001</LINK>), aqueous cream (<LINK REF="STD-Hanretty-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Hanretty 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hutchins-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchins 1985</LINK>) or distilled water in the form of a spray (<LINK REF="STD-Harrison-1987b" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 1987b</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Harrison-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 1987a</LINK> used a placebo tablet as a double-dummy in each of its four arms but the tablet composition was not stated. <LINK REF="STD-Greer-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Greer 1984</LINK> used aqueous foam as the placebo, while <LINK REF="STD-Minassian-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Minassian 2002</LINK> used a placebo ointment. <LINK REF="STD-Seckin-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Seckin 2002</LINK> was the only study where the control group received no intervention.</P>
<P>Four out of the six trials stated that they were double-blinded studies (<LINK REF="STD-Corkill-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Corkill 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hanretty-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Hanretty 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hutchins-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchins 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Minassian-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Minassian 2002</LINK>). Of these, <LINK REF="STD-Hanretty-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Hanretty 1984</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Corkill-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Corkill 2001</LINK> made no mention of who was blinded or how it was achieved. <LINK REF="STD-Hutchins-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchins 1985</LINK> did make mention of unlabelled agents being supplied to the women to mask the participants from knowing; however, no further mention of who else was blinded was made. The two Harrison studies (<LINK REF="STD-Harrison-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 1987a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harrison-1987b" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 1987b</LINK>) did not state that they were double-blinded but did blind the women. In <LINK REF="STD-Harrison-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 1987a</LINK> this was done by providing canisters and tablets that were identical in appearance and in <LINK REF="STD-Harrison-1987b" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 1987b</LINK> while the nurse-observer was not blinded, they supplied identical aerosol canisters identified only with a treatment number hence blinding the women. In <LINK REF="STD-Minassian-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Minassian 2002</LINK>, women and medical personnel were masked to the jar content and in <LINK REF="STD-Seckin-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Seckin 2002</LINK> blinding was unclear.</P>
<P>The two trials carried out by Harrison (<LINK REF="STD-Harrison-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 1987a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harrison-1987b" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 1987b</LINK>) as well as <LINK REF="STD-Hanretty-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Hanretty 1984</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Seckin-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Seckin 2002</LINK> all had complete follow up. <LINK REF="STD-Corkill-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Corkill 2001</LINK> had an 89.2% to 94.7% and 78.4% to 88% response rate for 24 and 48 hour data respectively. Unfortunately, only 147/180 (81.7%) of women in the <LINK REF="STD-Hutchins-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchins 1985</LINK> trial recorded pain levels and the amount of pain relief used on the visual analogue scale. In <LINK REF="STD-Minassian-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Minassian 2002</LINK>, there were data for 186/200 (93%) of women; and only 167/200 (83.5%) of questionnaires were filled in adequately.</P>

<P>Eight trials made up of 976 women were included in the review.

Only three of these outcomes (pain experienced up to 24 hours after birth; pain experienced between 24 hours and 72 hours after birth; and additional analgesia for perineal pain) had data from more than one trial to include in the meta-analysis. Two of the trials presented data in a format that was not useable in RevMan Analyses (<LINK REF="STD-Harrison-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 1987a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harrison-1987b" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 1987b</LINK>) since they only reported the mean values without reporting the standard deviations. In <LINK REF="STD-Hutchins-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchins 1985</LINK> only the additional analgesia data could be used. In <LINK REF="STD-Greer-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Greer 1984</LINK> an ordinal rather than a continuous variable, that is, a four category scale for pain scores, was used and therefore could not be combined with the other studies in the meta-analysis.

The four studies used different methods to measure pain experienced (101-Numeric Rating Scale in <LINK REF="STD-Corkill-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Corkill 2001</LINK>, linear analogue scale in <LINK REF="STD-Hanretty-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Hanretty 1984</LINK>, the amount of ointment used in <LINK REF="STD-Minassian-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Minassian 2002</LINK> and a verbal rating scale in <LINK REF="STD-Seckin-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Seckin 2002</LINK>). Nevertheless, none of the studies showed any statistically significant difference between the treatment and control group. For the three studies measuring pain with scales, the standardised mean difference (SMD) was -0.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.47 to 0.04), with an I<SUP>2</SUP> (heterogeneity statistic) of 0%. <LINK REF="STD-Minassian-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Minassian 2002</LINK> used the Visual Analogue Scale and Linear Rating Scale to measure pain but the data were reported as median values (refer to 'Other data' in tables) and the results from these scales were consistent with those in the three studies using scales and reporting means and standard deviations. This study also measured pain experienced through the amount of ointment used by women; however, this also showed no statistically significant differences between the groups. The two Harrison studies (<LINK REF="STD-Harrison-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 1987a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harrison-1987b" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 1987b</LINK>) reported pain within 24 hours of administration; however, data were not in an appropriate format for meta-analysis. <LINK REF="STD-Harrison-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 1987a</LINK> found aqueous lignocaine to be better than placebo, although alcoholic lignocaine showed no difference. <LINK REF="STD-Harrison-1987b" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 1987b</LINK> found women using the lignocaine and cinchocaine sprays had lower pain intensity scores than women using placebo six hours after administration; however, this was not a statistically significant difference. <LINK REF="STD-Hutchins-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchins 1985</LINK> reported pain outcomes using median values, finding that women in the epifoam and lignocaine gel group experienced less pain than the placebo group.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The topical anaesthetics used in the trials included in this review include lignocaine (<LINK REF="STD-Corkill-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Corkill 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harrison-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 1987a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harrison-1987b" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 1987b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hutchins-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchins 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Minassian-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Minassian 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seckin-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Seckin 2002</LINK>) cinchocaine (<LINK REF="STD-Harrison-1987b" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 1987b</LINK>), and a topical preparation of 1% hydrocortisone acetate and 1% pramoxine hydrochloride (<LINK REF="STD-Greer-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Greer 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hanretty-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Hanretty 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hutchins-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchins 1985</LINK>). The variety of topical anaesthetics used in the eight included trials meant that the capacity to pool data was limited and this made interpretation difficult. The different methods of measuring pain also made comparisons between trials difficult.</P>
<P>From the limited data available from the trials, topically applied anaesthetics did not show clear benefits in relieving pain experienced after birth. Use of additional analgesia for perineal pain was found to be reduced for epifoam compared with placebo in <LINK REF="STD-Hutchins-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchins 1985</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Hutchins-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchins 1985</LINK> also stated that epifoam is costly in comparison with lignocaine. According to one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Corkill-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Corkill 2001</LINK>), which formally measured maternal satisfaction, it was found that the women receiving topical anaesthesia were more satisfied than the women receiving placebo. This may be a reflection of reduced pain with the topical anaesthetic between 24 and 72 hours, but overall the evidence does not seem to be sufficient to demonstrate that topical anaesthetics are clearly better than placebo. Similarly, the limited data available on topical anaesthetics compared with alternative treatments did not show any evidence that topical anaesthetics were more beneficial.</P>
<P>Another important aspect to consider is the use of the different types of additional analgesia given in the different studies. This could have an effect on the presence and severity of the pain. <LINK REF="STD-Corkill-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Corkill 2001</LINK> showed no statistically significant difference between the oral analgesia (ie panadol and solpadeine) given and the two intervention groups. However, treatment gel was also part of the additional analgesia offered in <LINK REF="STD-Corkill-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Corkill 2001</LINK> and this was used more in the placebo group than the lignocaine gel group. <LINK REF="STD-Hutchins-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchins 1985</LINK> provided paracetamol if requested by the women while <LINK REF="STD-Minassian-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Minassian 2002</LINK> provided a range of pain medications including acetaminophen, acetaminophen/hydrocodone, acetaminophen/codeine, ibuprofen or a combination. <LINK REF="STD-Hanretty-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Hanretty 1984</LINK> gave a standard dose of 100 mg pethidine intramuscularly to all women postpartum. This may be a confounding factor as the pethidine may mask the real effect of the topical anaesthetic with the placebo women perhaps feeling less pain than if they had not received pethidine. <LINK REF="STD-Harrison-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 1987a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Harrison-1987b" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 1987b</LINK> did not mention the type of additional analgesia given but stated that it was available if requested. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Overall, the findings of this systematic review suggest that the evidence for the effectiveness of topically applied anaesthetics for the treating perineal pain is not compelling. There has been no evaluation regarding any long-term effects of topically applied anaesthetics. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The findings of this review suggest that further research is essential before topical anaesthetics are used in clinical practice for the treatment of perineal pain. Issues to be addressed in any future trials include assessing the effectiveness of the timing and the dosage of the anaesthetic agent to be used. Future research should consider the outcomes important to women experiencing perineal pain, including short-term and longer-term outcomes that may impact on daily functioning. Comparisons of different topical anaesthetics may be warranted.</P>

<CHAR_METHODS>
<P>Single centre, regional teaching hospital in northwest England.<BR/>Randomised by consecutively numbered sealed envelopes to 1 of 2 groups (2% lignocaine gel or placebo gel). The envelopes contained 1 of the 2 gels and the necessary documents. Randomisation was in blocks of 10 and a central register of allocation was held in the hospital pharmacy.</P>
<P>
<BR/>
</P>
</CHAR_METHODS>
<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>240 women were approached of whom 149 women were randomised, 75 in the experimental group and 74 in the control group. They included primiparous and multiparous women who had a normal delivery of a healthy baby and had sustained a first- or second-degree tear.</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>The experimental group received 2% lignocaine gel and the control group received placebo gel, which was an inert lubricating gel, Aquagel. Women were instructed to use the gel as required but not more often than 4 hourly.</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>The primary outcome was perineal pain 24 hours after birth as measured on a 101-point Numerical Rating Scale completed by participants. Secondary outcomes were perineal pain 48 hours after birth, the consumption of additional analgesia, maternal satisfaction, and any side-effects associated with the use of the lignocaine gel.</P>
</CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<CHAR_NOTES>
<P>Exclusion criteria included women who had suffered a postpartum haemorrhage, manual removal of placenta, inability to speak English, and significant medical or psychiatric disorders. Women with a known sensitivity to lignocaine, women receiving treatment for gastric or duodenal ulcers or hypertension, and those taking beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs were also excluded.<BR/>At 24 hours there were 4 losses to follow up in the treatment group and 8 in the placebo group.</P>

<INCLUDED_CHAR STUDY_ID="STD-Greer-1984">
<CHAR_METHODS>
<P>Single centre, Royal Maternity Hospital, Glasgow. Participants were stated to have been randomised but there was no mention of the process or concealment of treatment allocation. Similarly, the study stated that it was double-blind but no mention of who was blinded.</P>
</CHAR_METHODS>
<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>40 consecutive women who complained of episiotomy pain were included.</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>The treatment group received 1% pramoxine hydrochloride and 1% hydrocortisone acetate in a foam base while the control group received a simple aqueous foam. Participants applied 5 ml of the foam through an applicator to the wound site four times a day.</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>This study measured oedema, erythema, pain experienced, impairment of mobility and analgesic requirements. These were measured by the use of VAS scaled 1-4 where 4 equals the greatest severity. The outcomes was assessed by the same observer on the 1st, 3rd and 5th days after birth. The observer assessed the outcome by asking the participant.</P>

<CHAR_METHODS>
<P>Single centre, Glasgow. Participants were allocated to control or experimental groups immediately after delivery. No further information regarding randomisation and concealment of treatment allocation was given. The study stated that it was double-blind but no mention of who was blinded. All participants included in the trial were included in the analysis.</P>
</CHAR_METHODS>
<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>40 women between 18-30 years of age who had spontaneous vertex deliveries were included. The deliveries had been uncomplicated and participants were primigravida or secundigravida.</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>A standard dose of pethidine, 100 mg intramuscularly, was given to all participants in the immediate postpartum period. Participants were given an oral aspirin/meprobamate compound 4 times a day as analgesia. The placebo was an aqueous cream. The experimental group received a topical anaesthetic preparation of pramoxine hydrochloride/hydrocortisone in the form of a cream also. The cream was applied to the wound by the participants.</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>No direct mention of outcomes; however, the study suggests that pain 24, 48 and 72 hours after birth was of interest. 2 hours after administration of the cream the participants rated their pain level on a VAS where 0 = no pain and 10 = severe pain. This was repeated 4 times a day for 3 consecutive days.</P>
</CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<CHAR_NOTES>
<P>Exclusions included participants with any pre-existing medical or surgical disease which might have affected wound healing eg diabetes, previous third degree tear. <BR/>All the episiotomies were right medio-lateral in position and 3 cm - 5 cm in length. The participants were visited daily and the wounds assessed for oedema and any signs of infection.<BR/>

<CHAR_METHODS>
<P>Single centre, Ireland.<BR/>Participants were allocated at random using a consecutive treatment number series, to receive treatment with one or other of 2 local anaesthetic preparations or placebo. Although the nurse-observer was aware what medications the participants received, the contents of the plastic spray bottle were not known to the participants. Alcoholic and propellants administered from identical aerosol canisters identified only with a treatment number. <BR/>
</P>
</CHAR_METHODS>
<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>76 primiparous white women over 16 years of age, had given birth 24 to 72 hours previously, and were experiencing moderate to severe pain in association with episiotomy were included. Participants were ambulant and had not received analgesia or sedation during the preceding 11 hours.</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>The 2 anaesthetic preparations were lignocaine (5%) and cinchocaine (2%). The placebo group received distilled water. Medication was administered by the nurse-observer who sprayed the length of the episiotomy wound from a distance of approximately 25 cm for 1 to 2 seconds.</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>Each participant's pain levels were assessed before a single-dose administration of the spray and subsequently after 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 hours after administration of the trial medication. Assessments were that of pain intensity scores, pain relief scores and global assessments were made. Participants assessed these outcomes themselves.</P>

<CHAR_METHODS>
<P>Single centre, Leicester General Hospital. Participants were selected at random for treatment with 1 of the 2 agents. No further information was given about randomisation or concealment of treatment allocation. The study was stated as double-blind. They made mention of unlabelled agents being supplied to the participants to mask the participants from knowing. However, no further mention of the others blinded was made. 16 participants were excluded and these were not included in the final analysis.</P>
</CHAR_METHODS>
<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>180 women were studied (16 of whom were subsequently excluded as they left the hospital before the completion of the study). Only participants who had undergone normal vaginal birth without episiotomy extension by more than 1 cm were considered.</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>There were 3 arms to the study. The 1st arm received 1% hydrocortisone acetate and 1% pramoxine hydrochloride in a muco-adhesive foam base (epifoam). The 2nd arm received 1% lignocaine gel and the 3rd arm was the control group receiving a placebo preparation which was inert, aqueous cream. The agent was applied directly to the episiotomy site on a pad after completion of the repair. Participants were then provided with a supply of the unlabelled agent with instructions to apply it as necessary to relieve perineal discomfort until discharge from hospital, with a suggested minimum application of 4 times a day.</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>For the first 4 days after giving birth, perineal pain and amounts of relief gained by the application were recorded by the participants using a VAS (10 cm), representing the range from no pain to extremely severe pain. A single observer recorded the presence of oedema and bruising on each study day without being aware of the agent used, using a 4-point scale. Extra pain relief provided for the participant was recorded, as were episodes of stinging or local reaction to the agent.</P>
</CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<CHAR_NOTES>
<P>There was no mention of any exclusion criteria.<BR/>Of the 180 women included there 16 exclusions and 1 woman discontinued treatment. Of the 163 remaining there were data from only 147 women.</P>

<CHAR_METHODS>
<P>Single centre, University Medical Center hospital and Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center. Randomisation was performed using a random-number table, with bottles dispensed from the pharmacy. Each number had a corresponding label of lidocaine or placebo ointment. Participants and medical personnel, including the investigators, were masked to the contents of the jar.</P>
</CHAR_METHODS>
<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>200 women were randomised, with 108 receiving the intervention and 92 in the placebo group. The pregnant women were those who had given birth vaginally with either an episiotomy or a perineal laceration.</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>The intervention was a 20 g jar of 5% lidocaine ointment with routine care and pain medication as needed. The control group received a 20 g jar of placebo ointment and routine care and pain medication as needed.</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>The primary outcome measured was the amount of pain relief obtained from using the ointment during the first 2 postpartum days as well as the number of pain medication pills. Some observer weighed the jars and counted the pills. Also participants measured pain on a LRS and VRS.</P>
</CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<CHAR_NOTES>
<P>Exclusions include a history of adverse reactions to local anaesthetics or lidocaine, cardiac disease, class C diabetes or more on White classification and neurological disease affecting the lower extremities. For the VRS there were 16 losses to follow up in the lidocaine group and 17 in the placebo group. For ointment satisfaction there were 18 losses to follow up in the lidocaine group and 21 in the placebo group.</P>
