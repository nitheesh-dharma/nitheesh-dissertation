<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-11-11 18:53:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The onset of obsessive-compulsive disorder often occurs in childhood and adolescence. Paediatric OCD can be an extremely debilitating disorder, resulting in high levels of distress, impairment and disruption of psychosocial development. It also has a considerable impact on other family members. While there is evidence that medication can reduce symptoms, behavioural and cognitive-behavioural therapy (BT/CBT) are often proposed as acceptable alternative treatments. These therapies include assisting the child to better tolerate the anxiety-provoking situations and thoughts without the use of compulsive behaviour to manage their anxiety, psycho-educationabout anxiety and OCD; cognitive therapy in which the child is helped to learn to identify and challenge unhelpful ways of thinking; and parental support.</P>
<P>This review identified eight randomised controlled trials involving 343 participants, evaluating the benefits of behavioural and cognitive-behavioural therapy. The results show that, compared to a wait-list or pill placebo, BT/CBT is an effective treatment for reducing OCD symptoms and lowering the risk of having OCD after treatment. Based on three studies that directly compared BT/CBT with medication, there was no current evidence to suggest that either BT/CBT or medication was superior to the other. When combined with medication, BT/CBT produces better outcomes than medication alone. Although based on a small number of studies, these findings provide support for the value of BT/CBT in the treatment of children and adolescents with OCD.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-11-11 18:49:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in children and adolescents is characterised by persistent intrusive thoughts, experience of inappropriate impulses or images which cause marked anxiety, or by persistent repetitive behaviours such as hand washing, checking and ordering. Like OCD in adults, the symptomatic presentation in children and adolescents is heterogenous, with some experiencing both obsessions and compulsions, and others describing obsessions or compulsions only (<LINK REF="REF-Piacentini-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Piacentini 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Swedo-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swedo 1992</LINK>). Compulsions can be both overt, such as hand washing, and covert such as counting, repeating "magical" words or spelling words backwards. For some children the repetitive behaviours may not be experienced as anxiety-provoking. Estimates of the prevalence of OCD in childhood vary from 0.5% to 4% (<LINK REF="REF-Douglass-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Douglass 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Flament-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flament 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Rapoport-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rapoport 2000</LINK>), with clear clinical evidence that it is often associated with significant disruption and impairment in the child's family, social and academic life and that it can have adverse impacts on the child's psychosocial development (<LINK REF="REF-Piacentini-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Piacentini 2003</LINK>). In addition, children and adolescents who have OCD may have a heightened risk for clinically significant psychiatric and psychosocial problems as adults (<LINK REF="REF-Stewart-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 2004</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-11-06 03:02:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Behavioural or cognitive-behavioural therapy (BT/CBT) is recommended as the psychotherapeutic treatment of choice for children and adolescents with obsessive-compulsive disorder (<LINK REF="REF-AACAP-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">AACAP 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-March-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">March 1997</LINK>). A common and arguably essential component of BT/CBT for OCD involves exposure to the situational and internal triggers to the anxiety which motivates the compulsive behaviours, while at the same time preventing the compulsive activities. For example, children with compulsive washing would be required in a graded way to touch objects which they fear lead to contamination, and prevent the washing which neutralises their fear. This exposure with response prevention technique (ERP) is a core aspect of contemporary BT/CBT treatment. In addition to ERP, BT/CBT treatments vary in the emphasis they place on other components such as psycho education, cognitive training and parental involvement. Some earlier behaviour therapy approaches put little or no treatment time into these aspects compared to recent CBT approaches, which integrate cognitive and behavioural strategies. The reasons for the expert consensus recommendation in favour of BT/CBT for children and adolescents with OCD are the demonstrated efficacy of BT/CBT with ERP for OCD in adults (<LINK REF="REF-Kobak-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kobak 1998</LINK>), together with the belief that OCD in childhood is "virtually identical to the adult form" (<LINK REF="REF-Shafran-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shafran 1998</LINK>). In addition, ERP has a logically consistent and compelling rationale which presents a clear relationship between the obsessive and compulsive symptoms, their maintenance and the BT/CBT treatment.</P>
<P>There are a number of issues, however, which indicate that the downward extension of BT/CBT to paediatric forms of OCD may face unique problems. Firstly, a number of studies question the presumed development continuity between paediatric OCD and adult OCD. Geller and colleagues have described a bimodal age of onset for OCD, with one peak at about 10 years of age and another during adulthood (<LINK REF="REF-Geller-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geller 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Geller-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geller 2001</LINK>). While equally prevalent and similar in its clinical characteristics to adult OCD, the childhood onset disorder has a number of distinctive features that have implications for clinical management, including possible responsiveness to psychotherapeutic interventions. In particular, it is more predominant in boys and more strongly co-morbid with disruptive behavioural problems, developmental disorders including autistic disorder, depression and other anxiety disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Geller-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geller 1996</LINK>). Obsessive-compulsive disorder in children also co-occurs with tic disorders, and has been noted as a part of a paediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS, <LINK REF="REF-Murphy-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murphy 2002</LINK>). These co-morbidities may impact on the rationale for BT/CBT, in so far as they indicate differing mechanisms for symptom onset and maintenance, for example, the observation that children with tic related OCD have less well-developed cognitions triggering their compulsions (<LINK REF="REF-Geller-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geller 2003a</LINK>). Alternatively, co-morbidities may reduce the capacity of child and adolescent OCD patients to tolerate the discomfort involved in the exposure and response prevention component of BT/CBT.</P>
<P>A second issue of extending BT/CBT to paediatric forms of OCD concerns the more self-reflective cognitive techniques utilised with adults to enhance tolerance and adherence to ERP. Many of these techniques may be of limited value with younger children because they presume a level of meta-cognitive skill, for example an ability to reflect on thoughts and emotions, that may not be common until adolescence (<LINK REF="REF-Stegge-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stegge 2007</LINK>). Thirdly, BT/CBT for OCD in children generally requires support and therapeutic assistance from the family. Recent findings show that parents of children with OCD, aged 8 to 14 years, were less rewarding of the child's independence and less likely to promote positive problem solving than parents of children with other types of anxiety disorders, externalising problems or those with no problems. <LINK REF="REF-Barrett-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barrett 2002</LINK> suggested significant limitations to parents' capacity to support their child with OCD in undertaking self-directed ERP.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-11-04 16:59:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Several recent reviews and meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Abramowitz-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abramowitz 2005</LINK>,<LINK REF="REF-Barrett-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barrett 2008</LINK>,<LINK REF="REF-Freeman-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freeman 2007</LINK>,<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Kearney-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Kearney 2007</LINK>,<LINK REF="REF-Turner-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 2006</LINK>,<LINK REF="REF-Watson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watson 2008</LINK>) generally support the expert recommendation about the efficacy of CBT for paediatric OCD. There are, however, limitations to the quality of some of these reviews that obscure the degree and nature of the benefits associated with CBT and it relative efficacy compared to medication. Some( <LINK REF="REF-Abramowitz-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abramowitz 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Freeman-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freeman 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Kearney-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Kearney 2007</LINK>) include both controlled and uncontrolled designs or do not report on risk of bias of the included studies. Others (<LINK REF="REF-Barrett-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barrett 2008</LINK>,<LINK REF="REF-de-Haan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Haan 2005</LINK>,<LINK REF="REF-Turner-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 2006</LINK>,<LINK REF="REF-Watson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watson 2008</LINK>) compare CBT with medication by contrasting pooled effect sizes between independent CBT and medication studies. This type of contrast is problematic because of design differences between CBT and medication studies particularly the lack of a placebo control in the CBT trials and because, unlike meta-analyses of pharmacological treatment, most reported pooled effects sizes for CBTinclude pre-post estimations.</P>
<P>In contrast, accumulative evidence for the efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as fluoxetine and sertraline, appears reliable (<LINK REF="REF-Compton-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Compton 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Geller-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geller 2003b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kobak-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kobak 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Liebowitz-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liebowitz 2002</LINK>). Furthermore, there is a common belief amongst practitioners that combined medication and BT/CBT is the most beneficial approach (<LINK REF="REF-Harvard-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harvard 2002</LINK>). Nevertheless, there may be an understandable reluctance by clinicians to prescribe psychotropic medication to children and adolescents. This is in light of the recent concerns about increased suicidal attempts in depressed children and adolescents treated with SSRIs and the preference of patients and families for non-drug treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Bridge-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bridge 2007</LINK>). When available, BT/CBT is often recommended as the first-line treatment.</P>
<P>Consideration concerning study design, risk of bias and study comparability are particularly important from a clinical perspective when examining the relative benefits of BT/CBT. The aim of the current review is to update the previous Cochrane systematic review of BT/CBT for paediatric OCD (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Kearney-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Kearney 2006</LINK>) to assist clinicians in prioritising treatment options for their patients. Although CBT interventions are often multi-component treatments they share common psychotherapeutic principles and underlying science, as well as practices. At the present time the inclusive "CBT" is the more frequently used term, but a failure to consider studies that identify as behaviour therapy may unnecessarily exclude important evidence. This review first considers trials of BT/CBT for OCD in children and adolescents as a group and additionally examines the available evidence for the specific benefits of ERP and cognitive training.</P>

<P>The key component of BT/CBT for OCD was exposure to the situational and internal triggers of the anxiety which motivated the compulsive behaviours, while at the same time preventing the compulsive activities. In addition to exposure with response prevention, CBT approaches include a number of cognitive therapy strategies such as thought monitoring, thought challenging and cognitive restructuring incorporated as cognitive training. Before ERP became prominent other behavioural techniques were used, including contingency management, systematic desensitisation and thought stopping. Studies were included if they used any of these techniques either alone or in combination. Studies were to be differentiated on the basis of use/non-use of ERP and the use/non-use of cognitive training. None of the included studies at this time, however, allowed for these comparisons.</P>
<P>Trials were included regardless of "treatment" status of comparison, and the non BT/CBT comparison included active drug, pill placebo, attention placebo or wait-list. Because we anticipated only a small number of studies which included a BT/CBT only arm and a non-active comparison the review addressed the efficacy of BT/CBT relative to any non-active comparison.</P>

<P>Both the original (2006) and the current version of this review (Issue 1, 2010) rely upon methodological criteria specified in the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2004</LINK>), which pays particular attention to the quality of the randomisation procedure and allocation concealment, to assess risk of bias in the studies. In addition, risk of bias was assessed using the CCDAN Quality Rating Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Moncrieff-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moncrieff 2001</LINK>). This includes items on sample size, method of diagnosis, evaluation of treatment fidelity and attrition. Two reviewers (RO'K and KA; RO'K and AH) independently assessed each study, with disagreements resolved through discussion. Descriptions of key sources of bias were provided in the text.</P>

<P>The primary outcome comprised of post treatment scores on clinical outcome measures. Where the same measurement scale had been used across studies for continuous outcomes, the weighted mean difference (WMD) was used to pool differences in scores at post-treatment or change in scores pre to post where applicable. If different scales were used to measure the same outcomes and pooling was appropriate, standardised mean differences (SMD) were used. For continuing OCD at post treatment relative risks (RR) together with the 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated at post-treatment. Intention-to-treat analysis, using last observation carried forward (LOCF), was performed where applicable in most studies.</P>

<P>After reviewing the titles, abstracts and full texts where necessary, of the 1681 relevant titles initially identified by our search, 42 studies where located which provided data on BT/CBT for OCD in children and adolescents. Reasons for further discarding studies at this point included: lack of a BT/CBT intervention or control group; case study or case series; the study investigated factors affecting prognosis or treatment response rather than BT/CBT efficacy; participants were older than 18 years; participants had mixed anxiety disorder diagnoses;data for BT/CBT participants or OCD participants not reported separately; the study was not a treatment trial or was a review only. Of the identified studies, 17 were considered to be eligible for inclusion in the review. Two of these (<LINK REF="REF-Freeman-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freeman 2009</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Franklin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Franklin 2003</LINK>) were descriptions on the design and methods of a study reported elsewhere (<LINK REF="STD-POTS-2004" TYPE="STUDY">POTS 2004</LINK>) and of an ongoing study (<LINK REF="STD-POTS-II-ongoing" TYPE="STUDY">POTS II ongoing</LINK>).

<P>Data at pre-treatment and post-treatment were reported in the studies for all the randomised groups.

Change scores were supplied in <LINK REF="STD-Freeman--2008" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 2008</LINK> for the main outcome or could be estimated from the presented data for <LINK REF="STD-de-Haan-1998" TYPE="STUDY">de Haan 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Neziroglu-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Neziroglu 2000</LINK>. <LINK REF="REF-Asbahr-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Asbahr 2009</LINK> recently provided clarifying data for the <LINK REF="STD-Asbahr-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Asbahr 2005</LINK> study with means and standard deviations for the main outcomes at nine monthly post treatment follow-ups. We calculated the mean pre treatment score for the group from the data provided by <LINK REF="REF-Asbahr-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Asbahr 2009</LINK> and for any individual with a missing value at post treatment we substituted the pre-treatment mean for the group in order to compare the intention-to-treat outcomes for the BT/CBT and setraline groups at one month post treatment. <LINK REF="STD-Neziroglu-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Neziroglu 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Asbahr-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Asbahr 2005</LINK> reported follow-up data for both groups but none of the other studies provide follow-up data beyond post-treatment for the control group.</P>

Four of these were against a wait-list group (<LINK REF="STD-Barrett-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barrett 2004</LINK>(2), <LINK REF="STD-Bolton-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bolton 2008</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Williams-ND" TYPE="STUDY">Williams ND</LINK>); one against a pill placebo group (<LINK REF="STD-POTS-2004" TYPE="STUDY">POTS 2004</LINK>), and one against a psychological placebo (family relaxation training) (<LINK REF="STD-Freeman--2008" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 2008</LINK>).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-11-11 18:53:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Overall, the main findings of this updated review (2010) remain consistent with the earlier version <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Kearney-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Kearney 2006</LINK> ; that is, that the evidence reviewed continues to support BT/CBT as a potentially effective treatment option for paediatric OCD. We found no evidence that BT/CBT and medication alone differ in their benefits in reducing the severity of OCD symptoms or in preventing participants from continuing with OCD at post-treatment. Data from two studies indicate that combining BT/CBT with medication produces better outcomes than medication alone. Despite the addition of four new studies to this update, the size and quality of included studies together with the variability in study protocols mean that the absolute and relative strength of the benefits associated with BT/CBT remain open to question.</P>
<P>Our review now identified eight RCTs (twelve comparisons) with 343 participants. Four of those comparisons tested the efficicacy of BT/CBT relative to non treated controls (<LINK REF="STD-Barrett-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barrett 2004</LINK> (2 comparisons),<LINK REF="STD-Bolton-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bolton 2008,</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Williams-ND" TYPE="STUDY">Williams ND</LINK>) and two against a placebo control (<LINK REF="STD-Freeman--2008" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 2008</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-POTS-2004" TYPE="STUDY">POTS 2004</LINK>). Their results suggest that BT/CBT reduces severity of OCD by about 11 points on the CY-BOCS when compared to a wait-list control and by about 5 points on the CY-BOCS when compared to groups receiving a pill or psychological placebo. Three comparisions (<LINK REF="STD-Barrett-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barrett 2004</LINK> (2); <LINK REF="STD-POTS-2004" TYPE="STUDY">POTS 2004</LINK>) reported that BT/CBT reduced the risk of children and young people continuing to have OCD at post-treatment relative to the control group whilst two other studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bolton-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bolton 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Freeman--2008" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 2008</LINK>) found no evidence that the proportion of participants with OCD at post treatment differed between BT/CBT and the control. It is noteworthy that the one study using a psychological placebo control (family-based relaxation; <LINK REF="STD-Freeman--2008" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 2008</LINK>) did not find an advantage for BT/CBT in post treatment symptom severity, continuing to have OCD at post treatment, or in change in symptom severity or global impression of improvement using intention-to-treat data. The authors (<LINK REF="STD-Freeman--2008" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 2008</LINK>) note, however, that participants who completed the CBT treatment showed greater improvement at post treatment than those who completed the family relaxation treatment.</P>
<P>The review also provides some additional data relevant to clinical questions concerning the choice between BT/CBT and medication alone for paediatric OCD. While there are many considerations for clinicians in advising their patients about this choice, one of these considerations is evidence about their relative efficacy. Inconclusive evidence about this now comes from three RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Asbahr-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Asbahr 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-de-Haan-1998" TYPE="STUDY">de Haan 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-POTS-2004" TYPE="STUDY">POTS 2004</LINK>). Separately the effect sizes from the three studies do not provide evidence of a difference between the two treatments in terms of symptom severity on the CY-BOCS and risk of continuing with OCD; nor does combining data from the two comparable studies indicate a difference between the two treatments. Whilst the trials do show trends in favour of BT/CBT, they are few and sample sizes are small. Clearly any decision to begin treatment for paediatric OCD with medication alone before a trial of BT/CBT would depend on a number of important issues such as patient preference, the availability of skilled CBT practitioners, cost to patients and the patient's treatment history. The impact of co-morbidities and the severity of the OCD will also be important factors although there is still little evidence from RCTs currently available on how to include these factors in decision making.</P>
<P>The evidence from this review continues to provide cautious support for the claimed advantage of BT/CBT combined with medication both when compared to a placebo <LINK REF="STD-POTS-2004" TYPE="STUDY">POTS 2004</LINK> and medication alone <LINK REF="STD-Neziroglu-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Neziroglu 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-POTS-2004" TYPE="STUDY">POTS 2004</LINK>. However, the utility of the advice relative to BT/CBT alone is less compelling. While favouring combined treatment over BT/CBT alone, the confidence interval around this estimate from one RCT (<LINK REF="STD-POTS-2004" TYPE="STUDY">POTS 2004</LINK>) does not exclude the possibility of the more benefits of BT/CBT alone over the combined treatment. Despite these findings from the high quality <LINK REF="STD-POTS-2004" TYPE="STUDY">POTS 2004</LINK> study the relative benefits of combining CBT with medication need to demonstrated in additional studies.</P>
<P>The BT/CBT interventions reviewed here are similar, with five of the eight studies using treatments derived from a standard protocol for the BT/CBT treatment of OCD in children and adolescents. While the protocol and manuals are readily available (<LINK REF="REF-March-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">March 1998</LINK>), training and supervision in its delivery are less accessible. ERP was a part of all the BT/CBT interventions reviewed, but there was no evidence regarding the relative benefits of the various BT/CBT treatment components. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bolton-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bolton 2008</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Neziroglu-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Neziroglu 2000</LINK>) used ERP only with no cognitive components or family involvement. The intensity of BT/CBT treatment varied between 8.8 to 30 hours, but the 14 hours of therapy found to be effective in th ehighest quality study <LINK REF="STD-POTS-2004" TYPE="STUDY">POTS 2004</LINK> represents a feasible and reasonable outlay of personnel time in most public and private clinical settings. The inclusion of parents in the treatment may also be an important consideration in the application of the findings for some patients and settings.</P>
<P>All the participants were diagnosed with OCD using standard clinical assessment practices, either a clinical or semi-structured clinical interview. In assessing the relevance of the results the exclusion of participants with some common co-morbidities (particularly major depressive disorder and Tourette's syndrome) needed to be considered. <LINK REF="STD-POTS-2004" TYPE="STUDY">POTS 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Freeman--2008" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 2008</LINK> included children who had comorbid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) who were stabilised on medication. These co-morbidities may affect compliance and/or responsiveness to ERP in adults and similar difficulties may have been evident for children and adolescents. Only <LINK REF="STD-Neziroglu-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Neziroglu 2000</LINK> considered difficult to treat participants with OCD, while <LINK REF="STD-Asbahr-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Asbahr 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-POTS-2004" TYPE="STUDY">POTS 2004</LINK> excluded participants who had any earlier treatment or treatment failures.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>None of the studies report adverse events. Nevertheless, there are possible adverse outcomes of BT/CBT such as the immediate impact on relationships within the family which need to be considered when advising on treatment choices. One of the suggested disadvantages of BT/CBT is a high rate of treatment refusal and drop-out. However, the refusal rates (8.1% - 14.8%) and drop-out rates (8.3% - 10.7%) from two studies (<LINK REF="STD-de-Haan-1998" TYPE="STUDY">de Haan 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-POTS-2004" TYPE="STUDY">POTS 2004</LINK>) suggest that BT/CBT may have been an acceptable approach to the participants in these studies.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-10-29 02:11:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The evidence from this systematic review supports behaviour therapy/cognitive-behaviour therapy as an effective treatment for OCD in children and adolescents. Findings from the review suggest that BT/CBT alone reduces the severity of OCD sysptoms and that it is at least as effective as medication alone. There is some, albeit, limited evidence that BT/CBT, when combined with medication, may result in greater reduction in OCD symptoms relative to what can be achieved with medication alone. The evidence from this review shows that when available BT/CBT allows clinicians to effect improvement for patients when psychological treatment is the preferred treatment. In addition, adding BT/CBT may provide clinicians with the opportunity to improve treatment outcomes for patients who will accept a trial of medication when appropriate. There is still insufficient evidence to be able to specify the preferred sequence of treatments for paediatric OCD.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-11-11 18:53:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our review suggests that the priority for research in BT/CBT for paediatric OCD would be a well conducted replication of the comparisons in the high quality <LINK REF="STD-POTS-2004" TYPE="STUDY">POTS 2004</LINK> study. This would strengthen the claims regarding the usefulness of BT/CBT and increase the precision of the estimates of the magnitude of its benefits. In addition, a replication would help clarify questions about the relative efficacy of BT/CBT against medication and when combined with medication. There are a number of ongoing studies addressing these questions. Further research evaluating relative efficacy, cost-effectiveness and suitability to various patients groups is warranted. The age range of participants in most studies to date is developmentally wide although the CBT treatment protocols are similar. It would be valuable for future work to evaluate the role of age of onset, and age of treatment in predicting treatment response in BT/CBT. Future research should also extend the range of outcomes to include sound patient measures of the impact of the OCD on the child's or youth's life functioning in their family, interpersonal relationships, school, and work roles and should also pay more attention to possible adverse outcomes. An equally important area of research arising from the results would be an examination of how well BT/CBT could be disseminated and implemented in non-specialist centres or non-academic settings, as often the main limitation to offering BT/CBT is availability of skilled therapists.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Implications for policy</HEADING>
<P>There are clear implications for health service managers and policy makers. Service planning for the treatment of paediatric OCD should consider the development of workforce skills to make BT/CBT more readily available as a treatment option. It would be disappointing to consumers and health service managers if a treatment which can optimise outcomes for patients preferring psychological treatment or medication, and which has a well documented and standardised protocol, was not accessible for suitable patients.</P>

<P>This double-blind study will be divided into two phases. Phase 1 will involve the development and evaluation of a new behavioral test to measure antidepressant side effects. Participants will attend a 2-hour screening interview during which they will be asked to describe any side effects experienced from antidepressant medications and to rate how problematic these side effects are for them. Participants will be contacted by phone 1 week later to answer questions repeated from the interview. Participation in Phase 1 will last about 10 days.</P>
<P>Phase 2 will comprise the medication/CBT treatment portion of the study. Potential participants will undergo an initial screening visit that will include an interview on psychological symptoms associated with OCD and possible family history of OCD. Eligible participants will then undergo a physical exam, blood draw, DNA sampling, and pregnancy test if applicable. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either sertraline or placebo daily for 18 weeks. At weekly study visits, participants will receive their study drug, complete questionnaires about symptoms of OCD, and undergo vital sign measurements. At specified visits, participants will also perform a task (Stop Signal Task) on a computerized assessment device to measure attention and impulse control and may have blood drawn. For the first 4 weeks of Phase 2, participants will wear a wristwatch-like device (Actigraph) to monitor sleep patterns. During the first three visits, participants will receive supportive psychotherapy. At Visit 4, participants will begin receiving 60-minute CBT sessions, which will continue until the final visit. The final visit will include a second physical exam, questionnaires, and blood testing.</P>

<P>Participants with OCD will be randomly assigned to either receive a 12-week CBT intervention or be placed on a waiting list for 8 weeks before receiving the 12-week intervention. A group of non-OCD participants in the same age group will be used as a control. All groups will undergo magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI), which will measure the concentrations of neurometabolites in multiple brain regions. The control group and the group initially given the CBT intervention will be scanned upon entry of the study and after 12 weeks. The group initially placed on a waiting list will be scanned three times: once upon entry, once after the 8-week waiting period, and once after the 12-week CBT intervention. To determine which participants are benefiting from the treatment, the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale and other clinical and neurocognitive measures will be administered concurrently with each brain scan.</P>
