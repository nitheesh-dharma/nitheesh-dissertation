<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-09-22 12:46:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>A pulmonary embolism is a potentially fatal blood clot that lodges in the main artery of the lungs, straining the right side of the heart and affecting blood circulation. Patients are also at risk of new embolisms forming (recurrence). In the case of a massive pulmonary embolism, treatment to restore blood flow is urgently required. Heparin thins the blood, but newer drugs that actively break up the clots (thrombolytics) may act more quickly and be more effective. These newer drugs include streptokinase, urokinase and recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator. The major complication of this treatment is bleeding.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>The review authors searched the literature and included 18 studies in this update (evidence current to September 2014). The trials involved 2197 adult participants with pulmonary embolism, who were randomly assigned to a thrombolytic agent followed by heparin versus heparin alone or heparin plus placebo or surgical procedure. We were able to combine data from 17 clinical trials with a total of 2167 patients. Thrombolytics seemed to lower the likelihood of death or recurrence of blood clots over heparin. However, after excluding four very low quality studies, this benefit disappeared. On the other hand, thrombolytics caused more side effects, including major and minor bleeding events (haemorrhagic events) and stroke, than heparin alone. Limited information from five trials showed that thrombolytics were better at improving blood flow through the lungs; seven included studies showed they can improve heart function.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence is low because of several important design limitations, the potential influence of pharmaceutical companies and small sample sizes. We need more large, rigorous trials to understand if thrombolytic therapy is truly beneficial for pulmonary embolism.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-09-22 11:00:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Thrombolytic therapy (powerful anticoagulation drugs) is usually reserved for patients with clinically serious or massive pulmonary embolism (PE). Evidence suggests that thrombolytic agents may dissolve blood clots more rapidly than heparin and reduce the death rate associated with PE. However, there are still concerns about the possible risk of adverse effects of thrombolytic therapy, such as major or minor haemorrhages. This is the second update of the Cochrane review first published in 2006.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-09-22 12:46:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified 18 trials with a total of 2197 participants for inclusion in the review. We were not able to include one study in the meta-analysis because it had no data to extract. Most of the studies carried a high risk of bias because of high or unclear risk relating to randomisation and blinding. Meta-analysis showed that, compared with heparin alone, or heparin plus placebo, thrombolytics plus heparin can reduce the odds of death (odds ratio (OR) 0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.37 to 0.87, P = 0.02, low quality evidence) and recurrence of PE (OR 0.51; 95% CI 0.29 to 0.89, P = 0.02, low quality evidence). The effects of death weakened when we excluded four studies at high risk of bias from analysis: OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.06, P = 0.08. The incidence of major and minor haemorrhagic events was higher in the thrombolytics group than in the control group, and this difference was statistically significant (OR 2.90, 95% CI 1.95 to 4.31, P &lt; 0.001, low quality evidence; OR 3.09, 95% CI 1.58 to 6.06, P = 0.001, very low quality evidence, respectively). Length of hospital stay (mean difference (MD) -1.35, 95% CI -4.27 to 1.58) and quality of life were similar between the two treatment groups. Stroke was reported in one study and occurred more often in the thrombolytics group than in the control group, although the confidence interval was wide (OR 12.10, 95% CI 1.57 to 93.39). Limited information from a small number of trials indicated that thrombolytics may improve haemodynamic outcomes, perfusion lung scanning, pulmonary angiogram assessment, echocardiograms, pulmonary hypertension, coagulation parameters, clinical outcomes and survival time to a greater extent than heparin alone. However, the heterogeneity of the studies and small number of participants involved warrant caution when interpreting results. Similarily, fewer patients from the thrombolytics group required escalation of treatment. None of the included studies reported on post-thrombotic syndrome or compared the cost of the different treatments.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-09-22 11:02:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is low quality evidence that thrombolytics reduce death following acute pulmonary embolism compared with heparin. Furthermore, thrombolytic therapies included in the review were heterogeneous. Thrombolytic therapy may be helpful in reducing the recurrence of pulmonary emboli but may cause more major and minor haemorrhagic events and stroke. More high quality double blind RCTs assessing safety and cost-effectiveness are required.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-09-22 11:07:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A pulmonary embolism (PE), or blood clot in the artery of the lungs, is a life-threatening condition that is accompanied by significant morbidity and mortality. Massive and submassive PE are subtypes of PE, which are often encountered in the literature, even though the definitions of these subtypes are vague and lead to ambiguity (<LINK REF="REF-Goldhaber-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldhaber 2002</LINK>). The American Heart Association defines massive PE as acute PE with haemodynamically unstable manifestations such as sustained hypotension (systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg for at least 15 min or requiring inotropic support, not due to a cause other than PE, such as arrhythmia, hypovolaemia, sepsis, or left ventricular dysfunction), lack of pulse, or persistent profound bradycardia (heart rate &lt; 40 beats per minute (bpm) with signs or symptoms of shock) (<LINK REF="REF-Jaff-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jaff 2011</LINK>). The same body defines submassive PE as haemodynamically stable (without systemic hypotension (systolic blood pressure &gt; 90 mmHg)) patients who present with either right ventricular dysfunction or myocardial necrosis (<LINK REF="REF-Jaff-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jaff 2011</LINK>). In massive PE, where restoration of the pulmonary arterial flow is urgently required due to right ventricular failure, prompt therapeutic intervention is imperative.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-09-22 12:49:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although the thrombotic origin of PE has been well documented for almost two centuries, anticoagulation (anti-clotting drugs) as a treatment for venous thromboembolism (VTE) dates back less than a century, and thrombolysis was initiated only relatively recently. In 1962, Browse and James reported that streptokinase could lyse (break up) pulmonary emboli in dogs and humans. Four patients treated with different dosage regimens experienced striking clinical improvement (<LINK REF="REF-Browse-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Browse 1962</LINK>). Further studies showed that patients who had hypotension (low blood pressure) responded quickly to streptokinase therapy, and their lung scans returned almost completely to normal (<LINK REF="REF-Bottiger-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bottiger 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Browse-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Browse 1962</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chesterman-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chesterman 1969</LINK>). However, improvement was less marked in those with associated cardiopulmonary disease and recurrent emboli (<LINK REF="REF-Hirsh-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirsh 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meneveau-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meneveau 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The findings of four clinical studies of urokinase for PE indicated that improvement with urokinase was more dramatic than with heparin alone (<LINK REF="REF-Genton-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Genton 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sasahara-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sasahara 1967</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sautter-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sautter 1967</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tow-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tow 1967</LINK>). Based on this promising experience, the National Heart and Lung Institute organised a multi-institutional randomised controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate thrombolytic agents in the treatment of PE. The results of Phase I (The Urokinase Pulmonary Embolism Trial, UPET) showed that a 12 h infusion of urokinase followed by heparin and oral anticoagulants, compared to heparin and oral anticoagulants alone, increased the resolution rate of pulmonary thromboemboli (<LINK REF="REF-Hyers-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hyers 1970</LINK>). Phase II (The Urokinase-Streptokinase Pulmonary Embolism Trial, USPET), completed in 1973, showed comparable results for two additional thrombolytic regimens&#8212;24 h of streptokinase and 24 h of urokinase. Increasing the duration of urokinase administration to 24 h conferred little benefit, and the distinction between 24 h of urokinase and streptokinase was less clear (<LINK REF="STD-UPET-Study-Group-1974" TYPE="STUDY">UPET Study Group 1974</LINK>). These trials did not document actual improvement in survival; however, patients with massive embolism did see a major physiological benefit. Therefore, thrombolytic agents may be potentially useful in severely ill patients with massive embolism or submassive embolism, especially when accompanied by shock.</P>
<P>In the late 1980s, recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) was introduced in the treatment of acute PE, with an RCT indicating its faster action and greater safety in comparison with urokinase (<LINK REF="REF-Goldhaber-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldhaber 1988</LINK>). A multicentre study showed that rt-PA decreased mean pulmonary arterial pressure (<LINK REF="STD-Meyer-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 1992</LINK>). The effect of intravenous rt-PA on arterial blood gases and right ventricular function was compared with the effect of heparin treatment in acute PE. Results showed that rt-PA is more effective for acute PE than heparin alone, and that a high dose of rt-PA leads to rapid improvement in arterial blood gases and lung perfusion images with no clinical episodes of recurrent PE (<LINK REF="STD-Goldhaber-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Goldhaber 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yamasawa-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yamasawa 1992</LINK>). The collaborative PIOPED study suggested that rt-PA given over 2 h has little effect on angiographic clot burden but may produce some improvement in haemodynamics. However, this treatment is not without risk (<LINK REF="STD-PIOPED-1990" TYPE="STUDY">PIOPED 1990</LINK>). One study has shown that angiographic improvement seems to be rapid and clinically important (50% on average), but the decrease of fibrinogen is also important and comparable with streptokinase (<LINK REF="REF-Vander-Sande-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vander Sande 1988</LINK>). Until now, the effectiveness of thrombolytic therapy in PE is still under discussion (<LINK REF="REF-Condliffe-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Condliffe 2014</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-09-22 11:10:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although there is good evidence that thrombolytic agents are superior to heparin alone in accelerating the lysis of pulmonary emboli, restoring normal pulmonary circulation and decreasing strain on the right side of the heart, few data are available on their long-term benefits for PE. A review summarising 14 anecdotal reports and three case series involving 34 patients revealed an overall initial survival rate of 55% to 100% following bolus administration of thrombolytic agents (<LINK REF="REF-Bottiger-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bottiger 1994</LINK>). Studies of long-term benefit of thrombolytic therapy in patients with PE suggest that thrombolytic therapy preserves the normal haemodynamic response to exercise and maintains cardiac output during long-term follow-up, possibly preventing recurrences of VTE and the development of pulmonary hypertension (<LINK REF="STD-Sharma-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sharma 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although it is difficult to prove that thrombolytic agents decrease mortality from pulmonary emboli, one large registry showed that thrombolytic treatment was associated with a 50% reduction of death risk in clinically stable patients with right ventricular enlargement (<LINK REF="REF-Konstantinides-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Konstantinides 1999</LINK>), and another prospective RCT showed that thrombolytic therapy reduced the mortality rate of massive acute PE (<LINK REF="STD-Jerjes_x002d_S_x00e1_nchez-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Jerjes-Sánchez 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Different thrombolytic agents&#8212;rt-PA, alteplase, streptokinase and urokinase&#8212;are almost equally efficacious at dissolving clots. However, these agents are not without risk, sometimes leading to frequent massive bleeding, including intracranial haemorrhage (<LINK REF="REF-Chatterjee-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chatterjee 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dalla_x002d_Volta-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Dalla-Volta 1992</LINK>). Other studies have shown that bleeding and fever increased in the streptokinase-treated patients, but both were generally controllable, with most bleeding occurring at the puncture site (<LINK REF="STD-Goldhaber-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Goldhaber 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sasahara-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sasahara 1973</LINK>). Several recent meta-analyses conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of thrombolytic therapy in the treatment of PE found no statistically significant differences in mortality or in the risk of PE relapse between the group of patients receiving thrombolytic agents and the group not receiving them (<LINK REF="REF-Cao-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cao 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Liu-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marti-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marti 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nakamura-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nakamura 2014</LINK>). However, there were significant differences between these two groups with regard to the risk of bleeding events (<LINK REF="REF-Chatterjee-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chatterjee 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although most studies agree that thrombolytic agents are superior to heparin alone in accelerating the lysis of pulmonary thromboemboli, the benefits in terms of reduced death rate from PE and influence on survival remain unclear. This review will attempt to ascertain the efficacy of thrombolytic agents in the treatment of PE. This is the second update of a review first published in 2006.</P>

<P>We recorded data regarding the methodological criteria employed by investigators in all included studies. A narrative summary is presented in the 'Risk of bias' tables (and discussed in the text where relevant) within the review. Two review authors (QH and JY) independently assessed trials for risk of bias with regard to adequate sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding of participants, personnel and outcomes assessors; attrition bias (i.e. whether all the participants were accounted for in the analysis (intention-to-treat, or ITT)); selective reporting and other types of bias. We graded each domain as 'low risk of bias', 'high risk of bias' or 'unclear risk of bias' according to the guidelines of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> 5.1.0 (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).<I>.</I>
</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Sequence generation</HEADING>
<P>Examples of randomisation methods falling into each risk of bias category for the generation of allocation sequence include the following.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk of bias: Adequate generation of allocation sequence encompasses randomisation methods such as computer-generated numbers, a table of random numbers, shuffling cards or envelopes, tossing a coin or dice, drawing of lots.</LI>
<LI>High risk of bias: Inadequate generation of allocation sequence refers to group allocations by case record number; date of birth; day, month, or year of admission; judgement of the clinician or the participant; laboratory test or a series of tests; availability of the intervention.</LI>
<LI>Unclear risk of bias: The paper reported the generation of allocation sequence unclearly.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Allocation concealment</HEADING>
<P>Examples of methods for allocation concealment that fall into each category include the following.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk of bias: Adequate allocation concealment was achieved through central randomisation (including telephone, web-based and pharmacy-controlled randomisation; sealed opaque containers administered serially to participants).</LI>
<LI>High risk of bias: Inadequate allocation concealment occurred by means of any procedure that was transparent before allocation.</LI>
<LI>Unclear risk of bias: Trials provided insufficient information to make a judgement on risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Blinding</HEADING>
<P>Double-blinding methods prescribe masking the clinician (person delivering treatment), the participant and the outcomes assessor to treatment allocation. We determined risk of bias in line with the following examples.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk of bias: We considered masking of both the participants and results assessor as carrying a low risk of performance and detection bias. We did not consider blinding necessary for mortality or other outcomes not influenced by blinding.</LI>
<LI>High risk of bias: Non-blinded assessment outcomes such as quality of life (QoL) carries a high risk of bias; for objective outcomes (e.g. death), we did not consider it necessary.</LI>
<LI>Unclear risk of bias: Studies did not provide sufficient information to judge 'yes' or 'no'. We considered single blinding of the results assessor to carry a moderate risk of performance bias, detection bias or both. If single blinding was performed on the participants but not the results assessor, we considered the outcomes to carry a high risk of detection bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Incomplete outcome data</HEADING>
<P>Incomplete outcome data refers to a mismatch between the number of randomised participants and those included in the main analysis. Examples for the three risk categories include the following.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk of bias: Trials are not missing outcome data or note few exclusions and attrition; an ITT analysis is possible.</LI>
<LI>High risk of bias: The rate of exclusion, attrition or both is higher than 15%, or there are wide differences in exclusions between intervention group and control group, whichever ITT analysis is used.</LI>
<LI>Unclear risk of bias or moderate risk of bias: Trials report the rate of exclusions or attrition (or both) as higher than 10%, whichever ITT analysis is used.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Selective reporting</HEADING>
<P>If the protocol of the included study was available, we compared the outcomes in the protocol and published report. If the protocol was not available, outcomes listed in the Methods section of the study were compared with those in the Results.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Other bias</HEADING>
<P>We assessed potential factors affecting precision of an estimate of included studies.</P>
<UL>
<LI>All quality criteria met - low risk of bias.</LI>
<LI>One or more of the quality criteria partly met - unclear risk of bias.</LI>
<LI>One or more criteria not met - high risk of bias.</LI>

Pooling this data with the data from alteplase or streptokinase plus enoxaparin versus enoxaparin alone (<LINK REF="STD-Taherkhani-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Taherkhani 2014</LINK>), the result still had statistical significance (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.64, P = 0.001; <LINK REF="CMP-010.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 10.1</LINK>).This indicates that fewer participants required rescue thrombolysis in the thrombolytic plus heparin group than in heparin alone group.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcomes analysed</HEADING>
<P>Overall, results for included outcomes were unsatisfactory and susceptible to bias due to the fact that most outcomes in the subgroups were extracted from only one or two studies. Most studies had small sample sizes, and some had low methodological quality. After assessment of all the included studies in this update, we only found three studies with four or more bias domains assessed as having a low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Fasullo-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Fasullo 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-UPETSG-1970" TYPE="STUDY">UPETSG 1970</LINK>). However, <LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2014</LINK> received funds from several companies, which may cause conflicts of interest. In addition, some trials did not assess the most important outcomes defined in this review or evaluate the potential complications of thrombolytic therapy.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Clinical interpretation of the data</HEADING>
<P>Thrombolytic agents showed benefit in terms of death compared with heparin (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.87, P = 0.01) and reduced the odds ratio of recurrence of PE (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.89, P = 0.02). However, after excluding four high risk of bias studies, we found the risk of death was no longer significantly different (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.06, P = 0.08). There were more major and minor haemorrhagic events in the thrombolytics group than in the control group, and these differences were statistically significant (OR 2.90, 95% CI 1.95 to 4.31, P &lt; 0.001; OR 3.03, 95% CI 1.60 to 5.73, P &lt; 0.001, for major and minor haemorrhagic events, respectively) even after excluding the trials at high risk of bias for these outcomes. One study reported on stroke, which occurred more often in the thrombolytics group than in the control group (OR 12.10, 95% CI 1.57 to 93.39). The total number of deaths was 83, and the total number of major haemorrhagic events was 56 in 2116 participants over all studies. From the confidence intervals, we can see there is a relatively precise estimate of treatment effect for recurrence of PE and major and minor haemorrhagic events. However, the significance of the treatment effect for mortality was lost after excluding studies at high risk of bias for the sensitivity analysis, even though there were only slight alterations in the confidence intervals. Thus, there is a need for further studies in order to draw conclusions.</P>
<P>Many of the results for the secondary outcome measures of this review are based on only one or two studies. In addition, there were different follow-up periods and interventions used in the studies, entailing some unavoidable heterogeneity. The very limited results indicate that thrombolytic therapy was better than heparin in terms of improving haemodynamic outcomes, perfusion lung scanning, pulmonary angiogram assessment and echocardiograms. Given the risk of bias in the included studies and the inconsistent results, we cannot draw a strong conclusion about the benefit of thrombolytic agents versus heparin in this review.</P>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-09-22 12:36:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We assessed the effectiveness and safety of thrombolytic therapy for people with acute pulmonary embolism. We found that thrombolytic therapy was better than the comparison group in reducing the odds ratio of death and recurrence of PE, and it improved some composite clinical outcomes and haemodynamic parameters (perfusion lung scanning, pulmonary angiogram assessment and echocardiograms). The participants of the included studies were all adults aged 18 or over, with a mean age of about 60. However, the included trials did not have strict subgroups of elderly participants. Only <LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2014</LINK> had a subgroup for participants over 75, and their results showed no statistical benefits in death or haemodynamic decompensation (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.66). On the other hand, tenecteplase increased the OR of major extracranial bleeding (OR 20.38, 95% CI 2.69 to 154.53). Any differences between adults and elderly people therefore need further investigation.</P>
<P>Based on data from <LINK REF="STD-Konstantinides-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Konstantinides 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Perlroth-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perlroth 2007</LINK> pointed out that the heparin group required treatment escalation approximately three times more often than the thrombolytics group, but they did not observe any difference in the risk of death from PE. The investigators also found that treatment with heparin alone was more effective and less costly than treatment with alteplase plus heparin in participants with submassive PE and right ventricular dysfunction. However, we were not able to show any difference between thrombolytic therapy and comparison group in health cost and post-thrombotic syndrome, as no included studies reported on these outcomes. In clinical practice, haemodynamic parameters and age of PE patients must be considered, especially for haemodynamically unstable patients and patients over 75.</P>
<P>The included studies involved different types of thrombolytics, including alteplase, urokinase, streptokinase, rt-PA, ultrasound-assisted catheter-directed thrombolysis system and tenecteplase, usually followed by heparin. The control intervention was heparin alone or placebo plus heparin. No studies compared thrombolytics with surgical intervention.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Thrombolytics for massive PE (haemodynamically unstable patients)</HEADING>
<P>It is clinically very important to differentiate haemodynamically stable and unstable patients (massive PE). However, we only identified one study to date that compared thrombolytic therapy versus heparin in massive PE patients (<LINK REF="STD-Jerjes_x002d_S_x00e1_nchez-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Jerjes-Sánchez 1995</LINK>). Four studies included both massive and unknown PE types (<LINK REF="STD-Dotter-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Dotter 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ly-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Ly 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tibbutt-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Tibbutt 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-UPETSG-1970" TYPE="STUDY">UPETSG 1970</LINK>). The proportion of massive PE varied, standing at 8% in <LINK REF="STD-Ly-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Ly 1978</LINK>, 9% in <LINK REF="STD-UPETSG-1970" TYPE="STUDY">UPETSG 1970</LINK>, 23% in <LINK REF="STD-Tibbutt-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Tibbutt 1974</LINK> and 71% in <LINK REF="STD-Dotter-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Dotter 1979</LINK>. As we did not know the types of PE for all included participants in these studies, we decided to include these four studies in the 'type of PE unknown' group. In the study by <LINK REF="STD-PIOPED-1990" TYPE="STUDY">PIOPED 1990</LINK> all included participations had an unclear PE type. Therefore, we also included this study in the same group.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Jerjes_x002d_S_x00e1_nchez-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Jerjes-Sánchez 1995</LINK> showed an unbalanced allocation in the two groups at onset of PE, so we judged this study as being at high risk of bias due to the high risk of selective reporting and very small sample size. In this RCT, eight participants received either 1,500,000 IU of streptokinase in 1 h through a peripheral vein followed by heparin or heparin alone. The four participants who were randomised to streptokinase (mean time of onset of symptoms of the first event of PE: 2.5 h) improved in the first hour after treatment, survived, and in two years of follow-up did not present with pulmonary arterial hypertension. All four participants treated with heparin alone (mean time of onset of symptoms of the first event of PE: 34.75 h) died within 1 to 3 h after arrival at the emergency room. We excluded this study along with another three studies at high risk of bias in the sensitivity analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Ly-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Ly 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taherkhani-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Taherkhani 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tibbutt-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Tibbutt 1974</LINK>), and this neutralised the significance in all cause death between the two groups. Thus, the data from <LINK REF="STD-Jerjes_x002d_S_x00e1_nchez-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Jerjes-Sánchez 1995</LINK> had a big influence on the pooled analysis. Even though we performed a subgroup analysis according to different types of the PE (massive/submassive/unknown types of PE) for the primary outcomes, these results cannot be extrapolated to massive PE due to the limitations of <LINK REF="STD-Jerjes_x002d_S_x00e1_nchez-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Jerjes-Sánchez 1995</LINK>.</P>

There was no blinding in <LINK REF="STD-Goldhaber-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Goldhaber 1993</LINK>, and it was broken in <LINK REF="STD-Taherkhani-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Taherkhani 2014</LINK>. Although two studies used the appropriate method to generate the random sequence, <LINK REF="STD-Ly-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Ly 1978</LINK> included five participants who were not randomised, and in <LINK REF="STD-Jerjes_x002d_S_x00e1_nchez-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Jerjes-Sánchez 1995</LINK> numbers were unbalanced between the intervention and control group at the onset of PE. The remaining trials did not give clear details about random sequence generation, allocation concealment or blinding. Two studies were unclear in all the items in the risk of bias assessment (<LINK REF="STD-Marini-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Marini 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sharifi-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Sharifi 2013</LINK>), and in four studies all risk of bias domains were either unclear or at high risk (<LINK REF="STD-Dotter-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Dotter 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kucher-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Kucher 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ly-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Ly 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tibbutt-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Tibbutt 1974</LINK>).This could potentially have biased the results in favour of treatment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sample size</HEADING>
<P>Many of the outcome measures only come from one or two studies, so some effect sizes have a confidence interval over 95% (such as for incidence of stroke). For some outcomes, we may not have been able to detect any real effects of thrombolytics because of small sample size.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Conflicts of interest</HEADING>
<P>Four included studies were funded by related pharmaceutical companies (<LINK REF="STD-Dotter-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Dotter 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kline-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Kline 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kucher-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Kucher 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2014</LINK>), and some study authors worked for these companies (<LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2014</LINK>). This could potentially result in conflicts of interest in drafting and reporting the results of the study, even though the authors stated there was no influence in the whole study period.</P>
<P>Due to the above issues, the overall quality of the evidence available in this review is low.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>Within each subgroup, we used Chi<SUP>2</SUP> analyses to test for statistical evidence of heterogeneity among studies and I<SUP>2</SUP> to measure the degree of inconsistency across studies. When Chi<SUP>2</SUP>analysis was significant and I<SUP>2</SUP> values were in excess of 50%, we analysed differences in participant selection, baseline values, risk of bias, design and methods that could possibly explain the heterogeneity.</P>
<P>Heterogeneity in responses did not appear to result from differences in methods used for most of the primary outcomes (including overall mortality, recurrence of pulmonary emboli, major haemorrhagic events) or for some of the secondary outcomes (mean pulmonary arterial pressure improvement, pulmonary angiogram assessment (72 h after treatment), echocardiograms). We obtained dynamic measurements in studies comparing thrombolytics versus heparin, showing a similar effect on those outcomes listed above. We did not find any dose-related or time-related relationships in these dynamic analyses.</P>
<P>There was moderate heterogeneity in dynamic analysis of minor bleeding in studies comparing thrombolytics versus heparin (<LINK REF="STD-Becattini-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Becattini 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dalla_x002d_Volta-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Dalla-Volta 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fasullo-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Fasullo 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kucher-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Kucher 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Levine-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Levine 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ly-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Ly 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taherkhani-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Taherkhani 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tibbutt-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Tibbutt 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-UPETSG-1970" TYPE="STUDY">UPETSG 1970</LINK>), and we found a statistically significant difference between the two therapies. Therefore, when we use this result in clinical practice, we must consider heterogeneity in the meta-analysis. A great degree of heterogeneity was present in the dynamic analysis for D-dimer concentration at 2 h after treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Dalla_x002d_Volta-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Dalla-Volta 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PIOPED-1990" TYPE="STUDY">PIOPED 1990</LINK>), pulmonary artery systolic pressure (<LINK REF="STD-Fasullo-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Fasullo 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sharifi-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Sharifi 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taherkhani-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Taherkhani 2014</LINK>), and right ventricle to left ventricle ratio (<LINK REF="STD-Fasullo-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Fasullo 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kucher-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Kucher 2014</LINK>), showing a significant difference between the two treatment groups. This may be a consequence of the different types of thrombolytics and heparin used in the two studies (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table).</P>

<P>For this 2015 update, ten additional studies met our inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Becattini-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Becattini 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dotter-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Dotter 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fasullo-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Fasullo 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jerjes_x002d_S_x00e1_nchez-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Jerjes-Sánchez 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kline-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Kline 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kucher-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Kucher 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marini-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Marini 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sharifi-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Sharifi 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taherkhani-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Taherkhani 2014</LINK>). Almost all studies showed that thrombolytic therapy can reduce the primary outcomes defined by the study, especially the echocardiographic parameters. Our meta-analysis of all included studies showed beneficial results for thrombolysis in terms of death from all causes. However, after the sensitivity analysis, which removed the studies labelled as high risk of bias showed there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of death. The results from <LINK REF="STD-Jerjes_x002d_S_x00e1_nchez-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Jerjes-Sánchez 1995</LINK> showed apparent benefit for the thrombolytics group, and removing it during the sensitivity analysis may explain the loss in significance.</P>
<P>In a recent meta-analysis by <LINK REF="REF-Chatterjee-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chatterjee 2014</LINK>, the authors reported that theirs was the first analysis of thrombolysis in PE with sufficient statistical power to detect associations with a meaningful mortality reduction. However, they included the data from the <LINK REF="STD-Jerjes_x002d_S_x00e1_nchez-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Jerjes-Sánchez 1995</LINK> trial, which we labelled as carrying a high risk of bias, Furthmore, <LINK REF="REF-Chatterjee-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chatterjee 2014</LINK> did not perform a sensitivity analysis according to the quality of included studies and did not assess the conflicts of interest in the included trials, which also may introduce bias to the review process. According to the<I> Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>), Peto OR works well when the individual odds ratios are close to one (i.e. intervention effects are small) and when events are not particularly common (the ideal event rate is below 1%). In <LINK REF="REF-Chatterjee-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chatterjee 2014</LINK>, the range of the ORs was 0.03 to 5.80 and the maximum event rate was 100% (4/4) in the control group. Thus, the Peto OR method used by <LINK REF="REF-Chatterjee-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chatterjee 2014</LINK> to pool data may not be the most appropriate way to deal with the data.</P>
<P>Our review also had different subgroup analyses compared with <LINK REF="REF-Chatterjee-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chatterjee 2014</LINK> and published guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2012</LINK>). In our review, studies that included participants with unclear types of PE were put into the 'type of PE unknown' group, which was more precise than the subgroups used by <LINK REF="REF-Chatterjee-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chatterjee 2014</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2012</LINK> (namely, unstable/massive and stable/submassive). The NICE guideline did not find significant reductions in overall mortality in the unstable/massive and stable/submassive PE subgroups (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.15 and OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.51, respectively). Four other reviews did not find significant reductions in overall mortality, especially for submassive PE or haemodynamically stable patients (<LINK REF="REF-Cao-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cao 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Liu-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marti-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marti 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nakamura-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nakamura 2014</LINK>). Therefore, larger clinical trials focusing on this association are also needed.</P>

<P>The available evidence suggests a benefit of thrombolytics over heparin in the treatment of acute pulmonary embolism in terms of death. However, we cannot draw any clear conclusion because the quality of evidence is low. Furthermore, the thrombolytic therapies included in this review are heterogeneous. Thrombolytic therapy may be helpful in reducing the recurrence of PE but may cause more major and minor haemorrhagic events and stroke, including intracranial haemorrhage. The results show a three-fold increase of major bleeding, and this result appears robust and not sensitive to the exclusion of lower quality studies. We also note that most of the included studies in this review considered patients with submassive PE. Only one study focused on massive PE, finding an apparent benefit for thrombolysis. More high quality double blind RCTs assessing safety and cost-effectiveness for thrombolytic therapy for acute PE are required.</P>

<P>We have revised the methods of 'Assessment of risk of bias in included studies' according to the new version of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). The additional secondary outcomes of 'Escalation of treatment' and 'Hospital stay' were added in this update because of their clinical importance in the treatment of acute pulmonary embolism with thrombolytics. We reordered the outcomes of survival time, composite clinical outcome, QoL and healthcare cost comparison from primary to secondary outcomes due to clinical importance. We added a subgroup analysis for massive/submassive PE because of its clinical importance in the treatment of acute pulmonary embolism. We also used GRADE to assess the overall quality of the evidence following the instructions from the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) and summarised this in a 'Summary of findings' table.</P>

<P>The protocol for this review was developed and published under the auspices of the Cochrane Airways Collaborative Review Group. As the scope of treatment of pulmonary embolism was considered to be more suited to the Peripheral Vascular Diseases (PVD) Group, whose scope already included prevention of pulmonary embolism, this review was passed over to the PVD Group. The PVD Group was renamed Cochrane Vascular in July 2015.</P>
<P>The published protocol did not specify methods for statistical analysis. We have added details of the analysis to the full review. In addition, we have also clarified the review objectives.</P>
