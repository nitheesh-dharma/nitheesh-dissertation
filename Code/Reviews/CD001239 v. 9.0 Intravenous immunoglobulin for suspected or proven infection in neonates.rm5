<DESCRIPTION>
<P>The title has been changed to: 'Intravenous immunoglobulin for suspected or proven infection in neonates'. One additional published trial and one ongoing trial were identified. The trial by INIS (<LINK REF="STD-INIS-2011" TYPE="STUDY">INIS 2011</LINK>) enrolled infants with proven or suspected infection at the time of randomisation. This is the largest trial published to date, adding 3493 infants to this systematic review. We report the results for the combined cohort of infants with suspected and proven infection at the time of randomisation. This approach represents a deviation from previous versions of this review. In addition, the authors provided us with results separately for infants with suspected infection and with proven infection at the time of entry to the trial. We report the results separately for infants with suspected infection, with proven infection and with suspected or proven infection at treatment initiation.</P>
<P>Also in this update, we have included in a subgroup analysis the outcome of mortality for infants who were treated with IgM-enriched IVIG.</P>
<P>For this update, we excluded the comparison: IVIG versus placebo or no intervention for 'subsequently' proven infection; such estimates are meaningless as the clinician is unaware, at the point of starting treatment, whether the infant will or will not have proven sepsis at a later time point.</P>
<P>With the addition of data from the INIS trial (<LINK REF="STD-INIS-2011" TYPE="STUDY">INIS 2011</LINK>), it is now clear that IVIG does not have a significant effect on important outcomes such as in-hospital death or death and disability at 2 years corrected age.</P>
<P>In a secondary analysis of trials using IgM-enriched immunoglobulin, no significant reduction in mortality during hospital stay was reported. One ongoing trial of IgM-enriched immunoglobulin was identified.</P>
<P>Conclusions changed: there is now no indication that the use of IVIG or IgM-enriched IVIG in infants with suspected or proven infection at the time of initiation of treatment improves important outcomes. No further research is recommended to test current IVIG preparations for suspected or proven serious infection.</P>

<P>Infants may acquire infection while in the womb or in the hospital after birth, especially if they require intensive care. Such infections may cause serious illness or death.

<P>Neonates are at higher risk of infection due to immuno-incompetence. Maternal transport of immunoglobulins to the fetus mainly occurs after 32 weeks' gestation, and endogenous synthesis begins several months after birth. Administration of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) provides immunoglobulin G (IgG) that can bind to cell surface receptors, provide opsonic activity, activate complement, promote antibody-dependent cytotoxicity and improve neutrophilic chemo-luminescence.

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-03-22 03:32:14 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Congenital and nosocomial bacterial and fungal infections continue to be a significant cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. In a cohort of 7861 very low birth weight (VLBW) neonates admitted during a 32-month period (1991 to 1993) to the 12 National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Network centres, blood culture proven early-onset (occurring within 72 hours of birth) sepsis occurred in 1.9% of infants (<LINK REF="REF-Stoll-1996a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 1996a</LINK>). In contrast to the low incidence of proven early-onset sepsis, almost 50% of infants in the cohort were considered to have clinical sepsis and were treated with antibiotics for longer than five days. Neonates with early-onset sepsis were more likely to have later co-morbidities or complications (severe intraventricular haemorrhage, patent ductus arteriosus, and prolonged assisted ventilation). Decreasing gestational age was associated with increased rates of infection; and 26% of VLBW infants with early-onset sepsis died. However, only 4% of the 950 deaths that occurred in the first 72 hours of life were attributed to infection. For infants who survived to discharge, early-onset sepsis was associated with a statistically significant longer hospital stay (86 versus 69 days; P &lt; 0.02). From the same 12 centres, a 25% incidence of late-onset infection has been reported in a cohort of 6911 VLBW infants who survived beyond 3 days of life (<LINK REF="REF-Stoll-1996b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 1996b</LINK>). Neonates in whom late-onset sepsis developed were significantly more likely to die than those who were not infected (17% versus 7%; P &lt; 0.0001).</P>
<P>Maternal transport of immunoglobulins to the fetus occurs mainly after 32 weeks' gestation, and endogenous synthesis does not begin until about 24 weeks after birth. Therefore, infants born at term and especially premature infants are at high risk for morbidity and mortality from infections acquired in utero, as well as from exposure to infectious sources in neonatal intensive care units (<LINK REF="REF-Baker-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baker 1990</LINK>). The rationale for treating neonatal infection with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is based on evidence that administration of IVIG provides immunoglobulin G (IgG) that can bind to cell surface receptors, provide opsonic activity, activate complement, promote antibody-dependent cytotoxicity and improve neutrophilic chemo-luminescence (<LINK REF="REF-Baley-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baley 1988</LINK>).</P>
<P>Prophylactic administration of IVIG to prevent nosocomial infection has been studied in &gt; 5000 neonates enrolled in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (<LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 2010</LINK>a). The results of these meta-analyses show a statistically significant reduction in sepsis (risk difference (RD) -2.8%; number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 36) and any serious infection (typical RD -3.2%; NNTB 31) but no reduction in mortality from infection (<LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 2010</LINK>a).</P>
<P>The effectiveness of IVIG as an adjunct to standard treatment with antibiotics in reducing mortality from suspected infection has been less well studied. In clinical practice, the number of infants with suspected infection considerably outweighs the number of infants eventually proven to have systemic infection. To study the effectiveness of IVIG in reducing mortality and morbidity from infection in the clinical setting, neonates with suspected infection should be entered and randomly assigned into such trials and outcomes should be reported on an 'intention-to-treat basis". <LINK REF="REF-Baley-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baley 1992</LINK> presented a systematic review based on three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Haque-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Haque 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sidiropoulos-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Sidiropoulos 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weisman-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Weisman 1992</LINK>a) that evaluated the effect on mortality of administration of IVIG to neonates with suspected sepsis. However, the study by Weisman (<LINK REF="STD-Weisman-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Weisman 1992</LINK>a) included only infants with subsequently proven infection. Although the meta-analysis showed a statistically significant typical risk difference (RD) for mortality of -14.5% (95% confidence interval (CI) -4.5 to -24.5), the authors stressed that the analysis must be viewed with caution as only a small number of infants had been studied (173 neonates were included in their review). <LINK REF="REF-Lacy-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lacy 1995</LINK> excluded the study by Sidiropoulos (1986) in a meta-analysis as the original study published in German (<LINK REF="STD-Sidiropoulos-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Sidiropoulos 1981</LINK>) indicated that it was a quasi-randomised trial (a group of 82 newborns with suspected infection were treated with antibiotics alone or with antibiotics and immunoglobulin on an alternating basis). The authors of the meta-analysis concluded that no statistically significant reduction in mortality was noted following IVIG administration for the treatment of neonatal infection. In another meta-analysis, <LINK REF="REF-Jenson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jenson 1997</LINK> included the same three studies as were included by <LINK REF="REF-Baley-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baley 1992</LINK> but concluded that IVIG administration is "of unequivocal benefit in preventing death when administered therapeutically for early-onset neonatal sepsis". In a subsequent publication, these authors concluded, "The additional benefit of decreasing the risk of acute mortality indicates that the inclusion of IVIG should be considered a part of the routine therapy of neonatal sepsis" (<LINK REF="REF-Jenson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jenson 1998</LINK>). In a meta-analysis of five studies of IVIG to treat neonatal sepsis, <LINK REF="REF-Haque-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haque 1997</LINK> concluded that IVIG treatment results in a significant reduction in mortality (typical odds ratio (OR) 0.32, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.48). Two of the included studies lacked a randomised control group (<LINK REF="REF-Friedman-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedman 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haque-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Haque 1995</LINK>). A Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Alejandria-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alejandria 2001</LINK>) conducted after publication of the first version of our Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 1998b</LINK>) included all age groups. The authors found a reduction in overall mortality in participants of all ages who received polyclonal IVIG. In a subgroup analysis in neonates (4 studies, 191 infants) no statistically significant reduction in all-cause mortality was reported (typical risk ratio (RR) 0.60, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.14). The analyses by Alejandria (<LINK REF="REF-Alejandria-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alejandria 2001</LINK>) included fewer studies than were included in the previous version of our systematic review in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 1998b</LINK>).</P>
<P>This review updates our existing Cochrane review, 'Intravenous immunoglobulin for suspected or subsequently proven infection in neonates', published in 1998 (<LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 1998b</LINK>). It was updated in 2001 (<LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 2001</LINK>), 2004 (<LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 2004</LINK>), 2007 when no new trials were identified, 2010 when one new trial was identified (<LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 2010</LINK>) and in July 2013 when the large INIS trial (<LINK REF="STD-INIS-2011" TYPE="STUDY">INIS 2011</LINK>) was included (<LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 2013</LINK>).</P>

<LI>to assess the effects of IVIG on mortality and morbidity caused by suspected infection at study entry in neonates;</LI>
<LI>to assess the effects of IVIG on mortality and morbidity caused by proven infection at study entry in neonates;</LI>
<LI>to assess the effects of IVIG on mortality and morbidity caused by suspected or proven infection at study entry in neonates; and</LI>
<LI>to assess in a subgroup analysis the effects of IgM-enriched IVIG on mortality from suspected infection.</LI>
</UL>
<P>For the 2013 update and this update, we excluded the comparison and related outcomes for 'IVIG versus placebo or no intervention for subsequently proven infection'. As was stated in a previous update of the review, "such estimates are meaningless as the clinician is unaware, at the point of starting treatment for suspected infection, whether the infant will have proven sepsis or not".</P>
<P>In a deviation from the protocol for the 2013 update, we included a study that enrolled infants with suspected or proven serious infection at the time of randomisation (<LINK REF="STD-INIS-2011" TYPE="STUDY">INIS 2011</LINK>). For that and this update, we performed a subgroup analysis for mortality in studies that used IgM-enriched IVIG for treatment of suspected infection. Suspected infection was defined as clinical symptoms and signs consistent with infection without isolation of a causative organism. Proven infection was defined as clinical symptoms and signs consistent with infection in association with isolation at autopsy of a causative organism (bacteria or fungi) from a blood culture, cerebrospinal fluid culture, urine culture (urine obtained by suprapubic tap) or a normally sterile site (for example liver, spleen, meninges, lung).</P>

<P>The search strategy used to identify studies was based on the guidelines of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group.</P>
<P>The search was initiated by a review of personal files. Reference lists of identified studies and subsequently retrieved articles were scanned for additional references. MEDLINE was searched from 1966 to September 2003. EMBASE (Excerpta Medica online) was searched from 1980 to September 2003. <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (Issue 3, 2003) was searched. The following keywords were used: immunoglobulin and infant-newborn, and random allocation, or controlled trial, or randomised controlled trial (RCT). No language restrictions were applied. Ms Elizabeth Uleryk developed and applied an extensive search strategy (available upon request) for MEDLINE and EMBASE in February 2001 and September 2003.</P>
<P>For the 2010 update, the same search strategy was applied for all databases in December of 2009. Progress details on the ongoing International Neonatal Imunotherapy Study (INIS) were obtained from the trial website (<A HREF="http://www.npeu.ox.ac.uk/inis/inis_downloads/inis_update_06-07.pdf">http://www.npeu.ox.ac.uk/inis</A>) and by communication with the principal investigator, Dr Peter Brocklehurst, in February 2010.</P>
<P>For the 2013 update, Ms Yolanda Brosseau conducted searches of CINAHL, <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, PubMed, EMBASE, clinicaltrials.gov and controlledtrials.com on 13 February 2013.

<P>An assessment of the quality of the included studies (excluding abstracts) was performed independently by JBL and AO using criteria developed by the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. These criteria include blinding of randomisation, blinding of intervention, complete follow-up and blinding of outcome measurement. For each criterion, there were three possibilities: yes, can't tell, and no. The assignment was not done with the assessors blinded to author, institution, journal of publication or results, as both assessors were familiar with most of the studies and the typographical layout of the journals and would have knowledge of these even when blinded. In addition, the results sections of articles often include methodological information. After independent scoring, the two assessors discussed the ratings for each study, and any discrepancies were resolved. For the 2010 update, the risk of bias tables were completed by one review author (AO). For the 2013 and 2015 updates, both review authors (AO, JBL) completed the <LINK TAG="STUDY_QUALITY" TYPE="SECTION">Risk of bias in included studies</LINK> table.</P>

Typical risk ratio (RR) and risk difference (RD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using the fixed-effect model were reported for dichotomous data and weighted mean difference (WMD) for continuous data. If a statistically significant reduction in the RD had been found, the number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) would have been calculated. If a statistically significant increase in the RD had been found, the number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) would have been calculated. For previous updates, the RD and the NNTB were not calculated for the subset of participants who entered the trials with suspected sepsis, and who were subsequently proven to have sepsis. Such estimates are meaningless as the clinician is unaware at the point of starting treatment whether or not the infant will have proven sepsis. This comparison for a subset of participants was excluded for both the 2013 and this update.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Erdem-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Erdem 1993</LINK> enrolled 44 infants with suspected sepsis. Twenty were randomly chosen to receive IgM-enriched IVIG, and 24 were controls. Fifteen infants in each group had blood culture proven sepsis, and the remaining infants were classified as having suspected but not proven infection. Outcomes for all randomly assigned infants were reported. Through correspondence, the authors indicated that allocation was performed on an 'alternating basis'.</P>

The currently included study by <LINK REF="STD-Akdag-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Akdag 2014</LINK> was of small sample size too and enrolled 102 infants to receive either IgM-enriched IVIG or placebo. In the 2013 update, one large study that included infants with proven and suspected infection at trial entry was included (<LINK REF="STD-INIS-2011" TYPE="STUDY">INIS 2011</LINK>). This study enrolled 3493 infants. In only three studies was a sample size calculation reported as part of the study design (<LINK REF="STD-Akdag-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Akdag 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-INIS-2011" TYPE="STUDY">INIS 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shenoi-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Shenoi 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The eight small studies were performed in six countries (Bangladesh, India (n = 2), Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, Turkey (n = 2) and the US). The level of intensive care offered to these neonates was poorly described and was likely to have varied. The large <LINK REF="STD-INIS-2011" TYPE="STUDY">INIS 2011</LINK> study was conducted in 113 hospitals in nine countries (including Argentina, Australia, New Zealand and several countries in Europe).</P>
<P>In all but one study, infants were enrolled because of suspected infection. It is our interpretation that randomisation and initiation of treatment occurred at this stage. In the INIS study (<LINK REF="STD-INIS-2011" TYPE="STUDY">INIS 2011</LINK>) infants were enrolled with either suspected infection or proven infection at the time of initiation of treatment. Seven of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ahmed-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ahmed 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Akdag-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Akdag 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Erdem-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Erdem 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haque-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Haque 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-INIS-2011" TYPE="STUDY">INIS 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Samatha-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Samatha 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sidiropoulos-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Sidiropoulos 1981</LINK>) reported on outcomes as per intention to treat. Christensen (<LINK REF="STD-Christensen-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 1991</LINK>) did not report on the allocation of two infants who were excluded from the study (one infant died). In the study by Shenoi (<LINK REF="STD-Shenoi-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Shenoi 1999</LINK>), 58 newborns with suspected sepsis were allocated to IVIG treatment or placebo. Seven neonates who qualified but did not receive either IVIG or placebo were taken into a separate control group, and one infant who received only one dose of IVIG was excluded from the analysis.</P>

<P>It is uncertain whether reported deaths represented total mortality from all causes in all studies. Ahmed (<LINK REF="STD-Ahmed-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ahmed 2006</LINK>) defined the mortality outcome as those infants who died in hospital as the result of sepsis, prematurity or its complications. Haque (<LINK REF="STD-Haque-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Haque 1988</LINK>) stated that the deaths were the result of sepsis, but some reported deaths occurred in neonates with suspected sepsis. Haque has confirmed that all deaths in the study population were reported (personal communication, 1998). In the other studies, it was assumed that all deaths during the initial hospitalisation were accounted for.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-03-22 07:08:45 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The updated search in January 2015 identified one published study (<LINK REF="STD-Akdag-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Akdag 2014</LINK>) that was ongoing in the previous update. The study included 102 infants of which 51 were randomised to IgM-enriched IVIG and 51 to normal saline.</P>
<P>For the update in 2013, we identified one new published study (<LINK REF="STD-INIS-2011" TYPE="STUDY">INIS 2011</LINK>) with a very large sample size (n = 3493 infants) and one ongoing study. We made several changes from our previous reviews; studies that reported only on infants diagnosed with proven infection after randomisation were excluded. As was stated in the previous update of the review, "such estimates are meaningless, as the clinician is unaware, at the point of starting treatment for suspected infection, whether the infant will have proven sepsis or not". In the 2013 update, we reported on the outcomes of infants with suspected infection, as well as infants with proven infection, at trial entry. In a subgroup analysis, we reported on in-hospital mortality among infants treated with IgM-enriched IVIG for suspected infection. After the findings from the large, high-quality INIS trial (<LINK REF="STD-INIS-2011" TYPE="STUDY">INIS 2011</LINK>) were incorporated, the results became unequivocal. For suspected or proven infection (or a combination of the two) intravenous immunoglobulin, in addition to antibiotics, did not confer any advantage with regard to mortality while in hospital, death at two years corrected age, or death or major disability at two years corrected age. For suspected or proven infection at trial entry, no significant difference was evident for the outcomes of use of supplemental oxygen on day 28, major cerebral abnormality, necrotizing enterocolitis, or duration of hospital stay. Intravenous immunoglobulin enriched with IgM did not seem to confer any advantage.</P>
<P>A total of nine studies evaluating 3973 infants were included in this update of the review.</P>
<P>Mortality during hospital stay in infants with clinically suspected infection was not significantly different after IVIG treatment (9 studies (n = 2527); typical RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.13; typical RD -0.01, 95% CI - 0.04 to 0.02; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 23% for RR and 29% for RD). Death or major disability at 2 years corrected age was not significantly different in infants with suspected infection after IVIG treatment (1 study (n = 1985); RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.09; RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.03). Mortality during hospital stay was not significantly different after IVIG treatment in infants with proven infection at trial entry (1 study (n =1446); RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.21; RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.03). Death or major disability at 2 years corrected age was not significantly different after IVIG treatment in infants with proven infection at trial entry (1 trial (n = 1393); RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.18; RD 0.01, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.06). Mortality during hospital stay in infants with clinically suspected or proven infection at trial entry was not significantly different after IVIG treatment (1 study (n = 3493); RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.16; RD 0.00, 95% CI - 0.02 to 0.03). Death or major disability at 2 years corrected age was not significantly different after IVIG treatment in infants with suspected or proven infection at trial entry (1 study (n = 3493); RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.09; RD -0.00, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.03). Three studies enrolling 170 infants with suspected infection reported on length of hospital stay. A statistically significant reduction in length of hospital stay was noted (MD -4.08 days, 95% CI -6.47 to -1.69; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 33%, low). Length of hospital stay was not reduced for infants with suspected and proven infection at trial entry (1 study (n = 3493); mean difference (MD) 0.00 days, 95% CI -0.61 to 0.61).</P>
<P>No significant difference in mortality during hospital stay after administration of IgM-enriched IVIG for suspected infection at trial entry was reported in 4 studies (n = 266); typical RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.20; RD -0.06, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.02; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 17% for RR and 53% for RD).</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-03-22 07:11:52 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The large <LINK REF="STD-INIS-2011" TYPE="STUDY">INIS 2011</LINK> study was conducted in 113 hospitals in nine countries (including Argentina, Australia, New Zealand and several countries in Europe) and enrolled 3493 infants with suspected or proven infection at trial entry. It was a high-quality trial and because of its size carried a high weight in all analyses in which it was included.</P>
<P>Eight small studies (enrolment included between 24 and 102 infants) were performed in six countries (Bangladesh, India (n = 2), Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, Turkey (n = 2) and the US). The level of intensive care offered to these neonates was poorly described and is likely to have varied. The evidence from the meta-analyses of IVIG for suspected or proven infection in neonates clearly indicates that IVIG does not reduce mortality or other important outcomes and should not be used. Although the sample size for the meta-analysis of IgM-enriched IVIG is small, there is no indication that its use would significantly reduce mortality in infants with suspected infection.</P>
<P>It is possible that the various IVIG preparations used by the authors in different geographical locations were not optimally targeted for the bacteria that were commonly isolated. No serious short-term side effects were reported in these studies; a finding that is consistent with a previous meta-analysis of prophylactic IVIG in preterm or low birth weight infants (<LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 2013a</LINK>).</P>
<P>IVIG preparations with high concentrations of antibodies to bacteria that are commonly isolated from neonates in specific local settings or geographical areas may be more effective in reducing adverse outcomes. However, the use of anti-staphylococcal immunoglobulins to prevent staphylococcal infection in very low birth weight infants has been reviewed and currently is not recommended (<LINK REF="REF-Shah-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 2009</LINK>).</P>

<P>Methodological weaknesses identified in several of the studies included the lack of a sample size calculation (in general, very small cohorts were recruited), uncertainty about concealment of randomisation and how randomisation was undertaken, lack of a placebo, outcomes where assessors were not ascertained as blinded to group allocation, and outcomes not reported as per intention to treat. The large <LINK REF="STD-INIS-2011" TYPE="STUDY">INIS 2011</LINK> trial was of high quality and provided clear evidence that IVIG does not confer any significant benefits regarding death or major disability at two years corrected age in neonates with suspected or proven serious infection. The meta-analyses of all trials support the findings of no impact of IVIG on mortality during hospital stay.</P>

Our 2001 review (<LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 2001</LINK>) included five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Erdem-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Erdem 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mancilla_x002d_R-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Mancilla-R 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Samatha-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Samatha 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shenoi-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Shenoi 1999</LINK>) that were not included in the reviews by Baley and Fanaroff (<LINK REF="REF-Baley-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baley 1992</LINK>), Lacy and Ohlsson (<LINK REF="REF-Lacy-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lacy 1995</LINK>), Jenson and Pollock (<LINK REF="REF-Jenson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jenson 1997</LINK>), Haque (<LINK REF="REF-Haque-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haque 1997</LINK>) or Jenson and Pollock (<LINK REF="REF-Jenson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jenson 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Alejandria (<LINK REF="REF-Alejandria-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alejandria 2001</LINK>) included four studies in her analysis of IVIG for treatment of sepsis (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Erdem-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Erdem 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haque-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Haque 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weisman-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Weisman 1992</LINK>). In her analysis, studies that reported deaths among neonates with suspected or subsequently proven infection were combined. She excluded the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Sidiropoulos-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Sidiropoulos 1981</LINK> as it was a quasi-randomised trial but included the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Erdem-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Erdem 1993</LINK>, which is now known to be a quasi-randomised trial.</P>
<P>Our updated meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 2004</LINK>) had increased power, compared with previous reviews, to provide a more precise estimate of the possible advantages of IVIG treatment for neonatal sepsis. The updated review in 2010 reported on an additional 60 infants (<LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 2010</LINK>). Results then showed a statistically significant reduction in mortality in cases of suspected infection with an NNTB of 10 infants (95% CI 6 to 33) to avoid one death. Because of concerns regarding the quality of the studies we cautioned against the routine use of IVIG.</P>
<P>In the 2013 update of our review (<LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 2013</LINK>) it was clear that IVIG did not reduce mortality in infants with suspected or proven infection at study entry. Another recent review that used slightly different inclusion criteria reached the same conclusions (<LINK REF="REF-Franco--2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Franco 2012</LINK>). The Cochrane review 'Intravenous immunoglobulin for treating sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock' was updated in 2013 (<LINK REF="REF-Alejandria-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alejandria 2013</LINK>). They included both adults and newborns but provided separate analyses for the two age groups. They included three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mancilla_x002d_R-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Mancilla-R 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weisman-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Weisman 1992</LINK>) that we excluded because the authors reported only on the infants with subsequently proven infection, not on infants with suspected or proven infection at the trial entry. For the IgM-enriched IVIG subgroup analysis they included the same trials as we have, except for the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Akdag-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Akdag 2014</LINK>, which was not published at the time of their update in 2013. However, they concluded "Among neonates with sepsis, there is sufficient evidence that standard polyclonal IVIG, as adjunctive therapy, does not reduce mortality based on the inclusion of the large polyclonal IVIG trial on neonates. For IgM-enriched IVIG, the trials on neonates and adults were small and the totality of the evidence is still insufficient to support a robust conclusion of benefit".</P>

<P>The undisputable results of the INIS trial, which enrolled 3493 infants, and our meta-analysis (n = 3973) showed no reduction in mortality during hospital stay, or death or major disability at two years of age in infants with suspected or proven infection. Although based on a small sample size (n = 266), this update provides additional evidence that IgM-enriched IVIG does not significantly reduce mortality during hospital stay in infants with suspected infection. Routine administration of IVIG or IgM-enriched IVIG to prevent mortality in infants with suspected or proven neonatal infection is not recommended.</P>

Staff in Europe and Argentina would have been blinded to the intervention, but in Australia and New Zealand it is possible that healthcare providers could have detected whether IVIG or placebo was given as the solutions would have behaved differently (no froth on agitation for normal saline).
