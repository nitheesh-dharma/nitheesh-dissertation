<P>
<B>What are hip protectors?</B>
</P>
<P>Older people living in nursing care facilities or older adults living at home are at high risk of falling and a hip fracture may occur after a fall. Hip protectors are plastic shields (hard) or foam pads (soft), usually fitted in pockets in specially designed underwear. They are worn to cushion a sideways fall on the hip.</P>
<P>
<B>Do they prevent hip fractures?</B>
</P>
<P>We conducted a review of the effect<I> </I>of hip protectors to prevent hip fractures. We searched for all relevant studies up to December 2012. We found 19 studies with about 17,000 people who were around 80 years old.</P>
<P>Overall, there was moderate quality evidence from these studies for the following results.</P>
<P>In older people living in nursing care facilities, providing a hip protector<BR/>- probably decreases the chance of a hip fracture slightly<BR/>- may increase the small chance of a pelvic fracture slightly<BR/>- probably has little or no effect on other fractures or falls</P>
<P>In older people living at home, providing a hip protector<BR/>- probably has little or no effect on hip fractures</P>
<P>When wearing the hip protectors very few people had side effects, such as skin irritation. However, people often did not wear the hip protectors when they were provided. Better understanding is needed of the personal and design factors that may influence acceptance and adherence.</P>

<P>Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We sought additional information from trialists. Data were pooled using fixed-effect or random-effects models as appropriate.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-03-26 11:51:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review includes 19 studies, nine of which were cluster randomised. These included approximately 17,000 people (mean age range 78 to 86 years). Most studies were overall at low risk of bias for fracture outcomes. Trials tested hard or soft hip protectors enclosed in special underwear in 18 studies.</P>
<P>Pooling of data from 14 studies (11,808 participants) conducted in nursing or residential care settings found moderate quality evidence for a small reduction in hip fracture risk (risk ratio (RR) 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67 to 1.00); the absolute effect is 11 fewer people (95% CI, from 20 fewer to 0) per 1000 having a hip fracture when provided with hip protectors.</P>
<P>There is moderate quality evidence when pooling data from five trials in the community (5614 participants) that shows little or no effect in hip fracture risk (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.58); the absolute effect is two more people (95% CI 2 fewer to 6 more) per 1000 people having a hip fracture when provided with hip protectors.</P>
<P>There is probably little to no effect on falls (rate ratio 1.02, 95% CI 0.9 to 1.16) or fractures other than of the hip or pelvis (rate ratio 0.87, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.07). However, the risk ratio for pelvic fractures is RR 1.27 (95% CI 0.78 to 2.08); this is an absolute effect of one more person (95% CI 1 fewer to 5 more) per 1000 having a pelvic fracture when provided with hip protectors.</P>
<P>The incidence of adverse events while wearing hip protectors, including skin irritation, ranged from 0% to 5%. Adherence, particularly in the long term, was poor.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-03-31 12:53:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Hip protectors probably reduce the risk of hip fractures if made available to older people in nursing care or residential care settings, without increasing the frequency of falls. However, hip protectors may slightly increase the small risk of pelvic fractures. Poor acceptance and adherence by older people offered hip protectors is a barrier to their use. Better understanding is needed of the personal and design factors that may influence acceptance and adherence.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-03-25 20:51:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-03-25 20:51:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The majority of hip fractures occur in an older population with an average age of around 80 years. Females predominate over males by about four to one (<LINK REF="REF-Thorngren-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorngren 2002</LINK>). An estimated 1.7 million hip fractures occurred worldwide in the year 1990 (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1994</LINK>). The number of people sustaining a hip fracture continues to rise due to a combination of an increasingly elderly population and a continued increase in the age-specific incidence in some countries. A prediction for global numbers of 6.26 million hip fractures by the year 2050 has been made (<LINK REF="REF-Melton-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Melton 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>The fracture is usually the result of a fall. Falls can be due to multiple factors such as underlying physical illnesses, impaired balance, medications or environmental hazards, often in combination (<LINK REF="REF-Kellogg-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kellogg 1987</LINK>). The aetiology of hip fractures is also multifactorial but the three principal factors can be summarised as a combination of a fall, loss of protective mechanisms (for example, putting out the arms to break the fall) and weaker bone strength (<LINK REF="REF-Cummings-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cummings 1989</LINK>). These factors are associated with ageing. The fall usually occurs whilst standing or walking and the impact with the ground is usually on the side in the region of the hip (<LINK REF="REF-Hopkinson_x002d_Woolley-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hopkinson-Woolley 1998</LINK>). Whilst the hip fracture is usually the only major injury, its frequent combination with other medical problems associated with ageing results in significant mortality and morbidity.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-03-25 19:25:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Hip fractures affect the proximal femur (the upper part of the thigh bone). The idea of reducing the impact of a sideways fall onto the greater trochanter of the femur (this is the outer facing part of the top of the femur), and thereby the chance of fracturing the hip, began to receive research attention in the late 1980s (<LINK REF="REF-Lauritzen-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lauritzen 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lauritzen-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lauritzen 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wortberg-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wortberg 1988</LINK>). The first clinical trial of hip protectors was reported in 1993 (<LINK REF="STD-Lauritzen-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lauritzen 1993</LINK>) with encouraging results. Much of the early work was summarised in <LINK REF="REF-Lauritzen-1996a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lauritzen 1996a</LINK>. Different hip protector designs have been developed by researchers and manufacturers, and some of these have been enthusiastically adopted by health professionals.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-03-25 12:40:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are two main types of hip protectors. Hard protectors provide a firm shell over the lateral aspect of the hip, and are usually held within specifically designed underwear. Their main mode of action is to shunt the force of the impact away from the greater trochanter to the soft tissues of the thigh. The pads of soft protectors use compressible materials designed to be mainly energy absorbing. The typical force likely to cause a fracture has been established in biomechanical studies. Different protector designs are now able to be tested in a standard way to confirm that they have properties likely to reduce the forces transmitted to the hip in a sideways fall to a level below the typical fracture threshold (<LINK REF="REF-Cameron-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cameron 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Holzer-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holzer 2009</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-12-19 10:41:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lesley Gillespie">
<P>Over the two decades since the concept and outcomes of providing older people with hip protectors were first described, observational studies and some clinical trials have demonstrated effectiveness, but others have not. This updated review (first published in 1999) seeks to provide a critical appraisal and synthesis of the current evidence for the effectiveness of hip protectors.</P>

<P>We used the generic inverse variance method for the presentation of results and pooling of data for risk ratio (number of participants sustaining an event in each group) and, where appropriate, for rate ratio (number of events in each group). The generic inverse variance option requires entering the natural logarithm of the rate ratio or risk ratio and its standard error; we calculated these in <LINK REF="REF-Microsoft-Excel" TYPE="REFERENCE">Microsoft Excel</LINK>. When rate ratios or risk ratios were not provided by the authors but raw data were available, we first used <LINK REF="REF-Review-Manager-5" TYPE="REFERENCE">Review Manager 5</LINK> to calculate a risk ratio and 95% confidence interval, or <LINK REF="REF-Microsoft-Excel" TYPE="REFERENCE">Microsoft Excel</LINK> to calculate an incidence rate ratio and 95% confidence interval.

If both adjusted and unadjusted rate ratios were reported we used the unadjusted estimate, unless the adjustment was for clustering. If a rate ratio was not reported we calculated this, and a 95% confidence interval, if appropriate raw data were reported. In calculating rate ratios, we used events per person year of follow-up for hip fractures and falls if these data were reported or were calculable from the reported data. Where only the number of events or of individuals sustaining an event in the protected and unprotected groups were reported, we assumed an equal duration of follow-up surveillance for all participants in each group.</P>

<P>Our assessment of the risk of bias in the individual included studies is shown in <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>. <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK> shows the assessment for each individual study, and <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK> shows a summary of the risk of bias by domain. The domain judged to have the lowest risk of bias was allocation concealment, whereas the domain with the highest risk of bias was blinding of participants and personnel. As it is not feasible to blind participants, there is a risk of performance bias, i.e. knowledge of the intervention received may affect the outcomes; it is unclear if this would result in an overestimate or underestimate of the effect. For example, would a resident who is wearing a hip protector take more risks and therefore increase the risk of a fracture or would the resident be more aware of the risk of a fracture and take extra precautions? The only trial that was judged to have a low risk of bias in this domain was <LINK REF="STD-Kiel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kiel 2007</LINK>, since they were assessing the effect of hip protectors using a design in which participants acted as their own controls (hip protector worn on one side only). Consequently, blinding of outcome assessors is a critical issue to avoid potential biases. Assessment of fractures was judged to have a low risk of bias in 16 out of the 19 trials, whereas assessment of falls was judged to have a low risk of bias in three out of the 19 trials. Although many studies had high loss to follow-up, the risk of bias for outcome assessment was not considered high because in most of those studies the incident rates of fractures were similar to studies with low loss to follow-up. Only three of the 19 trials had selective outcome reporting bias for hip fractures and other fractures. In particular, <LINK REF="STD-Kiel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kiel 2007</LINK>, a relatively recent study, did not report the incidence of other fractures.</P>

However, using a typical baseline risk from the included studies (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>), the calculated absolute effect was two per 1000 more people (95% CI from 2 fewer to 6 more) with a hip fracture when provided with hip protectors in the community. The results of these studies showed no heterogeneity.</P>
<P>There was moderate quality evidence (due to risk of bias) that hip protectors probably had little or no effect on hip fractures in the community.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Pubic ramus and other pelvic fractures</HEADING>
<P>Data on the incidence of pubic ramus and other pelvic fracture were available in nine studies (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). The risk ratio is 1.27 (95% CI 0.78 to 2.08). This result is imprecise due to the small number of events in the analysis (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK> for absolute events per study) and the confidence interval include no effect as well as an appreciable harm. However, in absolute effects it would mean one more person per 1000 provided with a hip protector (95% CI from 1 fewer to 5 more) will have a pelvic fracture. Overall heterogeneity across community and institutional settings is I<SUP>2</SUP> = 20% (no heterogeneity in community and I<SUP>2</SUP> = 34% in institutions), but due to the small number of events, heterogeneity may have been difficult to detect across studies (in particular between <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Halloran-2004" TYPE="STUDY">O'Halloran 2004</LINK> and the other studies). There are similar effects on pelvic fractures between community and institutional settings, although the point estimate is greater in institutional settings. Overall, the evidence is low quality.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Other fractures</HEADING>
<P>Data on the incidence of other fractures that occurred over the study periods were reported in 11 studies, but were disaggregated from pelvic fractures in six. Pooling of results from the six studies providing disaggregated data on fractures other than in the hip or pelvis shows little or no effect in rate of fractures (RateR 0.87, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.07) (<I>see </I>
<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). The absolute effect is 26 fewer fractures per 1000 people provided with hip protectors over one year (95% CI from 58 fewer to 14 more). Pooling of data aggregating pelvic and other fractures together shows little or no effect in rate of fractures (RateR 0.88, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.05) (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>). There is no heterogeneity across studies. The quality of evidence is moderate due to risk of bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Falls</HEADING>
<P>Sixteen studies reported falls incidence; the pooled analysis shows little or no effect on the frequency of falls (RateR 0.99, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.13, <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>). In people at low risk of falls, the absolute effect is 10 more falls per 1000 people (95% CI, from 50 fewer to 80 more); in people at high risk it is 60 more falls per 1000 people (95% CI, from 300 fewer to 480 more). There is however, considerable heterogeneity amongst these studies (Chi² = 198.69, df = 15 (P &lt; 0.00001), I² = 92%), but it did not result in imprecise results. The overall quality of evidence is moderate.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Halloran-2004" TYPE="STUDY">O'Halloran 2004</LINK> reported on the occurrence of injurious falls (falls requiring medical attention): adjusted RateR 1.16 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.76) in a trial authors' analysis. <LINK REF="STD-Kannus-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kannus 2000</LINK> reported on falls only in the protector group (1404 falls occurring in the 653 individuals).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Acceptance and adherence (also termed compliance)</HEADING>
<P>Amongst those who were assigned to hip protectors, there was limited compliance with wearing them. Despite special efforts by some research groups (<LINK REF="STD-Kiel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kiel 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Halloran-2004" TYPE="STUDY">O'Halloran 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Schoor-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Van Schoor 2003</LINK>) to improve acceptance and adherence through staff and participant education, acceptance and adherence remain low.

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Birks-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Birks 2003</LINK> gave an overall compliance figure of 34%. In <LINK REF="STD-Birks-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Birks 2004</LINK>, 17,222 individuals were identified who met the inclusion criteria (aged 70 years or over and having at least one risk factor for hip fracture) but 13,645 (79%) declined to participate. Of those who agreed, only 31% were still wearing the protectors daily by the end of the 28-month study. <LINK REF="STD-Cameron-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Cameron 2001</LINK> stated that the total compliance was 57%.

Compliance in those who agreed to participate in the study (assessed as the number of days the protector was worn as a percentage of all available follow-up days) was 48% (± 29%, range &lt; 1% to 100%). In <LINK REF="STD-Kiel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kiel 2007</LINK>, participating residents were visited by research staff three times per week to assess adherence; this was throughout the trial, including the two-week run-in period.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Complications (including skin damage or breakdown)</HEADING>
<P>Not all studies measured complications, and studies often combined reporting of these with reasons for non-compliance. In studies that did report on complications, there was a range of event rates that were small (~ 0% to 5%). In <LINK REF="STD-Birks-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Birks 2004</LINK>, one hip fracture resulted from falling while putting on a protector. Minor skin irritation was reported in <LINK REF="STD-Cameron-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Cameron 2001</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Cameron-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cameron 2003</LINK> reported minor skin irritation or infection caused by hip protectors in 16 users (5%). <LINK REF="STD-Cameron-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Cameron 2011</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Cameron-2011a" TYPE="STUDY">Cameron 2011a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Cameron-2011b" TYPE="STUDY">Cameron 2011b</LINK> asked participants open-ended questions about complications, but no complications were reported. <LINK REF="STD-Chan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2000</LINK> indicated that one staff member noted that the underwear had rubbed. <LINK REF="STD-Ekman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ekman 1997</LINK> mentioned that the occurrence of skin irritation was used as a reason for non-compliance. <LINK REF="STD-Hubacher-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hubacher 2001</LINK> reported that aches and pains and an uncomfortable feeling while wearing the protectors were given as a reason for non-compliance. <LINK REF="STD-Kannus-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kannus 2000</LINK> reported skin irritation or abrasion in 15 cases.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Economic evaluation</HEADING>
<P>We found 12 economic evaluations of the use of hip protectors. Economic outcomes were available from two of the included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Schoor-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Van Schoor 2003</LINK>). Ten other economic evaluations modelled the possible impact of provision of hip protectors in different health delivery systems in North America and Europe.</P>
<P>Seven economic evaluations conducted in North America assumed efficacy of hip protectors, derived from one or more of the early cluster randomised studies or from pooled data in the 2001 version of this Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Parker-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2001</LINK>), and conducted economic modelling relevant to their health system.</P>
<P>Four evaluations were conducted in the USA (<LINK REF="REF-Colon_x002d_Emeric-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colon-Emeric 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Honkanen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Honkanen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Honkanen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Honkanen 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Segui_x002d_Gomez-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Segui-Gomez 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Colon_x002d_Emeric-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colon-Emeric 2003</LINK> conducted a cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis using a societal perspective and an 18-month time horizon. They concluded that &#8220;using external hip protectors in nursing facilities is cost saving or economically attractive over a wide range of cost and utility assumptions&#8221;.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Honkanen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Honkanen 2005</LINK> used a Markov model considering the short-term and long-term outcomes of hip protectors for a hypothetical nursing home population, stratified by age, sex and functional status. Estimates of hip protector effectiveness were derived from <LINK REF="STD-Kannus-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kannus 2000</LINK>, and costs and transition probabilities between health states were from other published secondary data. From a Medicare perspective, hip protectors appeared to be potentially cost-saving in the nursing home environment across almost all sex and functional groups aged 65 years and older, and for the nursing home population as a whole when adherence was greater than 42% and residents used three hip protectors a year.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Honkanen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Honkanen 2006</LINK> used a Markov model similar to that in <LINK REF="REF-Honkanen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Honkanen 2005</LINK>, conducting a cost-utility analysis of using hip protectors in a community-dwelling population compared with no intervention. In this setting, the analysis demonstrated that hip protector use was the dominant strategy only in women who initiated use at the age of 80 or 85 years, and in men who initiated use at the age of 85 years.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Segui_x002d_Gomez-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Segui-Gomez 2002</LINK> modelled two hypothetical cohorts of 500,000 65-year-old men or women with and without hip protectors through to death or the age of 100 years, whichever was earlier, using the data from <LINK REF="STD-Kannus-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kannus 2000</LINK> to give an efficacy estimate of 56% (sensitivity analysis range 43 to 69). In this model, everyone in the hip protector cohort was assumed to show 100% adherence for the base case but sensitivity analyses explored the effect of lower levels. At an efficacy estimate of 13% (compatible with the evidence from our <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK> and <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>), net costs were generated. Hip protectors for women would be cost saving with adherence above 23%.  </P>
<P>Three economic evaluations were reported from Canada (<LINK REF="REF-Sawka-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sawka 2007b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Singh-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Waldegger-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waldegger 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Sawka-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sawka 2007b</LINK> used a pooled odds ratio of 0.40 (95% CI 0.25 to 0.61) from a meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Sawka-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sawka 2007a</LINK>, which included <LINK REF="STD-Ekman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ekman 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harada-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Harada 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jantti-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Jantti 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2003</LINK>) in a model-based economic analysis, using estimates of transition probabilities, costs and utilities relevant to Canada. Assumed compliance was as in these four studies. They concluded that if hip protectors could be provided to elderly Ontario nursing home residents without additional labour expenditures, there was a reasonable probability that such a strategy might result in healthcare cost savings.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Singh-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 2004</LINK> modelled the cost-effectiveness of hip protectors in the prevention of hip fractures using data from literature current at that time, and from the care of elderly nursing home residents in a community hospital in British Columbia, Canada. They found that hip protector use was a dominant strategy compared to no treatment and to calcium and vitamin D supplements, and could save money while preventing hip fractures and improving quality of life.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Waldegger-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waldegger 2003</LINK> conducted a meta-analysis of five early cluster randomised studies that were at high risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Chan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ekman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ekman 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harada-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Harada 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kannus-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kannus 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lauritzen-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lauritzen 1993</LINK>) assuming a relative risk of hip fracture of 0.40 (95% CI 0.23 to 0.70) and an adherence range of 25% to 50%. Using these assumptions, their economic analysis indicated that hip protectors were a cost-effective method of preventing hip fracture in an institutionalised elderly population.  </P>
<P>Five economic evaluations were conducted in northern Europe, three of which were modelling studies (<LINK REF="REF-Fleurence-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleurence 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gandjour-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gandjour 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kumar-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumar 2000</LINK>), and two had been conducted as a prospectively planned and conducted component of studies included in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Schoor-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Van Schoor 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Fleurence-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleurence 2004</LINK> (UK) developed a Markov model to follow a hypothetical cohort of males and females at high risk and general risk of fracture. They concluded that &#8220;Current information available on interventions to prevent fractures in the elderly in the United Kingdom, suggests that, at the decision-maker&#8217;s ceiling ratio of $20,000 per quality adjusted life year (QALY), hip protectors were cost-effective in the general female population and high-risk male population, and cost-saving in the high-risk female population, despite the low compliance rate with the treatment".</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Gandjour-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gandjour 2008</LINK> (Germany) reported the use of a Markov simulation of two cohorts of 100,000 hypothetical patients, one offered hip protectors and the other not. In their analysis, they use the pooled estimate of effectiveness from the previous update of this Cochrane review (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.97). Adherence of 50% was assumed; so was use of protectors up to a total of two years by other individuals if the first wearer were to stop earlier. The base-case analysis found that wearing hip protectors would lead to savings of EUR 315 and a gain of 0.13 QALYs per patient. The probability of savings was 99%; only with an assumption of low hip protector effectiveness or high mortality rate at six months after fracture would these savings not be realised; however, some uncertainty about cost-effectiveness did remain.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Kumar-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumar 2000</LINK> (UK) modelled the additional costs of providing three pairs of hip protectors to older people in the catchment area of a district general hospital using: contemporary costs for 1998; an assumption of effectiveness based on the three studies in this review that were published before 2000 (<LINK REF="STD-Ekman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ekman 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jantti-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Jantti 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lauritzen-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lauritzen 1993</LINK>); and detailed age and gender data based on a four-year observational study. The results suggested that for people aged over 84 years, wearing hip protectors appeared to be cost-effective, but that further evaluation of effectiveness, costs and compliance was desirable.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2003</LINK>, (Germany), in which a planned economic evaluation was conducted alongside the clinical study, education about and provision of hip protectors did reduce hip fracture incidence but was found to produce a slight increase in costs, although cost savings might be made if the price of the hip protectors could be decreased.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Van-Schoor-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Van Schoor 2003</LINK> (Netherlands) conducted an economic evaluation alongside the clinical study, which found that provision of hip protectors was neither effective nor associated with lower costs.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-03-25 17:37:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The initial cluster randomised studies, which formed the bulk of the early evidence up to 2001, appeared to indicate that hip protectors significantly reduced the incidence of hip fracture, and their use was widely adopted in institutional settings. In the last decade, the accumulating data has challenged the initial optimism.</P>
<P>Inclusion of all eligible randomised and quasi-randomised studies continues to indicate that providing hip protectors probably slightly reduces the incidence of hip fractures in older people in institutional settings, with little or no effect on falls, other fractures (not including pelvic) and adverse events, such as skin irritation. However, the current best evidence, which is of low quality, suggests that the risk of a pelvic fracture may slightly increase, but this translates to an absolute risk which is very small (1/1000 more people will have a pelvic fracture when provided with hip protectors than when not (95% CI 1 fewer to 5 more)). In the community, hip protectors probably have little or no effect on hip fractures.</P>
<P>The conclusions of the 12 economic evaluations over the last decade have been, overall, optimistic that the provision of hip protectors would be cost effective, which is not surprising given the estimates of effectiveness that were used in modelling. Increasing uncertainty about the size of any protective effect has been reflected, however, in the more cautious conclusions of more recent modelling studies (<LINK REF="REF-Gandjour-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gandjour 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sawka-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sawka 2007b</LINK>) and the prospective evaluations 'piggy-backed' on clinical trials (<LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Schoor-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Van Schoor 2003</LINK>).</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-03-26 12:01:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>These results, seen from the perspective of biomechanical plausibility and experience from observational studies, have seemed to many health professionals and researchers working in the care of older people to be counter-intuitive. How can it be, they ask, that meta-analysis of randomised comparative studies fails to confirm the effectiveness of a theoretically plausible intervention reported to be effective in the early RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Chan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ekman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ekman 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jantti-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Jantti 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kannus-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kannus 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lauritzen-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lauritzen 1993</LINK>) and in clinical practice by observational studies (<LINK REF="REF-Forsen-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forsen 2003a</LINK>). Our review suggests that, first, both acceptance of and adherence to wearing protectors by participants in studies has been consistently poor; clearly it is difficult to measure efficacy if hip protectors are not worn by study participants but it may in fact represent effectiveness and reflect implementation and patient outcomes in practice. Second, the analyses include a variety of hip protectors but heterogeneity was not important in most analyses. On one hand, we could conclude that our results could apply to hip protectors in general. On the other hand, we could not perform subgroup analyses to determine if there were distinguishing features of hip protectors that would exert larger or smaller effects. We also cannot predict the effects of new technology. Third, the design, conduct, analysis and reporting, particularly of outcome measures, may have introduced bias.These issues are complex and difficult to disentangle. They are now well recognised by the research community and ways in which future research may reduce the risk of bias are described in a recent report (<LINK REF="REF-Cameron-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cameron 2010</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Acceptance and adherence (compliance)</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Kurrle-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kurrle 2004a</LINK> defined acceptance as "the percentage of potential users who initially agree to wear hip protectors" and adherence as "the wearing of hip protectors in accordance with the recommendations of the study protocol". In the context of an RCT analysed by intention to treat, poor adherence introduces 'compliance bias' by reducing the number of participants in the intervention group who actually receive the intervention. The definition from <LINK REF="REF-Kurrle-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kurrle 2004a</LINK> of adherence in the use of hip protectors has now been recommended by the International Hip Protector Research Group (<LINK REF="REF-Cameron-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cameron 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>A systematic review of the literature reporting on the acceptance of, and adherence to, the use of hip protectors (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Schoor-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Schoor 2002</LINK>) reported that acceptance ranged from 37% to 72% (median 68%) and adherence varied between 20% and 92% (median 56%), and that "the reasons most frequently mentioned for not wearing hip protectors, were: not being comfortable (too tight/poor fit); the extra effort (and time) needed to wear the device; urinary incontinence; and physical difficulties/illnesses". <LINK REF="REF-Cryer-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cryer 2008</LINK> reviewed the literature on adherence concluding that it remains unclear what person-level and environmental factors are positively or negatively associated with hip protector adherence. <LINK REF="STD-Bentzen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bentzen 2008</LINK> examined uptake and adherence with soft and hard-shelled hip protectors in a randomised trial in Norwegian nursing homes, finding that participants using soft protectors had only a slightly higher probability of continued use but were significantly more likely to be 24-hour users. Adherence from the RCTs in this review may be more representative of what may occur when implementing hip protectors in nursing care facilities rather than in community settings.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Heterogeneity of study populations</HEADING>
<P>Most analyses show no heterogeneity or heterogeneity that 'might be important'. However, we conducted subgroup analyses in community and institutional settings to explore whether the setting could have an impact. We found differences for hip fractures in that the absolute size of the effect is important in institutional settings but not in the community. For other outcomes, such as pelvic fractures, other fractures and falls, the effects were similar across settings (although there was heterogeneity that might be important between the <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Halloran-2004" TYPE="STUDY">O'Halloran 2004</LINK> study and the other studies). With respect to falls there was little to no effect of hip protectors on the risk of falling (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>), but there was considerable heterogeneity across studies (a post hoc analysis by setting did not reduce heterogeneity). In addition to this exploration of heterogeneity by setting, we saw a wide range of baseline risks (even within community and institutional settings) of the incidence per person year of hip fracture (with 95% CIs) (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>).</P>
<P>These observations raise the question of how future research might better identify participants at high risk of hip fracture in any setting. It has been reported that the risk of hip fracture in older people increases exponentially with age (<LINK REF="REF-Melton-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Melton 1993</LINK>), but it has been suggested (<LINK REF="REF-Couris-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Couris 2007</LINK>) that the exponential model may overestimate risk amongst people over 85 years of age. Two possible approaches to identify high risk patients use recent biomechanical and epidemiological research. The biomechanical approach (<LINK REF="REF-Bouxsein-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bouxsein 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Keaveny-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keaveny 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Riggs-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riggs 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2010</LINK>) focuses on the concept of a fracture threshold, measured as the ratio of the applied impact force to the bone strength. It might, if it were possible to simply measure bone strength in clinical practice, help to define better a population at highest risk. An epidemiological approach using fracture risk algorithms (<LINK REF="REF-Ensrud-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ensrud 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kanis-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanis 2009</LINK>) might be simpler in current clinical practice. The International Hip Protector Research Group recommends that in future, "Participants in clinical trials of hip protectors should be at high risk (annual incidence &gt; 3%) of proximal femoral fracture". Suggested indicators include a history of bone fragility fracture, low weight, functional impairment, increased fall risk and older age (<LINK REF="REF-Cameron-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cameron 2010</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-03-26 12:09:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite the contributions of large numbers of researchers, carers and participants over 20 years, we found the quality of evidence for most outcomes to be of moderate or low quality primarily due to risk of bias and imprecise results because of few fracture events. It could be argued that evidence for hip fractures in the community, and for pelvic fractures, could be assessed as higher quality since the incidence of events is very low and the confidence intervals narrow enough that additional research would not be required. However, the unexplained heterogeneity across studies for pelvic fractures (in particular due to the <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Halloran-2004" TYPE="STUDY">O'Halloran 2004</LINK> study) warrants additional research to determine the effects of hip protectors on pelvic fractures and the evidence was therefore assessed as low quality.</P>
<P>Our assessment of the risk of bias in the included studies is summarised in <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>. We updated the risk of bias tables in this review and, when possible to judge, we made most judgements as high or low risk of bias in lieu of using 'unclear'. Blinding of participants and of carers has usually not been possible, leaving open the possibility of performance bias and detection bias. The risk of selection bias is high in any cluster randomised trial where participants are recruited over time; their admission to a particular nursing home or ward may not have been a random event. Although cluster randomised studies appear to better reflect the real world of health care (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 2001</LINK>), greater care is needed, compared with individually randomised trials, in their design, conduct, analysis and reporting, particularly to avoid post-randomisation biases occurring.</P>
<P>While we felt confident that most studies provided robust hip fracture data, we assessed the falls data as at high risk of bias due to the lack of blinding of outcome assessors. The heterogeneity between studies in <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK> may represent selection bias, through failure of allocation concealment, or detection bias when recording falls. It may also reflect systematic differences in other aspects of care between individual nursing homes or wards, introducing co-intervention bias. For example, the particular attention paid to staff and participant education that was reported in <LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Van-Schoor-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Van Schoor 2003</LINK>, where provision of hip protectors was associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of falls, might have contributed to that finding.</P>
<P>Hip protector studies are difficult to design and conduct but these elements, and the analysis and reporting, could be improved considerably. Adherence by researchers to the recommendations of the International Hip Protector Research Group (<LINK REF="REF-Cameron-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cameron 2010</LINK>) should facilitate improvement in the future.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2014-03-26 12:09:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although we did not detect publication bias, it is possible none the less. We attempted to reduce bias in the review process to a minimum by searching a range of databases and not limiting the search by language. We also ensured that study identification and inclusion, data extraction and risk of bias assessment were carried out by two review authors working independently. We were not always successful in obtaining missing information from authors; this is not surprising given the passage of time since the earlier studies. In this update, at least two review authors reviewed the risk of bias tables that were previously published and updated the criteria (for example, selective outcome reporting) and reconsidered judgements made by past authors (in particular when unclear judgements were made).</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2014-03-31 10:54:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found three other systematic reviews addressing the effectiveness of hip protectors. Comparing these reviews with ours clearly points out some of the difficulties inherent in meta-analysis, particularly the choice of inclusion criteria, interpretation of reports of included studies, and the consequent need for careful appraisal of any systematic review.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Sawka-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sawka 2005</LINK> agreed with our analyses and conclusions on the ineffectiveness of hip protectors to reduce fractures in community-dwelling individuals. Although their inclusion criteria were somewhat stricter than ours, they also concluded that hip protectors were effective in older people in an institutional setting. Their review included <LINK REF="STD-Van-Schoor-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Van Schoor 2003</LINK> in the community-dwelling analysis. We were puzzled by this as in <LINK REF="STD-Van-Schoor-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Van Schoor 2003</LINK> the investigators themselves indicated that the study was conducted in a population in institutional care. Dr Van Schoor has confirmed that of the 561 residents, 38 lived in apartment houses for the elderly, 247 in homes for the elderly and 276 in nursing homes (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Schoor-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Schoor 2005</LINK>). Admission to either of the two latter categories is based on the need for extra care. We therefore feel justified in including <LINK REF="STD-Van-Schoor-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Van Schoor 2003</LINK> in the institutional analysis.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Sawka-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sawka 2007a</LINK> conducted a Bayesian meta-analysis of the data from four trials (1922 participants) exclusively recruited from nursing homes (<LINK REF="STD-Ekman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ekman 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harada-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Harada 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jantti-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Jantti 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2003</LINK>), of which the first three were cluster randomised. They reported that the pooled odds ratio (OR) of an elderly nursing home resident sustaining one or more hip fractures with hip protector allocation was 0.40 (95% CI 0.25 to 0.61), concluding that hip protectors decrease the risk of hip fracture in elderly nursing home residents. Their model was robust in multiple sensitivity analyses assuming alternative intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) values. We conducted a sensitivity analysis of our data by including only these four studies (using ICC of 0.02) and our findings (analysis not shown) are similar (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.72). However, their inclusion criteria excluded a number of studies that were available to them and which we believe should be included in a comprehensive review of evidence.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Oliver-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oliver 2007</LINK> reported a meta-analysis of nine studies "for hip protectors as a single intervention in care homes (no hospital studies were identified)". Eight of these (<LINK REF="STD-Cameron-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Cameron 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ekman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ekman 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jantti-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Jantti 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kannus-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kannus 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lauritzen-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lauritzen 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Halloran-2004" TYPE="STUDY">O'Halloran 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Schoor-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Van Schoor 2003</LINK>) were included in this review, and one (<LINK REF="STD-Woo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Woo 2003</LINK>) was excluded. Their results for hip fractures were sensitive to the magnitude of the ICC which they used; use of values of 0.026 and lower gave significant results. They reported a rate ratio of 0.67 (95% CI 0.46 to 0.98) for hip fractures. Our calculated rate ratio when including only the same eight studies was 0.76 (95% CI 0.62 to 0.94).</P>

<UL>
<LI>Better understanding is needed of the personal and design factors that may influence acceptance and adherence.</LI>
<LI>Future studies should have realistic calculations of study power and take into account the likely incidence of hip fractures within the sampling frame, and the probable rates of acceptance and adherence or compliance with wearing protectors in the treatment group. Sample size calculations should allow for clustering in trials of that design. The research community should also address biases when measuring outcomes and adopt the recommendations of the International Hip Protector Research Group (<LINK REF="REF-Cameron-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cameron 2010</LINK>).</LI>

<P>The original protocol included mortality as a secondary outcome. This has been removed. Successive revisions of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> and Review Manager Software (RevMan) have introduced changes to the format, and have replaced assessment of methodological quality of included studies with assessment of risk of bias; which has been augmented in this version to include additional domains and criteria including the assessment of selective outcome reporting. GRADE assessment of the results of the review has also been conducted. A 'Summary of findings' table is newly included; this is based on the primary and important outcomes identified in earlier versions of the review. These revisions have also allowed use of rate ratios, where appropriate, for outcomes in which participants may experience more than one event during follow-up (other fractures and falls). Economic evaluations of the use of hip protectors were not included in the original protocol.</P>

The relative risk for hip fracture was 0.18 (0.04 to 0.79), relative risk reduction 82% (2 versus 13 cases). The study is described incorrectly as a randomised controlled trial in Current Controlled Trials (ISRCTN81342808).</P>

<P>Allocation of clusters " was performed at the President Urho Kaleva Kekkonen Institute for Health Promotion Research by an independent physician with the use of sealed envelopes".</P>
<P>Initial identification of "at risk" individuals in each participating study centre was completed prior to assignment of the cluster. However, consent to participate was not obtained until after randomisation of the clusters, and the proportions of "at risk individuals" who did not agree to participate in the study were 204 of 650 (31%) in the intervention group, but only 94 of 1075 (9%) in the control group. Selection bias may thus have occurred.</P>
<P>Nor can it be ruled out in the later stages of the recruitment "the study positions of subjects who dropped out were to be refilled, whenever possible, by new eligible subjects from a waiting list". To replace the dropouts, eligible adults were recruited from the waiting list over the study period (207 in the protector group and 167 in the control group. This may have caused selection bias.</P>
<P>Table 1 of <LINK REF="STD-Kannus-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kannus 2000</LINK> shows that the process of sequence generation and allocation did not result in equivalence of risk factors in the intervention and control groups. However, if any bias was introduced in this replacement phase, it is unlikely to have exaggerated the efficacy of hip protectors. Although the participants in the protector group were on average one year younger (81 versus 82 years, P = 0.006), they had lower weight (63.1 kg versus 65.5 kg, P &lt; 0.001), lower body mass index (24.3 versus 25.1, P &lt; 0.001), and were more likely to have dementia (33% versus 26%, P = 0.001), more likely to have a previous stroke, bleeding, or related central nervous system condition (21% versus 15%, P = 0.002), more likely to have impaired mental status (P &lt; 0.001) and more likely to have a history of previous falls (P &lt; 0.001).</P>

</P>
<P>Suggest that the results from <LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2003</LINK> not be combined with other cluster randomised trials in the exploratory analysis as the other trials investigated only one component (provision of hip protectors) compared with no treatment, whereas <LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2003</LINK> investigated the effects of an intervention programme comprising education and the provision of hip protectors compared to optimised usual care.</P>
<P>Furthermore, we still want to emphasize that we did not report a compliance rate of 34%. The true compliance rate is not known, as it was not a topic of our investigation. The given figure is based on a worst case scenario estimate as explained in our letter to the BMJ. Therefore, we would like to suggest to use compliance rate during fall events as investigated and reported in our publication.</P>
</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2014-03-25 13:22:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We thank Dr Meyer and Professor Mulhauser for their comments. We have changed the text as requested and now report the compliance rate during fall events. The figure of 34% previously reported was taken from Table 04 in <LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2003</LINK>.</P>
<P>We believe that some degree of educational component to encourage compliance is a feature of many if not all trials in which hip protectors are provided. Were our review comparing a strong educational component with a weak educational component in improving compliance, Dr Meyer's study would be included in the strong educational component group. However, we are actually interested in the evidence overall for the effectiveness of provision of hip protectors to older people. In that context we find Dr Meyer's study to be well conducted and reported and entirely worthy of inclusion in our analysis.</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY MODIFIED="2011-09-23 12:58:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>We have carefully read the updated version of the Cochrane review on "Hip protectors for preventing hip fractures in older people". We do not agree with some issues of the critical appraisal of our study (Meyer et al, BMJ 2003;326:76-8).</P>
<P>Allocation concealment has been judged as unclear. We refer the Cochrane reviewers to our article where the flow through the trial (Figure 1) outlines that residents were selected prior to random allocation of clusters. Cluster randomisation took place at the start of the study. Residents were not replaced during follow up (see discussion section of the article). Thus, the quality criterion has been fulfilled according to the reviewer&#8217;s definition.</P>
<P>Concerning the quality criterion &#8220;incomplete outcome data addressed&#8221;, we do not agree to judge nursing home residents who deceased during 18-month follow-up as losses to follow-up. The difference between the study groups in mean follow-up as a result of the different proportion of residents with early study termination was not statistically significant. We refer the reviewers to our Letter to the Editor (Meyer et al, BMJ 2003;326:930) where this issue has been explicitly discussed.</P>
<P>We kindly ask the reviewers to reconsider their quality assessment.</P>
<P>Some further concerns remain:</P>
<P>The hypothesis on the causal relationship between pelvic fractures and hip protectors is not clear. Why do the Cochrane reviewers investigate pelvic fractures as separate outcome? Which effect of the hip protector do they assume?</P>
<P>We wonder why blinding of outcome assessors towards falls has been defined as similarly relevant quality criterion as blinding of hip fractures. Falls are always secondary outcomes in hip protector trials, although &#8211; without doubt &#8211; important for study group comparison purposes.</P>
<P>It is unsatisfactory and decreases transparency of reporting that fall event rates and/or number of persons with at least one fall are not mentioned in the figures and only rate ratios are displayed. This is also the case with all other comparisons, except for the primary outcome hip fracture.</P>
</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2011-09-23 13:06:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>We thank Dr Meyer for her comments. The introduction of Risk of Bias assessment in Cochrane Reviews has been difficult for many reviewers, who are asked not only to make judgments on the basis of reports, but to provide text quotations to justify their assessments. In the presence of any doubt, Cochrane Review authors have sometimes preferred assignment of &#8216;Unclear risk&#8217; of bias, since in the absence of unequivocal evidence of low risk it avoids the risk of assigning &#8216;High risk&#8217; of bias in a study which seems overall to have been conducted with care and attention to detail.  And of course, &#8220;risk of bias&#8221; does not mean &#8220;evidence of bias&#8221;.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Allocation concealment</HEADING>
<P>Under &#8216;Participants and methods&#8217; in <LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2003</LINK>, we found &#8220;<I>A cluster was defined as a nursing home by itself or an independently working ward of a large nursing home. Recruitment took place from March to November 1999. In each cluster a study coordinator was nominated. The nursing staff selected 15 to 30 residents according to predefined inclusion criteria: &gt;70 years old, not bedridden, and living in the nursing home for more than three months&#8221;.</I>
</P>
<P>Although the flow chart (Figure 1 of <LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2003</LINK>) makes it clear that an initial group of 942 participants in 49 clusters in 42 nursing homes were recruited prior to randomisation of clusters, it would have been possible, after June 1999, for a &#8220;replacement&#8221; to have been found.  </P>
<P>Under &#8216;Discussion&#8217; we found <I>&#8220;To avoid violation of randomisation and selection bias we did not exclude participants who declined to use the hip protector. In contrast, Kannus et al excluded 31% of participants who were assigned to the hip protector group but who declined to participate after randomisation, and people who dropped out were replaced from a &#8220;waiting list".&#8221;</I>   </P>
<P>We were unable from the published text to be sure that replacement from amongst new admissions did not occur, and are happy to have Dr Meyer&#8217;s assurance that no residents were recruited after clusters were randomised. We have changed the assessment of risk of bias to &#8216;Low risk&#8217;.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Incomplete outcome data addressed</HEADING>
<P>The correspondence to which Dr Meyer refers had escaped our attention. The letter from Torgerson and Porthouse (BMJ 2003; 326:930-1) was, we think, fair comment based on the originally published data, but the response from Dr Meyer and colleagues provided hazard ratios which indicate that bias was indeed unlikely. We have added this correspondence to the references (<LINK REF="REF-Torgerson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Torgerson 2003</LINK>) and changed the risk of bias for that item to &#8216;Low risk&#8217;.  </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Causal relationship between pelvic fractures and hip protectors</HEADING>
<P>Some AO type B pelvic ring fractures are believed to be caused by lateral compression, and it is not inconceivable that they might occur in a fall from standing height onto the greater trochanter, and be mitigated by hip protectors. Nine of the studies included in the review reported pelvic fractures and so we included their data.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Blinding of fall assessors</HEADING>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2003</LINK>, attention is drawn to falls in an analysis which although secondary is relevant - <I>&#8220;After adjustment for the cluster randomisation the proportions of fallers who used a hip protector were 68% and 15% respectively (mean difference 53%, 38% to 67%, P = 0.0001).</I>&#8221;</P>
<P>Risk of ascertainment bias may differ between falling and fracture outcomes, particularly in studies conducted in the community. For fractures, the standard for low risk of bias is radiological confirmation. In studies conducted in institutional situations, as in <LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2003</LINK>, reporting of falls is likely to have been by staff aware of group allocation, and risk of bias is certainly possible. We note once more that &#8220;risk of bias&#8221; does not mean &#8220;evidence of bias&#8221;.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Rate ratios but not raw data for event rates in Generic Inverse Variance (GIV) Analyses </HEADING>
<P>In our review the raw data for hip fractures in institutional studies are provided in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>. Interestingly, Dr Meyer refers to fall event rates in particular despite their being, as she puts it, &#8220;always secondary outcomes in hip protector studies&#8221;. Where data on falls have been analysed by GIV, we used the information reported in each individual included study. If Dr Meyer can provide us with the confidence intervals of the cluster-adjusted hazard ratio mentioned in her reply to the letter of Torgerson and Porthouse (<LINK REF="REF-Torgerson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Torgerson 2003</LINK>), we can ensure that our analysis correctly reflects hers in the next update of this review. </P>
