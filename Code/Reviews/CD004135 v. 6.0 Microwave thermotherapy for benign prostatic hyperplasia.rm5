<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-07-25 14:32:44 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Benign prostatic hyperplasia may lead to troublesome urinary symptoms, particularly in older men. Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) has been considered the definitive treatment for BPH. However, TURP is associated with complications. Therefore, less invasive techniques have been developed. These include microwave thermotherapy, which applies energy (heat) to shrink enlarged prostatic tissue. We found microwave thermotherapy to be a relatively safe and effective treatment option. Microwave thermotherapy can be performed as an outpatient procedure and has fewer and less severe side effects than TURP. However, TURP produced greater improvements in urinary symptoms and urine flow and fewer men required retreatment. Further studies are needed to determine the long-term outcomes of microwave thermotherapy and to identify the most effective microwave thermotherapy devices and energy settings.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) has been the gold-standard treatment for alleviating urinary symptoms and improving urinary flow in men with symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). However, the morbidity of TURP approaches 20%, and less invasive techniques have been developed for treating BPH. Preliminary data suggest that microwave thermotherapy, which delivers microwave energy to produce coagulation necrosis in prostatic tissue, is a safe, effective treatment for BPH.</P>

<P>All randomized controlled trials evaluating transurethral microwave thermotherapy (TUMT) for men with symptomatic BPH were eligible for this review.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-07-25 14:32:29 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this update, we identified no new randomized comparisons of TUMT that provided evaluable effectiveness data. Fifteen studies involving 1585 patients met the inclusion criteria, including six comparisons of microwave thermotherapy with TURP, eight comparisons with sham thermotherapy procedures, and one comparison with an alpha-blocker. Study durations ranged from 3 to 60 months. The mean age of participants was 66.8 years and the baseline symptom scores and urinary flow rates, which did not differ across treatment groups, demonstrated moderately severe lower urinary tract symptoms. The pooled mean urinary symptom scores decreased by 65% with TUMT and by 77% with TURP. The weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) was -1.00 (95% CI -2.03 to -0.03), favoring TURP. The pooled mean peak urinary flow increased by 70% with TUMT and by 119% with TURP. The WMD for peak urinary flow was 5.08 mL/s (95% CI 3.88 to 6.28 mL/s), favoring TURP. Compared to TURP, TUMT was associated with decreased risks for retrograde ejaculation, treatment for strictures, hematuria, blood transfusions, and the transurethral resection syndrome, but increased risks for dysuria, urinary retention, and retreatment for BPH symptoms. Microwave thermotherapy improved IPSS symptom scores (WMD -5.15, 95% CI -4.26 to -6.04) and peak urinary flow (WMD 2.01 mL/s, 95% CI 0.85 to 3.16) compared with sham procedures. Microwave thermotherapy also improved IPSS symptom scores (WMD -4.20, 95% CI -3.15 to -5.25) and peak urinary flow (WMD 2.30 mL/s, 95% CI 1.47 to 3.13) in the one comparison with alpha-blockers. No studies evaluated the effects of symptom duration, patient characteristics, prostate-specific antigen levels, or prostate volume on treatment response.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-07-25 14:32:33 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Microwave thermotherapy techniques are effective alternatives to TURP and alpha-blockers for treating symptomatic BPH in men with no history of urinary retention or previous prostate procedures and prostate volumes between 30 to 100 mL. However, TURP provided greater symptom score and urinary flow improvements and reduced the need for subsequent BPH treatments compared to TUMT. Small sample sizes and differences in study design limit comparisons between devices with different designs and energy levels. The effects of symptom duration, patient characteristics, or prostate volume on treatment response are unknown.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-07-25 14:33:52 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a common condition in older men who can result in bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). The histological changes of hyperplasia are found in over half of 60-year-old men and nearly 90% of 85-year-old men (<LINK REF="REF-McConnell-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">McConnell 1994</LINK>). Over 30% of men 65 years and older have irritative (urgency, frequency, nocturia) and/or obstructive (weak stream, hesitancy, intermittency, and incomplete emptying)urinary symptoms attributed to BPH (<LINK REF="REF-Chapple-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chapple 2001</LINK>). In 2000, LUTS accounted for nearly 8 million physician visits in the United States with nonpharmacologic BPH treatment costs estimated to be USD 1.1 billion (<LINK REF="REF-Wei-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wei 2004</LINK>). Nearly 90,000 prostatectomies were performed for BPH that year (<LINK REF="REF-Wei-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wei 2004</LINK>), and an estimated one in four men will have undergone treatment to relieve BPH symptoms by age 80 (<LINK REF="REF-Barry-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barry 1990</LINK>). Medicare data from 2005 documented the performance of 127,786 BPH procedures (<LINK REF="REF-Yu-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yu 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>For many years the transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) has been the definitive treatment for BPH. Although TURP has been proven to reduce symptoms of BPH and increase urinary flow compared with watchful waiting (<LINK REF="REF-Wasson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wasson 1995</LINK>), the procedure has some limitations. The perioperative and postoperative (early and late) morbidity of TURP exceeds 20%, including blood loss requiring transfusion, infections, strictures, sexual dysfunction, urinary incontinence, urinary retention, and the development of the transurethral resection syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Borboroglu-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borboroglu 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mebust-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mebust 1989</LINK>). Transurethral resection syndrome is a dilutional hyponatremia caused by absorbing large volumes of irrigation fluid during the procedure. Presentation of this potentially lethal condition includes nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, confusion, seizures, and coma. However, over time, the risk for transfusion has decreased from 2.5% to 0.4% and the risk of the transurethral resection syndrome has decreased from 2% to 0.8%. About 10% of patients undergoing TURP will still have persistent bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms by three years after surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Wasson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wasson 1995</LINK>), and reoperation rates are about 1% to 2% annually (<LINK REF="REF-Roos-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roos 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wasson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wasson 1995</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-07-25 14:36:37 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="James Tacklind">
<P>In recent years the number of men undergoing TURP has steadily declined due to increasing utilization of pharmacologic treatments (alpha-blockers and 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors) and of minimally invasive surgical techniques, such as transurethral needle ablation, laser coagulation and vaporization techniques, and microwave thermotherapy (Yu 2008). Microwave techniques vary by the degree of prostatic heating and include hyperthermia (heating prostate tissue to 42 ºC to 44 ºC), thermotherapy (45 ºC to 60 ºC), and thermoablation (60 ºC to 75 ºC). Preliminary data suggest that microwave prostatectomies are effective and safe treatments for BPH (<LINK REF="REF-Walmsley-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walmsley 2004</LINK>). Transurethral thermotherapy has become the preferred microwave technique because treatment can be provided in a single session (<LINK REF="REF-Jepsen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jepsen 1998</LINK>). Transurethral thermotherapy techniques have evolved over the past decade. Initial systems worked at lower energy or heat settings and treatment would take around an hour with minimal discomfort; however, results were disappointing. Subsequent systems incorporated catheters that provided urethral cooling thus allowing higher energy delivery. These advancements reduced the procedure time to around 30 minutes and improved outcomes. However, the higher energy leads to greater discomfort during the procedure, where patients often require sedation and analgesia, and continued risk for urinary retention (<LINK REF="REF-EAU-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">EAU 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walmsley-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walmsley 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Compared to TURP, transurethral thermotherapy procedures have fewer major complications and can be performed on an outpatient basis (<LINK REF="REF-Walmsley-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walmsley 2004</LINK>). However, direct comparisons of TUMT with TURP and with other minimally invasive procedures are limited, the effect of using different microwave thermotherapy systems has not been systematically evaluated, and few long-term follow-up data are available. We conducted and updated a systematic review, first published in 2008, to search for and combine all evidence from randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of microwave thermotherapy in treating men with symptomatic BPH.</P>

<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2012-07-25 14:37:02 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="James Tacklind">
<P>The primary outcome was the efficacy of microwave thermotherapy in improving urinary tract symptoms based on changes in urologic symptom scale scores (American Urological Association (AUA) Symptom Index, International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), Madsen-Iversen, Boyarsky). Secondary outcomes included mean and peak urinary flow, post-void residual, prostate volume, and quality of life. Measures of mortality and morbidity included perioperative death, bleeding requiring transfusion, urinary tract infections, epididymitis or orchitis, dysuria, clot retention, urinary retention, erectile dysfunction, retrograde ejaculation, urethral and bladder neck strictures, urinary incontinence, transurethral resection syndrome, and the need for retreatment either surgical or pharmacologic. Hospital length-of-stay and catheter duration were also evaluated. Baseline covariates included age, race or ethnicity, prostate size, residual volume, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels.</P>

Three studies (two reports on <LINK REF="STD-Wagrell-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Wagrell 2002</LINK>) provided long-term follow-up beyond one year, but results from these reports were not systematically evaluated due to poor follow-up rates and different control groups (<LINK REF="STD-Djavan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Djavan 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mattiasson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mattiasson 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wagrell-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wagrell 2004</LINK>).</P>

<P>Two studies (comparisons of TUMT with sham controls) met criteria for adequate treatment allocation concealment (central randomization by telephone, opaque envelopes, on-site computer, etc.) (<LINK REF="STD-Blute-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Blute 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nawrocki-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Nawrocki 1997</LINK>). None of the TUMT versus TURP or alpha-blocker trials blinded patients or providers; two studies indicated that outcomes assessors were blinded (<LINK REF="STD-Abbou-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Abbou 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wagrell-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wagrell 2004</LINK>). However, all studies of TUMT versus sham controls blinded patients and outcomes assessors. Participants randomized to sham procedures underwent insertion of a treatment catheter under local anesthesia and then a simulated treatment program, which could have included circulating coolant and a displayed treatment profile but without the application of microwave energy. Although information was not consistently reported, three studies explicitly described administering prophylactic oral antibiotics to all participants (<LINK REF="STD-Blute-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Blute 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Larson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Larson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roehrborn-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Roehrborn 1998</LINK>) and three studies reported administering periprocedural oral or parenteral, or both, analgesics (<LINK REF="STD-Albala-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Albala 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Blute-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Blute 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roehrborn-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Roehrborn 1998</LINK>) or sedation (<LINK REF="STD-Roehrborn-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Roehrborn 1998</LINK>). However, parental medications were used infrequently and less often in sham participants. A number of studies evaluated whether blinding was effective. Immediately after undergoing a procedure, Nawrocki et al (<LINK REF="STD-Nawrocki-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Nawrocki 1997</LINK>) reported that 63% of all participants were uncertain whether they underwent TUMT and Ogden et al reported that over 90% of all participants thought that they had undergone TUMT (<LINK REF="STD-Ogden-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ogden 1993</LINK>).

<P>All studies provided information on study inclusion and exclusion criteria. Almost all studies reported excluding patients in urinary retention (variably defined by a post-void residual ranging from 250 mL to 300 mL, catheterization requirement, or history of being unable to void). Most studies also excluded men with prostatic urethral lengths less than 25 mm, prostate volumes less than 30 mL or greater than 100 mL, prominent median lobes, prostate cancer, or history of prostate surgery. Follow-up duration for TURP studies ranged from six months to three years. One sham-controlled study provided one-year follow-up data (<LINK REF="STD-Abbou-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Abbou 1995</LINK>), three provided six-month follow-up data (<LINK REF="STD-Larson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Larson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nawrocki-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Nawrocki 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roehrborn-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Roehrborn 1998</LINK>), and four sham-control studies provided three-month follow-up data, at which time participants were unblinded and followed out to one year (<LINK REF="STD-Albala-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Albala 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bdesha-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Bdesha 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Blute-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Blute 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Wildt-1996" TYPE="STUDY">De Wildt 1996</LINK>).

<P>Overall, 540 participants were randomized in the six trials, including 322 to TUMT and 218 to TURP. Studies in general enrolled men aged 45 years and older with symptom scores above 7, peak urinary flow less than 15 mL/s, and prostate gland volumes between 30 mL and 100 mL. The pooled mean values with the corresponding range of individual mean study values were the following: age, 67.8 years (65 to 70 years); baseline symptom score, 19.5 (15.7 to 21.3); baseline peak urinary flow, 8.6 mL/s (7.9 to 10.1 mL/s); PSA level, 3.2 ng/mL (2.9 to 3.4 ng/mL); and prostate volume, 44.5 mL (33.9 to 52.7). These values did not differ by treatment group.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Clinical outcomes</HEADING>
<P>High-energy TUMT systems (Prostatron with Prostasoft 2.5 software, ProstaLund Feedback Treatment) were used in five studies; the sixth study used the Prostatron device with Prostasoft 2.0 software (<LINK REF="STD-Dahlstrand-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Dahlstrand 1995</LINK>). TUMT was routinely performed as an outpatient procedure while TURP was an inpatient procedure with a median hospital length-of-stay of five days. Catheter duration was consistently longer following TUMT, though usually protocol driven, ranging from 7 to 15 days compared to 2 to 4 days following TURP. Five studies found significant decreases in urinary symptoms and significant increases in peak urinary flow between baseline and follow-up for both TURP and TUMT. Ahmed and colleagues found that TUMT did not improve peak urinary flow (<LINK REF="STD-Ahmed-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ahmed 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>TUMT was less effective than TURP in reducing lower urinary tract symptoms. The pooled mean symptom score for men undergoing TUMT decreased 65% in 12 months (19.4 to 6.7) versus 77% (19.6 to 4.5) in the men undergoing TURP. The WMD for the four studies reporting IPSS at follow-up was -1.00 points (95% CI -2.03 to 0.03), favoring TURP. Three studies used the Madsen-Iversen symptom score and the WMD for symptom score at follow-up was -1.59 points (95% CI -2.48 to -0.69), favoring TURP. Except for one TUMT treatment group (<LINK REF="STD-Ahmed-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ahmed 1997</LINK>), both procedures consistently reduced mean urinary symptom scores from moderate and severe ranges to the mildly symptomatic range. In secondary outcomes, two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ahmed-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ahmed 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dahlstrand-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Dahlstrand 1995</LINK>) also reported the proportion of participants whose symptom scores improved by &gt; 50% following treatment. Overall, 72% of TUMT participants achieved this level of improvement compared to 98% of TURP participants, RR of 0.74 (95% CI 0.50 to 1.09).</P>
<P>TURP led to greater improvement in peak urinary flow than TUMT. The pooled mean peak urinary flow for men undergoing TUMT increased 70% (from 7.9 mL/s to 13.5 mL/s) versus 119% (from 8.6 mL/s to 18.7 mL/s) in men undergoing TURP. The WMD for peak urinary flow at follow-up was 5.08 mL/s (95% CI 3.88 to 6.28), favoring TURP. Only two studies reported a mean peak urinary flow following TUMT that exceeded 15 mL/s compared to five studies that reported a mean peak urinary flow exceeding 15 mL/s following TURP. The five studies using Prostatron systems found that TURP consistently improved peak urinary flow compared to TUMT, by 2.20 mL/s to 7.40 mL/s. The one CoreTherm device study (<LINK REF="STD-Wagrell-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wagrell 2004</LINK>) found that TURP was not significantly better than TUMT (WMD 1.90 mL/s, 95% CI -1.17 to 4.97).</P>
<P>We were not able to statistically detect any treatment differences between low-energy and high-energy systems or between treatment devices for improving urinary symptom scores or peak urinary flow. We found substantial overlap between the pooled point estimates and 95% confidence intervals when comparing low- and high-energy systems with TURP. Although one study using both low-energy (Prostasoft 2.0) and high-energy (Prostasoft 2.5) systems found greater improvement in symptom scores (mean difference 2.4) and peak urinary flow (mean flow increase 3.1 mL/s) with the high-energy system, the differences were not statistically significant (<LINK REF="STD-Norby-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Norby 2002a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two studies reported long-term follow-up data. Overall, only 71% of participants enrolled by Wagrell and colleagues were available for follow-up at 36 months (76% TURP, 69% TUMT) (<LINK REF="STD-Wagrell-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wagrell 2004</LINK>). The mean IPSS symptom score was significantly lower among TURP participants compared to TUMT participants (5.0 versus 8.2, P = 0.02). Mean peak urinary flow rates were similar for TURP (13.5 mL/s) and TUMT (11.9 mL/s) participants (P = 0.58). Sixty-six per cent of these participants completed 60 months of follow-up (Mattiasson 2007). Symptom scores (6.0 versus 7.4) and peak urinary flows (13.6 mL/s versus 11.4 mL/s) still favored TURP, but differences were not significant. Less than half of the participants enrolled by Floratos and colleagues were available for follow-up at 36 months (<LINK REF="STD-Floratos-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Floratos 2001</LINK>). The mean IPSS scores were significantly lower following TURP (3 versus 12, P &lt; 0.01) and mean peak urinary flow rates were significantly higher following TURP (24.7 mL/s versus 11.9 mL/s, P &lt; 0.01).</P>
<P>Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Floratos-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Floratos 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Norby-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Norby 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wagrell-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Wagrell 2002</LINK>) evaluated the effect of treatment on quality of life (QOL) using the IPSS question, "If you were to spend the rest of your life with your urinary condition just the way it is now, how would you feel about that?: delighted (1 point), pleased (2 points), mostly satisfied (3 points), mixed (4 points), mostly dissatisfied (5 points), or unhappy (6 points)". The pooled mean QOL score (reported data were insufficient for estimating WMD) for men undergoing TUMT decreased 58.5% (4.1 to 1.7) versus 63.4% (4.1 to 1.2) in men undergoing TURP. QOL significantly improved following both TUMT and TURP and there were no significant differences between treatments.</P>
<P>In the four studies reporting this outcome, TUMT participants (7.54/100 person-years) were more likely than TURP participants (1.05/100 person-years) to require retreatment for BPH symptoms (P &lt; 0.001), relative hazard of 10.0 (95% CI 2.44 to 50). Most retreatments were surgical; only two studies reported whether medications were added and two studies failed to characterize the retreatment. In the five studies reporting this outcome, TURP participants (5.85/100 person-years) were more likely than TUMT participants (0.63/100 person-years) to require surgical treatment for strictures (meatal, urethral, or bladder neck) (P &lt;0.001), relative hazard of 9.76, (95% CI 2.22 to 42.96).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Adverse events</HEADING>
<P>Most studies did not comprehensively report perioperative and postoperative adverse events. Compared to participants undergoing TURP, significantly fewer TUMT participants required blood transfusion (RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.86; RD -0.11, 95% CI -0.21 to 0.02), or developed clinically important hematuria (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.85; RD -0.06, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.0) or the transurethral resection (TUR) syndrome (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.81; RD -0.05, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.0). However, more participants developed dysuria, urgency and urinary retention (defined as the prolonged postprocedure requirement for an indwelling catheter due to failing a voiding trial) following TUMT than TURP. Sexually active participants undergoing TUMT were significantly less likely to experience retrograde ejaculation (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.75; RD -0.34, 95% CI -0.55 to -0.13). Few studies provided any data on the duration of urinary retention and these could not be statistically compared because mean values were not reported. However, the range or median durations of urinary retention were consistently higher following TUMT (<LINK REF="STD-Ahmed-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ahmed 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dahlstrand-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Dahlstrand 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Norby-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Norby 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wagrell-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Wagrell 2002</LINK>).

All procedures were performed in an outpatient setting. Studies did not report on the duration of urinary catheterization. Participants treated with TUMT had a greater improvement in symptom scores than sham control participants, whether measured by the IPSS symptom score (WMD -5.15, 95% CI -4.26 to 6.04) or the Madsen symptom score (WMD -5.10, 95% CI -3.79 to -6.42). The pooled mean symptom score for men undergoing TUMT decreased 50% in 3 to 6 months (21.4 to 10.8) versus 41% (21.3 to 12.6) in the men undergoing sham treatment. Peak urinary flow rates increased slightly more following TUMT compared to sham treatment with a WMD of 2.015 mL/s (95% CI 0.85 to 3.16). The pooled mean peak urinary flow for men undergoing TUMT increased 43% (from 8.1 mL/s to 11.6 mL/s) versus 11% (from 8.7 mL/s to 9.7 mL/s) in men undergoing sham treatment.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-07-25 14:39:05 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our systematic review identified six randomized comparisons of transurethral microwave thermotherapy (TUMT) with TURP, eight comparisons with sham thermotherapy treatment, and one comparison with an oral alpha-blocker. We found that TUMT effectively reduced urinary symptoms attributable to BPH and improved peak urinary flow for 12 months following the procedure. Overall, TUMT reduced symptom scores by 65% and increased peak urinary flow by 70%. However, TUMT was less effective than TURP in improving urinary symptom scores and peak urinary flows. An advantage for TUMT, though, was that procedures were performed in the outpatient setting, while TURP patients were hospitalized for a median of five days. However, none of these studies were performed in the United States, where the standard of care is usually to discharge the patient within a day after surgery. Adverse events generally occurred less frequently following TUMT, including retreatment for strictures, transfusions, retrograde ejaculation, and the TUR syndrome. TUMT, though, was not compared with newer techniques such as bipolar TURP or laser ablation of the prostate that have lower complication rates than traditional TURP. Urinary retention and dysuria occurred more frequently following TUMT. Additionally, the BPH retreatment rate was significantly higher following TUMT than TURP. Study inclusion criteria (moderately severe symptoms (AUA/IPSS scores &gt; 7), peak urinary flow &lt; 15 mL/s, and age above 45 years) and exclusion criteria (very large prostates, large median lobes, urinary retention, prostate cancer, and previous prostate surgery) were similar to those used in other surgical studies of BPH treatment, suggesting that our results are generalizable.</P>
<P>TUMT consistently produced greater improvement in symptom score (5 points) and peak urinary flow (1.7 mL/s) than sham treatments. However, study follow-up durations for the sham comparison studies were limited, and patients may have become aware that they were randomized to active treatment based on receiving perioperative analgesics and sedatives, particularly parental medications, and prolonged catheterization. The one comparison of TUMT with an alpha-blocker showed improved symptom relief and peak urinary flow and less retreatment following TUMT. We did not find any randomized comparisons of TUMT with other minimally invasive or pharmacologic BPH treatments.</P>
<P>Although we limited our analyses to randomized controlled trials, the majority of the studies had important potential methodological flaws. Only two studies clearly had adequate concealment of randomization while six studies reported blinding outcomes assessors. Two of the studies comparing TUMT with TURP had only six months of follow-up data, though few participants were lost to follow-up. Even though several of these studies followed participants for at least two years, the attrition rate was substantial. Four of the studies comparing TUMT with sham procedures followed participants for only three months before offering active treatment to the sham group. We analyzed only the three-month TUMT versus sham intention-to-treat results. None of the studies provided data on the mean changes in symptom scores or peak urinary flow so that we could compare only follow-up values. These analyses, which are unable to adjust for baseline function, are less representative of an individual's experience. We were unable to detect any statistically significant outcome differences between high- or low-energy TUMT systems or between different devices. Bolmsjo and colleagues have reported substantial differences in heating profiles between devices with different microwave antenna designs (<LINK REF="REF-Bolmsjo-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bolmsjo 1996</LINK>). However, these authors considered the reported amount of microwave energy delivered by the TUMT equipment to be an unreliable measure of the microwave energy actually absorbed by the prostate.</P>
<P>Studies did not consistently report on or define perioperative adverse events, particularly dysuria, hematuria, and sexual dysfunction, and our estimates for these complications may be unreliable. Few studies evaluated QOL outcomes. Although studies usually reported the occurrence of urinary retention, they did not consistently or uniformly indicate its duration. One important complication that was not reported in the clinical trial literature was thermal injury. On October 11, 2000, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published a Public Health Notification because they had received 16 reports of severe thermal injury associated with TUMT, including 10 resulting in fistula formation and six resulting in tissue damage to the penis or urethra (<LINK REF="REF-FDA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 2000</LINK>). The FDA noted that the injuries could take hours or days to develop. Although the FDA recommended several corrective measures for physicians, they considered TUMT to be safe and effective based on performance of over 25,000 procedures.</P>
<P>Recent guidelines considered TUMT to be an appropriate alternative for treating men with lower urinary tract symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-AUA-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">AUA 2011;</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-CUA-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">CUA 2010</LINK>). The AUA recommended TUMT for men with moderate to severe symptoms, noting that TUMT is effective in partially relieving symptoms due to BPH, though evidence is insufficient to determine whether one device is superior to another. The Canadian guidelines considered TUMT an optional treatment for men with moderate symptoms, and small- to moderate-size prostate glands, who wish to avoid more invasive therapy. TUMT has become the most widely utilized procedure for minimally invasive surgical therapies among the Medicare population (<LINK REF="REF-Yu-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yu 2008</LINK>). Overall use increased from just 4874 procedures in 1999 to 28,969 (rate of 262 per 100,000 men) by 2005.</P>
<P>Our results may help guide patients and providers in weighing the short-term relative risks and benefits of TUMT versus TURP or an alpha-blocker. The best available clinical data suggested that TUMT was an effective BPH treatment, could be performed as an outpatient procedure, and had fewer adverse events than TURP. However, TURP produced greater improvements in symptom scores and peak urinary flow and fewer patients required retreatment for symptomatic BPH. Further research is needed to evaluate the long-term effectiveness and safety of TUMT and to determine which devices and energy settings are most effective.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-07-25 14:39:05 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="James Tacklind">
<P>Microwave thermotherapy techniques are effective alternatives to TURP and alpha-blockers for treating symptomatic BPH for men with no history of urinary retention or previous prostate procedures and prostate volumes between 30 to 100 mL. However, TURP provided greater symptom score and urinary flow improvements and reduced the need for subsequent BPH treatments compared to TUMT. Small sample sizes and differences in study design limit comparisons between devices with different designs and energy levels. The effects of symptom duration, patient characteristics, or prostate volume on treatment response are unknown. Patients and providers can use the information provided by this systematic review to weigh the relative risks and benefits of TUMT and TURP procedures. Although improvements in urinary symptoms and flow slightly favored TURP, TUMT procedures had fewer adverse events and were performed as outpatient procedures. The risk of retreatment for symptomatic BPH was higher following TUMT procedures. The one study comparing TUMT with an alpha-blocker found that TUMT was associated with better symptom relief and urinary flow and less retreatment.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-07-25 14:39:05 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Relatively few patients have been studied in controlled clinical trials of TUMT. Further studies, using randomized treatment allocation, larger sample sizes, and comprehensive measures of outcomes and adverse events, are still needed to better define the role of TUMT techniques for treating BPH.</P>
