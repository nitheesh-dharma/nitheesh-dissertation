<TITLE>Creatine for treating muscle disorders</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-04-30 11:51:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Jewitt">
<P>Hereditary muscle diseases usually lead to a progressive muscle weakness. Treatment is mainly symptomatic because curative therapies are lacking. Creatine, a popular nutritional supplement among athletes, improves muscle performance in healthy individuals. This is an update of our review evaluating creatine treatment in muscle disorders that was first published in 2007. At this update we identified no new studies but we had previously found 14 randomised controlled trials with 364 participants which met our defined selection criteria. The methodological quality of these studies was high, with only one exception. Analysis of pooled results showed a significant increase in muscle strength in muscular dystrophies and an improvement in activities of daily living in muscular dystrophies and inflammatory myopathies during creatine treatment compared to placebo. Significant adverse events occurred only in people with glycogen storage disease type V presenting as an increase in muscle pain episodes and impairment in activities of daily living.</P>

<P>Progressive muscle weakness is a main symptom of most hereditary and acquired muscle diseases. Creatine improves muscle performance in healthy individuals. This is an update of our 2007 Cochrane review that evaluated creatine treatment in muscle disorders. Previous updates were in 2009 and 2011.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-05-09 14:54:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Jewitt">
<P>On 11 September 2012, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL (2012, Issue 9 in <I>The Cochrane Library</I>), MEDLINE (January 1966 to September 2012) and EMBASE (January 1980 to September 2012) for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of creatine used to treat muscle diseases.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-05-09 14:54:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Jewitt">
<P>A total of 14 trials, including 364 randomised participants, met the selection criteria. The risk of bias was low in most studies. Only one trial had a high risk of selection, performance and detection bias. No new studies were identified at this update.</P>
<P>Meta-analysis of six trials in muscular dystrophies including 192 participants revealed a significant increase in muscle strength in the creatine group compared to placebo, with a mean difference of 8.47%; (95% confidence intervals (CI) 3.55 to 13.38). Pooled data of four trials including 115 participants showed that a significantly higher number of participants felt better during creatine treatment compared to placebo with a risk ratio of 4.51 (95% CI 2.33 to 8.74). One trial in 37 participants with idiopathic inflammatory myopathies also showed a significant improvement in functional performance. No trial reported any clinically relevant adverse event.</P>
<P>In metabolic myopathies, meta-analyses of three cross-over trials including 33 participants revealed no significant difference in muscle strength. One trial reported a significant deterioration of activities of daily living (mean difference 0.54 on a 1 to 10 scale; 95% CI 0.14 to 0.93) and an increase in muscle pain during high-dose creatine treatment in McArdle disease.<BR/>

</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-04-25 15:02:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Jewitt">
<P>High quality evidence from RCTs shows that short- and medium-term creatine treatment increases muscle strength in muscular dystrophies. There is also evidence that creatine improves functional performance in muscular dystrophy and idiopathic inflammatory myopathy. Creatine is well tolerated in these people. High quality but limited evidence from RCTs does not show significant improvement in muscle strength in metabolic myopathies. High-dose creatine treatment impaired activities of daily living and increased muscle pain in McArdle disease.<BR/>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-05-09 14:54:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Jewitt">
<P>Myopathies affect primarily skeletal muscle and can cause a wide variety of complaints including progressive muscle weakness and wasting, myalgias, early fatigue and painful muscle cramps. The main hereditary myopathies are classified into muscular dystrophies (for example, X-linked dystrophinopathies (Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy), facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), limb girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMD), congenital muscular dystrophies (CMD)), myotonic dystrophies (type 1 myotonic dystrophy or DM1 (Curschmann-Steinert disease) and type 2 myotonic dystrophy (DM2) or proximal myotonic myopathy (PROMM)), ion channel disorders (for example, periodic paralysis, congenital myotonias), metabolic myopathies (lipid and glycogen storage diseases, mitochondrial myopathies), congenital myopathies, distal myopathies and myofibrillar myopathies (MFM). Important progress has been made in the discovery of the molecular causes and pathogenesis of these hereditary myopathies. However, curative therapies such as gene or protein replacement, splice-modulation therapy, stem cell therapy or specific drug treatment are still not available or at the experimental stage with the exception of glycogenosis type II (Pompe disease) in which an enzyme replacement therapy have been available since 2006. Treatment is mainly symptom-oriented and includes regular physical therapy, aerobic exercise training, orthopaedic corrections, artificial ventilation in respiratory insufficiency and pharmacologic interventions, for example corticosteroids in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) are a heterogeneous group of acquired muscular disorders characterised by inflammation of the skeletal muscle not caused by a pathogen. The most common IIM of autoimmune origin are dermatomyositis (DM), polymyositis (PM) and sporadic inclusion body myositis (s-IBM). DM and PM are usually responsive to immunosuppressive therapy but side effects are frequent.<BR/>

<P>Creatine is a naturally occurring compound that is found in meat and fish in high concentration. It is produced endogenously in the liver and the kidneys (<LINK REF="REF-Guthmiller-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guthmiller 1994</LINK>). Creatine is transported freely in the blood and is mainly taken up into muscle, testes and brain (<LINK REF="REF-Guimbal-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guimbal 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wyss-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wyss 2000</LINK>). Creatine has a role in high energy phosphoryl group transfer during skeletal muscle contraction via the creatine kinase reaction. It also plays a role in transferring energy from the mitochondria to the cytosol in tissues with a high energy requirement such as brain and skeletal muscle (<LINK REF="REF-Wyss-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wyss 1992</LINK>). Finally, creatine may play a role in the regulation of muscle protein metabolism (<LINK REF="REF-Parise-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parise 2001</LINK>). Creatine has been proposed as a potential pharmacological treatment for several neuromuscular diseases.</P>
<P>In healthy humans, creatine monohydrate supplementation has been shown to result in an increase in muscle total creatine and phosphocreatine (PCr) concentration in skeletal muscle (<LINK REF="REF-Harris-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harris 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hultman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hultman 1996</LINK>) and brain (<LINK REF="REF-Dechent-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dechent 1999</LINK>). An increase in muscle creatine concentration in skeletal muscle is seen with a dose of about 0.3 g/kg/d for six days or 0.04 g/kg/d for 30 days (<LINK REF="REF-Hultman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hultman 1996</LINK>). The magnitude of the increase in skeletal muscle appears greatest in persons with low endogenous stores (<LINK REF="REF-Harris-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harris 1992</LINK>). Both prospective and retrospective studies in humans have not found evidence for long- or short-term significant side effects from creatine monohydrate supplementation taken in recommended doses (<LINK REF="REF-Mihic-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mihic 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Poortmans-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poortmans 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Poortmans-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poortmans 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Poortmans-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poortmans 2005</LINK>). The possibility of idiosyncratic reactions from creatine monohydrate must be considered but they are rare (<LINK REF="REF-Terjung-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Terjung 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>People with neuromuscular disorders can have lower skeletal muscle total creatine and PCr concentrations than control subjects (<LINK REF="REF-Matthews-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matthews 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Matthews-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matthews 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Park-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Park 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Park-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Park 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tarnopolsky-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tarnopolsky 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tarnopolsky-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tarnopolsky 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Banerjee-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Banerjee 2010</LINK>). This may be a function of lower creatine transporter content or an impairment of energy charge (a measure of the relative amounts of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and adenosine monophosphate (AMP) in the cell) in these groups (<LINK REF="REF-Tarnopolsky-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tarnopolsky 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tarnopolsky-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tarnopolsky 2001</LINK>). Therefore, the potential for creatine monohydrate supplementation to enhance performance may be greater in people who have reduced endogenous stores, such as those with neuromuscular disease. The dosing and magnitude of the response from creatine monohydrate supplementation in people with secondary defects in the creatine transporter has not been fully elucidated.</P>
<P>Creatine monohydrate supplementation has been shown to enhance force output in healthy volunteers by approximately 10% (<LINK REF="REF-Casey-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casey 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tarnopolsky-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tarnopolsky 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Terjung-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Terjung 2000</LINK>). Another reported consequence of creatine monohydrate supplementation is an increase in fat-free mass of about one kilogram (<LINK REF="REF-Harris-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harris 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hultman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hultman 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mihic-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mihic 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Safdar-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Safdar 2008</LINK>). This seems to be an effect of fluid retention in myocytes due to osmotic potential of high intracellular creatine abundance and an increased expression of genes and proteins related to muscle hypertrophy (<LINK REF="REF-Deldicque-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deldicque 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Safdar-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Safdar 2008</LINK>). In animal models of neurodegenerative disease, creatine monohydrate supplementation has been shown to increase brain energy charge, reduce oxidative stress and attenuate neuronal degeneration (<LINK REF="REF-Andreassen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andreassen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dedeoglu-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dedeoglu 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ferrante-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferrante 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hersch-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hersch 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klivenyi-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klivenyi 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klivenyi-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klivenyi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Malcon-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malcon 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Matthews-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matthews 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhu-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhu 2004</LINK>). Improved calcium handling resulting in lower intra-cellular calcium concentrations and enhanced cell survival have been shown in cultured dystrophin-deficient mdx cells, a mouse model of dystrophinopathy (<LINK REF="REF-Pulido-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pulido 1998</LINK>). Improvement in muscle function in mdx mice has also been noted following creatine supplementation (<LINK REF="REF-Passaquin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Passaquin 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>In theory, creatine monohydrate supplementation may benefit people with muscle disorders by non-specifically enhancing muscle force output (temporal energy buffering) or the accretion of fat-free mass, assuming this is muscle, or more directly by enhancing energy shuttling, reducing intra-cellular calcium accumulation and apoptosis (<LINK REF="REF-Sullivan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sullivan 2000</LINK>), preventing oxidative stress (primary and secondary effect), activating glycolysis and glycogenolysis, and attenuating cell death (<LINK REF="REF-Gualano-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gualano 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klivenyi-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klivenyi 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klivenyi-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klivenyi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Passaquin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Passaquin 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pulido-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pulido 1998</LINK>). Together, these considerations support the initiation of trials in people with myopathies that result in a reduction in energy charge.</P>
<P>The first prospective randomised study reporting the use of creatine monohydrate in a neurometabolic condition was published in 1997 (<LINK REF="STD-Tarnopolsky-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Tarnopolsky 1997</LINK>). This study reported an increase in high intensity power output of hand grip and dorsi-flexion, with no increase in endurance performance (<LINK REF="STD-Tarnopolsky-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Tarnopolsky 1997</LINK>). Based upon these results, the apparent safety and efficacy in enhancing power output in athletes (<LINK REF="REF-Casey-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casey 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Poortmans-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poortmans 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tarnopolsky-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tarnopolsky 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Terjung-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Terjung 2000</LINK>), and the theoretical benefits to people with muscle disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Klivenyi-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klivenyi 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Park-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Park 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Passaquin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Passaquin 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pulido-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pulido 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tarnopolsky-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tarnopolsky 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tarnopolsky-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tarnopolsky 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wyss-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wyss 1998</LINK>), several human trials were initiated. There was significant interest in the results of an open (N = 81 participants) and single blinded (N = 21) study that found an increase in high intensity power output with creatine monohydrate supplementation in a heterogenous group of people with neuromuscular disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Tarnopolsky-1999b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tarnopolsky 1999b</LINK>). Because this study was not randomised and the subgroups were not defined a priori this pilot study provided a catalyst for future studies.</P>
<P>This is an update of our systematic Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Kley-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kley 2007</LINK>) evaluating benefits of creatine treatment in muscle disorders. It was previously updated in 2008 and 2011 (<LINK REF="REF-Kley-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kley 2011</LINK>).</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2013-05-09 14:55:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Jewitt">
<P>We performed fixed-effect meta-analyses using the generic inverse variance (GIV) and inverse variance weighting facilities in Review Manager (RevMan, current version 5.2 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2012</LINK>)), the Cochrane statistical package. Results were expressed as mean differences (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). We analysed primary and secondary outcomes under consideration whenever the data allowed. Due to its long ordinal scale, we analysed Medical Research Council (MRC) sum scores as continuous data. We used P values described as &lt; 0.05 as 0.05 in calculation of standard errors. This is a conservative approach because derived standard errors are generally larger than those used by the authors in the analysis.</P>
<P>We did not scale the treatment effects and standard errors to a specified follow-up period because we have supposed a nearly constant treatment effect shortly after the beginning of creatine supplementation instead of a constant rate of change over time. This assumption relies on many studies in healthy people. For example, the maximum increase in muscle force seems to correlate with the achievement of the upper limit of intramuscular creatine concentration, which can be reached after a few days of creatine ingestion depending on its dosage (<LINK REF="REF-Persky-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Persky 2003</LINK>). However, most of these studies are short-term trials. Studies on the effects of prolonged creatine supplementation are rare and the results inconsistent.</P>
<P>For the primary outcome measure 'muscle strength measured by quantitative muscle testing', we calculated changes after treatment phases as percentage of baseline values to make measurements of different muscle groups comparable. In the case of cross-over trials, differences between creatine and placebo phases were converted into percentage of baseline values of the placebo phase. In the absence of baseline data we used the available values of the placebo phase. One trial reported only differences between treatment periods (<LINK REF="STD-Walter-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Walter 2002</LINK>). In this case, we decided to use the baseline data of <LINK REF="STD-Tarnopolsky-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Tarnopolsky 2004b</LINK> for participants affected by the same muscle disease, since the mean age of the participants and the muscle groups examined were similar. In the case of measurements of more than one muscle group, we accepted sum scores (<LINK REF="STD-Escolar-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Escolar 2005</LINK>) or chose a muscle group measured in other trials of the same muscle disorder. In case of bilateral measurements, we chose the right side (<LINK REF="STD-Schneider_x002d_Gold-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Schneider-Gold 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>For the secondary outcome measure 'Changes in activities of daily living (ADL) assessed by questionnaires or functional tests', participants' global assessment of improvement was converted into dichotomous data (improvement yes/no). We calculated mean differences (MD) and confidence intervals (CIs) of aggregate functional performance time (AFPT, trial of <LINK REF="STD-Chung-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chung 2007</LINK>) using t-tests.</P>
<P>For the secondary outcome measure 'muscle strength measured by manual muscle testing', we calculated percentage changes of MRC sum scores. We replaced missing change-from-baseline standard deviations in the trial from <LINK REF="STD-Tarnopolsky-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Tarnopolsky 2004b</LINK> by standard deviations from <LINK REF="STD-Walter-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Walter 2002</LINK> (see above for explanation). On the same grounds, we used correlation coefficients derived from data of the trial from <LINK REF="STD-Escolar-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Escolar 2005</LINK> for imputing change-from-baseline standard deviations for the trial from <LINK REF="STD-Tarnopolsky-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Tarnopolsky 2004a</LINK>.</P>
<P>Where meta-analysis was possible for a disease intervention, we constructed a 'Summary of findings' table for each appropriate group of diseases. The pre-defined outcomes were our primary outcome, change in muscle strength measured by quantitative muscle testing, the changes in activities of daily living (ADL) assessed by questionnaires or functional tests, the patient global assessment, and adverse events.</P>

</P>
<P>In the searches for this update there were 900 references from MEDLINE, 794 from EMBASE, 177 from CENTRAL and 86 from the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Register. We identified no new trials for inclusion from these most recent searches. Our searches of trials registries revealed records for 204 trials in ClinicalTrials.gov and for 71 trials in ICTRP. We detected one ongoing creatine trial in juvenile dermatomyositis (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_ONGOING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of ongoing studies</LINK>) that may be included in a future update of this review.</P>
<P>Our previous and recent searches revealed a total of 28 papers that were selected for closer scrutiny. We identified 15 RCTs that met the inclusion criteria for this review. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Sejersen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sejersen 2000</LINK>) was only published in abstract form and we could not obtain full details; we therefore excluded it (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>). The remaining 14 trials fulfilling the selection criteria included a total number of 364 randomised participants. One three-arm trial compared creatine and glutamine treatment with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Escolar-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Escolar 2005</LINK>). The other 13 trials compared creatine treatment with placebo. A total of 277 participants received creatine and 275 participants received placebo due to the fact that 10 of the 14 trials used a cross-over design. The duration of supplementation periods lasted between three weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Tarnopolsky-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Tarnopolsky 1997</LINK>) and six months (<LINK REF="STD-Escolar-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Escolar 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chung-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chung 2007</LINK>). The doses of creatine varied from 3 to 20 g daily.</P>
<P>Four trials examined the effect of creatine in people with dystrophinopathies (<LINK REF="STD-Banerjee-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Banerjee 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Escolar-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Escolar 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Louis-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Louis 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tarnopolsky-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Tarnopolsky 2004a</LINK>). One RCT compared creatine with placebo in various types of muscular dystrophies (<LINK REF="STD-Walter-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Walter 2000</LINK>). Three trials studied the efficacy of creatine in myotonic dystrophies, two in people with type 1 myotonic dystrophy (<LINK REF="STD-Tarnopolsky-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Tarnopolsky 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walter-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Walter 2002</LINK>) and one in persons with type 2 myotonic dystrophy (<LINK REF="STD-Schneider_x002d_Gold-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Schneider-Gold 2003</LINK>). Three trials compared creatine with placebo in people with mitochondrial cytopathy (<LINK REF="STD-Klopstock-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Klopstock 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kornblum-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kornblum 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tarnopolsky-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Tarnopolsky 1997</LINK>) and two trials evaluated the effect of creatine in glycogen storage disease type V (McArdle disease) (<LINK REF="STD-Vorgerd-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Vorgerd 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vorgerd-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Vorgerd 2002</LINK>). One trial tested the hypothesis that creatine with exercise is more effective than exercise with placebo in people with polymyositis or dermatomyositis (<LINK REF="STD-Chung-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chung 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>We excluded 14 studies that did not fulfill the inclusion criteria (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>). Twelve of these studies were case reports or non-controlled trials. One controlled study was not randomised and one trial used a combination therapy (creatine, coenzyme Q10 and lipoic acid).</P>

<P>We based our 'Risk of bias' assessments on information described in the text and additional information obtained from study authors. We assessed sequence generation and allocation concealment as adequate in 13 of 14 trials. One study was only single-blinded (<LINK REF="STD-Banerjee-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Banerjee 2010</LINK>). In the other trials, participants and observers were blinded. Incomplete outcome data were adequately addressed. In one cross-over trial (<LINK REF="STD-Walter-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Walter 2000</LINK>), the washout period lasted only three weeks and carry-over effects were detected. Therefore, authors included only data from the group of participants who received placebo in the first and creatine in the second period in the final statistical evaluation. In the other nine cross-over trials, the washout period was sufficient except for two participants in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Klopstock-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Klopstock 2000</LINK>) who had a washout period of 24 and 26 days. We assessed the diagnostic criteria as adequate in all trials. In the majority of cases, diagnosis of hereditary muscle disease was confirmed by genetic analysis. Significant differences in baseline values between study groups were not detected.</P>

Overall, 138 participants received creatine and 139 placebo. The follow-up periods ranged from eight weeks to six months (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). Five trials measured the isometric maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) of various muscle groups (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Schneider_x002d_Gold-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Schneider-Gold 2003</LINK>) used a hand-held dynamometer to calculate a compound strength score of proximal arm and leg muscles as well as a grip balloon dynamometer to evaluate the maximum grip strength.</P>

<P>Two trials in participants with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (<LINK REF="STD-Escolar-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Escolar 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tarnopolsky-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Tarnopolsky 2004a</LINK>) and one trial in myotonic dystrophy type I (<LINK REF="STD-Tarnopolsky-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Tarnopolsky 2004b</LINK>) performed functional tests. In <LINK REF="STD-Escolar-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Escolar 2005</LINK>, there was a significant lesser deterioration of time to climb 4 stairs and of time to run 10 metres after six months of creatine treatment (14 participants) compared to placebo (14 participants) (mean difference of changes between groups: time to climb 4 stairs -3.4 s (95% CI -6.18 to -0.56), time to walk 10 metres -1.0 s (95% CI -1.60 to -0.34)). Moreover, post hoc analysis in boys younger than seven years (26 participants) revealed significant improved scores on time to stand from supine position in the creatine group when compared with placebo group. Differences in the trials by Tarnopolsky et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Tarnopolsky-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Tarnopolsky 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tarnopolsky-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Tarnopolsky 2004b</LINK>) were not significant.</P>

One trial in Duchenne muscular dystrophy reported that this statement considered changes in activity levels, falls and time needed for motor tasks (<LINK REF="STD-Banerjee-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Banerjee 2010</LINK>). Overall 91 participants received creatine and 92 placebo. Analysis of pooled data revealed that an improvement was reported significantly more frequently after creatine treatment compared to placebo, with a risk ratio (RR) of 4.51 (95% CI 2.33 to 8.74) (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). The result was also significant and similar when the single-blinded study with a higher risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Banerjee-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Banerjee 2010</LINK>) was not included (RR 4.71; 95% CI 2.22 to 10.00, 156 participants). Three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Schneider_x002d_Gold-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Schneider-Gold 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walter-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Walter 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walter-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Walter 2002</LINK>) used the Neuromuscular Symptom Score (NSS) (<LINK REF="REF-Soueidan-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soueidan 1993</LINK>) to assess the subjective impairment of participants in 14 activities of daily living (ADL) but analysis of pooled data did not show a significant change in NSS after creatine supplementation compared to placebo (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>).

In 20 people with type 2 myotonic dystrophy (<LINK REF="STD-Schneider_x002d_Gold-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Schneider-Gold 2003</LINK>), VAS revealed greater absolute but not percentage improvement in the creatine group compared to placebo (difference of 20.0 points (scale from 0 to 100), P &lt; 0.05). The trial by Tarnopolsky et al.

<P>Three trials measured the ratio of PCr to beta-ATP. <LINK REF="STD-Louis-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Louis 2003</LINK> examined six participants with dystrophinopathies. After creatine supplementation, the investigators observed an increase of PCr/beta-ATP ratio of about 8% whereas the ratio remained almost unchanged in the placebo group. The difference was described as not significant in the text but a P value of 0.04 was presented in a table (level of statistical significance was set at P &lt; 0.05). In a second trial in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (<LINK REF="STD-Banerjee-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Banerjee 2010</LINK>), differences between creatine and placebo group were not significant. In a cross-over trial in 34 participants with type 1 myotonic dystrophy, the PCr/beta-ATP ratios were not significantly different in the creatine and placebo periods (<LINK REF="STD-Tarnopolsky-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Tarnopolsky 2004b</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the study by Banerjee et al.

The treatment periods lasted five (<LINK REF="STD-Vorgerd-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Vorgerd 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vorgerd-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Vorgerd 2002</LINK>) and six weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Kornblum-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kornblum 2005</LINK>). Analysis of pooled data showed no significant increase in PCr/beta-ATP ratio after creatine treatment as compared to placebo (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>).</P>
<P>All three studies used the same standardised calf muscle ergometric test to assess the effects of treatment on skeletal muscle bioenergetics. In the first study by Vorgerd et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Vorgerd-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Vorgerd 2000</LINK>), the PCr depletion increased during aerobic and ischaemic exercise. Moreover they reported an increase in accumulation of inorganic phosphate during ischaemic exercise. However, the force-time integral during Ischaemic exercise was significantly higher with creatine. In the other two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Kornblum-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kornblum 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vorgerd-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Vorgerd 2002</LINK>), there were neither significant changes in PCr consumption nor in increases in Pi and ADP values during aerobic and ischaemic exercise. Meta-analysis demonstrated a reduction of ATP consumption during aerobic exercise in the creatine phase as compared to placebo with a MD of -1.75 %PCr<SUB>i</SUB> (95% CI -2.98 to -0.51) (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>). This indicates a higher resynthesis of ATP by phosphoryl group transfer from PCr to ADP via creatine kinase reaction. This might be interpreted as a favourable increase in exercise tolerance. Changes in ATP consumption during ischaemic exercise did not reach statistical significance (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>). Moreover meta-analysis revealed no significant improvement in time constants (tau) for oxidative PCr recovery from aerobic (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>) and ischaemic (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>) exercise.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-05-09 14:57:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Jewitt">
<P>The data analysis reveals that there is high quality evidence that short- to intermediate-term supplementation with creatine monohydrate in people with muscular dystrophy resulted in a modest, but significant, increase in maximal isometric force of approximately 8.5% using quantitative muscle testing, with a less robust improvement noted using MRC manual muscle testing scores (1.1%) (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). These findings were associated with a significant increase in fat free mass of 0.63 kg. Meta-analysis of changes in activities of daily living was complicated by the fact that a variety of tests were used to evaluate this outcome. Pooled data of participants' global assessment of improvement showed that 44% felt better during creatine treatment compared to less than 10% in the placebo groups. Improvement in functional tests and participants' own assessment of activities of daily living also indicate that creatine increases functional performance in muscular dystrophies. Changes in Neuromuscular Symptom Score were not significant but it may be that this score is not very sensitive to detect effects of creatine supplementation.</P>
<P>Most of the clinically relevant effects were seen in dystrophinopathy and type 2 myotonic dystrophy, but not consistently in type 1 myotonic dystrophy. This latter finding suggests that there may be clinical heterogeneity in the response and findings in one type of dystrophy, for example dystrophinopathy, cannot be applied directly to another, for example facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD). Although no specific trial of creatine in FSHD has been performed, 12 of the 32 muscular dystrophy patients studied by (<LINK REF="STD-Walter-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Walter 2000</LINK>) had FSHD and another Cochrane review has extracted the FSHD data <U>(</U>
<LINK REF="REF-Rose-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rose 2004</LINK>). These data seemed to show no benefit for creatine in FSHD but the numbers were small and the data were not analysed in the same way as for this review.</P>
<P>The different lengths of follow-up period among the trials included in this meta-analysis should be kept in mind. Even though a significant heterogeneity was not detected, changes in treatment effects depending on the duration of supplementation could not be excluded. It may be possible that there is a decline in response with longer intake. It would be useful to study the effects of long-term creatine supplementation and it may be interesting to compare continuous long-term ingestion with a cyclic intake.</P>
<P>There is also evidence that creatine improves functional performance in dermatomyositis and polymyositis. In metabolic myopathies (including mitochondrial myopathies) there was high quality evidence, but from only three diverse studies, that creatine has no effect on increasing strength by any measurement (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>), although ATP consumption during exercise was slightly attenuated. There is also evidence that creatine improved functional performance in idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (<LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>).The discrepancy between the fairly consistent effects noted in muscular dystrophy and possible effects in idiopathic inflammatory myopathy compared with metabolic myopathies is not entirely clear. However, it is possible that having fewer participants led to a type II statistical error (failing to detect an effect when in truth there is one).</P>
<P>Overall, the finding of an increased fat free mass and maximal strength are consistent with the balance of data in young healthy individuals (<LINK REF="REF-Casey-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casey 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harris-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harris 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hultman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hultman 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mihic-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mihic 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tarnopolsky-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tarnopolsky 2000</LINK>) and older adults (<LINK REF="REF-Brose-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brose 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Burke-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burke 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chilibeck-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chilibeck 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chrusch-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chrusch 2001</LINK>). Quantitative muscle testing seems to be more sensitive to detect moderate changes in strength than manual muscle testing. This conclusion is in accordance with findings in Duchenne muscular dystrophy: In a 6-month trial by Fenichel et al. (<LINK REF="REF-Fenichel-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fenichel 2001</LINK>), QMT revealed a significant deterioration in strength of about -11% in the placebo group whereas MMT showed a non-significant change of about -2%. Similar changes have been reported in the trial by Escolar et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Escolar-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Escolar 2005</LINK>). The increase in muscle creatine and phosphocreatine documented using magnetic resonance spectroscopy appears to be somewhat less in people with muscular dystrophy and metabolic myopathies as compared to healthy individuals (<LINK REF="REF-Brose-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brose 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Casey-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casey 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harris-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harris 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hultman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hultman 1996</LINK>). However, the participant numbers were quite small and studies using direct measurements from muscle biopsies have not been completed.</P>
<P>Long-term studies (greater than one year) are not currently available to access the safety of creatine monohydrate supplementation in people with muscle disorders. However, in studies up to six months in duration there did not appear to be any significant side effects except for a significant increase in muscle pain and impairment in ADL in people with glycogenosis type V (<LINK REF="STD-Vorgerd-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Vorgerd 2002</LINK>). The reason for this exacerbation of pain remains to be elucidated. Most studies in healthy participants did not report any significant increase in symptoms over placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Greenwood-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenwood 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kreider-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kreider 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mihic-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mihic 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Poortmans-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poortmans 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Poortmans-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poortmans 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shao-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shao 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Terjung-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Terjung 2000</LINK>). An increase in serum creatinine of approximately 10% to 15 % is likely indicative of increased rate of delivery of creatinine to the nephron with no evidence of alterations in creatinine clearance rate (<LINK REF="REF-Brose-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brose 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Poortmans-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poortmans 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Poortmans-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poortmans 2005</LINK>). These safety results are very similar to those reporting few side effects in trials in people with neurological disorders (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and Huntington's disease) (<LINK REF="REF-Chetlin-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chetlin 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Groeneveld-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Groeneveld 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hersch-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hersch 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shefner-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shefner 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Verbessem-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verbessem 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Given that a reduction in total muscle mass and strength are characteristic hallmarks of muscular dystrophy, even a slight improvement in these variables seen with creatine supplementation could potentially be of functional significance. For example, corticosteroids are a mainstay of therapy in dystrophinopathy in spite of the known side effects, due to the fact that modest increases in strength appear to translate into longer-term improvements in functional status and outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Manzur-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manzur 2004</LINK>). Preliminary evidence suggests that creatine monohydrate supplementation increased strength and fat-free mass in boys with dystrophinopathy who were already taking corticosteroids (<LINK REF="STD-Tarnopolsky-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Tarnopolsky 2004a</LINK>). Whether or not a protective effect of creatine monohydrate with respect to bone mass (<LINK REF="REF-Chilibeck-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chilibeck 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roy-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roy 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tarnopolsky-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Tarnopolsky 2004a</LINK>), or type II muscle fibre atrophy (<LINK REF="REF-Roy-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roy 2002</LINK>), will be realised in clinical trials in participants with muscular dystrophy taking corticosteroids remains possible, but unproven. To date, the functional implications of the short-term increases in strength and fat free mass following creatine supplementation have not been subjected to longer-term trials. There is a need for longer-term studies of the efficacy and side effects of creatine in muscle diseases.</P>

<P>There is high quality evidence from RCTs that short- and intermediate-term creatine treatment can significantly improve muscle strength in people with muscular dystrophies.There is also evidence that creatine improved functional performance in muscular dystrophy and idiopathic inflammatory myopathy. Creatine was well tolerated in these people. Limited but high quality evidence from RCTs did not show significant improvement in muscle strength in metabolic myopathies. High-dose creatine treatment impaired ADL and increased muscle pain in glycogenosis type V.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-01-19 11:57:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Jewitt">
<P>There is a need for long-term studies of creatine in muscle diseases. Particular attention should be given to the specific type of myopathy. Diseases such as FSHD or myofibrillar myopathies have not yet been specifically targeted for evaluation. There is also a need for more studies in the metabolic myopathies due to the fact that dose dependent paradoxical effects were seen in McArdle disease and no studies have been conducted in other metabolic disorders such as fatty acid oxidation defects.<BR/>There is a need for standardisation of outcome measures, particularly with regard to activities of daily living. Regarding strength measurement, quantitative muscle testing should be chosen in preference to manual muscle testing.</P>

We decided to accept all time points of measurements for meta-analysis because there is no evidence that the effect of short- and medium-term creatine treatment changes in a function of time. We included searches of ClinicalTrial.gov and ICTRP in our search strategy for identification of studies and adapted the assessment of methodological quality and risks of bias to the new Cochrane methodology.
