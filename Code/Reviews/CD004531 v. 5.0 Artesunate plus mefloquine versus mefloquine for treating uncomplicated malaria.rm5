<P>Malaria is a parasitic disease spread by mosquitoes that kills thousands of people worldwide. Multiple-drug-resistant malaria is widespread, and in South-East Asia resistance is high against nearly all single therapy antimalarial drugs. Here, and in other areas with low malaria transmission, the combination of artesunate and mefloquine may provide an effective alternative. The review includes eight trials, mainly from South-East Asia, that compared artesunate plus mefloquine with mefloquine alone for treating uncomplicated malaria. Artesunate plus mefloquine performed better at destroying blood parasites and reducing fever. Adverse events were similar with both treatments.</P>

<P>Two authors independently applied the inclusion criteria, extracted data, and assessed methodological quality.

<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Eight trials involving 1996 participants met the inclusion criteria. All were conducted in areas with low malaria transmission, seven in South-East Asia and one in the Peruvian Amazon. The doses and dosing regimens of artesunate and mefloquine varied across trials. The trials using a total dose of 25 mg/kg mefloquine and 10 mg artesunate reported fewer treatment failures with the combination at all time points: day 28 (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.47; 824 participants, 4 trials), day 42 (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.39; 298 participants, 1 trial), and day 63 (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.77; 501 participants, 2 trials). The results for parasitaemia showed a similar trend. Trials using a lower dose of artesunate tended to favour the artesunate plus mefloquine combination. Overall, adverse events were similar across treatment arms.</P>

<P>Artesunate plus mefloquine performs better than mefloquine alone for treating uncomplicated falciparum malaria in areas with low malaria transmission.

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-08-13 17:57:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-08-13 17:57:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<I>Plasmodium falciparum</I> malaria continues to be a major cause of ill health and death in many areas, especially in the tropics (<LINK REF="REF-WHO_x002f_UNICEF-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO/UNICEF 2003</LINK>). Uncomplicated falciparum malaria is the commonest form of the disease and accounts for the greatest proportion of morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Olliaro-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olliaro 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Antimalarial combination therapy is currently regarded as a major strategy to combat drug-resistant malaria (<LINK REF="REF-RBM-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">RBM 2001a</LINK>). This is because malaria parasites can rapidly develop resistance to antimalarial drugs when they are used alone (single therapy). Combination therapy involves the simultaneous use of two or more blood schizonticides (drugs acting on the blood stage of the malaria parasites) that have independent modes of action and different biochemical targets in the parasite (<LINK REF="REF-White-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-RBM-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">RBM 2001b</LINK>). The combination may be more effective than single therapy, if the components exert a synergistic or additive antimalarial effect and there is decreased effectiveness due to resistance to at least one of the component drugs. The combination of artemisinin derivatives with other antimalarial drugs is widely advocated because it produces rapid clinical and parasitological response, may delay the development of resistance, and may reduce malaria transmission (<LINK REF="REF-RBM-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">RBM 2001a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Artesunate is a water-soluble derivative of dihydroartemisinin and the most widely used member of the artemisinin derivatives. It is effective against gametocytes (<LINK REF="REF-Price-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Price 1996</LINK>), the sexual forms of the parasites responsible for the transmission of malaria, and is one of the most rapidly acting antimalarial agents available. There is no documented resistance against artesunate, but because it has a very short half life (less than two hours), long treatment courses of five to seven days are necessary to prevent recurrence of the parasites (<LINK REF="REF-Bethell-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bethell 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-White-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Mefloquine is a 4-quinoline methanol antimalarial drug. It has been used as single therapy in areas of low malaria transmission and where chloroquine resistance is common (<LINK REF="REF-White-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 1996</LINK>). Because its terminal half life is about 20 days, it is eliminated slowly from the body (<LINK REF="REF-Looareesuwan-1992b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Looareesuwan 1992b</LINK>). This means that the malaria parasites are exposed to sub-therapeutic levels of the drug over long periods of time, which encourages the development of resistant strains (<LINK REF="REF-White-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 1997</LINK>). Reports from Thailand and neighbouring countries show that parasites are rapidly developing resistance to mefloquine (<LINK REF="REF-Wongsrichanalai-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wongsrichanalai 2002</LINK>), and its use as a single antimalarial treatment is no longer recommended in these areas (<LINK REF="REF-Looareesuwan-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Looareesuwan 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>In South-East Asia, mefloquine is often combined with artesunate to treat multiple-drug-resistant uncomplicated malaria (<LINK REF="REF-Angus-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Angus 2001</LINK>). The rationale is to provide improved early clearance of parasites in order to reduce the probability of any remaining parasites surviving the residual effect of mefloquine. By preventing the exposure of the initial high load of parasites to mefloquine alone the spread of parasite resistance to mefloquine may be delayed. The gametocidal action of artesunate may also reduce the transmission of mefloquine-resistant malaria strains. The addition of mefloquine to artesunate allows the use of a practical short course of artesunate, that is, three days compared with five or seven days for artesunate alone. The combination may also reduce recrudescence rates; for example, recrudescence rates as high as 37% have been observed with a five-day course of artesunate compared with 7% when artesunate is given together with mefloquine (<LINK REF="STD-Price-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Price 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Trung-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trung 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Results from clinical trials comparing artesunate plus mefloquine with mefloquine alone suggest that the combination is superior. These trials have however used varying regimens of the combination with mefloquine given either during or after the artesunate course (<LINK REF="REF-Hoshen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoshen 2000</LINK>). In addition, current dosage schedules are based on available clinical data and not from well-designed dose-finding trials (<LINK REF="REF-RBM-2001c" TYPE="REFERENCE">RBM 2001c</LINK>). Therefore, it is still unclear which regimen and dosing schedule are most suitable.</P>
<P>The use of artesunate and mefloquine either alone or in combination may be associated with unwanted effects. Mefloquine is associated with neuropsychiatric disorders, including psychosis and convulsions, which have been observed both during treatment and prophylaxis (<LINK REF="REF-Weinke-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weinke 1991</LINK>). Some artemisinin derivatives have been associated with fatal neurotoxicity in animals, and a few people taking artemisinin drugs have been reported with transient first-degree heart block, but artesunate itself seems to be well tolerated (<LINK REF="REF-Brewer-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brewer 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kain-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kain 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gilles-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilles 2000</LINK>). Reports from trials assessing the effects of the combination have reported moderate tolerability with no increase in adverse events over those related to the individual drugs (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>McIntosh and Olliaro prepared a Cochrane review of all artemisinin drugs for treating uncomplicated malaria (<LINK REF="REF-McIntosh-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">McIntosh 1999</LINK>). Although they reviewed the effects of combining artemisinins with mefloquine, no two trials used the same treatment regimens and thus the findings were inconclusive. However, the review authors do not intend to update their review because their objectives were achieved. Our review attempts to answer the still outstanding questions regarding the combination of artesunate plus mefloquine.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Trial design and location</HEADING>
<P>All trials were described as randomized, but most trial authors provided no information on the method of randomization. The trials were conducted in low malaria transmission areas. Seven trials were conducted in South-East Asia &#8722; Thai-Burmese border (two), Thai-Cambodia border (one), Thai-Myanmar border (one), most northern state of the Union of Myanmar (one), and the interior of Thailand (two). One trial was conducted in the Peruvian Amazon Basin in South America.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Participants</HEADING>
<P>The eight trials included 1155 participants. Five trials included children and adults, and three trials included adults with the lowest cut-off age of 15 years.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>All trials compared artesunate plus mefloquine with mefloquine alone. Four trials had additional arms that were not considered in this review. As shown in <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>, the total dose of artesunate and mefloquine varied across the trials; some trials used single doses and others divided the doses.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Drug resistance</HEADING>
<P>The seven trials conducted in South-East Asia were in areas described as having multiple-drug-resistance to antimalarial drugs; nearly all mentioned high resistance to mefloquine. <LINK REF="STD-Marquino-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Marquino 2003</LINK> did not mention resistance to mefloquine, but it was likely to be low.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>All trials reported the presence of parasites at various time points in addition to other review outcomes. None reported on adherence to the treatment schedule or the progression to severe malaria. All trials except <LINK REF="STD-Smithius-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Smithius 2004</LINK> mentioned adverse events, although some did not report them in detail.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This review includes 1155 participants from eight trials. The data are mainly from South-East Asia where malaria transmission is low and multiple-drug resistance is prevalent. </P>
<P>Few trials reported the number of participants screened and eligible, the numbers excluded or withdrawn, or the numbers lost to follow up in each treatment group at each target visit. Where possible we used the randomized participants to form our denominator (approximated intention-to-treat analyses), but where this information was unavailable we used the numbers as given in the trial report. It was not clear from the trial reports if any of the trials that concealed allocation of treatment also used blinding, but based on the description of the regimens this was unlikely. This might affect the quality of trial results by introducing bias and therefore limiting the conclusions that can be made. </P>
<P>Although some trials included both children and adults, we were unable to analyse outcomes by age group because the trial reports did not provide details. </P>
<P>Few participants contributed to each given outcome because of a lack of uniformity in the way the trials measured and reported on outcomes, and in the drug doses and regimens. This creates uncertainty with the observed result and some comparisons did not have much statistical power to detect differences. </P>
<P>The combination of artesunate and mefloquine generally results in higher cure rate and better fever control than mefloquine alone. A total dose of 25 mg/kg mefloquine and at least 10 mg/kg artesunate gave the best results. The effects were more varied with a lower dose of artesunate (4 mg/kg), but the combination was still better than mefloquine alone. There were insufficient data to determine the effect of using at least 10 mg/kg artesunate and 15 mg/kg mefloquine. The combination of 4 mg/kg artesunate and 15 mg/kg mefloquine did not perform better than mefloquine alone. </P>
<P>One serious adverse event (psychosis) was observed in the mefloquine alone group. Other adverse events were similar across treatment groups, sometimes leading to discontinuation of treatment. Because the number of participants is still small to enable the risk of rare but important adverse events to be determined, surveillance of artesunate plus mefloquine is needed.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-07-25 14:29:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Artesunate plus mefloquine is better than mefloquine alone for clearing malaria parasites and resolving fever in people with uncomplicated <I>P. falciparum</I> malaria in areas with low malaria transmission, although the trials reviewed were of variable methodological quality. Adding artesunate to mefloquine does not lead to any more adverse events than when mefloquine is used alone. A total dose of 25 mg/kg mefloquine and at least 10 mg artesunate lead to faster symptom relief and better cure. There are insufficient data to determine the effect of using lower doses of mefloquine.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-07-25 14:29:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomized controlled trials are needed from areas outside of South-East Asia, as are trials in children. These trials need to determine the optimal regimen of artesunate plus mefloquine and should use uniform outcome definitions and standardized reporting to allow for comparability of results. Trials should also include outcomes on symptom resolution as these are of particular interest to malaria patients. Trialists should use rigorous methodology, particularly for allocation concealment and blinding, and thorough reporting.</P>

<P>We changed the title of the review from 'Artesunate plus mefloquine for treating malaria' to the current title to reflect the review's inclusion criteria. We include only one primary outcome measure, treatment failure, following recent developments in knowledge around the accuracy of some malaria treatment outcomes. In line with changes in the guidance from the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group, we updated the methods for assessing blinding and changed the wording of "loss to follow up" to "inclusion of all randomized participants in the final analysis".</P>
