<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-09-08 14:59:39 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In the right lower part of the abdomen there is a small blind ending intestinal tube, called appendix. Inflammation of the appendix is called appendicitis and is usually acute in onset. Appendicitis is most frequent in children and young adults. Most cases require emergency surgery, in order to avoid rupture of the appendix into the abdomen. During the operation, called appendectomy, the inflamed appendix is surgically removed. The traditional surgical approach involves a small incision (about 5 cm or 2 inches) in the right lower abdominal wall. Alternatively, it is possible to perform the operation by laparoscopy. This operation, called laparoscopic appendectomy, requires 3 very small incisions (each about 1 cm or 1/2 inch). The surgeon then introduces a camera and some instruments into the abdomen and removes the appendix as in the conventional operation.</P>
<P>This review analysed 67 clinical studies, in which surgical technique (conventional open or laparoscopic) for each patient was determined by chance. The majority of studies were done on adults, but there were also 7 studies on children. The main advantages of laparoscopic over conventional appendectomy were reduced risk of wound infection, reduced postoperative pain, shorter hospital stay (-1 day), and more rapid return to normal activities. As disadvantages of laparoscopic appendectomy a longer duration of the operation (+10 minutes) and a higher rate of intraabdominal abscesses were identified. The results for children were similar to those seen in adults. An additional benefit of the laparoscopic approach is the possibility to inspect the inside of the abdomen. Especially in women of childbearing age, in whom many other conditions can mimic appendicitis, laparoscopy therefore reduces the risk of an unnecessary appendectomy.</P>
<P>In summary, laparoscopic surgery for suspected appendicitis has diagnostic and therapeutic advantages as compared to conventional surgery. However, conventional appendectomy should not be considered 'wrong', because the difference between the two techniques is rather small and strongly depends on patient characteristics and the treating surgeon's expertise.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Laparoscopic surgery for acute appendicitis has been proposed to have advantages over conventional surgery.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To compare the diagnostic and therapeutic effects of laparoscopic and conventional 'open' surgery. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2010-08-26 18:35:36 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, CNKI, SciSearch, study registries, and the congress proceedings of endoscopic surgical societies.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We included randomized clinical trials comparing laparoscopic (LA) versus open appendectomy (OA) in adults or children. Studies comparing immediate OA versus diagnostic laparoscopy (followed by LA or OA if necessary) were separately identified. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality. Missing information or data was requested from the authors. We used odds ratios (OR), relative risks (RR), and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for analysis.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-08-26 18:31:34 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 67 studies, of which 56 compared LA (with or without diagnostic laparoscopy) vs. OA in adults. Wound infections were less likely after LA than after OA (OR 0.43; CI 0.34 to 0.54), but the incidence of intraabdominal abscesses was increased (OR 1.87; CI 1.19 to 2.93). The duration of surgery was 10 minutes (CI 6 to 15) longer for LA. Pain on day 1 after surgery was reduced after LA by 8 mm (CI 5 to 11 mm) on a 100 mm visual analogue scale. Hospital stay was shortened by 1.1 day (CI 0.7 to 1.5). Return to normal activity, work, and sport occurred earlier after LA than after OA. While the operation costs of LA were significantly higher, the costs outside hospital were reduced. Seven studies on children were included, but the results do not seem to be much different when compared to adults. Diagnostic laparoscopy reduced the risk of a negative appendectomy, but this effect was stronger in fertile women (RR 0.20; CI 0.11 to 0.34) as compared to unselected adults (RR 0.37; CI 0.13 to 1.01).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>In those clinical settings where surgical expertise and equipment are available and affordable, diagnostic laparoscopy and LA (either in combination or separately) seem to have various advantages over OA. Some of the clinical effects of LA, however, are small and of limited clinical relevance. In spite of the mediocre quality of the available research data, we would generally recommend to use laparoscopy and LA in patients with suspected appendicitis unless laparoscopy itself is contraindicated or not feasible. Especially young female, obese, and employed patients seem to benefit from LA.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-09-08 14:59:44 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Since its introduction by McBurney in 1894 appendectomy is the treatment of choice for acute appendicitis (<LINK REF="REF-McBurney-1894" TYPE="REFERENCE">McBurney 1894</LINK>). It soon became one of the most frequently performed surgical procedures. Today, in developed countries about 8% of the population is appendectomized for acute appendicitis during their lifetime (<LINK REF="REF-Addiss-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Addiss 1990</LINK>). The surgical technique remained nearly unchanged for over a century, as it combines therapeutic efficacy with low morbidity and mortality rates (<LINK REF="REF-Eriksson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eriksson 1995</LINK>). The evolution of endoscopic surgery led to the idea of performing appendectomy in laparoscopy, which was first described by Semm in 1983 (<LINK REF="REF-Semm-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Semm 1983</LINK>). Nevertheless, the new method has only partly gained acceptance (<LINK REF="REF-Faiz-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faiz 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paterson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paterson 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Hove-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Hove 2008</LINK>), because the advantages of laparoscopic appendectomy were not as obvious as for laparoscopic cholecystectomy, e.g.. While some studies claimed laparoscopic appendectomy to be superior to open appendectomy in terms of a quicker and less painful recovery, less postoperative complications, and better cosmesis, other studies found no such advantages or even favoured the traditional approach.<BR/>Beside these therapeutic effects of LA, laparoscopy <I>per se</I> may offer valuable diagnostic opportunities. Since surgical removal of an un inflamed, normal ('innocent') appendix occurs in up to 50% of patients, it has been proposed not to remove the appendix in those situations, where other pathologies can be diagnosed during laparoscopy. Some surgeons therefore have used laparoscopy as a diagnostic tool only, and perform conventional appendectomy after laparoscopy in those patients, where the appendix macroscopically has an abnormal appearance. However, it is not yet clarified, in which situations a normal looking appendix should be left in place, although non-randomized studies indicate this (<LINK REF="REF-van-den-Broek-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">van den Broek 2001</LINK>).<BR/>The large number of published trials and the still ongoing debate prompted us to undertake a systematic review of all randomized trials which compared therapeutic and diagnostic advantages of both techniques.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>This review compares laparoscopic and conventional surgery with regard to several peri- and post-operative variables. It addresses diagnostic and therapeutic laparoscopy separately. Furthermore, it aims at identifying certain subgroups of patients, in which one of the techniques might be more appropriate than the other.</P>

<P>All randomized controlled trials comparing laparoscopic surgery and open appendectomy for acute appendicitis. Trials that allocate patients depending on the availability of staff or instruments or on the number of the day (odd or even) were excluded from the analysis. Due to the large number of studies available, we decided to also exclude trials that had no concealment of allocation.<BR/>If a trial was reported only as an abstract, or if no measure of dispersion was given for an outcome variable, or if the method of randomizations was not stated, the authors were contacted to provide full details of their trial. If the authors of an abstract did not provide full information on their trial, the trial was excluded from further analysis. The decision about inclusion of studies was discussed between two observers, and disagreements were resolved by discussion.<BR/>All interventions within the primary studies should be analysed on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis, and we tried to obtain ITT data from the study authors. For each study, we list in the study characteristics table the number of patients not treated according to study protocol, and we state whether these patients were or were not analysed on ITT. This usually includes patients, who were converted from LA to OA, or who were not appendectomised because of other diagnosis found on laparoscopy.</P>

<P>(1) Laparoscopic versus conventional appendectomy in adults:<BR/>The classical muscle-splitting appendectomy was compared with laparoscopic appendectomy. Usually this technique requires the insertion of three trocars into the abdominal cavity. The appendix can be dissected by using either a stapling device (EndoGIA) or ligatures, the so-called Roeder or EndoLoops. Both techniques can be seen upon as comparable, although costs differ (<LINK REF="STD-Klima-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Klima 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kazemier-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kazemier 2006</LINK>). Studies included in this section may (but not necessarily so) have performed diagnostic laparoscopy.<BR/>(2) Laparoscopic versus conventional appendectomy in children:<BR/>Same interventions as (1).<BR/>(3) Diagnostic laparoscopy (followed by open or laparoscopic appendectomy if necessary) versus immediate open appendectomy:<BR/>Conventional appendectomy was compared with diagnostic laparoscopy followed by laparoscopic or conventional appendectomy if necessary. Studies were included only if they clearly described under what circumstances they refrained from appendectomy. This included patients, in whom other intraabdominal pathologies were found and the appendix looked normal, but also patients, in whom no pathology was found. This section addresses only the diagnostic effect of laparoscopy without paying attention to therapeutic effects, which depend on the type of appendectomy that was performed after laparoscopy. The therapeutic effects of the studies included in (3) are summarized under section (1) when LA and under section (4) when OA was performed after diagnostic laparoscopy.<BR/>(4) Diagnostic laparoscopy (followed by open appendectomy if necessary) versus immediate open appendectomy:<BR/>Surgical techniques are described in section (3).</P>

<P>In order to be as comprehensive as possible, the following search strategies were employed to identify all relevant studies irrespective of language. Studies predating 1983 were not searched for, because the first laparoscopic appendectomy was described in that year.<BR/>Electronically, we searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, SciSearch and Biosis. Additionally, we scanned foreign<BR/>language Databases, such as LILACS (Literatura Latinoamericana y del Caribe en Ciencias de la Salud) and CNKI (Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure). Cochrane Library and MEDLINE searches were repeated until April 15th 2010, all other databases were last searched in August 2009. In MEDLINE, we combined the Cochrane Collaboration search strategy for randomized controlled trials with the MeSH term "appendectomy". EMBASE was searched using the controlled terms "appendectomy" and "laparoscopy" ('Emtree medical descriptors'). In other databases similar strategies were employed. The WHO international clinical trial registry platform was used to identify planned or ongoing studies (http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/). The Science Citation Index was checked for papers citing K. Semm (<LINK REF="REF-Semm-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Semm 1983</LINK>). The online catalogues of the German (http://www.zbmed.de/index.html) and French National Medical Library (http://www.bium.univ-paris5.fr/) were searched for dissertations. The reference lists of all relevant primary studies and review article were screened for further studies (<LINK REF="REF-ANDEM-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">ANDEM 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Golub-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Golub 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Slim-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Slim 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fingerhut-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fingerhut 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chung-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chung 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Garbutt-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garbutt 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barth-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Barth 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Temple-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Temple 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kim-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 2004</LINK>;<LINK REF="REF-Aziz-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aziz 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kapischke-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kapischke 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bennett-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sadr_x002d_Azodi-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sadr-Azodi 2009</LINK>). Additionally, authors of relevant articles and known international experts in the field of laparoscopic surgery were contacted to obtain information on any past, present, or future studies.<BR/>Abstracts presented to the following international scientific societies were handsearched: European Association of Endoscopic Surgery (EAES), Society of American Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES), American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE), Asian Surgical Association (ASA), International Society for Surgery (ISS), Endoscopic and Laparoscopic Society of Asia (ELSA), Surgical Infection Society (SIS), and the German Society for Surgery (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Chirurgie, DGCh). Authors of abstracts were asked to provide full information using a four-page data extraction form.</P>

<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2010-04-15 17:40:20 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All studies were assessed by two reviewers, who read the articles independently from each other. For each trial, the two reviewers assessed three main criteria of study design and analysis: (1) method of randomisation and allocation concealment, (2) blinding of outcome assessment, and (3) dealing with protocol violations, for instance converted procedures. In the 'Risk of Bias' table, violations of the ITT principle are described in the 'Other Bias' column.<BR/>Two observers independently extracted the results of each paper on a data sheet; disagreements were resolved by discussion.<BR/>For dichotomous variables relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were the preferred measure. For complication rates, however, Peto's odds ratios (OR) were calculated, because simulation studies by Deeks et al. have shown, that this effect measure is the most robust when dealing with rare or extremely rare events (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 1999</LINK>). For dichotomous outcomes we also calculate the number of patients that needs to be treated to prevent one complication (NNT). We expected complication rate to vary only by a very small degree, and therefore used fixed-effects models (<LINK REF="REF-Hardy-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hardy 1998</LINK>), unless heterogeneity was present.<BR/>In the analysis of continuous variables, generally means with their corresponding standard deviations (SDs) are needed to calculate weighted or standardized mean differences with 95% CIs. However, some of the variables, e.g. hospital stay or length of surgery, tend to have non-Gaussian distributions. Thus, authors understandably use nonparametric statistics and give their data as medians with ranges. Although this is correct for a single study, meta-analysis cannot use this data. On the other hand, it can be misleading to request means and SDs from all trial authors, because this would simply ignore the non-Gaussian distribution. In conclusion, we present mean and median data separately, but we use only mean data for statistical pooling. In case a study failed to report SDs for an outcome measure, we assumed that the SD is equal to the mean value itself. This approach produces relatively conservative results, since studies without reporting of SDs tended to receive less weight. We pooled the effect measures within a random effects model (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>), because these outcomes are heavily influenced by the context of care.<BR/>Studies on diagnostic laparoscopy were divided into those performed on unselected patients and those on fertile women. Sensitivity analyses were a priori planned to compare the study results for their inclusion criteria (i.e. sex ratio, percentage of perforated or gangrenous cases), technique of laparoscopic appendectomy (loops vs stapler for closure of appendix stump, learning-curve apparent vs not) and study design and reporting (adequate vs unclear allocation concealment, studies that reported means vs medians). To control the influence of a possible publication bias we test funnel plot asymmetry as proposed by Egger et al. (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>).</P>

<P>All included studies used similar subjective clinical criteria to identify patients suspected to suffer from acute appendicitis. The age range and the gender ratio, however, were quite different among the studies, since most studies on diagnostic laparoscopy included fertile women only. Some of the studies excluded patients in whom a perforated appendix was suspected. Although this was not explicitly described in all studies, we assume that all studies excluded pregnant women and patients in whom laparoscopy was preoperatively believed impractical.<BR/>The interventions were very similar among the studies. Laparoscopic appendectomy was usually performed with the use of three trocars for access and ligatures for stump closure. A stapling device for securing the appendix stump was routinely used by only a few trialists (<LINK REF="STD-Hall-Long-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hall Long 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heikkinen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Heikkinen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Henle-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Henle 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaiser-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Katkhouda-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Katkhouda 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laine-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Laine 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martin-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moberg-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Moberg 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nordentoft-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Nordentoft 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simon-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Simon 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Witten-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Witten 1998</LINK>). The trial by Ortega et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Ortega-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ortega 1996</LINK>) had a three-armed design to compare stapling and loops for appendiceal stump closure. While some trials used disposable instruments (which are quite expensive), other used reusable ones. One further three-armed trial used needlescopic instruments with 2mm ports (<LINK REF="STD-Huang-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2001</LINK>). Nearly all studies described that both treatment groups received the same single dose of antibiotics. Those studies that used laparoscopy for diagnosing appendicitis had different criteria, when to remove the appendix or not.<BR/>Most trials assessed several clinical outcomes within hospital stay, although some trials had a follow-up examination of one month after surgery. The most commonly examined outcomes were operating time, complication rates, hospital stay, pain, and return to normal activities. Some studies were interested in return of bowel function, cosmetic result and costs. Other outcomes, which are not assessed in this review (but in some primary trials), include quality of life (<LINK REF="STD-Kaplan-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kaplan 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vallribera-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Vallribera 2003</LINK>), the rate of bacteraemia (<LINK REF="STD-Sezeur-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sezeur 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nordentoft-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Nordentoft 2000</LINK>), the rate of postoperative adhesions on second-look laparoscopy (<LINK REF="STD-DeWilde-1991" TYPE="STUDY">DeWilde 1991</LINK>), and some pathophysiological parameters (<LINK REF="STD-Perner-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Perner 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karadayi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Karadayi 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simon-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Simon 2009</LINK>).<BR/>Three trials presented their results in combination with other results. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Settmacher-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Settmacher 1995</LINK>) compared laparoscopic appendectomy and cholecystectomy against the corresponding conventional techniques. A second very small trial (n= 11; <LINK REF="STD-Perner-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Perner 1999</LINK>) reported on LA and OA, but also on laparoscopic colectomy. A third trial (<LINK REF="STD-Williams-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1996</LINK>) reported results for randomized and non-randomized patients. In all these cases, we used only the relevant part of the data.<BR/>One trial was described only in a meta-analysis, of which the primary trialist was a coauthor (<LINK REF="STD-Barth-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Barth 1999</LINK>). We met the trialist, but he failed to provide us with further data. We decided to include the trial results, that were reported in the meta-analysis.<BR/>Several trials were reported on in more than just one publication. Of note, the two articles by Lintula et al. described different stages of the same trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lintula-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lintula 2004</LINK>), with 73 and 87 patients. We used the most complete information, wherever possible. One trial was reported in three different publications (<LINK REF="STD-Henle-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Henle 1996</LINK>). We were unable to resolve the discrepancies in complication rates among the three papers (<LINK REF="REF-Neugebauer-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neugebauer 1999</LINK>). We decided not to use the trial results on infectious complications, but we included the trial's other outcome data, which were reported consistently.</P>

<P>The quality of all included studies was moderate to poor (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). Most studies had very similar flaws. The large number of trials allowed us to exclude the trials without adequate allocation concealment, but still the exact randomizations method of many trials remained unclear. In total, 42 trials (63%) were judged to have an adequately concealed process of randomisation. Not unexpectedly, only nine trials (<LINK REF="STD-Ortega-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ortega 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lejus-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lejus 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lintula-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lintula 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huang-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ignacio-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ignacio 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Katkhouda-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Katkhouda 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moberg-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Moberg 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ricca-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ricca 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-YIn-1996" TYPE="STUDY">YIn 1996</LINK>) took measures to blind investigator and/or patient against treatment received.

However, there are no long-term data available to describe the effects of LA and OA on the occurrence of incisional hernia or intraabdominal adhesions.<BR/>Furthermore, only some of the studies described how many patients presented with suspected acute appendicitis during the trial period, how many of these patients were primarily eligible for the trial, and how many subsequently refused trial participation.<BR/>Data extraction on pain was difficult, since we had to identify the prespecified time point of 24 hr after operation in figures, that had other or unclear schedules of pain measurement. Furthermore, one study (<LINK REF="STD-Ortega-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ortega 1996</LINK>) reported only a summary pain score that was calculated from the VAS measurement, but also from pain tablets consumed.

<P>A total of 67 studies were included in this review, but not all them reported clinically relevant data which contributed to the results of this review. Of these 67 studies, the vast majority (56 studies) compared LA and OA in adults. Seven studies of OA versus LA were on children (<LINK REF="STD-Bolla-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bolla 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lavonius-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lavonius 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lejus-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lejus 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lintula-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lintula 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Little-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Little 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simon-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Simon 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yeung-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Yeung 1997</LINK>) (and one further study is ongoing (<LINK REF="STD-Paya-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Paya 2000</LINK>)). Fourteen studies addressed the diagnostic effects of laparoscopy specifically. Of these fourteen studies, four examined only the diagnostic effects of laparoscopy, and performed OA if appendicitis could not be ruled out during laparoscopy (<LINK REF="STD-Jadallah-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Jadallah 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Larsson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Larsson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olsen-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Olsen 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Dalen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Dalen 2003</LINK>). In the remaining ten studies, LA was performed after diagnostic laparoscopy. Therefore, the therapeutic effects of these ten studies are included in the 67 studies comparing LA and OA.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Therapeutic effects in adults</HEADING>
<P>Out of the various complications that were described after OA and LA, we examined only two specific complications. It was impossible to extract data on overall complication rates from the included studies, because definition and reporting of complications was inconsistent. Wound infections were about half as likely (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>; Peto OR 0.43; 95%-CI 0.34 to 0.54) after LA than after OA,- a highly significant result based on nearly 6000 operated cases. Despite the large number of studies with differences in surgical expertise, antibiotic regimens, and clinical setting, low heterogeneity was detectable (I<SUP>2</SUP> 11%). On the other hand, intraabdominal abscesses were increased nearly threefold after LA (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>; Peto OR 1.77; 95%-CI 1.14 to 2.76). In this case, moderate heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> 33%) was detectable among the 46 studies that contributed data to this overall result. There were no notable differences in the results of trials using stapler vs. loops for stump closure. The funnel plot showed no signs of publication bias.<BR/>The duration of surgery was 10 minutes (95%-CI 6 to 15) longer for LA (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). The results for anaesthesia time or operating time were similarly prolonged. Not unexpectedly, strong heterogeneity was present in these analyses. It seems as if the difference between LA and OA has become smaller during the more recent years. A possible interaction between the presence of a learning curve bias and trial results was not detectable.<BR/>Pain measurements on day 1 after surgery showed a reduction of pain by 8 mm (95%-CI 5 to 11 mm; <LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>) on a 100 mm VAS. This finding is hampered by the fact that strong heterogeneity was found among the studies and also the absolute pain levels varied between 5.9 cm and 2.9 cm. Less pain was also found in most of those trials that measured pain over one or two weeks after surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Bauwens-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bauwens 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hart-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hart 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hebebrand-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hebebrand 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hellberg-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hellberg 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Katkhouda-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Katkhouda 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moberg-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Moberg 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reiertsen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Reiertsen 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ricca-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ricca 2007</LINK>), although the absolute differences became smaller with time. Various studies described that LA requires less analgesic drugs doses and/or a shorter duration of analgesia. When restricting the analysis of pain intensity only to the three trials that did used blinding and reported mean data, the pooled result was still significantly in favour of LA.<BR/>Hospital stay also showed large variations among the absolute lengths of stay in the various studies (range 1 to 7 days) and also for the LA versus OA differences (range 0 to 4 days reduction). Not a single study reported a significant increase in hospital stay. In the summary statistics, therefore, a significant reduction of 1.1 days was calculated (95%-CI 0.7 to 1.5; <LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>). However, the two biggest studies (<LINK REF="STD-Pedersen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pedersen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hellberg-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hellberg 1999</LINK>), reported that hospital stay was similar after LA and OA, but these results could not be used in the meta-analysis, because medians were presented by the study authors. The fact that study results are highly heterogeneous can be partly explained by the absolute duration of hospital stay, which ranged between 1 and 10 days. The trials with long hospital stay after OA reported clearly higher reductions in length of stay after LA as compared to those trials, in which hospital stay was already very short after OA.<BR/>After LA, bowel function returned more quickly than after OA, but this finding is based on a smaller number of studies and also is of borderline significance only. Furthermore, the results on reintroduction of liquid and solid diet were highly heterogeneous. Three studies used indices of bodily function and quality-of-life to compare LA and OA (<LINK REF="STD-Hellberg-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hellberg 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaplan-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kaplan 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vallribera-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Vallribera 2003</LINK>). All three trials reported significant advantages for LA.<BR/>Return to normal activity was 5 days (95%-CI 4 to 7; <LINK REF="CMP-001.17" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.17</LINK>) earlier after LA than after OA, but again heterogeneity was present, although it was caused by only a single trial. Return to work was quite similar after LA and OA with a difference of 2 days in favour of LA (95%-CI -2 to +5; <LINK REF="CMP-001.19" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.19</LINK>), but the two large but excluded trials found quicker recovery after LA (<LINK REF="STD-Pedersen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pedersen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hellberg-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hellberg 1999</LINK>). Both trials found a significant difference of 6 and 3 days earlier return to work, respectively. Return to sporting activities was found to be possible earlier after LA in the two trials assessing this outcome. Only two studies assessed the cosmetic result by the use of a VAS. Both noted a significant benefit (quantified as 10 mm on the VAS) for LA versus OA.<BR/>Operation and hospital costs of LA were significantly higher than that of OA, but this finding is strongly heterogeneous (<LINK REF="CMP-001.25" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.25</LINK>). When comparing the total costs within hospital stay and the costs outside hospital, it seems as cost increase and decrease cancel out each other. Although LA causes more in-hospital costs, it saves costs outside the hospital on the society level. In consequence, Hall-Long et al., Heikkinen et al., and Macarulla et al. described that LA is cost-saving from a societal perspective,- especially in employed patients.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Therapeutic effects in children</HEADING>
<P>In children, less data is available, but the result do not seem to be much different when compared to adults. Again, laparoscopic surgery took longer to perform (+11 minutes; 95%-CI +6 to +16). Wound infections were significantly reduced (Peto OR 0.20; 95%-CI 0.08 to 0.54). There were only three single cases of intraabdominal abscess formation, which precludes meaningful analysis of this outcome. Since pain was measured blindly in two paediatric trials, this outcome deserves special attendance. The trial by Lejus et al. failed to find a reduction in pain, but the trial by Lintula et al. described significantly less pain at various time points. Shoulder tip pain, however, was more frequent after LA (<LINK REF="STD-Lejus-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lejus 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lintula-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lintula 2004</LINK>). In the study by Lintula (<LINK REF="STD-Lintula-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lintula 2004</LINK>), blinding lasted for seven days and a significant reduction in hospital stay was noted (-0.7 days; 95%-CI -0.3 to -1.1 days). This result is similar to the pooled estimate, but between-trial differences were large (I<SUP>2</SUP> 52%). The trial Hay et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Hay-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hay 1998</LINK>), which we excluded due to its clearly unconcealed randomizations, also obtained similar results. Controversial data exist on postoperative reconvalescence. Two trials consistently found higher costs within hospital stay, but data on out-of-hospital savings are lacking.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Diagnostic effects</HEADING>
<P>In trials on unselected patients, diagnostic laparoscopy led to variable reductions in the rate of negative appendectomies. Although the overall result is nearly significant (RR 0.37; 95%-CI 0.13 to 1.01; <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>), it is influenced strongly by a recently published large trial (<LINK REF="STD-Pedersen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pedersen 2001</LINK>). It seems as if older trials were more reluctant to leave an uninflamed appendix in situ. One further study on unselected adults (<LINK REF="STD-Reiertsen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Reiertsen 1997</LINK>) stated, that "the laparoscopic procedure was found to have a significantly lower risk of unnecessary appendicectomy (p= 0.03)", but we were unable to extract raw data from this study. In parallel to the reduction in negative appendectomy rate, the rate of unestablished diagnoses was also decreased after laparoscopy (RR 0.43; 95%-CI 0.17 to 1.08).<BR/>In fertile women, in whom appendectomy was deemed necessary, diagnostic laparoscopy reduced the number of unnecessary appendectomies largely (RR 0.20; 95%-CI 0.11 to 0.34). Consequently, the number of patients without a final diagnosis established was smaller after laparoscopy (RR 0.27; 95%-CI 0.17 to 0.44). Both results are based on six similar trials without any signs of heterogeneity. No data are available on the role of diagnostic laparoscopy in children with suspected appendicitis.<BR/>The therapeutic effects of laparoscopy followed by OA vs. direct OA have been reported only in a few trials. All outcomes show non-significant results.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-09-08 15:06:16 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Laparoscopy can serve as a diagnostic and therapeutic tool in patients with suspected appendicitis. We tried to disentangle these two aspects, because diagnostic laparoscopy and laparoscopic appendectomy can each be performed with or without performing the other.<BR/>The diagnostic effects were analysed separately for unselected patients and young women. In both groups large reductions of unnecessary appendectomies and an improved diagnostic efficacy was seen, although the effect was a little more pronounced in young women. Clinically, we therefore believe it justified to recommend diagnostic laparoscopy in many if not all cases of suspected appendicitis. This interpretation, however, also depend on further studies, that will elucidate the situations in which a normal-looking appendix can safely be left in situ. To date, the studies included in this review did not remove a macroscopically normal appendix only if another cause of abdominal pain was found. If future studies prove that a macroscopically normal appendix could also be left unresected, if no other pathology is found, this would further increase the therapeutic advantage of laparoscopy. We believe that the diagnostic effects of laparoscopy are still undervalued (<LINK REF="REF-Flum-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flum 2001</LINK>), because many surgeons are reluctant to leave an uninflamed appendix in situ.<BR/>The reduction of the rate of patients without definite diagnosis is difficult to value, since some of these patients are likely to have no serious intraabdominal disease. On the other hand, there will also be cases, in whom conventional appendectomy overlooks a serious, perhaps even malignant disease. Such cases will most likely receive a definite diagnosis within or after hospital stay. However, since most trials (except for van Dalen et al. (<LINK REF="STD-van-Dalen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Dalen 2003</LINK>)) did not extend follow-up beyond hospital discharge, these case of recurrent diseases could have been missed in the trials.<BR/>The therapeutic effects of LA are much more difficult to value, because the overall differences are only very small and some of the effects are in opposite direction. If we can avoid 3 wound infections, but have to accept 1 intraabdominal abscess more in return, which complications are more important? We also were unable to provide global complication data, which could serve as a more robust indicator of intra- and postoperative safety.<BR/>It is important to remember that the diagnostic efficacy of laparoscopy also affects the therapeutic outcomes. It is well imaginable that LA was faster completed in some trials, just because appendectomy was never carried out. Patients in whom diagnostic laparoscopy was the only procedure might also be less likely to suffer from postoperative complications. The comparison between trials that did leave or did not leave a normal-looking appendix in situ, however, is difficult, because some trials seemed to have no clear policy about what to do with an innocent appendix.<BR/>The heterogeneity in postoperative hospital stay and return to normal activity allows only some very cautious conclusions, although there is a uniform tendency to quicker reconvalescence after LA. When looking closer at the raw data, some of the trials report surprisingly long hospital stay after OA. This suggests that discharge after OA in some trials depended more on tradition than on clinical needs. It has been shown that hospital stay after OA can be shortened to one day or less (<LINK REF="REF-Ramesh-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramesh 1993</LINK>). One might also argue that the reductions in postoperative pain and hospital stay and also the quicker return to normal bowel function are - though significant - not clinically relevant, because the differences were so small. A reduction of pain by 10 mm on a 100 mm VAS scale - as it was found here - has been shown to be under the level of pain that an average patient is able to perceive. However, the absolute pain intensity and its duration also have to be taken into account as well as the possibly reduced number of analgesics. When assessing pain, it is extremely important to note that many of the trials in adults were unblinded. The majority of blinded trials gave similar results as the unblinded ones, but some of the blinded trials were excluded from the statistical analysis because median data on pain were reported. In conclusion, one may still doubt on justified grounds whether pain is truly less after LA, and if so, whether this is of clinical relevance (<LINK REF="REF-Eypasch-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eypasch 1996</LINK>).<BR/>The effect of blinding was of critical importance in the evaluation of laparoscopic cholecystectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Majeed-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Majeed 1996</LINK>). It may well be possible that patients who were randomized to LA and their caregivers had high expectations, since LA is the more 'modern' procedure. Therefore, since nearly all results might have been influenced by such effects (<LINK REF="REF-Neugebauer-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neugebauer 1991</LINK>), these results all have to be confirmed by blinded studies.<BR/>The costs of LA have had strong influence on a hospital's choice between LA and OA. From a hospitals perspective, LA is likely to be the more expensive procedure, even if in future the costs of the operation and the equipment (single use vs. reusable; Endo-GIA vs. Roeder loops) may decrease. From the society's perspective, however, the quicker reconvalescence may balance or even supersede the increased in-hospital costs. Still, these considerations are difficult to generalize, since the studies were carried out in different health care systems, they used different materials, and were very heterogeneous among each other. Therefore readers perhaps should pay closer attention only to those studies that were performed in their own country or other countries with similar health care settings.<BR/>In 2000, Benson and Hartz (<LINK REF="REF-Benson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benson 2000</LINK>) have raised doubts against the paradigm that non-randomized studies provide weaker evidence than randomized ones. To illustrate this, they also have compared randomized and non-randomized studies of LA versus OA, while this review excluded non- and pseudo-randomised studies as well as studies without allocation concealment, because this has been shown to have influence on trial results. Still, we think that prospective trials can provide good evidence, especially if the allocation to treatments is determined by presence or absence of an experienced surgeon. Under these circumstances, therefore the methodological difference between such prospective and truly randomized trials is possibly only very small, but it still exists. A large database analysis of over 40.000 patients in the U.S. found that laparoscopic appendectomy halved the risk of postoperative infection and reduced hospital stay from 2.9 to 2.1 days (<LINK REF="REF-Guller-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guller 2004</LINK>). A similar analysis confirmed this shortening of hospital stay and described slightly higher costs of LA as compared to OA (<LINK REF="REF-Sporn-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sporn 2009</LINK>). All these findings are consistent with the results of our analyses and support the generalisability of our results.<BR/>When compared to various other systematic reviews on LA (<LINK REF="STD-Barth-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Barth 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chung-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chung 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fingerhut-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fingerhut 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Garbutt-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garbutt 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Golub-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Golub 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCall-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCall 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Slim-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Slim 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Temple-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Temple 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Uhl-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uhl 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Aziz-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aziz 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kapischke-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kapischke 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bennett-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sadr_x002d_Azodi-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sadr-Azodi 2009</LINK>), our analysis included some additional studies, that were either published only as abstracts, book chapters or even theses, or were excluded in these reviews for language or other reasons. As we found some of such studies, we cannot entirely rule out that we have missed other studies, but it can be reasonably assumed that such studies are very small in size and therefore have little impact on our results. Furthermore, the funnel plot analysis of the wound infection rate showed no signs of asymmetry. Still, it is disturbing as a researcher to know of abstracts, that were presented many years ago, and never were published in full (<LINK REF="STD-Barth-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Barth 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Loh-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Loh 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoff-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Hoff 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rohr-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Rohr 1994</LINK>).<BR/>Methodologically, meta-analysis has its problems when dealing with non-Gaussian data, which require non-parametric statistics. We decided to make a distinction between means and medians, but this sometimes may exclude the more valid trials from meta-analysis. Therefore, we listed these trials in the analyses, so that readers can compare the results among these trials. For any trial that reported mean values but without giving SDs, we also estimated SDs, which is an accepted technique (<LINK REF="REF-Follmann-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Follmann 1992</LINK>). Therefore, we believe that all formats of data were adequately represented in the analyses.</P>

<P>Although the overall effects of laparoscopic surgery for suspected appendicitis are impressing, one must not forget that most of the laparoscopic surgeons involved in these trials were well-trained experts in laparoscopy. Therefore, surgical expertise with laparoscopic techniques is a basic prerequisite before surgeons can justly expect clinical benefits from LA. The still ongoing dissemination of the various laparoscopic techniques, however, renders it likely that the majority of future surgeons will be able to obtain training more easily.<BR/>Within the same process, laparoscopic equipment is becoming more and more available, too. This is important, since the routine availability of laparoscopic devices even in night hours is essential. In parallel, the operative costs will probably decrease.<BR/>In those clinical settings where surgical expertise and equipment are available and affordable, we would generally recommend to use laparoscopy and LA in all patients with suspected appendicitis unless laparoscopy itself is contraindicated or not feasible. This recommendation, however, does not pertain to perforated or gangrenous cases, since intraabdominal abscesses are more likely to occur after LA in general and there is some evidence that such cases run a higher risk (<LINK REF="STD-Pedersen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pedersen 2001</LINK>). Since the overall benefits of LA are very small, those who continue to operate on appendicitis by conventional techniques might continue to do so, but laparoscopic surgery should routinely be employed at least in special cases, for instance young female or obese patients (<LINK REF="STD-Hellberg-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hellberg 1999</LINK>), because the diagnostic and therapeutic advantages of laparoscopy are clearly larger in these cases.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-09-08 15:07:58 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Since a large number of studies was available for most comparisons in this review, future research should either use better study designs or focus on more specific aspects of the issue, such as specific outcomes or specific patient subgroups.<BR/>With regard to diagnostic laparoscopy, future studies should focus on specific patient groups, in whom a normal-looking appendix can be left in situ. It also remains to be clarified, what to do in patients, in whom no intraabdominal pathology (neither at the appendix, nor at any other organ) can be found during laparoscopy. Is appendectomy required in such situations? More recent, but still preliminary data have shown that it is probably safe to leave a normal looking appendix in situ (<LINK REF="STD-van-Dalen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Dalen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-den-Broek-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">van den Broek 2001</LINK>).<BR/>Most of the studies included in this review had a follow-up between a few days of hospital stay and a month. A much longer follow-up period of present and future studies is necessary to find out whether the lower rate of adhesions found by DeWilde (<LINK REF="STD-DeWilde-1991" TYPE="STUDY">DeWilde 1991</LINK>) translates into a clinically relevant reduction of adhesion-related complications, such as ileus.<BR/>The assessment of pain (and also other outcomes) should be done in a blinded manner in future studies. Furthermore, standard regimens of pain therapy should be employed in both study arms. Researchers should decide whether to measure pain and standardize pain therapy, or to measure analgesics consumption and keep patients below a standard level of pain. Studies, where both, analgesics and pain intensity vary, are difficult to interpret when the results for both are in opposite direction. It is likely that needlescopic instruments reduce postoperative pain (<LINK REF="STD-Huang-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2001</LINK>), but this has to be proven separately for appendectomy.<BR/>Those who use LA as a standard technique should concentrate on measures to reduce the risk of intraabdominal abscesses. The question whether LA is justifiable in patients with perforated or gangrenous appendicitis remains controversial. It seems impractical, however, to identify such cases preoperatively and enrol them into a trial. Finally, the comparative effectiveness of staplers versus loops for stump closure needs to be examined further.</P>
