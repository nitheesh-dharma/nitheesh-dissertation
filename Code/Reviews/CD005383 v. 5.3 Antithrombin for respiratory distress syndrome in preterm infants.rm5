<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Antithrombin (AT) is a substance that is produced by the liver and that plays an important role in the control of blood clotting and the subsequent breakdown of the clot. Critically ill infants, such as those born prematurely with immature lungs leading to respiratory distress (Respiratory Distress Syndrome; RDS) have low concentrations of AT in the blood. Studies have been conducted to examine whether preterm infants with RDS benefit from the administration of AT. In our systematic review, we found that preterm infants with RDS do not benefit from therapy with AT and may be harmed. </P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Acquired Antithrombin (AT) deficiency is a common and prognostically important finding in sick preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). It has been hypothesised that AT concentrate may improve clinical outcomes in preterm infants with RDS. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2010-01-03 20:48:24 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To determine the effect of administration of AT concentrate compared with placebo or no treatment on mortality in preterm infants with RDS.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2010-01-06 12:49:12 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>An electronic literature search in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE was performed in August 2006. References from identified studies were cross checked for possible additional studies. Experts in the field and pharmaceutical companies were contacted for unpublished data. Abstracts of the American Society of Pediatric Research and European Society of Pediatric Research meetings (1983 to 2005) were searched and authors of relevant studies were contacted to obtain additional information. The electronic search was updated in December 2009.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomized controlled trials comparing any dose and duration of AT therapy with placebo or no treatment in preterm infants with RDS. </P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2010-01-06 12:36:33 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently extracted data from included studies. Data for similar outcomes were combined where appropriate, using a fixed-effects model in RevMan 4.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-01-03 20:53:26 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two trials consisting of 182 preterm infants fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Mean gestational age of patients included was 28 weeks. In one trial, patients had to be intubated and ventilated for RDS to be eligible for the study. In the other trial, RDS was not mentioned as an inclusion criteria; however, the vast majority of infants in the study received surfactant. No individual trial showed a significant difference in mortality. One of the trials was stopped early because of an increase in deaths in the AT group. The pooled analysis for mortality within the first week of life showed a typical relative risk of 2.67 (95% CI 0.72 to 9.83) in favour of the control group. Only the trial that was stopped early followed the infants long enough to report neonatal mortality. This trial reported 7 deaths (11.5%) in the AT group and two deaths (3.3%) in the placebo group within 28 days of life. Secondary outcomes included days of mechanical ventilation and supplemental oxygen which were only reported in 1 trial. Both outcomes were in favour of the control group and statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05).</P>

<P>Preterm infants with RDS are unlikely to benefit from AT treatment and may be harmed.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-01-08 11:50:14 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Antithrombin (AT), a potent inhibitor of the reactions of the coagulation cascade, is a glycoprotein synthesized by the liver. Although the name, antithrombin, implies that it works only on thrombin, it inhibits other coagulation enzymes as well (activated factors IX, X, XI and XII) (<LINK REF="REF-Roemisch-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roemisch 2002</LINK>). The ability of AT to limit coagulation through multiple pathways makes it one of the primary natural anticoagulant proteins. The well-recognised association between inherited AT deficiency and the risk of venous thrombosis in adults points to the importance of AT as a modulator of blood coagulation (<LINK REF="REF-Bick-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bick 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Healthy neonates have physiologically low levels of AT as compared with adults (<LINK REF="REF-Hathaway-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hathaway 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Andrew-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andrew 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Andrew-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andrew 1988</LINK>). Activities of AT are decreased in preterm (<LINK REF="REF-Peters-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peters 1985</LINK>) and critically ill infants, such as those with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) (<LINK REF="REF-van-den-Berg-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">van den Berg 1989</LINK>). RDS is an acute lung disease in preterm infants that is characterized by diffuse atelectasis, high permeability edema, hyaline membrane formation and right to left shunting of pulmonary blood flow. The primary cause of neonatal RDS is surfactant deficiency in the immature lung (<LINK REF="REF-Avery-1959" TYPE="REFERENCE">Avery 1959</LINK>) and surfactant replacement has significantly reduced mortality and morbidity from neonatal RDS (<LINK REF="REF-Soll-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soll 1992</LINK>). However, sometimes residual lung injury remains despite surfactant therapy.</P>
<P>It was hypothesised that increased thrombin formation due to acquired AT deficiency contributes to the progression and abnormal resolution of neonatal RDS. In animals studies, unopposed intravascular thrombin activity leads to an increasing endothelial permeability resulting in pulmonary oedema (<LINK REF="REF-Malik-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malik 1987</LINK>). Intravascular thrombin formation also contributes to pulmonary hypertension by vasoconstriction in rabbits (<LINK REF="REF-Malik-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malik 1987</LINK>). In the extravascular lung compartment, thrombin may inhibit surfactant function and therefore contribute to the progression of neonatal RDS (<LINK REF="REF-Seeger-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seeger 1993</LINK>). The effects of acquired AT deficiency on the regulation of neonatal thrombin formation have been studied extensively during the course of RDS in preterm infants. Schmidt demonstrated a strong direct relationship between the activation of the clotting system, the depletion of AT activity, and the severity of RDS (<LINK REF="REF-Schmidt-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmidt 1992</LINK>). These observations were later confirmed and extended by Brus (<LINK REF="REF-Brus-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brus 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>It was therefore reasonable to hypothesize that unopposed thrombin activity may contribute to the progression of neonatal diseases that are accompanied by hypercoagulopathy and that antithrombotic therapy with AT might improve clinical outcomes of preterm infants with RDS.</P>

<P>The relevant studies were reviewed for methodological quality by two review authors (DB, DM). Areas of disagreement were discussed with a third review author (BS) and consensus had to be reached before analysis of the results. Criteria for assessing methodological quality were: adequate randomization, allocation concealment, blinding of parents and caregivers and assessors of outcome, completeness of follow-up (&gt; 95%) in randomized subjects for the primary outcome. All criteria were defined as "yes", "no" or "unsure". These data were entered into the table "Characteristic of Included Studies".</P>
<P>In addition, the following issues were evaluated and entered into the Risk of Bias table:</P>
<P>1. Sequence generation: Was the allocation sequence adequately generated? </P>
<P>For each included study, we described the method used to generate the allocation sequence as: adequate (any truly random process e.g. random number table; computer random number generator); inadequate (any nonrandom process e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number); or unclear. </P>
<P>2. Allocation concealment: Was allocation adequately concealed?</P>
<P>For each included study, we described the method used to conceal the allocation sequence as: adequate (e.g. telephone or central randomization; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes); inadequate (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth); or unclear. </P>
<P>3. Blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessors: Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study? At study entry? At the time of outcome assessment? </P>
<P>For each included study, we described the methods used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We assessed the methods as: adequate, inadequate or unclear for participants; adequate, inadequate or unclear for study personnel; and adequate, inadequate or unclear for outcome assessors and specific outcomes assessed. </P>
<P>4. Incomplete outcome data: Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed? </P>
<P>For each included study and for each outcome, we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We stated whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomized participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. We assessed methods as: adequate (&lt; 20% missing data); inadequate (&gt; 20% missing data) or unclear. </P>
<P>5. Selective outcome reporting: Are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting? </P>
<P>For each included study, we assessed the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias as: adequate (where it is clear that all of the study's pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported); inadequate (where not all the study's pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported); or unclear. </P>
<P>6. Other sources of bias: Was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a high risk of bias? </P>
<P>For each included study, we described any important concerns regarding other possible sources of bias (for example, whether there was a potential source of bias related to the specific study design or whether the trial was stopped early due to some data-dependent process). We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as: yes; no; or unclear.</P>

<P>The electronic search strategy yielded a total of 1360 citations: 23 (PubMed), 1145 (Embase), 192 (Central). After reading the titles/abstracts, six articles were identified as potentially relevant and full text versions were obtained. Two reviewers independent of each other identified these studies with good inter-observer agreement (Cohens unweighted kappa = 0.8, SE = 0.05). Handsearching abstracts of the American Society of Pediatric Research (SPR) and European Society of Pediatric Research (ESPR) meetings (1983 to 2005) yielded three potentially relevant citations, one of them already identified by the electronic search. The other two were finally regarded as not relevant by both reviewer authors (DB, DM) after independent review. Crosschecking the references of the six articles did not yield any additional studies. All six studies were performed in different countries (Italy, Germany, Austria, Turkey, Canada, and the US) and were published in English language. Contact of experts in the field and pharmaceutical companies did not reveal any additional studies.</P>

<P>Two trials consisting of 182 preterm infants, were included in the systematic review.<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Schmidt-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Schmidt 1998</LINK> studied 122 preterm infants with birth weights between 750 and 1900 g who required mechanical ventilation for RDS. Only infants with moderate to severe disease were included. AT was given as a loading dose of 2 ml/kg (equivalent to 100 U/kg of AT) intravenously, followed by 1 ml/kg (equivalent to 50 U/kg) every 6 h for 48 h.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Fulia-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fulia 2003</LINK> examined whether the administration of AT decreases the risk of cerebral hemorrhage in premature infants. They studied 60 infants who were born at less than 30 weeks' gestation and who had an AT activity less than 40% in the first 12 h of life. Only infants without sonographic evidence of ICH were enrolled. AT was given as a loading dose of 2 ml/kg (equivalent to 100 U/kg of AT) intravenously, followed by 1 ml/kg (equivalent to 50 U/kg) every 8 h for 48 h. RDS was not mentioned as an inclusion criteria, however 27/30 infants randomized to the placebo group and 28/30 infants randomized to the AT group received surfactant. The study report does not explicitly describe whether surfactant was given for treatment or prophylaxis; the study states that "all newborns received the same exogenous surfactant". It is likely that the majority of infants in this study cohort suffered from at least mild RDS, an assumption that is further supported by the relatively low rates of antenatal steroids in this study (53.3% in the AT group, 56.6% in the placebo group). The study by <LINK REF="STD-Fulia-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fulia 2003</LINK> was included following independent agreement of the two reviewer authors (DB &amp; DM) despite RDS being included as an inclusion criterion; this decision is a post hoc decision that was also supported by the third review author (BS).</P>

<BR/>Primary outcome<BR/>Mortality (Outcomes 1.1 - 1.3):</B>
</P>
<P>We assessed mortality at three different time points. Only Schmidt reported mortality to 28 days (RR 3.5, 95%CI 0.76, 16.18) (Outcome table 1.1) and mortality before discharge from hospital (RR 2.33, 95%CI 0.63, 8.61) (Outcome 1.3). Data on mortality at seven days were provided in both studies (outcome table 1.2). Schmidt found an increase in mortality at seven days in the AT group which was of borderline statistical significance (RR 7.00, 95%CI 0.89, 55.2; RD 0.10, 95%CI 0.01, 0.18). The meta-analysis of both trials suggests a trend towards increased mortality at seven days in the AT groups, but this did not reach statistical significance (typical RR 2.67, 95%CI 0.72, 9.83; typical RD 0.05, 95%CI -0.01, 0.12).</P>

</B>
<BR/>Neither of the two studies was able to detect a significant difference in the overall incidence of IVH between the AT and the placebo group. <LINK REF="STD-Schmidt-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Schmidt 1998</LINK> showed a trend towards a higher combined rate of any intraventricular hemorrhage and periventricular echodensities on day seven, which was still present after adjustment for birth weight and gender stratum as well as the presence or absence of intraventricular and periventricular lesions at baseline: the adjusted odds ratio was 2.30 (95% CI, 0.86 to 6.16; p = 0.06). In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Fulia-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fulia 2003</LINK> there was no significant difference in the overall incidence of IVH 26.7% vs 30% (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.40, 1.99) but they reported a higher incidence of IVH Grade 3 in the placebo group in contrast with the AT group (21.4% vs 13.7%, no CI provided). <LINK REF="STD-Fulia-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fulia 2003</LINK> did not report any cases with PVED (grade 4 IVH), while in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Schmidt-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Schmidt 1998</LINK>, seven infants in the AT group and six infants in the control group developed PVED (grade 4 IVH) (outcome table 01.06).

</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-09-11 10:54:17 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although AT concentrates have been available for more than 20 years, the evidence to justify their use in neonatal RDS remains weak. Our systematic review of this therapy in newborn infants did not document clinically important benefits of neonatal AT therapy. Moreover, there is some suggestion that AT therapy may be harmful in preterm infants with moderate to severe RDS.</P>
<P>Only two studies with a total of 182 preterm infants fulfilled the inclusion criteria for our systematic review. Our primary outcome, mortality, did not reach statistical significance. There is a trend towards increased mortality in the AT group that is consistent among the assessment of this outcome at three different time points. However, these findings are mostly driven by the study from <LINK REF="STD-Schmidt-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Schmidt 1998</LINK>. This study was stopped early because of an observed imbalance in deaths between the treatment groups. Early stopping of a trial may have lead to a biased result, overestimating the real difference in mortality between the 2 groups. However randomization in this study was halted only six patients short of the planned sample size of 128 patients.</P>
<P>The duration of mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy was significantly prolonged in the group that was treated with AT-concentrate. All other secondary outcomes describing the clinical course of the patients showed no difference between the groups. Like most of the results in this systematic review, the significant findings in favour of the control group are based on data from only one of the trials because of inconsistency in the reported outcomes. However, the study by <LINK REF="STD-Schmidt-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Schmidt 1998</LINK>, including 122 patients, is a study with rigorous methodology: adequate method of generating randomisation sequence, allocation concealment, blinding of parents, caregivers and outcome assessors, complete follow-up. Therefore the significant findings in favour of the control group for the duration of mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy are likely to be true and different interpretations for the treatment failure of AT concentrate in the preterm population with RDS need to be considered. Acquired AT deficiency and increased thrombin formation may just be coincidental markers of the disease process, and therefore thrombin inhibition may not alter the course of neonatal RDS. Alternatively, as <LINK REF="STD-Schmidt-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Schmidt 1998</LINK> speculate "thrombin may indeed play a pathogenetic role in neonatal acute lung injury, but AT concentrate was not sufficiently effective in suppressing unopposed thrombin activity".</P>
<P>One of the strengths of this meta-analysis is its comprehensive and sensitive literature search. In addition to an electronic search, we hand searched conference abstracts of the two most important paediatric conferences for a time period of more than 20 years and contacted pharmaceutical industry and experts. We did not apply a language restriction to our literature search. Therefore we consider it very unlikely that our literature search may have missed relevant trials and are confident, that this systematic review summarizes all the presently available evidence from RCTs on AT for RDS in preterm infants.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The results of this systematic review suggest that AT therapy may increase mortality in preterm infants with RDS. Based on one well-designed trial, the review also shows that the administration of AT concentrate during the first two days of life prolongs the time on mechanical ventilation and the time needing supplemental oxygen. The potential harm together with the certain lack of benefit strongly argue against the routine use of AT concentrate for the treatment of neonatal RDS in preterm infants</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Possible adverse effects of antithrombotic agents have to be carefully considered in this high-risk population. Future studies for AT in RDS are not indicated. The role of AT administration in sick neonates for indications other than RDS should only be considered in the context of well-designed controlled clinical trials.</P>

<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>60 infants who were born at less than 30 weeks' gestation and who had an AT activity less than 40% in the first 12 hours of life. Only infants without sonographic evidence of ICH were enrolled. RDS was not specifically mentioned as an inclusion criteria, however 27/30 infants in the placebo group and 28/30 infants in the AT group received surfactant.</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>AT was given as a loading dose of 2ml/kg (equivalent to 100 U/kg of AT) intravenously, followed by 1 ml/kg (equivalent to 50 U/kg) every 8h for 48h to 30 infants. A 5% glucose solution was used as placebo in 30 infants.</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>The primary outcome was the risk of intraventricular hemorrhages. Overall, 8 clinical outcomes were reported: surfactant use, pneumothorax, pulmonary hemorrhage, patent ductus arteriosus, use of inotropes, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular hemorrhages (grade 0-4 according to Papile), death.</P>

</CHAR_METHODS>
<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>122 preterm infants with birth weights between 750 and 1900g who required mechanical ventilation for RDS. Only infants with moderate to severe disease were included, i.e. those with a ratio of arterial to alveolar oxygen pressure (a/A PO2) less than 0.3 after the first dose of exogenous surfactant when the infants were between 2 and 12 hours old.</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>AT was given as a loading dose of 2ml/kg (equivalent to 100 U/kg of AT) intravenously, followed by 1 ml/kg (equivalent to 50 U/kg) every 6h for 48h to 61 infants. A 1% human albumin solution was used as placebo in 61 infants</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>The primary outcome was the ratio of arterial to alveolar oxygen pressure a/A P02. Overall, 9 clinical outcomes were reported: measures of gas exchange (a/A PO2 and the ventilator efficiency index), the median duration of mechanical ventilation and need for supplemental oxygen, rates of pulmonary air leaks and patent ductus arteriosus, rates of ICH, clinically apparent bleeding from puncture sides, the umbilicus, nasogastric tubes, or endotracheal tubes, and mortality.</P>
