<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Psychological interventions are commonly used in the management of anxiety and certain types of psychological treatments, such as cognitive behaviour therapy, are well suited to needs of individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI). An advantage of these interventions is that, given their highly structured content, they are amenable to specialised adaptation for memory, attention and problem solving impairments, reflecting the difficulties people with TBI often experience. This review identified three randomised controlled trials in the area of psychological treatments for anxiety after TBI. Some evidence was found for the effectiveness of the following interventions: cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for treatment of acute stress disorder following mild TBI, and combining CBT and neurorehabilitation for treatment of general anxiety symptoms in people with mild to moderate TBI. The ability to make strong conclusions on the effectiveness of these approaches is limited by the small number of trials available for pooling of data, especially trials with similar conditions and participants.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Psychological treatments are commonly used in the management of anxiety. Certain types of psychological treatments are well suited to needs of people with traumatic brain injury (TBI). We have systematically reviewed studies examining the effectiveness of these approaches for TBI. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of psychological treatments for anxiety in people with TBI.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the following databases up until March 2006: Cochrane Injuries Group's specialised register, Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group's specialised register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, ERIC, and PsycBITE<SUP>TM</SUP>. Additionally, key journals were handsearched and reference lists of included trials were examined to identify further studies meeting inclusion criteria.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials of psychological treatments for anxiety, with or without pharmacological treatment, for people with TBI were included in the review. Pharmacological treatments for anxiety in isolation (without psychological intervention) were excluded. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors independently assessed methodological quality and extracted data from the included trials.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Three trials were identified in this review as satisfying inclusion criteria. Results of all three trials were evaluated, however, one of these trials had compromised methodological quality and, therefore the focus was placed on the other two trials. Data were not pooled due to the heterogeneity between trials. The first trial (n = 24) showed a benefit of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) in people with mild TBI and acute stress disorder. Fewer people receiving CBT had diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) at post-treatment compared to the control supportive counselling group, with maintenance of treatment gains found at six-month follow up. The second trial (n = 20) showed that post-treatment anxiety symptomatology of people with mild to moderate TBI was lower in the combined CBT and neurorehabilitation group compared to the no intervention control group.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>This review provides some evidence for the effectiveness of CBT for treatment of acute stress disorder following mild TBI and CBT combined with neurorehabilitation for targeting general anxiety symptomatology in people with mild to moderate TBI. These findings need to be viewed in light of the small number, small sample size and heterogeneous characteristics of current trials published in this area. More trials focusing on comparable psychological interventions, severity of injury of participants and diagnosis of anxiety disorder(s) are needed. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-07-31 18:15:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Anxiety is common in the general population and individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI) are thought to be at increased risk of developing the condition (<LINK REF="REF-Hiott-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hiott 2002</LINK>). Anxiety may manifest as symptomatology, which is frequently linked to the process of adjustment to the injury and may present as a feeling of apprehension or fear, or as a diagnosable disorder such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). The consequences of anxiety following brain injury are far reaching, negatively impacting upon rehabilitation outcomes, functional ability, interpersonal relationships and employment outlook. A biopsychosocial model of adjustment after injury has been proposed for the development of post-TBI anxiety (<LINK REF="REF-Gainotti-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gainotti 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kendall-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kendall 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lishman-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lishman 1973</LINK>). Within this model, the role of direct (medical, neurological and neuropsychological) and indirect (biographic, personal and environmental) antecedent factors are emphasised, with both direct and indirect components often playing a role in the development of emotional problems (<LINK REF="REF-Lishman-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lishman 1973</LINK>). Mediating factors are also highlighted with variables such as cognitive appraisals and coping and adjustment styles of the individual interacting with these antecedent factors (<LINK REF="REF-Kendall-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kendall 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is often difficult to accurately determine the occurrence of anxiety disorders following TBI because the clinical presentation of people with TBI is complex (<LINK REF="STD-Williams-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2003a</LINK>). Individuals with TBI commonly have difficulties in cognitive, behavioural and emotional functioning (<LINK REF="REF-Ponsford-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ponsford 1995</LINK>). These problems frequently overlap with presentation of anxiety symptoms, with the severity of the TBI compounding the level of anxiety. Estimates of how frequently anxiety symptoms occur following TBI range from 18% to 60% (<LINK REF="REF-Hibbard-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hibbard 1998</LINK>). Studies examining specific anxiety disorders have found that in people with brain injury, 24% to 27% were diagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder and 4% to 6% with panic disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Fann-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fann 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Reekum-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Reekum 1996</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Bryant-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bryant 2000</LINK> found that 27.1% of patients who sustained a severe TBI developed post-traumatic stress disorder at six months after the injury.</P>
<P>A number of approaches have been developed for the psychological management of anxiety; for example, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), psychoanalytic therapy and psycho-education. Psychological-based treatments are commonly used in the management of anxiety in individuals with and without a brain injury (<LINK REF="REF-Hiott-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hiott 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hodgson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hodgson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2003a</LINK>). Indeed, certain psychological interventions (for example, CBT) have been found to be clearly effective for the management of anxiety in general mental health groups (<LINK REF="REF-Deacon-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deacon 2004</LINK>). Some have argued that CBT is well suited to the needs of people with TBI because of the structured nature of the treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Manchester-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manchester 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ponsford-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ponsford 1995</LINK>); however, these programs require adjustment to account for difficulties related to the TBI (for example, memory and executive impairments as well as inability to make day-to-day decisions).</P>
<P>In terms of non-psychological interventions, pharmacotherapy is also used in the management of anxiety with or without psychological treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Balon-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balon 2004</LINK>). It has been noted, however, that an increased risk of medical side effects (for example, nausea, dizziness and insomnia) has been reported with pharmacological treatments in the TBI population, and hence psychological treatments may be preferred during the initial phase of anxiety treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Hiott-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hiott 2002</LINK>). Cognitive side effects of pharmacological treatments (for example, slowed information processing speed) have also been reported, further attenuating already compromised cognitive functioning. Other less commonly used treatments include psychosurgery (<LINK REF="REF-Ruck-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruck 2003</LINK>) and complementary and alternative therapies, such as aromatherapy and homeopathy (<LINK REF="REF-Kessler-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kessler 2001</LINK>); however, empirical evidence for the effectiveness of these alternative treatments for TBI populations is very limited.</P>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-07-31 18:15:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Given that psychological treatments for anxiety require specialised adaptation for the individual needs of people with TBI, few randomised controlled trials have examined the efficacy of these specific programs. However, because these treatments are commonly used and are recommended in the management of anxiety in people with neurological conditions (<LINK REF="STD-Williams-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2003a</LINK>), it is important to evaluate the empirical evidence that currently exists in this area. Although a number of narrative reviews focusing on the treatment of anxiety in general mental health groups have been published (<LINK REF="REF-Balon-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balon 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Deacon-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deacon 2004</LINK>), to date there are very few systematic reviews focusing on anxiety interventions. In particular, there is no systematic review focusing on treatment of anxiety in TBI and hence the strongest level of evidence is not available. This systematic review examines the evidence for psychological treatments for anxiety in people with TBI. Focus is placed on anxiety symptomatology as well as diagnosis of specific anxiety disorders. The results of this review can assist clinicians in the management of these conditions for people with TBI.</P>

<P>The most current search on electronic databases was conducted in March 2006 and this yielded a total of 3038 references. A total of three RCTs were identified which met the inclusion criteria. An additional 25 trials addressing anxiety after acquired brain injury were identified but these were excluded because they were either not an RCT or did not include a sample consisting of 80% or greater of participants with TBI. Investigation of other specified sources for identifying studies yielded no additional studies meeting inclusion criteria.

<P>There was too much heterogeneity among the studies to permit meta-analysis.

<BR/>This study examined psychological therapy for people with mild TBI diagnosed with a specific anxiety disorder, comparing CBT and SC groups which were similar at baseline in terms of anxiety symptomatology and presence of acute stress disorder. Post-treatment and six-month follow-up scores on anxiety outcome measures, controlling for pre-treatment symptom severity, were compared across groups. Results indicated that fewer participants met the criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the CBT group than the SC group, both at post-treatment (&#967;<SUP>2 </SUP>= 6.75, df = 1, P &lt; 0.05) and six-month follow up (&#967;<SUP>2</SUP> = 4.44, df = 1, P &lt; 0.05). Additionally, significant differences were found between groups at post-treatment on the CAPS frequency (F = 12.88, df = 1, 23, P &lt; 0.01) and intensity (F = 11.54, df = 1, 23, P &lt; 0.01) subscales, IES intrusions (F = 9.44, df = 1, 23, P &lt; 0.01) and avoidance (F = 47.49, df = 1, 23, P &lt; 0.01) subscales and the BAI (F = 3.99, df =1, 23, P = 0.05) with the CBT group achieving lower (better functioning) scores compared to the SC group on all of these measures. Maintenance of treatment gains were reported at six-months follow-up, particularly in relation to PTSD symptoms, with the CBT group achieving significantly lower scores on the frequency (F = 5.40, df = 1, 23, P &lt; 0.05) and intensity ( F = 6.75, df = 1, 23, P &lt; 0.05) subscales of the CAPS and the intrusions (F = 6.26, df = 1, 23, P &lt; 0.05) and avoidance (F = 9.58, df = 1, 23, P &lt; 0.01) subscales of the IES.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-07-31 18:27:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Principal findings</HEADING>
<P>The aim of this review was to identify effective psychological interventions for management of anxiety following TBI. Unfortunately, only three identified trials focusing on distinct areas of the literature were found and therefore it was not possible to meaningfully pool data across studies. This review focuses on three interventions in the context of the particular participant characteristics of each of the trials.</P>
<P>There was support for the effectiveness of treating acute stress disorder using CBT techniques following mild TBI in comparison to a SC control group. Improvements were found in general anxiety symptomatology, anxiety symptomatology related to PTSD and less frequent diagnosis of PTSD. Therapy gains assessed at post-intervention were also maintained at six-months follow up, particularly with respect to PTSD but not for general anxiety symptomatology. Overall, the methodological quality of the trial investigating this comparison was moderate. The study investigators, however, did not state whether random allocation of participants to groups was concealed or whether participants for whom outcome measures were available received the treatment or control condition as allocated. It is possible that trial findings may be biased for these reasons.</P>
<P>There is also evidence for the use of combining CBT and NR for targeting general anxiety symptomatology in people with mild to moderate TBI. A methodological strength of the trial investigating these techniques was concealed random allocation of participants to treatment groups. Although overall methodological quality of this study was moderate, the trial may have been affected by an inadequate number of participants being assessed at post-treatment (69%) and by participants for whom outcome measures were available not receiving the treatment or control condition as allocated.</P>
<P>Limited empirical support was found for IPR therapy compared to controls who received no interpersonal skills feedback. Although general anxiety levels were reduced in the IRP group, the methodological quality of the trial that examined this comparison was compromised. This trial is highly subject to bias because it is unclear whether random allocation to groups was concealed, if IPR and control groups were similar at baseline regarding the key outcomes, and if between-group statistical comparisons examining IPR and control groups were conducted. Given that the methodological quality of this trial is compromised, focus was placed on the other two identified studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Strengths and weaknesses of findings </HEADING>
<P>In interpreting the results of the review it is important to keep in mind that assessing anxiety in TBI populations is complex. Difficulties in assessment apply in particular to differential diagnosis of symptoms of anxiety disorders in people with TBI; for example, the overlapping symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder with the inflexible behaviour often characterised by people with brain injury (<LINK REF="STD-Williams-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2003a</LINK>). Assessment of anxiety is further complicated by the availability of appropriate anxiety measures for people with brain injury. Anxiety scales, including those used in the trials of this review, have typically been developed for non-TBI populations and may have limited validity for people with brain injury (<LINK REF="REF-Bowen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bowen 1998</LINK>), thus increasing the possibility of false classifications occurring. Additionally, the distinction between statistically versus clinical significant reduction in anxiety symptomatology scores is highlighted. Although a statistically significant post-treatment reduction in anxiety may be found in the trial, this information is often limited in terms of applicability to practice. It is useful to set an a priori outcome that is judged to be an adequate clinical response to treatment, for example, a 25% or 50% reduction in anxiety scores from baseline. In addition, it is acknowledged that broadening the scope of this review to include people with acquired brain impairment would have resulted in increased adaptability of these findings to clinical practice; on the other hand, by focusing on TBI this review was able to address issues specific to this population.</P>
<P>There are also areas of this research which have not been investigated. In particular, trials are needed that examine psychological treatments specifically for people with severe TBI, given that no study in this area was identified. The development of post-TBI anxiety follows a different path depending on the severity of the injury (<LINK REF="REF-Ponsford-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ponsford 1995</LINK>). Individuals with severe TBI often have a distinct profile of functioning compared to people with mild to moderate TBI in terms of degree of memory, executive, and insight difficulties, which may in turn impact anxiety levels. Further trials are also needed which use paediatric populations, given that no trial was identified examining psychological treatment for anxiety in children with TBI and that interventions targeting children need to address specific developmental issues.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Strengths and weaknesses of included studies</HEADING>
<P>A major strength of the two main trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bryant-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bryant 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tiersky-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tiersky 2005</LINK>) is their methodological quality, assessed by the PEDro scale as moderate. Both of these studies also focused on psychological treatments which are clinically suitable, particularly to people with TBI, and recommended as being suitable for people with neurological conditions (<LINK REF="STD-Williams-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2003a</LINK>). However, the findings from this review must be viewed in light of the small sample size as well as the heterogeneous characteristics of trials published in this area (for example, the types of psychological intervention and anxiety diagnoses examined).</P>
<P>This review also identified 20 studies examining psychological treatment of anxiety following TBI which did not employ an RCT design, including group (non-randomised) comparisons, case series and single participant designs. This suggests that although there are considerable data available, there may be barriers to conducting research in this area preventing the use of the more powerful design of an RCT. Given that the majority of these 20 studies (80%) used single participant design, these barriers appear to lie in the inability to obtain sufficient numbers of participants for group studies. Fostering collaboration between research groups would provide an avenue to overcome this difficulty.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Findings in relation of previous research</HEADING>
<P>These findings contribute to the understanding of psychological treatments for anxiety in people with TBI given there are no systematic reviews currently available summarising the evidence for effectiveness of these approaches with this clinical population. With only three identified trials, this review highlights that research in this area is not well developed. The ability to pool data from across studies would be greatly improved with future studies focusing on comparable psychological interventions, severity of injury of participants, and diagnosis of anxiety disorder(s).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>This review provides some evidence for the effectiveness of CBT for treatment of acute stress disorder following mild TBI, and CBT combined with NR for targeting general anxiety symptomatology in people with mild-moderate TBI. Additionally, when including samples of individuals with a diagnosed anxiety disorder, results indicate that treatment effects are linked to disorder rather than general anxiety, suggesting that further research examining anxiety disorders, such as PTSD, should focus on interventions which are tailored to the disorder. These conclusions are based on a small number of trials with small sample sizes (ranging from 16 to 24). More research using larger samples sizes as well as homogeneous samples and interventions are needed to confirm these findings.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>This review did not pool data across studies due to the heterogeneity of studies in this area and, therefore, results of the review are based on individual studies. In order to combine data across trials we recommend further trials which focus on comparable psychological interventions, severity of injury of participants and diagnosis of anxiety disorder(s). The findings of the review also indicate that there some areas of this research which have not been examined. Additional RCTs using samples with a broader range of injury severity, anxiety diagnoses and age (including children) are needed. </P>
