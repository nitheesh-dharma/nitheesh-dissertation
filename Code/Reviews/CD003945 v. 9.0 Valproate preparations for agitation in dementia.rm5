<P>October 2008: Two new controlled studies were reviewed (Tariot, 2005; Herrman, 2007).These studies were incorporated into a meta analysis that examined the effect of valproate preparations on agitation as measured by the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Index score and by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale.

<P>Both studies confirmed the Cochrane report of 2004 (Lonergan, 2004) that valproate preparations showed no effect on agitation as compared with placebo controls.

<P>An updated review (October 2008) of valproate treatment of agitation in demented patients failed to show any improvement in agitation among treated patients compared with those not receiving treatment, and also demonstrated a higher rate of harmful effects, such as falls,infections and gastrointestinal disorders (diarrhoea, nausea) among those receiving valproate preparations. Although further research on the value of valproate preparations is indicated, current evidence does not support use of this drug to control agitation of people with dementia.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-11-15 22:51:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Agitation affects up to 70% of older people with dementia. Valproic acid derivatives have been used for the past 10 years to control agitation in dementia, but no systematic review of the effectiveness of this treatment has been published to date. A systematic review of 2004 examined three randomised, placebo-controlled trials of the effect of valproate therapy on older people with dementia who were agitated. The review was updated (October 2008) to include two additional studies.</P>

<P>To determine whether evidence supports the use of valproate preparations in the treatment of agitation of people with dementia.</P>

<P>We searched <A HREF="http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois">ALOIS</A> - the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group&#8217;s Specialized Register on 30 July 2010 using the terms: valproic OR valproate OR divalproex.

<P>Randomized, placebo-controlled trials with concealed allocation where agitation and dementia of participants were assessed</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-02-01 21:26:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Meta-analysis in 2004 of the pooled results was limited because of the following problems.<BR/>
</P>
<P>In Porsteinsson 2001, although the physicians having direct responsibility for patient care were blinded, a non-blinded physician, who had no direct contact with these physicians, adjusted divalproex sodium dosage on the basis of reports from blinded raters and from confidential laboratory reports. Therefore, because the physician who controlled therapy knew which patients were receiving divalproex, the trial did not satisfy the criterion of concealed allocation.</P>
<P>In Tariot 2001, 54% of the treated patients dropped out compared with 29% of control patients. Of all treated patients, 22% dropped out because of adverse effects, and the study had to be discontinued prematurely.</P>
<P>The third trial (Sival 2002) had a cross-over design. No results from the first phase of the study were available, and although the statistical section stated, "the t-test for independent samples is used to analyse the two-period cross-over trial", because the samples were not independent - they are the same patients in the treatment and placebo groups - a question must be raised about the correctness of the analyses.</P>
<P>The valproate preparation used in the trials varied - one used short-acting sodium valproate, one long-acting divalproex sodium, and the third early-onset acting divalproex sodium. Average doses differed (480 mg/d - 1000 mg/d), as did duration of therapy (3 weeks - 6 weeks), and ways of evaluating patients and their response to therapy.</P>
<P>A limited meta-analysis, pooling the results concerning adverse effects (Porsteinsson 2001, Tariot 2001) revealed the following: sedation occurred more frequently in patients treated with valproic acid than in controls. Urinary tract infection was more common among patients treated with valproic acid than controls.</P>
<P>An updated systematic review (October 2008) of two new studies (Tariot 2005, Herrmann 2007) applied meta-analysis to the effect of valproate on agitation in demented patients and also combined these studies with the earlier reports to examine adverse effects among valproate treated patients. Because the study of Herrmann et al involved a cross-over design, only those results from the first part of this study were included in the updated review.</P>
<P>The new meta-analysis of pooled results showed no improvement of agitation among valproate treated patients, compared with controls, and showed an increase in adverse events (falls, infection, gastrointestinal disorders) among valproate treated patients.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-11-14 15:50:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>The updated review corroborates the earlier findings that valproate preparations are ineffective in treating agitation among demented patients, and that valproate therapy is associated with an unacceptable rate of adverse effects. More research on the use of valproate preparations for agitation of people with dementia is needed. On the basis of current evidence, valproate therapy cannot be recommended for management of agitation in dementia.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2010-10-04 10:51:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-11-14 15:52:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>Agitation has been reported in up to 70% of people with dementia. No formal definition of agitation has been published, although a widely accepted definition is: "inappropriate verbal, vocal, or motor activity that is not explained by needs or confusion per se" (<LINK REF="REF-Billig-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Billig 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cohen_x002d_Mansfield-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen-Mansfield 1989</LINK>). The descriptors of agitation include wandering, crying out, aggressiveness, repetitive movements, and uncooperative behaviour. Agitation of demented patients has been shown to worsen caregiver burden, increase the risk of injury, and add to the need for institutionalizations.</P>
<P>Attempts to control agitation in dementia with behavioural modification, benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, antidepressants, and beta-blocking agents have yielded varying results. During the past decade valproic acid, a drug employed initially to treat epilepsy (<LINK REF="REF-Trimble-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trimble 1984</LINK>), has been used to manage agitation of people with dementia (<LINK REF="REF-Herrmann-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herrmann 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kasckow-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kasckow 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Porsteinsson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Porsteinsson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sival-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sival 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tariot-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tariot 2001</LINK>). The mechanism of action of valproic acid is unclear; suggested mechanisms included enhancement of the intracerebral neurotransmitting agent, gamma butyric acid, anti-manic action, and mood stabilizing effect (<LINK REF="REF-Lon-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lon 1995</LINK>). Recently, a more readily tolerated pro-drug for valproate, divalproex, has been used. This drug differs slightly from valproic acid in that peak blood levels occur later (3 to 6 hrs, compared with 3 hrs), but the dosage and half-life of this drug are identical to those of valproic acid. Valproic acid has a record of low incidence of adverse effects. Despite some reports describing favourable effects of valproic acid, no clear consensus has emerged concerning the value of this drug. To date, no systematic reviews or meta-analyses of the effect of valproic acid or valproate preparations on agitation in dementia have been published.</P>
<P>A recent systematic review of the effect of the neuroleptic, haloperidol, on agitation of people with dementia revealed problems in the methodology used by different authors (<LINK REF="REF-Lonergan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lonergan 2002</LINK>). Interpretation of study results was difficult because of variations in the description of agitation, in the dosage and duration of drug treatment, and in the assessment of response to therapy. These findings must therefore influence the interpretation of the results of all studies on treatment of agitation in dementia, including the present review.</P>
<P>With these considerations in mind the question "what is the effect of valproic acid on agitation in demented patients?" was explored from several points of view:</P>
<UL>
<LI>The effect of valproate preparations on overall response of agitation to treatment</LI>
<LI>The effect of valproate compounds on one or more specific manifestations of agitation (e.g. wandering, aggression, crying out)</LI>
<LI>Examination of adverse effects of valproate treatment, and how adverse effects contributed to drop-outs among study populations.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The initial review, here updated to October 2008, was designed to provide guidance to clinicians and to researchers who are interested in the use of valproate derivatives for agitation in demented patients.</P>

<P>Types of studies included only unconfounded, randomised, placebo-controlled trials with concealed allocation of subjects. Trials had to have included pre- and post-treatment assessment of agitation. Interrupted time series trials were excluded. Length of trial and number of measurements did not influence the selection of trials for study. Where indicated, individual patient data were requested for further examination.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2009-05-11 14:38:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The report included participants of either sex and of any age (although almost all were 65 years of age or older). Both inpatients and outpatients (with or without caregivers) were included. The presence and type of dementia, unclassified or diagnosed, were identified according to the classifications provided by DSM IV (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK>) and ICD-10 (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1991</LINK>). Studies prior to 1994 used criteria for dementia found in DSM III (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1980</LINK>) and DSM IIIR (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1987</LINK>). In the absence of these criteria other acceptable evidence such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (<LINK REF="REF-Folstein-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Folstein 1975</LINK>), psychiatric evaluation, psychological evaluation, or a medical evaluation were accepted. Subset analysis by type of dementia was carried out where the number of patients was sufficient; otherwise, patients were combined into the category of "dementia" regardless of type.</P>
<P>No formal definition of agitation has been published. Therefore, either the description, "inappropriate verbal, vocal, or motor activity that is not explained by needs or confusion per se." (<LINK REF="REF-Billig-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Billig 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cohen_x002d_Mansfield-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen-Mansfield 1989</LINK>), or other descriptive language (e.g., wandering, aggression, crying out, uncooperative behavior) provided by individual investigators to identify agitation was accepted. Because agitation is common in delirium, all studies had to have demonstrated that a clinical evaluation was undertaken to rule out delirium, and all studies had to have ruled out other treatable causes of agitation (e.g. pain, infection, drug effect, urinary or faecal retention) prior to entering patients into the trial.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>At least one week of treatment with valproate preparations, of any dosage given by mouth, compared with placebo. Patients receiving chronic therapy with other psychoactive medications were excluded from the review.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2009-02-01 21:29:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For professionals and for non-professionals who care for demented patients, agitation is one of the most difficult behavioural problems to manage. The outcomes focus on the benefits and hazards of valproate treatment of demented patients who manifest agitation, and therefore should be meaningful to experts and non-experts alike. The most important of the outcomes were: overall effect of treatment on agitation; effect of treatment on one or more specific aspects of agitation; adverse effects of treatment; and withdrawal from treatment.</P>
<P>It would have been desirable to analyse response to treatment in terms of factors such as age and sex of patient, type of dementia, and type of agitation, but the number of patients available in the studies was not large enough to permit subgroup analysis. A more feasible approach was to consider the overall effect of treatment, particularly if it could be shown to modify specific manifestations of agitation, and to examine the effect of treatment on dropout rates.</P>
<P>For continuous or ordinal variables, such as psychometric test scores and clinical global impression scales, if the ordinal scale data appeared to approximate a normal distribution, or if analysis indicated that parametric tests were appropriate, outcome measures were treated as continuous data. A second approach, not excluding the first, was to dichotomise the data (e.g. improved versus not improved) and treat the variable as binary. For binary outcomes the Peto method of the typical odds ratio was used.</P>
<P>Where studies used a cross-over design, examination of the results was limited to the first part of the study.</P>

<P>Searching and screening of the results were be performed independently by two reviewers (ETL, JL). The reviewers selected trials for relevance and against defined inclusion criteria. Trials that did not meet the criteria were excluded. Reviewers' selection of trials were compared and the final list of studies was agreed by the reviewers.</P>
<P>Inclusion criteria: trials were ranked using one of the Cochrane approaches (<LINK REF="REF-Mulrow-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mulrow 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two reviewers (ETL, JL) independently estimated the quality of included studies. The Cochrane approach to assessing adequacy of allocation concealment was used:</P>
<P>1. Category A (adequate concealment). Allocation is determined by: 1) a centralized randomised scheme in which subjects are enrolled at a registry which codes and randomises the participants and notifies the investigator by telephone about treatment and control group allocation; 2) a randomizations controlled by a pharmacy; 3) coded containers with identical appearing capsules which are administered sequentially to participants; 4) an on-site or coded computer, given the allocations were in a locked, unreadable file that could be accessed only after inputting the characteristics of an enrolled subject; 5) the use of sequentially numbered and sealed, opaque envelopes; 6) combinations of the above.<BR/>2. Category B (unclear concealment). The report describes the allocation of treatment by: 1) the use of a list or table to allocate assignments; 2) the use of envelopes or of sealed envelopes to distribute medications; 3) a statement in the report to the effect that the report is randomised without further characterization.<BR/>3. Category C (inadequate). Allocation of treatment by: 1) alternation of subjects to treatment or control arms of the study; 2) use of "fixed data" such as birth dates, record numbers, days of the week; 3) allocation that is transparent such as an open list of random numbers of assignments. Unclear concealments have been shown to increase estimates of treatment effects compared with adequate methods of concealment.</P>
<P>Trials conforming to Categories A and B were accepted. Trials falling into category C were excluded from further study.</P>

<LI>Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis was applied to data obtained on every randomised patient, without exception. In the absence of ITT data, data for 'on-treatment analysis' were extracted and indicated as such.</LI>
<LI>For continuous variables, or ordinal variables approximated to continuous variables, outcomes of interest were the assessment score at the time point considered, and the change from baseline (i.e. pre-randomization or at randomization) at this point.</LI>
<LI>Where patients were not randomised and where treatment allocation was not concealed when titration periods were used, data from these titration periods were not extracted to assess safety or efficacy of valproic acid. For the same reason, data from follow-up periods were not extracted.</LI>
<LI>Data on adverse effects and drop-outs were recorded.</LI>
<LI>For some binary and ordinal outcomes (i.e. improved versus not improved) the end-point itself was of clinical relevance; because all patients, by definition, had the same initial score.</LI>
<LI>Where present, numerical scores such as those provided by Cohen-Mansfield (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen_x002d_Mansfield-1989b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen-Mansfield 1989b</LINK>) were used to measure response to treatment.</LI>

<P>For continuous or ordinal variables (e.g. psychometric test scores, clinical global impression scales (<LINK REF="REF-Guy-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guy 1976</LINK>), Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen_x002d_Mansfield-1989b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen-Mansfield 1989b</LINK>), if analyses indicated that parametric tests were appropriate, outcome measures were treated as continuous data; the data were be treated as continuous if ordinal scale data appeared to approximate a normal distribution.</P>
<P>Not excluding the above approach, data were concatenated into the two categories that best represent the contrasting states of interest, and the variable was treated as binary. For binary outcomes the Peto method of typical odds ratio was used. A test for heterogeneity of the treatment effect between the trials was done using a standard chi-square statistic. Where no heterogeneity was found, a fixed-effect parametric approach was taken. Where the included studies use the same outcome measures the method of weighted mean difference was to be used for meta-analysis. When different scales were used in the studies the method of standardized mean difference was used.</P>
<P>As indicated in the Background section, where different forms of valproic acid (e.g. divalproex or valproic acid) were used, subset analysis of the results was applied, and where different scales of assessment were used, again subset analysis was be applied to the results.</P>

<P>At the time of the original review, three trials met the inclusion criteria:</P>
<P>1. One study was conducted in Europe (<LINK REF="STD-Sival-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sival 2002</LINK>). Two studies were multi-site and from the United States (<LINK REF="STD-Porsteinsson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Porsteinsson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tariot-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tariot 2001</LINK>). All studies involved institutionalised patients.<BR/>2. The average age of participants ranged between 80.4 years and 85.0 years. Women made up 59.5 % to 69.6% of the patients studied.<BR/>3. All studies used one or more standard methods: (DSM IV (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK>); NINCDS-ADRDA (<LINK REF="REF-McKhann-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKhann 1984</LINK>)) to diagnose dementia, including Alzheimer's disease. All studies included patients with Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia.<BR/>4. All three studies examined the tolerability, adverse effects, and safety of valproic acid preparations. Other goals included the effect of divalproex treatment on agitation, aggression, mania, and overall function of demented patients.<BR/>5. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Sival-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sival 2002</LINK>) used the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 1982</LINK>), in which 2/42 patients were classified as "light", 24/42 patients as "moderate", and 14/42 patients as "severe". This same study used the Mini-Mental State Examination (<LINK REF="REF-Folstein-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Folstein 1975</LINK>), but 14 patients could not be scored because of low level of function. The second study (<LINK REF="STD-Tariot-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tariot 2001</LINK>) used the MMSE and found an average score of 7.4 among their patients (severe dementia). The third study (<LINK REF="STD-Porsteinsson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Porsteinsson 2001</LINK>) used the MMSE and found an average score of 6.8 among study subjects.<BR/>6. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Porsteinsson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Porsteinsson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tariot-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tariot 2001</LINK>) used the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) scale (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen_x002d_Mansfield-1989b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen-Mansfield 1989b</LINK>) for agitation and aggression. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Sival-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sival 2002</LINK>) used the Social Dysfunction and Aggression-9 Scale (SDAS-9) (<LINK REF="REF-Wistedt-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wistedt 1990</LINK>), the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI) (<LINK REF="REF-Guy-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guy 1976</LINK>) and the Nurse Observation scales (<LINK REF="REF-Colenda-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colenda 1991</LINK>), and Patel's method (<LINK REF="REF-Patel-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 1993</LINK>) to measure aggressiveness. This same study used the Behavior Observation Scale for Intramural Psychogeriatric Patients (GIP) (<LINK REF="REF-Verstraten-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verstraten 1988</LINK>) to measure other types of disturbed behaviour. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Porsteinsson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Porsteinsson 2001</LINK>) used the Overt Aggression Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Yudofsky-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yudofsky 1986</LINK>) to measure aggression. This study used the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale subset for agitation (BPRS) (<LINK REF="REF-Overall-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1988</LINK>) to measure other forms of disturbed behaviour.<BR/>7. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Tariot-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tariot 2001</LINK>) patients were treated with divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets or placebo. Dosage was begun at 125 mg bid and titrated to a dosage of 20 mg/kg/d - 30 mg/kg/d, to be reduced if intolerable adverse effects appeared. The median dose for treated patients at the end of 6 weeks was 1000 mg/d. In another study (<LINK REF="STD-Sival-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sival 2002</LINK>) participants received sodium valproate 240 mg bid for 3 weeks. In the third study (<LINK REF="STD-Porsteinsson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Porsteinsson 2001</LINK>) participants received rapid-acting divalproex sodium at an initial dose of 375 mg/day which was titrated to an average daily dose of 826 mg. In this trial a non-blinded supervising physician who had no contact with the blinded reviewers altered drug dosage by 125 mg per day, depending on written reports by the reviewers of response and adverse effects. Length of treatment was 6 weeks.<BR/>8. All studies permitted short-term use of short-acting psychotropics. In <LINK REF="STD-Porsteinsson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Porsteinsson 2001</LINK> chloral hydrate was used; in <LINK REF="STD-Tariot-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tariot 2001</LINK> short-term use of lorazepam, oxazepam, or chloral hydrate were permitted as needed. In <LINK REF="STD-Sival-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sival 2002</LINK> oxazepam was allowed for severe anxiety or insomnia.</P>
<P>9. In an update review (October 2008) two new studies were examined (<LINK REF="STD-Tariot-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tariot 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Herrmann-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Herrmann 2007</LINK>). Each of these used the CMAI to estimate effect of valproate preparations on agitation in dementia, compared with placebo controls, and each used a checklist to measure the incidence of adverse events among treated versus placebo patients. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Herrmann-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Herrmann 2007</LINK>) involved two institutions and used a cross-over design, and a two week washout period. The other study (<LINK REF="STD-Tariot-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tariot 2005</LINK>) was a multi-institution study. The methodology of both studies included intention-to treat analysis.</P>

<LI>In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Tariot-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tariot 2001</LINK>) the primary goal was to investigate the safety and tolerability of divalproex sodium in the treatment of mania among demented patients. The design of this study, however, included an examination of agitation as measured by total agitation and verbal agitation scores (Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory), to compare the response of placebo treated patients with patients who received divalproex sodium. In a second study (<LINK REF="STD-Sival-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sival 2002</LINK>) the response of aggressive behavior, a manifestation of agitation, was examined by comparing sodium valproate treated patients with control patients. In the third study (<LINK REF="STD-Porsteinsson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Porsteinsson 2001</LINK>) the response of patients with agitation was measured, comparing divalproex sodium treated patients with controls. This study was described as a preliminary examination of efficacy, tolerability and safety of divalproex sodium and was to be followed by a more extensive investigation of the value of this drug in treating demented patients who should aggression/agitation.</LI>
<LI>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Sival-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sival 2002</LINK>) used a cross-over design with each participant serving as his or her own control. Intention-to-treat analysis was not used in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Sival-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sival 2002</LINK>). In this study 4 patients withdrew, none of whom was receiving valproic acid at the time of withdrawal. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Porsteinsson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Porsteinsson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tariot-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tariot 2001</LINK>) used an intention-to-treat" analysis.</LI>
<LI>In the update of 2008 one study (<LINK REF="STD-Herrmann-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Herrmann 2007</LINK>) used a cross-over design with a two week washout interval between study periods. Both studies (<LINK REF="STD-Tariot-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tariot 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Herrmann-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Herrmann 2007</LINK>) use the CMAI to measure response of agitation to valproate preparation treatment, compared with controls.</LI>

<LI>The CMAI (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen_x002d_Mansfield-1989b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen-Mansfield 1989b</LINK>) examines 29 types of agitated behaviour, including pacing, verbal or physical aggression, screaming, and restlessness. The frequency of these behaviours is measured on a 7-point scale from 1 (never occurs) to 7 (occurs several times an hour) and scores for physical and verbal aggression and overall aggression may be aggregated.</LI>
<LI>The SDAS-9 (<LINK REF="REF-Wistedt-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wistedt 1990</LINK>) measures several aspects of behaviour having to do with patient interaction with other persons, and physical and verbal aggression.

<LI>Patel's (<LINK REF="REF-Patel-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 1993</LINK>) description of aggression includes any overt act of noxious stimuli affecting, though not necessarily aimed at, an object, organism or self which is not accidental. Intention is not included in the definition.</LI>
<LI>The CGI (<LINK REF="REF-Guy-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guy 1976</LINK>) is a 7-point scale with scores ranging from 1 (no aggressive behaviour) to 7 (severely aggressive behaviour). It is also uses to measure overall response to treatment (see below)</LI>
<LI>The "Nurse Observation" scale (<LINK REF="REF-Colenda-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colenda 1991</LINK>) assesses the incidence of aggressive behaviour at the moment the behaviour occurs.</LI>
<LI>The Behavior Observation Scale of Intramural Psychogeriatric Patients (<LINK REF="REF-Verstraten-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verstraten 1988</LINK>) consists of 14 observational scales to describe agitated and aggressive behaviour.</LI>
<LI>The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Overall-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1962</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Overall-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1988</LINK>) measures physical and verbal aggression, hallucinatory behaviour, and abnormal thought content.</LI>

<P>Each of the studies reviewed here conformed to category B (unclear concealment).</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Porsteinsson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Porsteinsson 2001</LINK>, although the physicians having direct responsibility for patient care were blinded, a non-blinded physician, who had no direct contact with these physicians, adjusted divalproex sodium dosage based on reports from the blinded raters. Therefore, because one physician who controlled therapy knew which patients were receiving divalproex, and adjusted that therapy based on the reports that were submitted, the trial did not satisfy the criterion of concealed allocation. Another methodological problem is that in the statistical analysis section it is stated that the t-test was used to examine within subject changes, but is unclear in describing treatment effects between groups. The results section does state that between-group treatment differences were examined.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Tariot-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tariot 2001</LINK> 54% of the treated patients dropped out, compared with 29% of control patients; 22% of all treated patients dropped out because of adverse effects, and the study had to be discontinued prematurely. Further, since patients had been on therapy for varying periods of time when the study was terminated, interpretation of the effects of treatment is difficult.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Sival-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sival 2002</LINK> had a cross-over design. No results from the first phase of the study were available, and although the statistical section stated, "the t-test for independent samples is used to analyse the two-period cross-over trial", because the samples were not independent - they are the same patients in the treatment and placebo groups - a question must be raised about the correctness of the analyses.</P>
<P>The trials varied in the type of valproic acid used (one trial, short-acting sodium valproate; one trial, long-acting divalproex sodium; one trial early-onset acting divalproex sodium), average dosage of drug (480 mg/d - 1000 mg/d), duration of therapy (3 weeks - 6 weeks), and ways of evaluating patients and their response to therapy.</P>
<P>In the updated review of 2008, <LINK REF="STD-Herrmann-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Herrmann 2007</LINK> had a cross-over design and a small group of patients (N = 14) who served as their own controls in the study. Although only the results from the first part of the study were examined in this review, interpretation of the results must be tempered by the observation that the number of patients in this report was small. </P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Agitation</HEADING>
<P>Because of methodological problems, the effect of valproic acid derivatives on agitation in demented patients as reported in the studies of <LINK REF="STD-Tariot-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tariot 2001</LINK>and <LINK REF="STD-Sival-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sival 2002</LINK> cannot be interpreted, and therefore these studies do not support the use of valproic acid derivatives to control agitation in demented patients. The third study (<LINK REF="STD-Porsteinsson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Porsteinsson 2001</LINK>) showed no significant difference in the response of agitation, between control and treated groups (P = 0.08).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse effects and drop-outs</HEADING>
<P>In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Sival-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sival 2002</LINK>) the mean incidence of adverse effects was low during three weeks of observation in both treated (0.17) and placebo (0.02) groups. The study provides no description of the kinds of adverse reactions that were identified.</P>
<P>In the second study (<LINK REF="STD-Tariot-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tariot 2001</LINK>) 47 (54%) of treated patients and 25 (29%) placebo patients withdrew from the study. Nineteen treated patients (22%) and 3 placebo patients (4%) withdrew from the study because of adverse effects, predominately somnolence (P &lt; 0.01), and including hyponatraemia, accidents, and weight loss, and the study was prematurely terminated. The only adverse effect other than somnolence that reached statistical significance in the study of <LINK REF="STD-Tariot-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tariot 2001</LINK> was thrombocytopenia: 6 participants (7%) in the treated group developed thrombocytopenia, compared with none in the placebo group (P = 0.01).</P>
<P>In the third study (<LINK REF="STD-Porsteinsson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Porsteinsson 2001</LINK>) adverse effects occurred in 68% of the divalproex group compared with 33% of the placebo group (P = 0.035), but these were described as "mild" and were not responsible for any withdrawals. Two of Porsteinsson's treated patients developed a significant decrease in platelet count (baseline &gt; 300,000/cubic mm to 261,000/cubic mm and 159,000/cubic mm), but not to the level of thrombocytopenia. <LINK REF="STD-Sival-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sival 2002</LINK> monitored blood values in his patients, but reported no instances of a drop in platelet counts.

<P>Analysis of individual adverse effects reported by <LINK REF="STD-Porsteinsson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Porsteinsson 2001</LINK> states no significant difference between treated and control groups. On repeating the analysis this was true for all adverse effects except sedation, weakness and respiratory infections. Sedation occurred more frequently in divalproex treated participants (odds ratio: 5.18, 95% confidence limits, 1.25 - 21.41; p = 0.02). Weakness occurred more frequently in divalproex treated participants (odds ratio: 8.00, 95% confidence limits, 1.06 - 60.16; p = 0.04). Respiratory tract infections were also more common among divalproex treated patients, compared with controls (odds ratio: 8.34; 95% confidence limits, 1.35 - 51.60; p = 0.02).</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Sival-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sival 2002</LINK>) lost 3 patients (two placebo, one during washout period) due to complications that were not ascribed to the study drug (fever, stroke, fractured hip) and one patient due to protocol violation (total 4, or 9.5%). No patient was receiving valproic acid at the time of withdrawal from the study. These patients were omitted from the statistical analysis of response to treatment. In another study (<LINK REF="STD-Tariot-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tariot 2001</LINK>) 47 treated patients (64%) dropped out, compared with 15 (30%) placebo treated patients, and the study was terminated prematurely. The major reason for drop-outs was somnolence among the treated patients. In the third study (<LINK REF="STD-Porsteinsson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Porsteinsson 2001</LINK>) four patients were dropped from the placebo arm, all with increased agitation; two patients left the divalproex arm, one because of small bowel obstruction, the other because of infection, delirium, and seizures.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-05-11 15:26:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It must be appreciated that the primary goal in one of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Tariot-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tariot 2001</LINK>) was to examine the safety and tolerability of divalproex sodium in the treatment of mania among demented patients. This study clearly showed that high dose divalproex sodium (median dose, 1000 mg per day) was associated with an unacceptable frequency of adverse effects, predominantly somnolence, among treated patients and the study was terminated prematurely. Although not a primary goal of the study, it is the case that the protocol of this investigation measured the effect of divalproex sodium on agitation in demented patients, as shown by total and verbal agitation scores of the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory. Because of high drop rates among treated patients interpretation of the results of treatment on agitation in demented patients cannot be relied upon for clinical guidance.</P>
<P>Flaws in methodology and lack of standardization in the ways of treating and assessing patients made it inappropriate to apply meta-analysis to these preliminary trials of the effect of valproic acid on people with dementia patients who were agitated. Variations in method, type of medication, dosage, duration of treatment, and ways of assessing participants in these studies also made it inappropriate to apply meta-analysis.</P>
<P>For example, although Porsteinsson's trial (<LINK REF="STD-Porsteinsson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Porsteinsson 2001</LINK>) described a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled design, the presence of a non-blinded physician who varied dosage of medication based on reports from blinded raters, and who was informed about laboratory results among these patients, did not satisfy the requirement of concealed allocation and could have introduced an uncontrolled variable into the outcomes of this investigation.</P>
<P>Further, the premature termination of one study (<LINK REF="STD-Tariot-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tariot 2001</LINK>), in which 47 treated patients (54%) dropped out before the protocol could be completed, made questionable the conclusion that divalproex sodium improved agitation of people with dementia, and did not justify including this report in a pooled analysis of the results of these studies. In Sival's report (<LINK REF="STD-Sival-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sival 2002</LINK>) the description of statistical analysis section describes "the t-test for independent samples is used to analyse the two-period cross-over trial," but since they are the same patients in the treatment and placebo groups, and hence not independent samples, it is not possible to accept the analyses in this study. Finally, it would be difficult to interpret a meta-analysis based on pooled results from studies that employed short-acting sodium valproate (<LINK REF="STD-Sival-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sival 2002</LINK>) or longer-acting divalproex sodium (<LINK REF="STD-Porsteinsson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Porsteinsson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tariot-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tariot 2001</LINK>), and in which the dosage varied more than two-fold (<LINK REF="STD-Sival-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sival 2002</LINK>, mean dose 480 mg/day; <LINK REF="STD-Tariot-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tariot 2001</LINK>, median dose 1000 mg/day; <LINK REF="STD-Porsteinsson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Porsteinsson 2001</LINK>, mean dose 875 mg/day).</P>
<P>A limited study of two pooled trials (<LINK REF="STD-Porsteinsson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Porsteinsson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tariot-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tariot 2001</LINK>), and applying meta-analysis, showed that sedation occurred more frequently among patients who received the higher dose of valproic acid/derivative compared with controls (odds ratio 2.64, 95% confidence interval 1.43 to 4.88; p = 0.002). In the third, low-dose study, (Sival 2002) adverse effects were described as rare and no mention of sedation was made.</P>
<P>A meta-analysis of the pooled data (<LINK REF="STD-Porsteinsson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Porsteinsson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tariot-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tariot 2001</LINK>) concerning urinary tract infection showed a higher frequency of this adverse effect among participants taking valproic acid, compared with controls (odds ratio 3.02; 95% confidence interval 1.04 - 8.88; p = 0.04). No explanation for this adverse effect was given in either of the reports, and no attempt to link sedation to urinary tract infections was made. Reanalysis of Porsteinsson's data also showed a higher rate of respiratory infections among divalproex treated patients, compared with controls (odds ratio 8.34; 95% confidence interval 1.35 - 51.60; p = 0.02). It may be conjectured that because respiratory tract and urinary tract infections, in general, occur more frequently among immobilized patients, is possible that the high frequency of sedation found in these studies may have lessened mobility among treated patients and thus contributed to the increased incidence of infection.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Sival-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sival 2002</LINK> found a low frequency of adverse effects in participants who received sodium valproate, 480 mg/day, but no improvement in agitation. <LINK REF="STD-Sival-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sival 2002</LINK> suggested that higher doses of valproate, and higher plasma levels, were associated with the increased frequency of serious adverse effects reported in <LINK REF="STD-Tariot-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tariot 2001</LINK>, with attendant high drop-out rates, but also may have explained the improved CMAI (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen_x002d_Mansfield-1989b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen-Mansfield 1989b</LINK>) total scores (P &lt; 0.05) and verbal agitation scores in this study. Neither <LINK REF="STD-Sival-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sival 2002</LINK> nor <LINK REF="STD-Porsteinsson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Porsteinsson 2001</LINK> demonstrated a significant response to treatment of agitation or aggression, although covariate analysis in Porsteinsson's study showed an improvement in the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Overall-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1988</LINK>) among treated patients. There were four drop-outs in the placebo arm of Porsteinsson's study, all associated with increased agitation. Given that there were also two drop-outs among the treated patients in this study, it is unlikely that the placebo drop-outs had any significant effect on the overall assessment of the results of this study. <LINK REF="STD-Sival-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sival 2002</LINK> concluded that higher doses of valproate were necessary to achieve therapeutic effect, and <LINK REF="STD-Tariot-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tariot 2001</LINK> observed that lower doses than those used in his study were necessary to avoid adverse effects and high drop-out rates.</P>
<P>In a new controlled study of the effect of divalproex sodium on agitation in demented patients, reported in abstract form,Tariot and associates (Tariot 2004a) were unable to demonstrate any significant difference in agitation among treated patients (target dose of divalproex, 750 mg per day), compared with placebo controls. This study will be reviewed in greater detail when the published article becomes available.</P>
<P>Update October 2008: Meta-analysis of pooled studies showed no improvement in agitation among demented patient treated with valproate preparations, as compared with controls. Because of heterogeneity in the outcome for agitation as measured by the CMAI in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Herrmann-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Herrmann 2007</LINK>), sensitivity analysis was performed and no change in the result (no response of agitation to valproate treatment) was found after the Herrmann study of 2007 was subtracted from the pooled results. Heterogeneity in the results of Herrmann may have been due to the small sample size (N = 14).</P>
<P>Further meta-analysis of pooled results showed both an increase in overall adverse events among valproate patients compared with placebo patients, and in subset analysis an increase in specific adverse events such as falls, infection, gastrointestinal disorders, and decreased platelet counts. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Tariot-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tariot 2005</LINK>) there was no difference in total adverse events, comparing valproate and placebo patients, but in this report specific adverse effects (falls, gastrointestinal symptoms, decreased platelet counts) were significantly more frequent among treated patients, compared with controls.</P>
<P>Because of the limited number of subjects it was not possible to analyse secondary objectives such as the effect of valproate therapy on individual manifestations of agitations (e.g., crying out, wandering) or the influence of age or type of dementia on the response to therapy.</P>

<P>These trials are best described as preliminary. Their main value lies in demonstrating the lack of effect of low dose valproate treatment of 480 mg/day (<LINK REF="STD-Sival-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sival 2002</LINK>), and the prohibitively increased frequency of adverse effects (somnolence, thrombocytopenia, infection) associated with high does therapy of 1000 mg/day (<LINK REF="STD-Tariot-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tariot 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Evidence from the three trials that were reviewed did not support the use of valproate preparations to control agitation of people with dementia.</P>
<P>Update of the review in 2008 included two new studies (<LINK REF="STD-Tariot-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tariot 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Herrmann-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Herrmann 2007</LINK>) and permitted meta-analysis of pooled results. The findings of the update showed failure of valproate treatment to decrease agitation among demented patients, compared with placebo controls, and demonstrated increased frequency of serious side effects among treated patients.</P>
<P>From the information available, valproate preparations cannot be recommended for first-line treatment of demented patients with agitation.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-11-14 16:10:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>Further studies are needed to examine the value of valproate therapy of agitation in people with dementia.</P>
<P>Standardization of drug dosage, duration of treatment, preparations of valproate, and ways of assessing patients and their response to treatment is recommended for future research in this area.</P>
<P>Careful attention to methodology, including statistical analyses and study design, is paramount in establishing a reliable basis on which to interpret results of studies.</P>

<P>The study represents the extension of an earlier pilot study that investigated the safety and tolerability of divalproex (Posteinsson 2001).
