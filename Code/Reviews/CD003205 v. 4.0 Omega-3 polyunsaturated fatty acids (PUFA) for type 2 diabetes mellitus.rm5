<DESCRIPTION>
<P>This review is a 2007 update of the initial Farmer 2001 review. The title was changed from 'fish oil in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus' to 'omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) for type 2 diabetes mellitus'. First author now is Janine Hartweg.<BR/>
<BR/>In the current review, we further developed the search criteria, and have used change data calculated from the difference between baseline and after intervention values for the meta-analysis, whereas in the previous review only the values after intervention were used. We have also included additional outcomes to those included in the previous review, i.e. VLDL and insulin.<BR/>
<BR/>A total of eight new trials have been identified in a literature search up to April 2007, of which four have been included in this review from the search conducted up to December 2006. This brings the total number of randomized controlled trials to 31 considering the effects of omega-3 fatty acids in patients with type 2 diabetes. One of these has endpoint data (myocardical infarction) not previously assessed by trials identified in the original review.</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>People with type 2 diabetes are known to be at increased risk of cardiovascular disease (such as heart attack or stroke). Type 2 diabetes mellitus is the fourth leading cause of death in developed countries with a two fold excess mortality and a two to four fold increased risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. The typical dyslipidemia (abnormality in blood lipids) associated with type 2 diabetes is a combination of hypertriglyceridemia (high levels of fats (triglycerides) in the blood), low levels of HDL (high density lipoprotein) cholesterol and abnormal LDL (low density lipoprotein) composition. Low levels of HDL cholesterol and high levels of LDL cholesterol are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, while the raised levels of triglycerides are less clearly linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Several pharmacologic approaches have been used to treat diabetic dyslipidemia and standard dietary approaches focus on restriction of saturated fat and limitation of simple carbohydrate and alcohol intake. In the late 1980s, several investigators reported on the use of dietary supplementation with fish oil as a means of treating diabetic dyslipidemia. Dietary fats and oils from different sources differ considerably in their fatty acid composition. Animal fat is rich in saturated fatty acids, vegetable and marine oils are rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids. Most fish oils are of the so-called omega-3 variety (omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs)).<BR/>We identified 23 randomised trials (maximum duration of eight months) including 1075 people in which omega-3 PUFA was compared to a vegetable oil or placebo. None of the trials looked at cardiovascular endpoints in cardiovascular disease or death as an outcome measure. <BR/>The review shows that although some types of fat in the blood are reduced through omega-3 supplementation, others including LDL cholesterol (which may promote heart disease) were increased. Control of blood sugar levels was not affected by the treatment. There were no other adverse effects of the interventions noted. Clinical outcome trials of sufficient duration are required to establish conclusively the role of omega-3 PUFA in type 2 diabetes but our results do not suggest a major harmful effect on the balance of blood fats and confirm that it has no adverse affect on blood sugar control.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>People with type 2 diabetes mellitus are at increased risk from cardiovascular disease. Dietary omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are known to reduce triglyceride levels, but their impact on cholesterol levels, glycemic control and vascular outcomes are not well known. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the effects of omega-3 PUFA supplementation on cardiovascular outcomes, cholesterol levels and glycemic control in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We carried out a comprehensive search of <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, MEDLINE, EMBASE, bibliographies of relevant papers and contacted experts for identifying additional trials. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All randomised controlled trials were included where omega-3 PUFA supplementation or dietary intake was randomly allocated and unconfounded in people with type 2 diabetes. Authors of large trials were contacted for missing information.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Trials were assessed for inclusion. Authors were contacted for missing information. Data was extracted and quality assessed independently in duplicate. Fixed-effect meta-analysis was carried out.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Twenty three randomised controlled trials (1075 participants) were included with a mean treatment duration of 8.9 weeks. The mean dose of omega-3 PUFA used in the trials was 3.5 g/d. No trials with vascular events or mortality endpoints were identified. Among those taking omega-3 PUFA triglyceride levels were significantly lowered by 0.45 mmol/L (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.58 to -0.32, P &lt; 0.00001) and VLDL cholesterol lowered by -0.07 mmol/L (95% CI -0.13 to 0.00, P = 0.04). LDL cholesterol levels were raised by 0.11 mmol/L (95% CI 0.00 to 0.22, P = 0.05). No significant change in or total or HDL cholesterol, HbA1c, fasting glucose, fasting insulin or body weight was observed. The increase in VLDL remained significant only in trials of longer duration and in hypertriglyceridemic patients. The elevation in LDL cholesterol was non-significant in subgroup analyses. No adverse effects of the intervention were reported.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Omega-3 PUFA supplementation in type 2 diabetes lowers triglycerides and VLDL cholesterol, but may raise LDL cholesterol (although results were non-significant in subgroups) and has no statistically significant effect on glycemic control or fasting insulin. Trials with vascular events or mortality defined endpoints are needed.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<P>Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder resulting from a defect in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. A consequence of this is chronic hyperglycaemia (that is elevated levels of plasma glucose) with disturbances of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism. Long-term complications of diabetes mellitus include retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy. The risk of cardiovascular disease is increased. For a detailed overview of diabetes mellitus, please see under 'Additional information' in the information on the Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders Group in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (see 'About the Cochrane Collaboration', 'Collaborative Review Groups').

<P>Type 2 diabetes mellitus is the fourth leading cause of death in developed countries with a two fold excess mortality and a two to four fold increased risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. The typical dyslipidemia (abnormality in blood lipids) associated with type 2 diabetes is a combination of hypertriglyceridemia (high levels of fats (triglycerides) in the blood), low levels of HDL (high density lipoprotein) cholesterol and abnormal LDL (low density lipoprotein) composition (<LINK REF="REF-Howard-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howard 1987</LINK>). Low levels of HDL cholesterol and high levels of LDL cholesterol are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), while the raised levels of triglycerides are less clearly linked to an increased risk of CVD. Several pharmacologic approaches have been used to treat diabetic dyslipidemia (<LINK REF="REF-ADA-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">ADA 1998</LINK>). These include use of 3-hydroxy 3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG Co-A) reductase inhibitors (promoting the removal of LDL cholesterol from the blood) (<LINK REF="REF-Pyorala-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pyorala 1997</LINK>), fibric acid derivatives (exact mechanism of action unclear, but probably includes stimulating triglyceride breakdown and LDL cholesterol removal from the blood) (<LINK REF="REF-Elkeles-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elkeles 1998</LINK>) and niacin (inhibits triglyceride production in the liver and VLDL (very low density lipoprotein) secretion) (<LINK REF="REF-Garg-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garg 1990</LINK>). Standard dietary approaches focus on restriction of saturated fat and limitation of simple carbohydrate and alcohol intake (<LINK REF="REF-ADA-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">ADA 1998</LINK>). In the late 1980s, several investigators reported on the use of dietary supplementation with fish oil as a means of treating diabetic dyslipidemia (<LINK REF="REF-Glauber-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glauber 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Friday-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friday 1989</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-11-04 21:24:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>A potential role for marine-derived omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in CVD risk reduction first came from observations of the native inhabitants of Greenland (Inuits) (<LINK REF="REF-Mouraoff-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mouraoff 1967</LINK>). Despite ingesting up to 40 percent of calories as fat (predominantly of marine origin), this population had a lower incidence of coronary heart disease compared to individuals with similar fat intake on a more conventional diet (<LINK REF="REF-Bang-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bang 1976</LINK>). Dietary fats and oils from different sources differ considerably in their fatty acid composition. Animal fat is rich in saturated fatty acids. Vegetable and marine oils are rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids. Polyunsaturated fatty acids are characterised by the presence of more than one double bond (allowing them to stay liquid at very low temperatures). The designation using n-3 or the Greek symbol omega-3, or n-6 and omega-6, has been applied in the case of fatty acids with the first double bond three or six carbon atoms from the end of the chain. Most fish oils are of the omega-3 variety and most vegetable oils are of the omega-6 variety, although alpha-linoleic acid is an omega-3 fatty acid found in canola oil. The omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oils are predominantly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2008-11-04 21:25:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>The beneficial effect of marine-derived omega-3 PUFA on cardiac risk markers and on lowering cardiovascular mortality and sudden death in the general population have previously been reported in the GISSI-Prevenzione (<LINK REF="REF-GISSI-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">GISSI 1999</LINK>) and DART 1 trials (<LINK REF="REF-Burr-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burr 1989</LINK>) and in a subsequent meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Bucher-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bucher 2002</LINK>). However, the results of a later secondary prevention trial on coronary heart disease (CHD) and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Burr-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burr 2003</LINK>) do not support the earlier conclusions and a subsequent review has also raised doubts that omega-3 PUFA reduce cardiovascular endpoints (<LINK REF="REF-Hooper-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hooper 2004</LINK>). The possibility of enhanced benefit from omega-3 PUFA in people with diabetes has been shown in two previous reviews. In a previous review of the role of omega-3 PUFA in diabetes (<LINK REF="STD-Friedberg-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Friedberg 1998</LINK>), benefit in reducing triglyceride levels was suggested. However, the authors included non-randomized studies and studies including people with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Their review included studies up to June 1995. Concerns were also raised about the possibility of harm from omega-3 PUFA supplementation. Early non-randomised studies in patients with type 2 diabetes suggested that omega-3 PUFA might be associated with a deterioration in glycemic control (<LINK REF="REF-Friday-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friday 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glauber-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glauber 1988</LINK>). This concern was addressed in the first publication of this systematic review, which showed that omega-3 PUFA supplementation has no adverse effects on glycemic control (<LINK REF="REF-Farmer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farmer 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Montori-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montori 2000</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-11-05 11:16:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>The first publication of this Cochrane review was limited to randomized trials involving patients with type 2 diabetes and included searches for trials up to September 2000 (<LINK REF="REF-Farmer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farmer 2001</LINK>). The current review includes randomised trials searched up to September 2006 and differs to our previous review in the following respects:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>title was changed from 'fish oil in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus' to 'Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) for type 2 diabetes mellitus';</LI>
<LI>first author was changed to Janine Hartweg;</LI>
<LI>change in outcomes from baseline to end-of-trial was used to calculate the pooled effect sizes;</LI>
<LI>a further five trials up to 2006 were identified and included in the analysis;</LI>
<LI>two further outcomes are included in addition to those previously pooled.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>We therefore set out to update our previous systematic review of dietary supplementation using omega-3 PUFA among people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Although our primary aim was to identify trials in which morbidity was studied, we also identified secondary aims of establishing the extent to which changes in serum lipids and deterioration in glucose control occurs following omega-3 PUFA supplementation .</P>
</IMPORTANCE>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of omega-3 PUFA supplementation on death and vascular events in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. We also wished to establish changes in lipids and whether deterioration in glucose control occurs. </P>

<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Papers of any language were considered. Trials were eligible if they were randomized placebo or vegetable oil controlled trials of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (including cross-over trials) as the only intervention in participants with type 2 diabetes. As no phase-specific information was available for cross-over trials, data were used only from the first intervention period to prevent measurements from the second period being affected by effects carried over from the first intervention period. Where serial measurement of an outcome was given during the intervention phase, data were obtained from the final measurement since that measurement was considered the conclusion of the study. The effect of trial design was explored in a sensitivity analysis. </P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The diagnosis of type 2 diabetes among the participants of trials included in the review was established using the standard criteria valid at the time of the beginning of the trial. </P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Trials in which participants were randomised to any type of dietary supplementation with omega-3 PUFA were included. No restrictions were imposed on dose or formulation, although trials where the effect of omega-3 PUFA could not be separated from the effect of simultaneously applied interventions, such as exercise or monounsaturated fatty acids, were not included.</P>
<P>No restrictions were placed on the range of compounds used as controls in the study. Some vegetable oils contain omega-3 PUFA, or complex fatty acids that might be metabolised to form omega-3 PUFA. </P>

<P>Extracted data were analyzed using the Cochrane Review Manager software. Quantitative analysis was based on changes in the means between baseline and endpoint measures. Standard deviation of the mean difference was calculated from the standard deviations of the mean at the beginning and end of each trial by assuming a degree of correlation of 0.5 (<LINK REF="REF-Rice-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rice 1995</LINK>). Trials were included in the pooled analysis where change data of the intervention and control groups could be obtained from calculations of the mean difference and standard deviation (SD).</P>
<P>A fixed-effect model was used for the pooled results. Where heterogeneity was indicated in the pooled analysis, a random-effects model was applied. Effect sizes are presented as weighted mean differences with 95 percent confidence intervals. Heterogeneity was assessed using the chi-squared test with the significance set at a P value of &lt; 0.1. Where serial measurement of an outcome was given during the intervention phase, comparisons were made with the final measurement. Where a trial used two sets of doses, included comparisons of EPA and DHA, or more than one control group, a sensitivity analysis was carried out to determine which comparison gave the smallest effect size (<LINK REF="REF-Tramer-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tramer 1997</LINK>), which was then included.</P>

<BR/>However, conclusions regarding LDL and VLDL cholesterol levels were more sensitive to these factors, with increases in LDL becoming non-significant when only blinded or parallel group trials were included. Pooled results for VLDL cholesterol were non-significant when blinded, and parallel designs were included. Using a random-effects model for VLDL cholesterol changed the pooled results to a non-significant weighted mean difference of -0.13 mmol/L (95% CI -0.28 to 0.02, P = 0.08), but did not change the conclusions with standardised mean differences, or using weighted mean difference with a fixed-effect model.

The weighted mean difference for both high and low dose trials were statistically non-significant, using either a fixed-effect or random-effects model, however with standardized mean difference fixed-effect or random-effects models the pooled reductions were significant in trials only with high doses -0.36 mmol/L (95% CI -0.66 to -0.06, P = 0.02). In hypertriglyceridaemic patients, using a standardised mean difference fixed-effect or random effects model for VLDL-cholesterol changed the results to -0.43 (95% CI -0.90 to 0.40, P = 0.07) and -0.36 (95% CI -0.67 to -0.06, P = 0.02) in non-hypertriglyceridemic patients.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-11-05 11:23:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>This systematic review pools 23 randomized controlled trials of omega-3 supplementation studying a total of 1075 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. None of the trials examined hard clinical endpoints (such as cardiovascular events or death). In the trials reviewed, omega-3 supplementation had a statistically significant triglyceride- and VLDL cholesterol lowering effect. A statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol was noted after omega-3 supplementation. LDL was not significantly increased in subgroup analyses of hypertriglyceridemic patients, high or low omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) doses and in trials lasting longer than two months. Omega-3 supplementation did not result in any statistically significant increase in fasting glucose, HbA1c, or fasting insulin. No other adverse effects were reported.</P>
<P>Overall, the subgroup analyses are difficult to interpret as up to 50% of the trials included in the hypertriglyceridemia, high dose and long duration subgroups were identical (that is including hypertriglyceridemic patients on a high dose of fish oil in a long trial) (<LINK REF="STD-Connor-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Connor 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morgan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Morgan 1995</LINK>), making it therefore difficult to determine which of these factors really caused the differential response. Non-hypertriglyceridemia, long study duration and low doses of omega-3 PUFA may have contributed to a greater reduction in triglyceride and levels, whereas hypertriglyceridemia and trials of longer duration may have had a contribution to the larger reductions in VLDL levels. Subgroup analyses did not indicate variables that increased in LDL cholesterol levels.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2008-11-05 11:24:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Our data are relevant to clinicians managing patients with type 2 diabetes. They indicate that, in hypertriglyceridemic and normotriglyceridemic patients, dietary supplementation with omega-3 PUFA leads to a modest lowering of triglycerides without any statistically significant effect on glycemic control. The increases in LDL are not significant in hypertriglyceridemic patients. It is unlikely that omega-3 PUFA will be prescribed in normotriglyceridemic patients, but our results do not provide evidence to discourage their use as over-the-counter preparations provided the formulation has been manufactured to eliminate undesirable contaminants.<BR/>Omega-3 PUFA has been suggested to have beneficial effects in other diseases including Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis and breast, colon and prostate malignancies (<LINK REF="REF-Connor-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Connor 2000</LINK>), and our results show that omega-3 PUFA represents a reasonable therapeutic strategy in hypertriglyceridemic individuals. We are not aware of any studies that have reported the combination of omega-3 PUFA with other lipid lowering drugs, and few trials have compared omega-3 PUFA with fibric acid derivatives (<LINK REF="REF-Fasching-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fasching 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>The slight increase in LDL cholesterol seen with the use of omega-3 PUFA can occur with other triglyceride lowering agents, in patients without diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Fisher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fisher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ouguerram-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ouguerram 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Theobald-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Theobald 2004</LINK>) and is consistent with physiological studies proposing the mechanism of the LDL increase with omega-3 PUFA (<LINK REF="REF-Lindsey-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindsey 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schectman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schectman 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Surette-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Surette 1992</LINK>). In addition, large buoyant LDL is known to be less atherogenic than small dense LDL and this may be the type of LDL produced in response to omega-3 PUFA (<LINK REF="REF-Minihane-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Minihane 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mori-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mori 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Suzukawa-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suzukawa 1995</LINK>). The impact of omega-3 PUFA on LDL levels in a larger trial included in this systematic review of patients with diabetes have not yet been published (<LINK REF="STD-Sirtori-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sirtori 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although the GISSI-Prevenzione trial has published its findings on the administration of fish oil to 11,324 survivors of myocardial infarction (<LINK REF="REF-GISSI-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">GISSI 1999</LINK>), the analysis for the diabetes sub-group (15% of participants) has not yet been reported. However, the findings of reduced triglycerides and an overall beneficial effect on survival on the patients surviving myocardial infarction (relative risk reduction of 10% for the primary endpoint of death, non-fatal myocardial infarction and stroke) are encouraging.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2008-11-05 11:24:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Several methodological challenges were encountered in the course of this review. Eleven of 23 trials used a cross-over design and phase-specific data were not available for any of these. For pooling results from cross-over and parallel group design studies, ideally, individual patient data or at least phase-specific data should be available. In the absence of these data, three approaches are possible. The first is not to analyse data from cross-over studies. The second is to pool parallel group design and cross-over trials separately. The third is to treat first phase data from cross-over studies as coming from parallel group design studies, pool these with data from parallel group design studies and look for heterogeneity in the analysis. We adopted the latter approach and our sensitivity analysis did not show any association between study design and direction or magnitude of effect. Use of the cross-over design to study omega-3 PUFA supplementation has other potential drawbacks. Omega-3 PUFA is incorporated into biologic membranes and presumably would require washout periods of appropriate duration to minimize any carryover effect. In our review, only four of the 11 cross-over studies had a washout period. Despite these limitations, the main findings of the review were similar if cross-over studies were included or excluded from the analysis.</P>
<P>Another methodological problem is the use of HbA1c as an outcome measure in trials of short duration. Glycated haemoglobin or HbA1c provide an integrated measure of glycemic control over a period of approximately 12 weeks. The use of such measurements in studies of short duration will underestimate any effects on glycemic control. This may have occurred in several trials included in this review (see tables).</P>
<P>The random-effects model was used where the studies were sufficiently different to assume some level of heterogeneity that could have been ignored in a fixed-effect model, but except for VLDL cholesterol, the conclusions did not change when the results were analyzed with either model.</P>
<P>It is interesting to compare the current systematic review with that of Friedberg et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Friedberg-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Friedberg 1998</LINK>). Despite the differences in design of that review to Farmer et al (<LINK REF="REF-Farmer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farmer 2001</LINK>) and our current review, the findings of the two reviews are similar and are in keeping with the results of the largest trial performed in this area (<LINK REF="STD-Sirtori-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sirtori 1997</LINK>).</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2008-11-05 11:24:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>The subgroup and sensitivity analyses require elaboration to undertake a more comprehensive comparison between groups with different characteristics. This will be addressed in a further publication.</P>
<P>Limitations of our systematic review include the limited number of trials with emerging cardiovascular risk markers as outcomes, and small trial sizes with a median of 23 participants. Another significant limitation of our study is the shorter duration of the included trials. Some trials did not describe methods of randomisation or blinding so that the degree of rigor with which they were conducted was not clear. It was not possible to pool all the identified outcomes because of non-standardised measurement units, and non-reporting of changes in outcomes. The findings from the funnel plot analysis (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>) may indicate bias in reporting, selection or methodology of the trials. However, we included trials reported in any language to reduce selection and language bias, and an assessment was made of the quality of the trials.</P>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>In hypertriglyceridemic patients, dietary supplementation with omega-3 PUFA leads to a modest lowering of triglycerides without any clinically significant effect on glycemic control, and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) may represent a reasonable therapeutic strategy in these individuals. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>A recent review included patients with diabetes as part of a high risk group analysis, but also included non-randomised control trials (<LINK REF="REF-Balk-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balk 2004</LINK>). Three previous systematic reviews have evaluated the effect of omega-3 PUFA on cardiovascular events, lipid and glycemic markers in type 2 diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Farmer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farmer 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Friedberg-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Friedberg 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Montori-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montori 2000</LINK>). However, we considered lipid cardiovascular risk factors beyond these markers, and used changes in the mean from baseline to the end of the trial in the pooled analysis. We have also identified more recent randomised trials. </P>
<P>The slight increase in LDL cholesterol seen with the use of fish oil represents a cause for concern and long-term studies assessing hard cardiovascular endpoints in patients with diabetes are needed. In conclusion, our systematic review demonstrates the difficulties of existing trial designs. Rigorously designed and conducted randomised controlled trials are required, using standardised units measuring both established and emerging cardiovascular risk markers in type 2 diabetes, to enable more conclusive pooled analyses and improve the precision of the effect size estimates. Larger trials of longer duration would conclusively establish the role and mechanisms of omega-3 PUFA in cardiovascular disease risk reduction in type 2 diabetes. One trial sub-group analysis awaits reporting (<LINK REF="REF-GISSI-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">GISSI 1999</LINK>), and four such end-point trials are in progress (<LINK REF="STD-AFORRD-2004" TYPE="STUDY">AFORRD 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ASCEND-2005" TYPE="STUDY">ASCEND 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Galan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Galan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ORIGIN-2005" TYPE="STUDY">ORIGIN 2005</LINK>).</P>
