<P>Although pharmacological and psychological interventions are both effective for major depression, antidepressant drugs remain the mainstay of treatment. During the last 20 years, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have progressively become the most commonly prescribed antidepressants. Escitalopram, the last SSRI introduced in the market, is the pure S-enantiomer of the racemic citalopram. In the present review we assessed the evidence for the efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of escitalopram in comparison with all other antidepressants in the acute-phase treatment of major depression. Twenty-two randomised controlled trials (about 4000 participants) were included in the present review. Escitalopram appears to be suitable as first-line antidepressant treatment for people with moderate to severe major depression. It has been compared with only a few other antidepressants and so we are unable to say whether it is better, worse or the same as many of the other drugs used in practice. However, it did perform better than citalopram when we brought together the results of six studies in nearly two thousand patients</P>

<P>Although pharmacological and psychological interventions are both effective for major depression, antidepressant drugs remain the mainstay of treatment in primary and secondary care settings. During the last 20 years, antidepressant prescribing has risen dramatically in western countries, mainly because of the increasing consumption of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and newer antidepressants, which have progressively become the most commonly prescribed antidepressants.

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-02-17 14:00:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Data were entered by two review authors (double data entry). Responders and remitters to treatment were calculated on an intention-to-treat basis.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-02-08 18:35:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Fourteen trials compared escitalopram with another SSRI and eight compared escitalopram with a newer antidepressive agent (venlafaxine, bupropion and duloxetine). Escitalopram was shown to be significantly more effective than citalopram in achieving acute response (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.87). Escitalopram was also more effective than citalopram in terms of remission (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.93). Significantly fewer patients allocated to escitalopram withdrew from trials compared with patients allocated to duloxetine, for discontinuation due to any cause (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.99).</P>

<P>Some statistically significant differences favouring escitalopram over other antidepressive agents for the acute phase treatment of major depression were found, in terms of efficacy (citalopram and fluoxetine) and acceptability (duloxetine). There is insufficient evidence to detect a difference between escitalopram and other antidepressants in early response to treatment (after two weeks of treatment). Cost-effectiveness information is also needed in the field of antidepressant trials. Furthermore, as with most standard systematic reviews, the findings rely on evidence from direct comparisons. The potential for overestimation of treatment effect due to sponsorship bias should also be borne in mind.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-11-21 10:43:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Major depression is generally diagnosed when a persistent and unreactive low mood and loss of all interest and pleasure are accompanied by a range of symptoms including appetite loss, insomnia, fatigue, loss of energy, poor concentration, psychomotor symptoms, inappropriate guilt and morbid thoughts of death (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK>). It was the third leading cause of burden among all diseases in the year 2002 and it is expected to show a rising trend during the coming 20 years (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1997</LINK>). This condition is associated with marked personal, social and economic morbidity, loss of functioning and productivity, and creates significant demands on service providers in terms of workload (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2007</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-02-17 14:03:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although pharmacological and psychological interventions are both effective for major depression, in primary and secondary care settings antidepressant drugs remain the mainstay of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ellis-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ellis 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2007</LINK>) (see below for other references to the relevant evidence). Amongst antidepressants many different agents are available, including tricyclics (TCAs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs, such as venlafaxine, duloxetine and milnacipran), and other newer agents (mirtazapine, reboxetine, bupropion). During the last 20 years, consumption of antidepressant has risen dramatically in western countries, mainly because of the increasing consumption of SSRIs and newer antidepressants, which have progressively become the most commonly prescribed antidepressants (<LINK REF="REF-Ciuna-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ciuna 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guaiana-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guaiana 2005</LINK>). SSRIs are generally better tolerated than TCAs (<LINK REF="REF-Barbui-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barbui 2000</LINK>), and there is evidence of similar efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Geddes-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geddes 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2000</LINK>). However, head-to-head comparison have provided contrasting findings. Amitriptyline, for example, may have the edge over SSRIs in terms of efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-Guaiana-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guaiana 2003</LINK>), and individual SSRIs and SNRIs may differ in terms of efficacy and tolerability (<LINK REF="REF-Puech-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Puech 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hansen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hansen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cipriani-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cipriani 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Escitalopram is the pure S-enantiomer of the racemic citalopram. As for all other antidepressants belonging to the SSRIs class, the mechanism of antidepressant action of escitalopram is presumed to be linked to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system resulting from its inhibition of neuronal reuptake of serotonin. Escitalopram is at least 100 fold more potent than the R-enantiomer with respect to inhibition of 5-HT reuptake and inhibition of 5-HT neuronal firing rate. Escitalopram has no or very low affinity for other receptors (alpha- and beta-adrenergic, dopamine (D1-5), histamine (H1-3), muscarinic (M1-5), and benzodiazepine receptors). The single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of escitalopram are linear and dose-proportional in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/day. In vitro studies indicated that CYP3A4 and -2C19 are the primary enzymes involved in the metabolism of escitalopram, however these studies did not reveal an inhibitory effect of escitalopram on CYP2D6.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-02-06 13:56:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The efficacy of escitalopram as a treatment for major depressive disorder was established in three, 8-week, placebo-controlled studies conducted in outpatients between 18 and 65 years of age who met DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder (www.fda.gov). The primary outcome in all three studies was change from baseline to endpoint in the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) (<LINK REF="REF-Montgomery-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montgomery 1979</LINK>).The 10 mg/day and 20 mg/day escitalopram treatment groups showed significantly greater mean improvement compared to placebo on the MADRS. Analyses of the relationship between treatment outcome and age, gender, and race did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of these patient characteristics. Among the 715 depressed patients who received escitalopram in placebo-controlled trials, 6% discontinued treatment due to an adverse event, compared to 2% of 592 patients receiving placebo. The rate of discontinuation for adverse events in patients assigned to a fixed dose of 20 mg/day escitalopram was 10%, which was significantly different from the rate of discontinuation for adverse events in patients receiving 10 mg/day escitalopram (4%) and placebo (3%). The most commonly observed adverse events in escitalopram patients (incidence of approximately 5% or greater and approximately twice the incidence as in placebo patients) were insomnia, ejaculation disorder (primarily ejaculatory delay), nausea, increased sweating, fatigue, and somnolence.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-02-07 16:00:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To shed light on the field of antidepressant trials and treatment of major depressive disorder, a group of researchers agreed to join forces under the rubric of the Meta-Analyses of New Generation Antidepressants Study Group (MANGA Study Group) to systematically review all available evidence for each specific newer antidepressant. As of October 2008, we have completed an individual review for fluoxetine (<LINK REF="REF-Cipriani-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cipriani 2005</LINK>), and published the protocols for venlafaxine (<LINK REF="REF-Cipriani-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cipriani 2007a</LINK>), sertraline (<LINK REF="REF-Malvini-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malvini 2006</LINK>), fluvoxamine (<LINK REF="REF-Omori-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Omori 2006</LINK>), citalopram (<LINK REF="REF-Imperadore-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Imperadore 2007</LINK>), duloxetine (<LINK REF="REF-Nose-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nose 2007</LINK>), milnacipran (<LINK REF="REF-Nakagawa-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nakagawa 2007</LINK>), paroxetine (<LINK REF="REF-Cipriani-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cipriani 2007b</LINK>) and mirtazapine (<LINK REF="REF-Watanabe-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watanabe 2006</LINK>). Thus, the aim of the present review is to assess the evidence for the efficacy and tolerability of escitalopram in comparison with TCAs, heterocyclics, other SSRIs and newer antidepressants, including non-conventional agents such as herbal products like hypericum (<LINK REF="REF-Linde-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Linde 2008</LINK>), in the acute-phase treatment of major depression.</P>

ICD-9 is not operationalised criteria, because it has only disease names and no diagnostic criteria, so studies using ICD-9 were excluded. However, studies using Feighner criteria or Research Diagnostic Criteria were included. Studies in which less than 20% of the participants might be suffering from bipolar depression were included, but the validity of this decision was examined in a sensitivity analysis. A concurrent secondary diagnosis of another psychiatric disorder was not considered as an exclusion criterion.</P>

<P>We used the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool as recommended in RevMan 5.0.0. This instrument consists of six items. Two of the items assess the strength of the randomisation process in preventing selection bias in the assignment of participants to interventions: adequacy of sequence generation and allocation concealment. The third item (blinding) assesses the influence of performance bias on the study results. The fourth item assesses the likelihood of incomplete outcome data, which raise the possibility of bias in effect estimates. The fifth item assesses selective reporting, the tendency to preferentially report statistically significant outcomes. It requires a comparison of published data with trial protocols, when such are available. The final item refers to other sources of bias that are relevant in certain circumstances, for example, in relation to trial design (methodologic issues such as those related to crossover designs and early trial termination) or setting.</P>
<P>Two review authors (AC, CB) assessed risk of bias in each trial independently, in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>).

<P>Responders and remitters to treatment were calculated on the intention-to-treat (ITT) basis: drop-outs were always included in this analysis.

When there were missing data and the method of "last observation carried forward" (LOCF) had been used to do an ITT analysis, then the LOCF data were used, with due consideration of the potential bias and uncertainty introduced.

<P>Subgroup analyses were performed and interpreted with caution because multiple analyses can lead to false positive conclusions (<LINK REF="REF-Oxman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oxman 1992</LINK>). However, we performed the following subgroup analyses, where possible, for the following a priori reasons:<BR/>1) Escitalopram dosing (fixed low dosage, fixed standard dosage, fixed high dosage; flexible low dosage, flexible standard dosage, flexible high dosage), because there was evidence to suspect that low dosage antidepressant might be associated with better outcomes both in terms of effectiveness and side effects than standard or high dosage antidepressants (<LINK REF="REF-Bollini-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bollini 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2002b</LINK>) and also because fixed versus flexible dosing schedule might affect estimates of treatment effectiveness (<LINK REF="REF-Khan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 2003</LINK>).

<P>The following sensitivity analyses were planned a priori.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-02-10 13:45:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Twenty two trials were included in this review. Some statistically significant differences favouring escitalopram over other antidepressants for the acute phase treatment of major depression were found in terms of efficacy (citalopram and fluoxetine) and acceptability (duloxetine). The included studies did not report on all the outcomes that were pre-specified in the protocol of this review. Outcomes of clear relevance to patients and clinicians, in particular, patients' and their carers' attitudes to treatment, their ability to return to work and resume normal social functioning, were not reported in the included studies. Almost one third of trials used citalopram as the comparator and only a small number of trials per comparison were found for most of the remaining antidepressants (with the exception of fluoxetine). This limits the power of the review to detect moderate, but clinically meaningful differences between the drugs. The dataset of the present review collected insufficient randomised evidence to detect a difference in early response to treatment (after two weeks of treatment). Looking at the data reported in the trials included in this systematic review, the question on comparative efficacy of early onset response has yet to be proven and remains a matter of ongoing debate (<LINK REF="REF-Gourion-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gourion 2008</LINK>).</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2009-02-06 15:53:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It has long been argued that placebo controlled trials are required to adequately demonstrate the efficacy of novel antidepressant drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Kupfer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kupfer 2002</LINK>), however, in the present review we focused only on the comparison between escitalopram and other active treatments. Retrieved randomised evidence compared escitalopram with a small selection of possible comparator antidepressants and no randomised trials comparing escitalopram with fluvoxamine (amongst SSRIs), or with mirtazapine, reboxetine, milnacipran or hypericum (amongst the newest antidepressants), or with any of the first generation antidepressants (such as TCAs or MAOIs) were found. Although the search was thorough, it is still possible that there are unpublished studies that have not been identified but the small number of trials identified per comparison hinders the detection of any publication bias. As in all systematic reviews and meta-analyses, in the present study the main concern is about the amount of the included information. The more information that is pooled together, the more precise and accurate is the estimate (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>). We are realistically aware that a possibly significant piece of information has not been published and thus is not contributing to the true treatment estimate we were seeking. Although we did our very best to retrieve as many data as possible, through asking pharmaceutical companies and study authors to supply all available information, we can assume that data from some trials are still lacking, most of which are likely to be studies with negative findings. We are also aware of the possibility that a number of further randomised controlled trials comparing escitalopram with other antidepressant drugs are currently being conducted and will be included in future updates of the review.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2008-11-21 10:25:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this review the mean sample size was bigger than mean sample size of antidepressant studies included in a similar systematic review comparing fluoxetine versus other antidepressants (<LINK REF="REF-Cipriani-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cipriani 2005</LINK>). Escitalopram is a relatively new compound and the quality of trials in psychiatry may have improved in the last years. Notwithstanding the increased sample size, the great majority of trials still do not report adequate information about randomisation and allocation concealment. The reporting of the outcomes in the included studies was often unclear or incomplete and the figures used for the analyses not immediately understandable. All antidepressant studies included in the review were very similar in design and conduct, and the scant information about randomisation and allocation concealment may be matter of reporting in the text than real defects in study design. However, sometimes there were some discrepancies between published reports and unpublished data available on the websites of the pharmaceutical industries. Dealing with summary statistics, the quality of information is important. Meta-analyses of poor quality studies may be seriously misleading, because the bias associated with defects in the conduct of primary studies (randomised trials) can seriously affect overall estimates of intervention. Systematic reviewers (not only within the Cochrane Collaboration) should routinely assess the risk of bias in the results of trials, and should report meta-analyses restricted to trials at low risk of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Wood-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 2008</LINK>).</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2009-02-10 14:00:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is unanimous evidence of presence of sponsorship bias in medicine and long-standing concern exists about the potential influence of financial interests on medical literature (<LINK REF="REF-Djulbegovic-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Djulbegovic 2000</LINK>). In the field of antidepressant trials sponsorship can play an important role (<LINK REF="REF-Bekelman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bekelman 2003</LINK>). In this review the great majority of the trials were sponsored by the escitalopram manufacturer. Because nearly all the trials were sponsored by the drug company marketing escitalopram, it was not possible to formally examine the potential influence of sponsorship bias in sensitivity analyses. For this reason, the potential for an overestimation of the effect size favouring escitalopram need be considered. Limitations of the primary trials and potential confounders may affect the validity of the findings. Readers cannot fully appreciate a study's meaning without acknowledging the subtle biases in design and interpretation that may arise when a sponsor stands to gain from the report (<LINK REF="REF-Schwartz-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwartz 2008</LINK>). Such associations should be made clear to let anyone judge the relevance of findings.</P>
<P>To clinically assess comparative treatment effectiveness, in this study we used both dichotomous and continuous outcomes (the number of patients who responded and the mean change between baseline and endpoint on standardised rating scales for depressive symptoms, respectively). It has been claimed that a very small difference in symptom score can translate into a very large difference in the proportion of patients who responded (<LINK REF="REF-Moncrieff-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moncrieff 2005</LINK>), however in this review we found that a statistically significant difference in symptom score did not translate into a significant difference in terms of dichotomous outcome. We used an imputation method to impute missing SDs. As reported in the result section, a sensitivity analysis excluding trials for which the SD had to be borrowed was pre-planned and carried out, and the two previously statistically significant results became no more statistically significant. For the fluoxetine comparison, this might be due to the imputation method which could have allowed us to use possibly narrower SDs; by contrast, for the citalopram versus escitalopram studies the difference might be due to the reduction of the overall sample size and, therefore, to the consequent loss of statistical power. However, even though no more statistically significant, the ORs in the sensitivity analysis were consistent with the primary overall analysis. A substantial limitation of some trials was the high rate of patients lost on follow-up (more than 30%). High withdrawal rates reduce the reliability of the assessment of other outcomes. A further limitation of this analysis is that by making multiple comparisons we might have committed a type 1 error, that is, reporting a spurious association. Therefore, results should be interpreted with caution.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2009-02-06 18:09:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In terms of side effect profile, different tolerability profiles for different antidepressants were found. This is an important issue from a clinical point of view and results from this review are consistent with previous findings (<LINK REF="REF-Cipriani-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cipriani 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hansen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hansen 2005</LINK>). However, a full description of tolerability profile of drugs cannot rely solely on randomised evidence (<LINK REF="REF-Etminan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Etminan 2005</LINK>). Furthermore, adverse effects were inconsistently reported in the studies in the present review, thus hampering cross-study comparisons. Standardisation in the reporting of adverse effects is needed, and patients' subjective experience of medication should be given more consideration. The issue about tolerability is clinically important because during the evidence-based decision-making process, clinicians should take into consideration and inform patients of different side effect profiles among antidepressants. However, it has been shown that randomised controlled trials might not be the most effective tool to identify possible causal relationship between antidepressants and even severe adverse events (<LINK REF="REF-De-Abajo-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Abajo 2008</LINK>). This is true for class-related adverse event, but might also be true for each specific compound. As it happens for the second generation antipsychotics (<LINK REF="REF-Kumra-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumra 2008</LINK>), newer antidepressants need more reliable and longer-term studies before knowing the real impact and burden on treated patients in terms of tolerability.</P>
<P>Dosage is another compelling issue when dealing with pharmacological treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Barbui-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barbui 2004</LINK>). In this review almost all studies used treatments within the therapeutic range. Half the studies used a fixed-dose regimen design and the remaining eleven a flexible-dose one. Among the included studies there was no evidence of imbalance in terms of dose design or disease severity favouring the investigational drugs.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-02-10 09:53:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Escitalopram appears to be suitable as first-line antidepressant treatment for moderate to severe major depression. It has been compared with only a few other antidepressants and so we are unable to say whether it is better, worse or the same as many of the other drugs used in practice. As for all other new investigational compounds, the potential for overestimation of treatment effect due to sponsorship bias should be borne in mind. Results reported for comparative efficacy have therefore to be viewed with caution.</P>
<P>Cost effectiveness evaluation of pharmacological treatments is extremely important for health policy purposes. Health economic models have been constructed to assess the cost-utility of antidepressant treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Sobocki-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sobocki 2008</LINK>) and new modelling has been developed to provide methodological benefits in depicting evolution of major depressive disorder, as well (<LINK REF="REF-Le-Lay-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Le Lay 2006</LINK>). By contrast, even though NICE guidelines suggested to prescribe antidepressant with generic formulation (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2007</LINK>), physicians infrequently discuss medication cost and acquisition issues when prescribing new medications (<LINK REF="REF-Tarn-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tarn 2006</LINK>). Some antidepressants have a lower acquisition cost and these are the non-patented drugs. Nowadays only two antidepressants, escitalopram and duloxetine, are still on patent in the US and in Europe. In this analysis we did not perform a full economic analysis. To simply rely on lower cost is not justified by the literature, because the acquisition cost may differ country by country and because several other costs associated with the use of antidepressants should be considered (<LINK REF="REF-Le-Lay-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Le Lay 2006</LINK>). However, acquisition cost of antidepressants may play a important role in impacting on the economic burden of drug prescription for such a common mental health disorder as depression, most of all in developing countries (<LINK REF="REF-Patel-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 2007</LINK>).</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-08-12 20:39:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Future studies should focus to a greater extent on outcomes of clear relevance to patients and clinicians, in particular, patients' and carers' attitudes to treatment, their ability to return to work and resume normal social functioning. Cost-effectiveness information is also needed in the field of antidepressant trials. Recognising the importance of addressing cost and acquisition issues with patients, appropriate economic analysis independent from pharmaceutical industry considering both costs and clinical outcomes should be carried out in the field of antidepressant trials, to improve physician knowledge about helping patients achieve affordable medication regimens.</P>
<P>The main methodological limitation of standard systematic reviews is that they can rely only on evidence from direct comparisons. However, given the wide spectrum of available comparisons for the treatment of major depression, the use of the methodology of multiple treatments meta-analysis (MTM) may help overcome this limitation (<LINK REF="REF-Lumley-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lumley 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lu-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lu 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Salanti-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salanti 2008</LINK>). MTM (also known as <I>network meta-analysis</I>) is a statistical method that enables to integrate data from direct comparisons (when treatments are compared within a randomised trial) and indirect comparisons (when treatments are compared between trials by combining results on how effective they are against a common comparator treatment) involving diverse regimens, and to assess the strength and consistency of the evidence. Many new drugs have been introduced for the treatment of depressive disorder over the last twenty years, many of which are structurally related and share similar putative mechanisms of action. It is unclear to what extent these agents vary in terms of efficacy and tolerability and some of the more recently introduced drugs (e.g. escitalopram) appear to bechemically similar to existing drugs with expiring patents rather than genuine advances in treatment. Some systematic reviews have found inconsistent differences in efficacy between second-generation antidepressants both within and between classes. MTM has already been used in other fields of medicine (<LINK REF="REF-Psaty-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Psaty 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Elliott-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elliott 2007</LINK>) and the review of a MTM comparing a group of antidepressants has been recently published (<LINK REF="REF-Cipriani-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cipriani 2009</LINK>). MTM may provide a clinically useful summary of the results that can be used to guide treatment decisions.</P>

<P>The present study was part of the S-citalopram development program for approval in some European countries through a bridging procedure using results from studies of the racemate, citalopram. Care and medication were free of charge for the patients enrolled in the trial. This study was specifically designed a priori as a superiority study. The sample size was calculated using Singer&#8217;s method. The largest between-group difference was estimated at 5 points, with an SD of 12. Given this assumption, and with an a level of 5% (2-tailed) and a b level of 20%, it was calculated that 100 patients per arm would be needed to achieve sufficient power. Assuming a 10% withdrawal rate, 10 additional patients per arm were included in the design to ensure sufficient power, giving 110 patients per arm (330 patients in total). This research was sponsored by OOO ARBACOM (Moscow, Federation of Russia) (it's unclear the relationship with the escitalopram manufacturer).</P>

<P>The authors report that escitalopram was significantly more effective than citalopram but caution against the &#8220;potential for overestimation of treatment effect due to sponsorship bias.&#8221; Indeed. Both substances were patented by Lundbeck, and the rejuvenated &#8220;me-again&#8221; drug, escitalopram, is merely the active half of the &#8220;old me&#8221; stereoisomer drug, citalopram.</P>
<P>One would not expect a molecule to be better than itself. I therefore suggest that the Cochrane review mention the results of a 2012 meta-analysis (1), also in the abstract and plain language summary. Independent researchers confirmed the Cochrane review&#8217;s findings that escitalopram was better than citalopram in head-to-head trials. All seven trials found this, apart from the single one that was not sponsored by Lundbeck or its affiliates. These researchers also did an indirect comparison of the two drugs based on 10 citalopram and 12 escitalopram placebo controlled trials (1), and now the effect of &#8220;me-again&#8221; and &#8220;old me&#8221; was very similar (odds ratio 1.03; 0.82 to 1.30).</P>
<P>Usually, direct comparisons are more reliable than indirect comparisons, but the drug industry routinely distorts its research to such an extent (2) that the indirect comparisons are sometimes the most reliable ones, which I believe is the case here. Lundbeck did not have any particular incentive to manipulate its placebo controlled studies more with escitalopram than with citalopram.</P>
<P>The Cochrane authors note that cost-effectiveness information is also needed in the field of antidepressant trials. Indeed. Even if we take Lundbeck&#8217;s results in its head-to-head trials at face value, there is no meaningful difference between the two versions of the drug. In one of Lundbeck&#8217;s own meta-analyses, the difference after eight weeks was 1 on a scale that goes up to 60 (2,3), which is totally irrelevant (4).</P>
<P>When I checked the Danish prices in 2009, Cipralex (escitalopram) cost 19 times as much for a daily dose as Cipramil (citalopram). This enormous price difference should have deterred the doctors from using Cipralex, but it didn&#8217;t. The sales of Cipralex were six times higher in monetary terms than the sales of citalopram both at hospitals and in primary care. I have calculated that if all patients had received the cheapest citalopram instead of Cipralex or other SSRIs, Danish taxpayers could have saved around &#8364;30 million a year, or 87% of the total amount spent on SSRIs.</P>

<FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2016-05-03 10:57:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We thank Prof Peter Gtzsche for his interest in our review. We totally agree with him that systematic reviews should include only the best available and unbiased evidence when assessing efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of treatment interventions. We all know that sponsorship bias and publication bias are important limitations of the medical literature on antidepressant (Turner 2008). In our publications (not only in the Cochrane review about escitalopram discussed here) we always do our best to address such relevant issues both in a scientifically and clinically sound manner (Barbui 2008; Cipriani 2009a; Cipriani 2012; Koesters 2013; Purgato 2014).</P>
<P>Our escitalopram review is a Cochrane review published in 2009. Of course in the next update of this review we will take into account not only the new published and unpublished trials about escitalopram in major depression, but also all the relevant contributions on this topic (including the meta-analysis by Alkhafaji et al., published in 2012).</P>
<P>Moreover, we strongly support the added value of combining direct and indirect evidence using network meta-analysis (Cipriani 2009b). Even if it is far from being perfect, this statistical technique can probably produce the most robust and reliable estimates of comparative effectiveness between active treatments. The methods for network meta-analysis will no doubt continue to develop, but they should always be accompanied by critical evaluation of the methods by collaborative groups of epidemiologists, statisticians, clinicians and policymakers, and be informed by the experience gained from increased use (Cipriani 2013).</P>
<P>Finally, we again agree with Prof Gtzsche: even though quite complex to carry out, cost economic analyses can reveal which is the material impact of study findings on clinical practice and real world settings. We look forward to reading Prof Gtzsche's publication about costs of antidepressants in Denmark, so we will be able to better understand the full results of his analysis and its clinical implications.</P>
