<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>People with advanced kidney disease frequently develop heart disease, which is the most common cause of deaths in these people. An increased level of the amino acid (homocysteine) in the blood is a risk factor for heart disease in people with advanced kidney disease. Therapies that reduce homocysteine levels (e.g. folic acid, vitamins B<SUB>6</SUB> and B<SUB>12</SUB>) are often used, but the benefits and harms of their use are unclear. We aimed to assess the benefits and harms of homocysteine-lowering therapies in people with advanced kidney disease who were on dialysis.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>From a search of the literature in January 2016, we identified six randomised controlled trials that involved 2452 participants aged between 48 and 65 years to be analysed.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>We found that homocysteine-lowering therapies had no benefits for heart health in people with advanced kidney disease who were on dialysis. These therapies did not achieve any reduction in rates of heart disease-related death. However, homocysteine-lowering therapies were generally well tolerated, and had a mild side effect profile.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Overall, studies were assessed as high quality.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-04-17 11:07:51 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>People with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) have high rates of cardiovascular events. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of homocysteine-lowering therapies have not shown reductions in cardiovascular event rates in the general population. However, people with kidney disease have higher levels of homocysteine and may have different mechanisms of cardiovascular disease. We performed a systematic review of the effect of homocysteine-lowering therapies in people with ESKD.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-04-07 08:15:32 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>To evaluate the benefits and harms of established homocysteine lowering therapy (folic acid, vitamin B<SUB>6</SUB>, vitamin B<SUB>12</SUB>) on all-cause mortality and cardiovascular event rates in patients with ESKD.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-04-07 08:16:47 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>We searched Cochrane Kidney and Transplant's Specialised Register to 25 January 2016 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-02-04 09:32:33 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Studies conducted in people with ESKD that reported at least 100 patient-years of follow-up and assessed the effect of therapies that are known to have homocysteine-lowering properties were included.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-02-04 09:32:41 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Two authors independently extracted data using a standardised form. The primary outcome was cardiovascular mortality. Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality, incident cardiovascular disease (fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction and coronary revascularisation), cerebrovascular disease (stroke and cerebrovascular revascularisation), peripheral vascular disease (lower limb amputation), venous thromboembolic disease (deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism), thrombosis of dialysis access, and adverse events. The effects of homocysteine-lowering therapies on outcomes were assessed with meta-analyses using random-effects models. Prespecified subgroup and sensitivity analyses were conducted.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-04-07 08:15:32 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>We included six studies that reported data on 2452 participants with ESKD. Interventions investigated were folic acid with or without other vitamins (vitamin B<SUB>6</SUB>, vitamin B<SUB>12</SUB>). Participants' mean age was 48 to 65 years, and proportions of male participants ranged from 50% to 98%.</P>
<P>Homocysteine-lowering therapy probably leads to little or no effect on cardiovascular mortality (4 studies, 1186 participants: RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.22). There was no evidence of heterogeneity among the included studies (I² = 0%). Homocysteine-lowering therapy had little or no effect on all-cause mortality or any other of this review's secondary outcomes. All prespecified subgroup and sensitivity analyses demonstrated little or no difference. Reported adverse events were mild and there was no increase in the incidence of adverse events from homocysteine-lowering therapies (3 studies, 1248 participants: RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.51 to 2.47; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%). Overall, studies were assessed as being at low risk of bias and there was no evidence of publication bias.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-02-04 14:14:45 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-02-04 10:44:28 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Dialysis-dependent end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients have reduced life expectancy, with annual mortality of 14.8% in Australia (<LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2007</LINK>), and 16.7% in the USA (<LINK REF="REF-USRDS-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">USRDS 2007</LINK>). Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an independent and powerful risk factor for cardiovascular disease (<LINK REF="REF-Go-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Go 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weiner-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weiner 2004</LINK>). Cardiovascular mortality is significant in CKD (<LINK REF="REF-de-Jager-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Jager 2009</LINK>). For dialysis-dependent ESKD patients, death from cardiovascular disease is 10 to 100 times higher than in age and sex-matched controls (<LINK REF="REF-Foley-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foley 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>The increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease among ESKD patients is not completely accounted for by the presence of traditional risk factors such as hypertension, dyslipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking, and left ventricular hypertrophy (<LINK REF="REF-Baigent-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baigent 2000</LINK>). Thus, there has been increasing investigation of nontraditional risk factors such as anaemia, hyperparathyroidism and hyperhomocysteinaemia.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-05-20 10:03:10 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>Homocysteine is an amino acid produced from the metabolism of methionine. It is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis by damaging the endothelium and promoting clotting (<LINK REF="REF-Eikelboom-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eikelboom 1999</LINK>). Epidemiological studies have shown homocysteine to be an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (<LINK REF="REF-HSC-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">HSC 2002</LINK>). Elevated homocysteine level is a predictor of vascular disease including stroke, myocardial infarction (MI, heart attack), atherosclerosis (thickening of artery walls), arterial and venous thrombosis (clotting) and cardiovascular death in the general population (<LINK REF="REF-HSC-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">HSC 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wald-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wald 2002</LINK>) and in people with ESKD (<LINK REF="REF-Chauveau-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chauveau 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moustapha-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moustapha 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robinson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>In contrast to the well-documented association between homocysteine levels and vascular events in the general population, the association between homocysteine levels and risk for atherothrombotic disease is not consistent among the ESKD population. Some investigators have described an inverse association between homocysteine levels and clinical outcomes in the ESKD patients with low levels of homocysteine being associated with worse outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Kalantar_x002d_Zadeh-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kalantar-Zadeh 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wrone-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wrone 2001</LINK>). However, even a mild increase in the homocysteine level appears to be a vascular risk factor in the general population and there is high prevalence of hyperhomocysteinaemia in ESKD. Thus, the paradoxical reverse association between homocysteine and clinical outcome in ESKD patients does not as such refute a possible role for homocysteine in the vascular pathogenesis. Furthermore, it has also been shown that association of hyperhomocysteinaemia and worse clinical outcomes persists in ESKD patients without chronic inflammation-malnutrition state (<LINK REF="REF-Ducloux-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ducloux 2006</LINK>). These authors postulate that the burden of chronic inflammation-malnutrition might mask the true relationship between hyperhomocysteinaemia and cardiovascular risk among dialysis-dependent ESKD patients.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-02-04 14:14:45 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Because kidney metabolism is the primary means by which homocysteine is cleared, plasma homocysteine has a strong inverse correlation with estimated glomerular filtration rate (<LINK REF="REF-Freidman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freidman 2001</LINK>). Among patients with ESKD, the prevalence of hyperhomocysteinaemia is 85% to 100% (<LINK REF="REF-Bostom-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bostom 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>In classical homocystinuria, plasma total homocysteine concentrations are very high (100 to 400 &#956;mol/L), and untreated patients die prematurely from venous thromboembolism and malignant arterial disease. Long-term treatment aimed at lowering homocysteine levels has been extremely effective in reducing the potentially life-threatening vascular risk in these patients modified by agents that lower homocysteine such as folic acid and vitamins B<SUB>6</SUB> and B<SUB>12</SUB>. Of the homocysteine-lowering therapies, folic acid is the most effective and consistent in reducing homocysteine levels in ESKD (<LINK REF="REF-van-Guldener-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Guldener 2006</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-01-20 16:00:08 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>A limited number of studies of homocysteine-lowering therapy in ESKD patients have been conducted which individually have been unable to find a statistically significant effect on surrogate markers of cardiovascular disease, cardiovascular events or all-cause mortality (<LINK REF="STD-ASFAST-2004" TYPE="STUDY">ASFAST 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-HOST-Study-2004" TYPE="STUDY">HOST Study 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vianna-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Vianna 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wrone-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wrone 2004</LINK>). The picture is confused by the inability of studies to normalise homocysteine levels in most patients, despite the administration of larger doses of folic acid than in studies of other population groups (<LINK REF="STD-ASFAST-2004" TYPE="STUDY">ASFAST 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gonin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gonin 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although there is no RCT evidence to support folic acid or vitamin B interventions, multivitamin supplementation for patients with ESKD is commonly practiced. The K/DOQI Clinical Practice Guidelines for Cardiovascular Disease in Dialysis Patients promote the administration of folate, vitamins B<SUB>6</SUB> and B<SUB>12</SUB> to compensate for dialysate losses and prevent elevation of homocysteine on the grounds of cardiovascular risk (<LINK REF="REF-K_x002f_DOQI-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">K/DOQI 2005</LINK>). The group also acknowledged the lack of evidence in the area and state that further data are required regarding the effect of vitamin therapy on clinical outcomes. Furthermore potential harms associated with folic acid supplements have not been excluded (<LINK REF="REF-Zoccali-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zoccali 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>In light of the burden of cardiovascular disease for patients with ESKD, the effectiveness or otherwise of any potentially effective interventions needs to be clearly established. This review aimed to assess the benefits and harms of homocysteine lowering therapy among people with ESKD to guide decision making and improve outcomes for patients.</P>

Shunt thromboses were not regarded as an end point.</P>
<P>The primary outcome in <LINK REF="STD-HOST-Study-2004" TYPE="STUDY">HOST Study 2004</LINK> was time to death from any cause. Secondary outcomes were time to MI, stroke, amputation of all or part of a lower extremity, and a composite of these three plus all-cause mortality.</P>
<P>For <LINK REF="STD-Righetti-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Righetti 2003</LINK>, the primary outcome was a composite cardiovascular end point (typical history of angina with abnormal myocardial scintigraphy or coronarography, fatal and nonfatal MI, symptomatic extracranial carotid stenosis resulting in carotid endarterectomy, fatal and nonfatal stroke and sudden cardiac arrest). There were no secondary outcomes.</P>
<P>The primary outcome in <LINK REF="STD-Vianna-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Vianna 2007</LINK> was a composite of new major cardiovascular events, including death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal MI, cardiac arrhythmias, angina, heart failure, and cerebral vascular accident. Secondary outcome was the evaluation of the intima-media thickness of the common carotid arteries.</P>
<P>For <LINK REF="STD-Wrone-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wrone 2004</LINK>, the primary outcomes were cardiovascular events (coronary artery intervention, MI, stroke, transient ischaemic attack, carotid endarterectomy, limb amputation) and mortality.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-04-07 08:15:31 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>In this systematic review including 2452 participants with ESKD, randomisation to folic acid-based homocysteine-lowering therapy did not affect cardiovascular mortality, all-cause mortality, and incidence of cardiovascular events including MI, stroke, venous or access thrombosis. Null results were consistently observed across all prespecified subgroups and sensitivity analyses. Reported adverse events from these therapies were mild and rates of adverse events were variable across the studies. Overall, there was no evidence of harm defined by rates of adverse events in this population.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-05-20 11:01:53 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>Guidelines for ESKD patients routinely suggest supplementation with folic acid and B group vitamins (homocysteine-lowering therapies) without lack of clear evidence (<LINK REF="REF-K_x002f_DOQI-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">K/DOQI 2005</LINK>), and many people with ESKD appear to be receiving folic acid supplementation (<LINK REF="REF-Andreucci-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andreucci 2004</LINK>). Our findings suggest that folic acid-based homocysteine-lowering should not be used for cardiovascular prevention in people with kidney disease, a population in whom medication burden is often high.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-04-07 08:15:31 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>The strengths of our systematic review we that an important clinical question has been investigated focusing on a study population with ESKD, using rigorous methodology and study search strategy techniques. We found consistent null results in primary, secondary, subgroup and sensitivity analyses.</P>
<P>These findings have direct implications for millions of people with ESKD globally who are currently taking homocysteine-lowering medications.</P>
<P>Risk of selection bias related to random sequence generation and allocation concealment was low in 50% of the included studies. Risks attributed to performance, attrition, detection, and reporting biases were low in more than 65% of included studies.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-04-07 08:15:31 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Limitations of our systematic review include reliance on tabular rather than individual patient level data. We focused on cardiovascular mortality as our primary outcome; however, this outcome was reported in only four of the six included studies. Competing risks for cardiovascular mortality were not analysed. Although funnel plot analysis suggested a low possibility of publication bias, this cannot be excluded based on the small number of included studies. We could not conduct separate analyses for peritoneal and haemodialysis patients since adequate data were not available. Overall, participants from the included studies were younger than the average ESKD population and this may limit generalisability.</P>
<P>Data on genetic polymorphisms that determine homocysteine-lowering effects of therapies (<LINK REF="REF-Klerk-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klerk 2002</LINK>) were not available; however, these polymorphisms have been shown to have no effects among dialysis patients (<LINK REF="REF-Aucella-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aucella 2005</LINK>). Nevertheless, although lowering of homocysteine levels were noted in all studies, normalisation of homocysteine levels was rare, pointing to the possibility of folic acid resistance in ESKD patients (<LINK REF="REF-Robinson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 1996</LINK>) and possible need for higher doses. However, in studies where high dose (&gt; 5 mg daily) folic acid was administered, similar null effects on outcomes were noted (<LINK REF="STD-ASFAST-2004" TYPE="STUDY">ASFAST 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-HOST-Study-2004" TYPE="STUDY">HOST Study 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wrone-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wrone 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Recent data indicate that there may be non-cardiovascular benefits of homocysteine lowering in the general population (such as reduced fracture risk) (<LINK REF="REF-Yang-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yang 2012</LINK>) and our review did not evaluate effects on such outcomes.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-02-04 09:29:46 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Our findings were consistent with a recent meta-analysis conducted in the general population for cardiovascular mortality, all-cause mortality and MI (<LINK REF="REF-Huang-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huang 2012</LINK>); however, our findings were discordant in terms of effects on stroke risk reduction.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Huang-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huang 2012</LINK> pooled data from 19 studies that included 47,921 participants and observed approximately 12% reduction in stroke risk in the general population. Although the analyses by <LINK REF="REF-Huang-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huang 2012</LINK> suffer from heterogeneity of patient populations in the pooled studies, other possible reasons for differences in stroke risk reduction between general and ESKD populations may relate to differences in biological risk factors for cerebrovascular disease in dialysis versus general populations (<LINK REF="REF-Kanbay-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanbay 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-VITATOPS-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">VITATOPS 2010</LINK> was conducted in patients who had experienced a recent stroke or transient ischaemic attack and found no significant difference for cardiovascular events (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.00, P = 0.05) or stroke (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.06).</P>
<P>There have been two recent meta-analyses that evaluated the effects of homocysteine lowering therapies on cardiovascular events in patients with kidney disease. <LINK REF="REF-Jardine-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jardine 2012</LINK> included 11 studies comprising 4389 patients with CKD, 2452 with ESKD, and 4110 with functioning kidney transplants. In <LINK REF="REF-Jardine-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jardine 2012</LINK>, folic acid-based therapy did not reduce cardiovascular event incidence (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.03, P = 0.326). <LINK REF="REF-Pan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pan 2012</LINK> pooled 10 studies involving 4836 participants with CKD or ESKD. The investigators noted that the estimated relative risks were not significantly different for any cardiovascular outcomes and all-cause mortality.</P>
<P>Our findings were consistent with these findings. In addition, we specifically derived outcome data on ESKD patients from studies that involved both CKD and ESKD patients (<LINK REF="STD-ASFAST-2004" TYPE="STUDY">ASFAST 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-HOST-Study-2004" TYPE="STUDY">HOST Study 2004</LINK>). Considering these differences, we believe that the findings of our review are likely to be a better estimate of the true effect of folic acid-based homocysteine-lowering on cardiovascular outcomes in ESKD patients. In combination with results from <LINK REF="REF-Jardine-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jardine 2012</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Pan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pan 2012</LINK> we feel confident regarding our conclusions on null effect from homocysteine-lowering therapies in ESKD patients and further solidify futility of such treatments as discussed in a recent editorial (<LINK REF="REF-Haynes-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haynes 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Recent data regarding associations between hyperhomocysteinaemia and cardiovascular risk (<LINK REF="REF-Menon-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Menon 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Suliman-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suliman 2007</LINK>) have questioned the earlier findings that linked hyperhomocysteinaemia with increased cardiovascular risk (<LINK REF="REF-Robinson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 1996</LINK>) and thus further strengthen our conclusions. In fact, hyperhomocysteinaemia in ESKD may be an illustration of reverse epidemiology with some authors finding elevated homocysteine levels associated with reduced cardiovascular risk (<LINK REF="REF-Kalantar_x002d_Zadeh-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kalantar-Zadeh 2004</LINK>) as has been described for factors such as obesity (<LINK REF="REF-Kalantar_x002d_Zadeh-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kalantar-Zadeh 2005</LINK>) in the population with ESKD. Regardless of the nature of the association reported by observational studies, our results clearly indicate that interventions to lower homocysteine levels in people with ESKD do not offer cardiovascular risk reduction and are likely to be futile. We found one study listed at clinicaltrials.gov with unknown recruitment status on this topic (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00004495" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00004495</LINK>); however, the enrolment goal for this study is listed as 84 and it is unlikely to significantly affect results of our analyses.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-05-20 11:10:15 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>In patients with ESKD, homocysteine-lowering therapies do not reduce mortality (cardiovascular and all-cause) or cardiovascular events. Homocysteine-lowering therapies should not be used in the ESKD population for cardiovascular risk reduction.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-05-20 11:10:29 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>From this review and meta-analyses, we conclude that there is no benefit in terms of cardiovascular health and mortality from homocysteine-lowering therapies in ESKD patients. The lack of benefit is consistent across various subgroups and in sensitivity analyses. Future research efforts in ESKD should focus on alternative therapies for the prevention of cardiovascular events.

<P>In the protocol, we mentioned N-acetyl cysteine as an intervention that lowers serum homocysteine levels to be considered for this review. Although it has this effect there are significant other effects including anti-oxidant effects from this intervention and since this review is focused on interventions that primarily reduce homocysteine, we decided to not include studies that evaluated N-acetyl cysteine in the ESKD setting in this review.
