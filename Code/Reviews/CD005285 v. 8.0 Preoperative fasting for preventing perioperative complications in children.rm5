<P>General anaesthetics inhibit the protective reflexes that stop the stomach contents reaching the lungs. In order to prevent the inadvertent inhalation of stomach contents, children are often advised to have nothing to eat or drink from the midnight before surgery. However, the review of trials found that drinking clear fluids up to a few hours before surgery did not increase the risk of regurgitation during or after surgery. Indeed there is an added benefit of a more comfortable preoperative experience in terms of thirst and hunger. Some children are considered more likely to regurgitate under anaesthetic, including those who are obese or have stomach disorders. More research is needed to determine whether these children can also safely drink up to a few hours before surgery.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2009-08-04 15:51:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Children, like adults, are required to fast before general anaesthesia with the aim of reducing the volume and acidity of their stomach contents. It is thought that fasting reduces the risk of regurgitation and aspiration of gastric contents during surgery. Recent developments have encouraged a shift from the standard 'nil-by-mouth-from-midnight' fasting policy to more relaxed regimens. Practice has been slow to change due to questions relating to the duration of a total fast, the type and amount of intake permitted. </P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2008-06-10 14:52:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To systematically assess the effects of different fasting regimens (duration, type and volume of permitted intake) and the impact on perioperative complications and patient well being (aspiration, regurgitation, related morbidity, thirst, hunger, pain, comfort, behaviour, nausea and vomiting) in children.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2009-07-02 13:50:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 25/6/09), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (<I>The Cochrane Library</I>, Issue 2 2009), Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to June Week 2 2009), Ovid EMBASE (1980 to 2009 Week 25), EBSCO CINAHL (1982 to June Week 3 2009), the National Research Register, relevant conference proceedings and article reference lists and contacted experts.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-08-04 15:51:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This first update of the review identified two additional eligible studies, bringing the total number of included studies to 25 (forty seven randomised controlled comparisons involving 2543 children considered to be at normal risk of regurgitation or aspiration during anaesthesia). Only one incidence of aspiration and regurgitation was reported.</P>
<P>Children permitted fluids up to 120 minutes preoperatively were not found to experience higher gastric volumes or lower gastric pH values than those who fasted. The children permitted fluids were less thirsty and hungry, better behaved and more comfortable than those who fasted.</P>
<P>Clear fluids preoperatively did not result in a clinically important difference in children's gastric volume or pH. Evidence relating to the preoperative intake of milk was sparse. The volume of fluid permitted during the preoperative period did not appear to impact on children's intraoperative gastric volume or pH contents.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-07-02 13:48:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is no evidence that children who are denied oral fluids for more than six hours preoperatively benefit in terms of intraoperative gastric volume and pH compared with children permitted unlimited fluids up to two hours preoperatively. Children permitted fluids have a more comfortable preoperative experience in terms of thirst and hunger. This evidence applies only to children who are considered to be at normal risk of aspiration/regurgitation during anaesthesia.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-06-26 11:20:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The amount and type of food and fluid that children need preoperatively varies with age. A neonate (a baby less than one month old) needs to be fed often with milk (breast milk, non-human milk or formula) to prevent hunger and thirst while the physiological needs of the adolescent (child 12 to 18 years) are similar to those of an adult (<LINK REF="REF-Aitkenhead-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aitkenhead 1996</LINK>). Reflexes that normally protect the airway and lungs are depressed or may even be absent during general anaesthesia (<LINK REF="REF-Aitkenhead-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aitkenhead 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Litman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Litman 1999</LINK>). Food or fluid regurgitated from the stomach and entering the lungs (aspiration) may lead to aspiration pneumonia (<LINK REF="REF-Mendelson-1946" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mendelson 1946</LINK>) and even death. The aspiration of breast milk or infant formula in particular results in severe damage to the lungs (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Hare-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Hare 1996</LINK>). Children are usually starved of food and fluid before their surgery to reduce the risk of aspiration during anaesthesia.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-06-26 11:20:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite the uncertainty surrounding the critical values of gastric contents older children and adults have traditionally followed a nil-by-mouth (NPO) from midnight instruction before morning surgery. For afternoon surgery, an early light breakfast is permitted which in the UK is typically a cup of tea and slice of toast. The traditional fast for younger children however appears to be less globally defined. Fasting regimens shorter than NPO from midnight were in place at some centres (<LINK REF="REF-Hunt-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hunt 1987</LINK>). Typically this more relaxed approach permitted clear fluids up to four hours preoperatively for infants (1 to 12 months), six hours for children (1 to 5 years) and eight hours for children older than 5 years. Other centres continued to apply the nil-by-mouth-from-midnight policy.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-06-26 11:20:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Fasting aims to reduce the volume and acidity of children's stomach contents. Children and adults however are often fasted (nil-by-mouth or NPO) from midnight before their surgery which may result in a fast of 12 hours or more (<LINK REF="REF-MacLean-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacLean 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Veall-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Veall 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-While-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">While 1992</LINK>). The incidence and severity of aspiration pneumonia is thought to be dependent on the volume and acidity of the stomach contents aspirated. No study has looked at the resulting pneumonia following aspiration of various volumes and pHs of gastric contents in humans but there are animal model studies as listed below such as <LINK REF="REF-James-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">James 1984</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Raidoo-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raidoo 1990</LINK>. The link between fasting, the content of children's stomachs during surgery and the risk of injury, should the contents be regurgitated and aspirated, is not clear. Many researchers have adopted the arbitrarily defined critical values of acidity (a pH value of less than 2.5) and volume (below 0.4 ml/kg) based on unpublished rhesus monkey data (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1974</LINK>). It is widely recognised that these measures are flawed (<LINK REF="REF-Schreiner-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schreiner 1998</LINK>) and recent research suggests that the acidity of the contents maybe more relevant than volume (<LINK REF="REF-James-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">James 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Raidoo-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raidoo 1990</LINK>). The evidence in relation to human breast milk and formula however is equivocal (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Hare-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Hare 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Hare-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Hare 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Before stomach contents can be regurgitated and aspirated into the lungs (leading to aspiration pneumonia) there must be a sufficient volume of contents in the stomach. We do not know what this critical volume is and it may never be possible to accurately establish the exact values required to pose a threat to child safety. As outcome measures, volume and pH value of stomach contents can only be considered surrogate measures of risk while more reliable measures are not (and may never be) available. Children rarely regurgitate and aspirate their stomach contents while anaesthetised and so aspiration pneumonia (and related death) is even rarer (<LINK REF="REF-Engelhardt-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Engelhardt 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kluger-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kluger 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NCEPOD-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCEPOD 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-SASM-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">SASM 2002</LINK>). Therefore large multicenter trials would be required to demonstrate a difference in the effectiveness of a fasting regimen based on such rare but clinically important outcome measures.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Guidelines</HEADING>
<P>The American Academy of Pediatrics (Committee on Drugs) was the first to publish specific guidelines for children fasting preoperatively. They recommended that clear fluids could be taken up to two hours prior to anaesthesia while milk or solids could be consumed up to four hours preoperatively for neonates, six hours for infants and eight hours for children. More recent guidelines published by the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) recommended a six-hour fast from non-human milk or infant formula for neonates and infants but a less conservative fast from breast milk of four hours preoperatively. Guidelines published by the Royal College of Nursing in 2005 (<LINK REF="REF-RCN-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCN 2005</LINK>) also follow the ASA recommendations of the "2-4-6 rule" (2 hours for clear fluids, 4 hours for breast milk and 6 hours for solids (including formula or cows' milk)) as do the Canadian Anesthesiolgists' Society (<LINK REF="REF-Canadian-Anesthesiologists_x0027_-Society-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Canadian Anesthesiologists' Society 2008</LINK>) although they recommend 8 hours after a meal that includes meat, fried or fatty foods. The Scandinavian Guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-S_x00f8_reide-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Søreide 2005</LINK>) differ only in their inclusion of formula milk in the 4 hour rule along with breast milk (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> for details). Several other national guidelines suggest that their members adhere to the recommendations of the ASA (<LINK REF="REF-AAGBI-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAGBI 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NHSQIS-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHSQIS 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite the publication of guidelines, many hospitals have been slow to adjust children's fasts (<LINK REF="REF-Engelhardt-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Engelhardt 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ferrari-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferrari 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haas-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haas 1998</LINK>). In a survey many British and Irish paediatric anaesthetists* allowed children to drink clear fluids up to two hours preoperatively (guidelines recommendation) but as many as 25% did not. Instructions relating to other intake, i.e. breast milk, formula, non-human milk and solids demonstrated even more variation (<LINK REF="REF-Emerson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emerson 1998</LINK>). Similar variations in permitted milk intake have also been found (<LINK REF="REF-Engelhardt-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Engelhardt 2001</LINK>) and in some cases anaesthetists are permitting milk intake closer to surgery time than is currently supported by the guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Hofer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofer 2001</LINK>). Milk, although a liquid, behaves more like a solid within the stomach with curds forming.</P>
<P>Such inconsistencies in practice may reflect a degree of uncertainty in evaluating the evidence relating to the preoperative intake of milk. Local policies require the consensus of the whole preoperative care multidisciplinary team (anaesthetists and nurses) as they strive to achieve a balance between a child's unnecessary starvation and their safety, hydration and well being. Thus, some clinicians may well be reluctant to alter an existing policy (or their own practice) that they believe ensures patients' safety (though not perhaps their comfort). The disparate nature of the evidence in relation to fasting from milk and other food and fluid intake makes it difficult for clinicians to independently evaluate the quality and relevance of the evidence for themselves.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Evaluating the evidence</HEADING>
<P>Researchers have investigated the duration of fasting, the volume and the type of intake permitted during a restricted fasting period using a variety of outcome measures. We have described the complexities of using the objective (if surrogate) outcome measures of gastric content volume and pH above. In some cases non-absorbable marker dyes were used to measure the volume of children's stomach contents. Phenolsulfonphthalein (phenol red) or bromosulphthalein (BSP) were added to children's stomach contents (either before or during surgery) and the concentration of the dyes in the stomach was expressed as a percentage of the original dye ingested and thus provided an indication of gastric emptying. In addition, children's ratings of thirst, hunger and comfort were also collected using visual analogue scales (VAS). Very young children however were unable to complete the scale (or other formal measure) and so, in some cases parents described their child's thirst, hunger, behaviour and comfort.</P>
<P>Following our systematic review of preoperative fasting for adults (<LINK REF="REF-Brady-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brady 2003</LINK>) we expected some complexity in evaluating the evidence. Pharmacological co-interventions such as H<SUB>2</SUB> receptor antagonists (for example ranitidine) which function to inhibit the production of gastric acid, antacids which raise gastric pH or anti-emetic drugs which increase gastrointestinal motility (for example metoclopramide, domperidone) were anticipated. We also expected the evidence to address a wide age range of children with fasting policy varying according to the child's age making comparisons difficult. In addition, some children are considered to be at a high risk of regurgitation and aspiration. For example, children who require emergency surgery or those who are obese may have delayed rates of gastric emptying and thus require a specific fast to ensure an empty stomach (<LINK REF="REF-Hofer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofer 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Results that are not statistically significant should be interpreted with caution as they do not necessarily indicate no difference exists (<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2004</LINK>). Instead our interpretation should be <I>clinically</I> based on how certain we are that any important benefits or harms have been excluded (<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Altman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Man_x002d_Son_x002d_Hing-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Man-Son-Hing 2002</LINK>). This judgement should be made on the basis of predetermined thresholds or limits of equivalence (<LINK REF="REF-Man_x002d_Son_x002d_Hing-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Man-Son-Hing 2002</LINK>). It is difficult to establish precise values especially in relation to preoperative fasting and many of the issues have been mentioned above. They include the low incidence (and reporting) of the primary outcome of aspiration and regurgitation, the surrogate nature of the alternative primary outcomes gastric pH and volume, the lack of valid critical gastric values and differences between individual clinicians' and patients' interpretation of what is considered clinically important (for example <LINK REF="REF-Smith-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2004</LINK>). Given these complexities the picture in relation to the optimum preoperative fasting regimen for children is a complex one. We set out to systematically gather and review the available evidence in relation to preoperative fasting for children and make it available to clinicians so that they could independently evaluate the evidence.</P>

<P>Within the related review of preoperative fasting in adults (<LINK REF="REF-Brady-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brady 2003</LINK>) we defined a standard fast as NPO from midnight before morning surgery with a light breakfast permitted early in the morning before afternoon surgery. However, as described above, many traditional fasting policies for children recognise the variation in this population. Typically, these more lenient traditional NPO fasts are four hours for infants (1 to 12 months), six hours for children (1 to 5 years) and eight hours for children older than 5 years. A small drink (up to 30 ml) to assist the intake of oral medication was also permitted during the standard fasting period. Studies that evaluated the following fasting regimens were considered for inclusion in the review. The order in which they are presented corresponds to the objectives of the review.<BR/>1.

<P>We identified the relevant literature using the search strategies detailed in the review. Procite, a bibliographic database package, was used to manage the references. lnvestigative trials which addressed preoperative fasting amongst children (in terms of duration of fast, type/volume of intake permitted) were identified.

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2009-07-02 13:52:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A system of coding the methodological quality of trials was adapted from a report by the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (<LINK REF="REF-CRD-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">CRD 2001</LINK>) and piloted. Two review authors (MB and SK or VN) independently evaluated quality and we resolved any disagreement in coding through discussion. Aspects of methodological quality considered included:<BR/>- listing of inclusion and exclusion criteria;<BR/>- evidence of an a priori sample size calculation;<BR/>- indication of the comparability of groups at baseline ;<BR/>- evidence of an intention-to-treat analysis (coded as yes/no);<BR/>- details of the method of generating the randomisation sequence ;<BR/>- evidence of concealment of allocation;<BR/>- evidence of blinding of assessors.</P>
<P>Details of the coding system can be found in <LINK REF="REF-CRD-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">CRD 2001</LINK>. Where relevant information was unavailable from the text, trial authors were contacted. Details of whether trial quality evaluations were based on published information or information provided by authors can be found in <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK> Details of Quality Evaluation by Trial.</P>
<P>For the update of this review two review authors independently assessed each included study using the Cochrane Collaboration tool for assessing risk of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). This tool addresses specific domains, namely, for this review update, sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding and incomplete outcome data. Blinding and completeness of outcome data were assessed for each outcome separately. We completed a risk of bias table for each eligible study. We discussed any disagreement amongst all review authors to achieve a consensus.</P>
<P>We will present assessment of risk of bias using a 'risk of bias summary figure', which presents all of the judgments in a cross-tabulation of study by entry. This display of internal validity indicates the weight the reader may give the results of each study.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2009-03-05 15:22:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Valerie Ness">
<P>To enable us to interpret the evidence from the meta-analyses where no significant difference between the groups was observed ideally requires some definition of threshold values or limits of equivalence. We mentioned above the lack of valid gastric content volume and pH limits of equivalence. However, some degree of interpretation is possible. Where the results of a meta-analysis demonstrated very narrow confidence intervals it was possible to state that the results provided little indication of an important clinical difference between the two groups. Similarly, where the confidence intervals were clearly wide and scattered, a statement was made to indicate that based on this result, insufficient evidence was available at present to state whether or not an important difference exists. In some cases the decision as to whether or not a clinically important difference existed was more subjective and in such cases individual readers should interpret the results within their own framework of clinical importance.</P>

<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2009-03-05 15:22:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Valerie Ness">
<P>Where relevant information was unavailable from the text, we contacted the trial authors and asked them to provide missing details. Where trials were published more than once, we used all the available sources of information to retrieve the maximum amount of information possible. In the event of any inconsistency we contacted the authors to resolve the issue. Where this was not possible the most comprehensive trial report was used and all publications referring to the results of the trials were recorded.</P>
</MISSING_DATA>
<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2009-07-02 13:53:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Some of the outcome variables in this review (for example residual gastric values of volume and pH) have skewed distributions. Except for trials with very small sample sizes, treatment comparisons based on mean and standard deviation (SD) summary data can be safely assumed as being approximately normally distributed i.e. with the mean and SD summary data the usual weighted mean difference approach is robust to skewness.</P>
<P>Unfortunately often study authors only report group medians and ranges (for example minimum and maximum or 25th and 75th percentiles) for skewed data and do not present means and SDs. While mean and SD summary statistics were sought it was not always possible to get these from the available data or directly from the authors. Where this was the case, pseudo-values were calculated (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Rourke-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Rourke 2002</LINK>) so that the usual weighted mean difference approach could be used. For the purposes of this review, the term pseudo is used to indicate that the values for the mean (pseudo-mean) and SD (pseudo-SD) are not true mean and SD values. These pseudo-values are estimates of what the true mean and SD values might be and allow for the uncertainty entailed by not actually observing them directly, only estimating them indirectly via other summary measures.</P>
<P>One of the authors (KO'R) has developed two approaches to the calculation of these values (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Rourke-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Rourke 2002</LINK>). The first, which is fairly mathematical, calculates and uses a likelihood based on the summaries in hand and requires the use of numerical optimization software (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Rourke-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Rourke 2002</LINK>). The second avoids the need for numerical optimization software by drawing on statistical methods for dealing with reported group medians and various ranges as linear combinations of order statistics (<LINK REF="REF-Arnold-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arnold 1992</LINK>). This method uses least squares to estimate the best linear estimates of the unreported mean and SD along with an appropriate standard error for the pseudo-mean, which again reflects uncertainty entailed by not actually observing the mean. These pseudo-means and pseudo-SDs are then entered into RevMan and treated as if they were actually observed (again, the process above having made allowance for them being estimated rather than actually observed). In general the first approach was used and where this was not possible the second approach was used. Except for highly skewed data, the results tend to be very similar and for highly skewed data the first approach is arguably more correct. Sensitivity analysis for the amount of skew can be carried out for the second approach, and this was done whenever the first approach was not available. With the pseudo-means and pseudo-SDs in hand, the usual methods for meta-analysis of means and SDs via weighted mean differences can be carried out.</P>
<P>In some cases a trial which randomly allocated children to two (or more) intervention groups but only one control group were included within one meta-analysis (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1990a" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1990a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1990b" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1990b</LINK> are included in Comparison 05: Type of Intake - Fluid versus Standard Fast, Outcome: 03 Gastric Contents - pH 04 Fruit Juice versus Standard Fast). Where this was the case, we avoided counting the individuals in the control group twice by 'splitting' the numbers in the control group across both interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Oxford-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oxford 2001</LINK>). This splitting ensures that the pooled results are correct, but does understate the evidence available for the various individual comparisons in that these individual confidence intervals are wider than they ideally need to be. Division of the number of children was as equal as possible using whole numbers.</P>
<P>The primary continuous outcome variables in relation to gastric content (volume, pH, marker dye concentration) were summarised using weighted mean differences. Chi squared calculations (significance level set at p &lt; 0.1) were made using RevMan. Trials which evaluated similar interventions using similar outcome measures in the absence of clinical or methodological heterogeneity were pooled. We used a random effects model in the presence of statistical heterogeneity and to pool summary data that included pseudo-value calculations. Details of these aspects will be reported for each section.</P>
<P>The various subjective approaches used to evaluate the secondary outcome measures of thirst, hunger, behaviour, comfort, nausea and vomiting could not be pooled in a quantitative fashion but were summarised in a tabular format. Details of the measurement tool, the timing of the measurement, the comparisons made and the results of the comparison were profiled and discussed in a narrative fashion within the results section.</P>

Given the wide range of geographical settings there is remarkable methodological consistency across all 24 trials that sampled gastric contents. One trial, (<LINK REF="STD-Castillo_x002d_Zamora-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Castillo-Zamora 2005</LINK>) did not sample gastric contents.</P>
<P>Where gastric contents were collected the methodology used a syringe to aspirate the stomach contents following insertion of a tube. Two trials used a nasogastric tube (<LINK REF="STD-Aun-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Aun 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gombar-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gombar 1997</LINK>) while <LINK REF="STD-Moyao_x002d_Garc_x00ed_a-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Moyao-García 2001</LINK> mention the collection of gastric contents during an endoscopic examination. The remaining 20 trials all used oro-gastric tubing which was in some cases further described as multi orifice (Cook Sather 2003; Crawford 1990; Sandhar 1989; <LINK REF="STD-Sarti-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Sarti 1991</LINK>), Salem sump (Goresky 1992; <LINK REF="STD-Kushikata-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kushikata 1996</LINK>; Maekawa 1993; <LINK REF="STD-Nicolson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Nicolson 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schreiner-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Schreiner 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1989</LINK>; Splinter 1990; Splinter Schaefer 3; <LINK REF="STD-Splinter-Schaefer-2" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter Schaefer 2</LINK>), Ryles (Meakin 1985), Levine (Spinter Schaefer 1a; Spinter Schaefer 1b) or a catheter (<LINK REF="STD-Welborn-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Welborn 1993</LINK>).

No trial reported children's experience of nausea during the preoperative period. Given the wide variety of methods used to evaluate these secondary measures and the subjective nature of their report (in most cases children's self-report) a qualitative approach to between-trial comparisons was adopted. Details of the secondary outcome measures employed (detailing the method and timing of the data collection) will be presented within the results section. <LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1989</LINK>; Splinter 1990 and <LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1991</LINK> employed a linear analogue scale to measure secondary outcomes, which will be referred to here as a visual analogue scale.</P>
<P>No trial specifically recruited children considered to be at a high risk of regurgitation/aspiration during anaesthesia, for example obese children (calculated with reference to age, height, weight). All the remaining trials recruited children undergoing elective surgery with most described as ASA I-II (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). Five trials did not report the children's ASA status (<LINK REF="STD-Kushikata-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kushikata 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Splinter-Schaefer-1a" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter Schaefer 1a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Splinter-Schaefer-1b" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter Schaefer 1b</LINK>; van der Walt 1986; <LINK REF="STD-Welborn-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Welborn 1993</LINK>) but described the children as 'healthy'. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Nicolson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Nicolson 1992</LINK>), was based on children undergoing elective cardiac surgery classed as ASA II-IV. Most trials took measures to exclude gastric disease, disorders and/or drugs that affected gastric secretion or motility with only three failing to indicate these as exclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Kushikata-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kushikata 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sarti-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Sarti 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Welborn-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Welborn 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>In conducting this systematic review we had prespecified three main age groups of children that we felt were of clinical relevance - neonate (under 1 month), infant (1 to 12 months), and children (over 12 months). While nineteen trials had limited recruitment to children other trials had recruited across age ranges (see <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK> for details). Three had recruited neonates (Cook Sather 2003; Splinter Schaefer 3; van der Walt 1986), five had recruited infants (Cook Sather 2003; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nicolson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Nicolson 1992</LINK>; Splinter Schaefer 3; van der Walt 1986), five had recruited older children (over 12 years) that could be classified as adolescents (Crawford 1990; Maekawa 1993; Meakin 1985; Sandhar 1989; <LINK REF="STD-Schreiner-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Schreiner 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1991</LINK>). There was a considerable degree of overlap within and between trials and it was not always possible to extract the age-group specific data. Given the degree of overlap all age group data will initially be presented together which will then be followed with a further exploration of age specific issues as permitted by the available data.</P>

<P>Blinding of participants and assessors as to the intake of food/fluid is difficult if not impossible to achieve in a trial evaluating a preoperative fasting regimen. However, blinding of the anaesthetist, sample collector and assessor is possible for trials that aim to measure children's gastric content values. Children cannot be blinded as to whether or not they have had something to eat or drink, and even blinding as to the volume of intake is difficult. Some comparisons do allow for such blinding. Two trials blinded children as to the type of pharmacological co intervention by administering either placebo or ranitidine (Goresky 1992; Sandhar 1989) but evaluation of such pharmacological interventions was not the focus of this review. The difficulty of blinding children (and their parents) as to whether they have had a drink or eaten is acknowledged and the impact this might have on the collection of outcome measures (e.g. ratings of thirst, hunger, comfort) is recognised and will be returned to in the results and discussion sections.</P>
<P>For the purposes of evaluating the quality of the trials, blinding ratings refer to the adequacy of blinding the assessors that collected and measured the gastric content values only and not to the blinding of participants or individuals involved in the collection of patient reported secondary outcome measures. Blinding details were unavailable for five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Kushikata-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kushikata 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1990</LINK>; Sandhar 1989; <LINK REF="STD-Sarti-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Sarti 1991</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Welborn-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Welborn 1993</LINK>) while for an additional four trials there were some qualifications to the blinding observed. In these four cases the blinding was restricted to either the ranitidine/placebo intervention (Goresky 1992), the assessor collecting the thirst and behaviour reports (<LINK REF="STD-Gombar-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gombar 1997</LINK>), the assessor measuring the gastric pH (Senayli 2007) or the assessor measuring gastric pH and food particles (Meakin 1989). The remaining 16 trials that collected gastric pH and volume measures were found to have adequate blinding of the assessors. The study that did not collect these measures was found to have adequate blinding of the assessors (<LINK REF="STD-Castillo_x002d_Zamora-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Castillo-Zamora 2005</LINK>).</P>

<P>Participant groups were demonstrated to be comparable at baseline by most trials although the level of comparison varied. Three trials found significant differences between the groups. <LINK REF="STD-Gombar-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gombar 1997</LINK> found the children who were fasted in the standard manner were heavier, older and had more females than the intervention group while the children given 10 ml/kg of fluid were lighter than the children given 6ml/kg in the trial by Splinter 1990. Neither trialists undertook an adjusted analysis to account for these differences. The children permitted intake in the van der Walt 1986 study we heavier than those that continued to fast.

<P>As observed in the systematic review relating to adults fasting preoperatively (<LINK REF="REF-Brady-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brady 2003</LINK>), it became clear from examining the available mean and standard deviation (SD) summary data in this review that there was also some indication of skewed distribution (mean/SD &lt; 1.64). Given the nature of the gastric volume and pH continuous outcome measures, it was not unexpected to find naturally positively skewed distributions. As described previously (<LINK REF="REF-Brady-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brady 2003</LINK>), some authors had as a result chosen to present the skewed distributions using median and range values. In our previous work we developed a method of calculating pseudo-values (described above) which allowed us to include within the meta-analysis those trials that reported only median and range summary statistics.</P>
<P>All but one of the 25 trials measured children's intra-operative gastric contents volume and/or pH. Methods of reporting the summary data for these continuous outcome measures (volume and pH) varied across trials. Mean and standard deviation gastric content values (volume and pH) were available in either published or unpublished format for 16 trials (details in Tables 06 to 09). Meakin 1985 reported the mean and standard deviation values for the gastric volume measure only. Senayli 2007 reported the mean and standard deviation values for pH measures only. Mean and range values were reported for both volume and pH measures (Sandhar 1989; <LINK REF="STD-Welborn-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Welborn 1993</LINK>) or for volume alone (<LINK REF="STD-Aun-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Aun 1990</LINK>) while Meakin 1985 reported gastric pH using median and range values and van der Walt 1986 only reported range values for both gastric volume and pH.

<P>We addressed four main elements of a preoperative fast within this review, namely:<BR/>(A) the duration of fast;<BR/>(B) the type of permitted intake;<BR/>(C) the volume of intake permitted during a fasting period and<BR/>(D) patient risk of aspiration/regurgitation during anaesthesia as perceived by the peri-operative team.<BR/>The evidence in relation to these four elements of preoperative fasting was evaluated within this review with reference to the primary outcome measures of aspiration/regurgitation, and gastric content values (volume, pH, marker dye concentration). The evidence regarding the secondary outcome measures of thirst, hunger, pain, nausea, vomiting and anxiety was also considered and details are presented in <LINK REF="TBL-12" TYPE="TABLE">Table 12</LINK> to <LINK REF="TBL-39" TYPE="TABLE">Table 39</LINK> with reference made within the text to the relevant tables as appropriate. For a key to these tables refer to <LINK REF="TBL-09" TYPE="TABLE">Table 9</LINK>.</P>
<P>There is a substantial body of evidence in relation to preoperative fasting for children and the evidence presented within this review is extensive. The presentation of the results is organised by the four parameters of a preoperative fast (as listed above) and within each of the parameters by outcome measure, which includes (01) adverse events (02) gastric volume, (03) gastric pH (04) marker dye and (05) secondary outcomes (as listed above). Whenever possible labels for each section correspond with the relevant meta-analysis graph. The incidence of aspiration/regurgitation (and any associated morbidity/mortality), one of the primary outcomes of this review, was not consistently addressed by the included trials. Whenever possible these details were directly sought from the authors. Available results have been presented in <LINK REF="TBL-12" TYPE="TABLE">Table 12</LINK>, <LINK REF="TBL-23" TYPE="TABLE">Table 23</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-30" TYPE="TABLE">Table 30</LINK>.</P>

Thus, for these trials above, two or more comparisons were made within each trial. For the purposes of this review a distinction was made between these comparisons by using the suffix a, b, c etc to the trial name as appropriate (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1990a" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1990a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1990b" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1990b</LINK>).

<P>Following the adult preoperative fasting review (<LINK REF="REF-Brady-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brady 2003</LINK>) there was a clear indication that comparisons that included a H<SUB>2</SUB> receptor antagonist co-intervention should be presented separately.

<P>Trials that compared two different fasting regimens on the basis of the duration of the preoperative nil-by-mouth fast are presented in this section. Standard fasting regimens were compared to a short fluid fast and a short solid fast, while shortened fluid fasts were compared to a short solid fast or other short fluid fasts. Children within these trials were all considered to be at normal risk of regurgitation/aspiration during anaesthesia, undergoing elective surgery and generally ASA I-II. The evidence in relation to each comparison is presented by outcome used to measure the effectiveness of the fasting regimens; (01) aspiration/regurgitation, (02) the volume of gastric contents, (03) the pH of gastric contents, (04) measures of gastric volume and emptying using marker dye and the secondary outcomes.

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcome 01: Aspiration/Regurgitation</HEADING>
<P>Twelve trials reported the incidence of adverse events including regurgitation and aspiration, though an additional eight authors provided unpublished data on this outcome. Of the 20 trials that specifically commented on the occurrence of aspiration/regurgitation, only <LINK REF="STD-Goresky-1992a" TYPE="STUDY">Goresky 1992a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Goresky-1992b" TYPE="STUDY">Goresky 1992b</LINK> reported any events of note. Only one incidence of aspiration/regurgitation was observed and occurred within the group that were permitted fluids up to 120 minutes preoperatively. The authors felt this incidence was related to airway management rather than as a result of the study intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Goresky-1992a" TYPE="STUDY">Goresky 1992a</LINK>). The additional eight events reported included a possible vaso-vagal response (flushing and sweating post intervention) and children that vomited or spat out the intervention fluid. These latter events occurred across the two trials <LINK REF="STD-Goresky-1992a" TYPE="STUDY">Goresky 1992a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Goresky-1992b" TYPE="STUDY">Goresky 1992b</LINK> but it is unclear to which groups the children belonged.

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcome 02: Gastric Contents - Volume</HEADING>
<P>Twenty-four trials measured intra-operative gastric volume for a standard preoperative fast versus a fast that permitted some fluid intake. The trials within this section are grouped based on the timing of the experimental intake; fluids permitted up to 120 minutes, 150 minutes, 180 minutes and 240 minutes preoperatively. The results were pooled within the meta-analysis using a random effects model and can be referred to in <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK> Duration - Shortened Fluid Fast versus Standard Fast; Outcome 02 Gastric Contents - Volume (ml/kg).</P>
<P>(i) Fluids (up to 120 minutes preoperatively) versus Standard Fast<BR/>Eight trials compared the intake of fluids up to 120 minutes preoperatively (n = 248) with a standard fasting regimen (n = 261). Pseudo-values were required for two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Sandhar-1989a" TYPE="STUDY">Sandhar 1989a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Welborn-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Welborn 1993</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Goresky-1992a" TYPE="STUDY">Goresky 1992a</LINK> also compared the intake of fluids up to 120 minutes preoperatively with a group that followed a traditional fast. The gastric volume data were reported as one cross-group summary mean (0.42ml/kg) and standard deviation value (0.04). As a result these data could not be included within this (or any other relevant) meta-analysis. On pooling the available data there was no evidence of a difference for gastric volume ( mean difference (MD) 0.03 ml/kg confidence interval (CI) 95% -0.03 to 0.10).</P>
<P>(ii) Fluids (up to 120 minutes preoperatively) versus Standard Fast (+ H<SUB>2</SUB> Receptor Antagonist)<BR/>Two trials that compared the intake of fluid up to 120 minutes preoperatively (n = 18) to a standard fasting regimen (n = 15) also administered ranitidine, a H<SUB>2</SUB> receptor antagonist, to all the children (<LINK REF="STD-Goresky-1992b" TYPE="STUDY">Goresky 1992b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sandhar-1989b" TYPE="STUDY">Sandhar 1989b</LINK>). Psuedo-standard deviation values were calculated for the <LINK REF="STD-Sandhar-1989b" TYPE="STUDY">Sandhar 1989b</LINK> trial to allow inclusion of the trial within the meta-analysis. There was no evidence of a difference between the intra-operative gastric volume of these groups that fasted and those that were permitted fluids (MD 0.01ml/kg 95% CI -0.12 to 0.14). Separate summary data for the groups in the <LINK REF="STD-Goresky-1992b" TYPE="STUDY">Goresky 1992b</LINK> trial were not available and so the data could not be pooled.</P>
<P>(iii) Fluids (up to 150 minutes preoperatively) versus Standard Fast<BR/>The intra-operative gastric volume of 102 children permitted fluids up to 150 minutes preoperatively was compared to the gastric volume of 71 children that followed a standard fast across three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1990a" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1990a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1990b" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1990b</LINK>). There was no evidence of a difference between the groups' gastric content volume (MD 0.07 ml/kg 95% CI -0.25 to 0.39).</P>
<P>(iv) Fluids (up to 180 minutes preoperatively) versus Standard Fast<BR/>Eight trials asked children to take fluids up to 180 minutes preoperatively while a second group of children continued to fast in the standard manner (<LINK REF="STD-Gombar-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gombar 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moyao_x002d_Garc_x00ed_a-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Moyao-García 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Splinter-Schaefer-2" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter Schaefer 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-der-Walt-1986a" TYPE="STUDY">van der Walt 1986a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-der-Walt-1986b" TYPE="STUDY">van der Walt 1986b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-der-Walt-1986c" TYPE="STUDY">van der Walt 1986c</LINK>). Three of the comparisons did not provide mean and standard deviation summary data and so pseudo-values were calculated to permit inclusion of these trials within the meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-van-der-Walt-1986a" TYPE="STUDY">van der Walt 1986a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-der-Walt-1986b" TYPE="STUDY">van der Walt 1986b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-der-Walt-1986c" TYPE="STUDY">van der Walt 1986c</LINK>). On pooling the data the children permitted fluids up to 180 minutes prior to surgery (n = 287) had a significantly lower volume of gastric contents than those children that fasted in the standard manner (n = 243) (MD -0.12 ml/kg 95% CI -0.22 to -0.03) p = 0.01.</P>
<P>(v) Fluids (up to 240 minutes preoperatively) versus Standard Fast<BR/>Sixty children were randomised to drink fluids up to 240 minutes preoperatively while 65 others followed a traditional fasting policy across three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Aun-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Aun 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maekawa-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Maekawa 1993b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meakin-1985e" TYPE="STUDY">Meakin 1985e</LINK>). Pseudo-standard deviation values were calculated for <LINK REF="STD-Aun-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Aun 1990</LINK>.

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcome 03: Gastric Contents - pH</HEADING>
<P>Twenty-three trials compared the intra-operative gastric pH of children after a shortened fluid fast compared with a standard fast. This represents all but one of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Aun-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Aun 1990</LINK>) that measured gastric content volume (as detailed above). In many trials individual children's gastric pH could not be measured as a gastric sample could not always be collected and so the numbers of children included in this comparison differs from the numbers of children observed in the gastric volume comparison above. A total of 695 children were permitted a shorter fluid fast while 632 continued a standard preoperative fast. The results of this comparison are presented in <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK> Duration - Short Fluid Fast versus Standard Fast; Outcome 03 Gastric Contents - pH. As with the gastric volume outcome measure presented above, the trials are grouped based on the timing of intake (up to 120 minutes, 150 minutes, 180 minutes and 240 minutes preoperatively). The trial results were pooled using a random effects model.</P>
<P>(i) Fluids (up to 120 minutes preoperatively) versus Standard Fast<BR/>Eight trials compared the intake of fluids up to 120 minutes preoperatively (n = 246) and a standard fasting regimen (n = 238) (<LINK REF="STD-Goresky-1992a" TYPE="STUDY">Goresky 1992a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maekawa-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Maekawa 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meakin-1985a" TYPE="STUDY">Meakin 1985a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nicolson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Nicolson 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sandhar-1989a" TYPE="STUDY">Sandhar 1989a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sarti-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Sarti 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schreiner-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Schreiner 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Welborn-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Welborn 1993</LINK>).

On pooling the data there was no evidence of a difference in gastric pH (MD 0.04, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.09) and the narrow confidence intervals indicate that an important difference between the groups is highly unlikely.</P>
<P>(ii) Fluids (up to 120 minutes preoperatively) versus Standard Fast (+ H<SUB>2</SUB> Receptor Antagonist)<BR/>Two additional trials permitted some children fluids up to 120 minutes preoperatively (n = 68) and compared their gastric pH with that of children that continued a standard fasting regimen (n = 61) (<LINK REF="STD-Goresky-1992b" TYPE="STUDY">Goresky 1992b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sandhar-1989b" TYPE="STUDY">Sandhar 1989b</LINK>). The children in these trials were all also administered ranitidine (an H<SUB>2</SUB> receptor antagonist). Pseudo-values were calculated for the <LINK REF="STD-Sandhar-1989b" TYPE="STUDY">Sandhar 1989b</LINK> trial and on pooling the data there was no statistically significant difference in gastric pH (MD 0.53, 95% CI -0.20 to 1.26) though this comparison is underpowered with only 129 children.</P>
<P>(iii) Fluids (up to 150 minutes preoperatively) versus Standard Fast<BR/>Children permitted fluids up to 150 minutes preoperatively (n = 102) were compared with those who remained fasting (n = 71) in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1990a" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1990a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1990b" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1990b</LINK>).

<P>(iv) Fluids (up to 180 minutes preoperatively) versus Standard Fast<BR/>Eight trials compared fluid intake up to 180 minutes preoperatively (n = 242) to a standard fast (n = 223) by evaluating children's intra-operative gastric pH (<LINK REF="STD-Gombar-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gombar 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moyao_x002d_Garc_x00ed_a-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Moyao-García 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Splinter-Schaefer-2" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter Schaefer 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-der-Walt-1986a" TYPE="STUDY">van der Walt 1986a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-der-Walt-1986b" TYPE="STUDY">van der Walt 1986b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-der-Walt-1986c" TYPE="STUDY">van der Walt 1986c</LINK>).

After pooling the data, there was no evidence of a difference in gastric pH (MD 0.32, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.78) though the high degree of heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 88%) should be noted.</P>

Although <LINK REF="STD-Aun-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Aun 1990</LINK> also compared the intake of fluids up to 240 minutes preoperatively to a standard fast they did not report separate gastric content pH summary data for the two groups. Instead, they reported that all children in the study had a gastric pH of &lt; 2.5. Pseudo-standard deviation values were required for <LINK REF="STD-Meakin-1985e" TYPE="STUDY">Meakin 1985e</LINK> and on pooling these results with those from <LINK REF="STD-Maekawa-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Maekawa 1993b</LINK>, there was no indication of a difference in intra-operative gastric pH (MD -0.02, 95% CI -0.23 to 0.18).

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcome 04: Gastric Contents - Marker Dyes</HEADING>
<P>Phenol red<BR/>Three trials used phenolsulfonphthalein (also known as PSP or phenol red) as a marker dye to measure gastric volume.<BR/>(i) Fluids (up to 120 minutes preoperatively) versus Standard Fast<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Sandhar-1989a" TYPE="STUDY">Sandhar 1989a</LINK> used the marker dye to compare gastric volume after the intake of fluids up to 120 minutes preoperatively (n = 13) and with a standard fast (n = 19). One child who fasted for an hour after the intervention was found to have a 33% percent of dye retrieval. Dye retrieval for the remaining children was less than five percent and for many children no dye was found. No additional details were available.</P>
<P>(ii) Fluids (up to 120 minutes preoperatively) versus Standard Fast (+ H<SUB>2</SUB> receptor antagonist)<BR/>A second study compared the intake of fluids up to 120 minutes preoperatively (n = 15) with the standard fast (n = 18) but included a ranitidine co-intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Sandhar-1989b" TYPE="STUDY">Sandhar 1989b</LINK>). Dye retrieval was 12% for one child that fasted for one hour following a juice and ranitidine intervention while the remaining children had a dye retrieval of less than five percent.</P>
<P>(iii) Fluids (up to 180 minutes preoperatively) versus Standard Fast<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Miller-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1990</LINK> used phenol red to calculate the volume of intra-operative gastric contents (expressed in ml).

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Secondary Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Thirteen of the total 24 comparisons presented within this review compared a shortened fluid fast to a standard fast by evaluating children's thirst, hunger, behaviour, comfort and vomiting. No trial addressed nausea. Additional information on the methods of measurement and the nature of the comparisons made is presented in <LINK REF="TBL-12" TYPE="TABLE">Table 12</LINK> Duration of Fast - Secondary Outcome Measures.

<P>Six trials comparing a shortened fluid fast to a standard preoperative fasting regimen considered children's thirst. In all cases visual analogue scales were completed immediately preoperatively (time point f or g) (see <LINK REF="TBL-09" TYPE="TABLE">Table 9</LINK> for key). The children (<LINK REF="STD-Gombar-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gombar 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1990a" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1990a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1990b" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1990b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1991</LINK>) or their parents (<LINK REF="STD-Nicolson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Nicolson 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1989</LINK>) were asked to describe their perceptions of thirst by completing the VAS scale. Details of the tools used and the timing of measures are presented in <LINK REF="TBL-13" TYPE="TABLE">Table 13</LINK> - Shortened Fluid Fast versus Standard Fast - Thirst. Where differences were noted, the children (or the parents of children) who took fluids up to 150 minutes and 180 minutes preoperatively described less preoperative thirst than those that followed a standard fasting regimen. One trial reported no difference in reported thirst between the children given apple juice 150 minutes preoperatively and those that continued fasting preoperatively (<LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1990b" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1990b</LINK>).</P>
<UL>
<LI>Hunger</LI>
</UL>
<P>Five trials compared a shortened fluid fasting regimen with a standard fasting regimen by measuring patients' hunger. A visual analogue scale was used to rate preoperative hunger by either a parent (<LINK REF="STD-Nicolson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Nicolson 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1989</LINK>) or by the children themselves (<LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1990a" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1990a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1990b" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1990b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1991</LINK>). Details can be referred to in <LINK REF="TBL-14" TYPE="TABLE">Table 14</LINK> Shortened Fluid Fast versus Standard Fast - Hunger.

See <LINK REF="TBL-16" TYPE="TABLE">Table 16</LINK> Shortened Fluid Fast versus Standard Fast - Comfort. <LINK REF="STD-Schreiner-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Schreiner 1990</LINK> also asked parents of children who had a prior experience of surgery and who were randomised to receive fluids preoperatively in their trial to consider whether their child's preoperative experience was improved in comparison to prior experiences. For 14 of the 18 children, their parents considered the preoperative experience that included fluid intake up to 120 minutes before surgery better than previous preoperative episodes while the remaining four parents had no opinion.</P>

<P>(i) Solids and Fluids up to 120 minutes preoperatively versus Standard Fast<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Meakin-1985b" TYPE="STUDY">Meakin 1985b</LINK> used a quasi-randomised approach (randomisation by operation list) to allocate children to either a standard fast (n = 20) or to a fasting regimen that permitted the intake of two plain biscuits and a drink of orange squash [10 ml/kg max 200 ml] up to two hours preoperatively (n = 32). Pseudo-standard deviation values were calculated and included within <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK> Duration - Short Solid Fast and Fluids versus Standard Fast, 01 Gastric Contents - Volume. The children permitted solids and fluids up to 120 minutes preoperatively had a significantly higher mean volume of intra-operative gastric contents than those children that fasted in the usual manner (MD 0.25 ml/kg 95% CI 0.07 to 0.43) (p = 0.006).</P>
<P>It is also of note that particles of the solid food intervention were observed in the gastric aspirate of 13 children permitted solid and fluid intake while no particles were observed in the aspirate of the fasted group (see <LINK REF="TBL-10" TYPE="TABLE">Table 10</LINK>). This significant result however is based on a small number of children in a single quasi-randomised trial.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Secondary Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Reports of thirst, hunger, behaviour, comfort and vomiting were noted by fourteen trials that compared the intake of a variety of fluids with a standard fast. No trial measured nausea.

These results are presented below.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Thirst</LI>
</UL>
<P>Thirst was measured in six different trials that compared the intake of a preoperative fluid to a standard fast. All trials used a VAS (<LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1989</LINK> used two) and measures were taken either pre-induction (time point f) or after the child had left for surgery (time point g - see <LINK REF="TBL-09" TYPE="TABLE">Table 9</LINK>). The children permitted water or clear fluids preoperatively described significantly less thirst than those who fasted (<LINK REF="STD-Gombar-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gombar 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nicolson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Nicolson 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1991</LINK>). Similarly, the trials that evaluated pre operative apple juice found the children (or parents of children) permitted apple juice recorded significantly less thirst on the VAS than the children who fasted (<LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1990a" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1990a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1989</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1989</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1990b" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1990b</LINK> found no difference between the children's description of thirst. Details can be seen in <LINK REF="TBL-24" TYPE="TABLE">Table 24</LINK> Type of Fluid versus Standard Fast - Thirst.</P>
<P>This indicates an interesting difference between the trials that evaluated the administration of apple juice preoperatively (<LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1990a" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1990a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1990b" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1990b</LINK>). All three recruited children aged 5-10 years and randomly allocated them to receive apple juice up to 150 minutes preoperatively or to the standard fasting regimen. The only obvious difference between these trials relates to the volume of intake permitted which varied from 3ml/kg (<LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1989</LINK>), 6ml/kg (<LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1990a" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1990a</LINK>) and 10ml/kg (<LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1990b" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1990b</LINK>). The issue of volume of intake will be dealt with in more detail below.</P>

All respondents used VAS to measure children (or parent's) ratings of preoperative hunger with measures taken pre-induction or after the child had left for surgery. Parental reports indicated that the children permitted clear fluids or apple juice were less hungry than those that continued to fast (<LINK REF="STD-Nicolson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Nicolson 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1989</LINK>). Based on children's report, only one of the trials that permitted preoperative apple juice described less hunger than those that fasted (<LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1989</LINK>). In the remaining trials that administered either preoperative clear fluids (<LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1991</LINK>) or apple juice (<LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1990a" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1990a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1990b" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1990b</LINK>) while the control group fasted, there was no difference between the children's descriptions of hunger.

<UL>
<LI>Behaviour</LI>
</UL>
<P>Behaviour was measured by five trials that compared the preoperative intake of water, clear fluids and apple juice to a standard fasting regimen. In all cases except one, parents rated their children's behaviour in terms of irritability on a VAS immediately prior to surgery or after the child had left for surgery. In the other case, an anaesthetist rated the child's behaviour on a VAS immediately prior to surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Castillo_x002d_Zamora-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Castillo-Zamora 2005</LINK>). In four of the five trials children permitted water (<LINK REF="STD-Gombar-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gombar 1997</LINK>), clear fluids (<LINK REF="STD-Schreiner-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Schreiner 1990</LINK>) and apple juice (<LINK REF="STD-Castillo_x002d_Zamora-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Castillo-Zamora 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1990a" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1990a</LINK>) were rated by their parents or the anaesthetist as less irritable when compared to the ratings made by the parents or the anaesthetist of children who fasted. <LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1990b" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1990b</LINK> however, found no difference in the parents' report of the behaviour amongst children permitted apple juice preoperatively and those that fasted.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">C. Volume of permitted intake</HEADING>
<P>While very small volumes of fluids are usually permitted during the preoperative period (for example up to 30 ml to allow the intake of medication) many clinicians question whether higher volumes of fluids could be permitted during this period. A total of 25 trials are presented in this section in relation to the volume of intake permitted during a period of restricted intake. Comparisons were either made between several different volumes of intake and a standard fasting regimen, or between two different volumes of intake. For analysis purposes the various volumes permitted preoperatively were categorised into three types of intake; low volume (less than or equal to 5 ml/kg), high volume (more than 5 ml/kg) and unlimited volumes (where no restriction was placed on the volume of children's preoperative fluid intake). As outlined at the protocol stage, two subgroup analyses were conducted to examine Comparison 07 Volume of Intake versus Standard Fast and Comparison 08 Volume 1 versus Volume 2. For each analysis the outcome measures (01) aspiration/regurgitation, (02) volume of gastric contents, (03) pH of gastric contents, (04) marker dye measures and secondary outcomes were considered.</P>

In both cases the parents of children permitted a drink described their children as more comfortable than did the parents of children who continued to fast preoperatively. <LINK REF="STD-Schreiner-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Schreiner 1990</LINK> also asked 18 parents how the experimental fasting regimen had been experienced by the children compared with previous experiences. Most parents (14/18) said the unlimited intake of clear fluids preoperatively had improved the preoperative experience for their children. Four parents had no opinion.

</UL>
<P>The incidence of vomiting during the preoperative period was available in relation to six trials as either published or unpublished information. Trials compared groups of children who followed either a standard fast or were permitted a low (<LINK REF="STD-Goresky-1992a" TYPE="STUDY">Goresky 1992a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goresky-1992b" TYPE="STUDY">Goresky 1992b</LINK>), high (<LINK REF="STD-Aun-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Aun 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maekawa-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Maekawa 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maekawa-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Maekawa 1993b</LINK>) or unlimited volumes (<LINK REF="STD-Schreiner-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Schreiner 1990</LINK>) of preoperative fluids. No between group differences were observed in four of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Aun-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Aun 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maekawa-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Maekawa 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maekawa-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Maekawa 1993b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schreiner-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Schreiner 1990</LINK>).

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-07-02 14:00:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this review we aimed to systematically identify, appraise and synthesise the reliable evidence from valid research in relation to preoperative fasting for children. We appraised this evidence in relation to children's safety and comfort, directly or indirectly, using a variety of outcome measures. The complexity of the preoperative fasting intervention was addressed by looking at the evidence relating to the three main parameters of a fasting regimen i.e. the duration of fast and the type and volume of intake permitted during a period of restricted intake. We also searched for evidence in relation to specific 'high-risk' patient groups. These complexities were not unexpected and had already been addressed by the related adult based review (<LINK REF="REF-Brady-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brady 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>We encountered some additional complexities, including the need to consider specific age groups (e.g. neonates, infants, children). Many trials were based on children whose ages spanned these subgroup bandings and while the resulting evidence was of relevance it was not specific to these groups. This was surprising given the great clinical awareness of the different physiological and psychological needs of these subgroups of children.</P>
<P>We identified a need to define a 'traditional' or 'standard' fasting regimen. The traditional approach to the care of children preoperatively often indicated a more lenient approach to fasting (which also accounted for the age of the child) than the 'nil-by-mouth-from-midnight' fast observed in adult practice. As a result, the review classified a 'typical' traditional standard fast of NPO for 4 hours for infants 1 to 12 months, 6 hours for children 12 months to 5 years and 8 hours for children over the age of 5 years.</P>
<P>The data in relation to the primary outcome measure of aspiration and regurgitation (and associated morbidity) was sparse. Of 1401 children in the trials that reported this primary outcome only one incident of aspiration and regurgitation was reported and this (according to the trialists) appeared to have been related to airway management rather than as a result of the intervention. Given the rarity of the incidence of regurgitation and aspiration we must be cautious in making any firm judgements based on this evidence. While some trialists reported on the incidence of aspiration and regurgitation as an outcome (or made this information available to the authors), most relied on surrogate measures of risk - children's gastric volume and pH during surgery. Most surrogate outcome measures are known to be poorly validated (for example <LINK REF="REF-DeMets-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeMets 2002</LINK>), and the validity of the link between regurgitation, aspiration, associated morbidity and mortality and the surrogate measures of gastric volume and pH is no exception. Thus we can only make some tentative extrapolations about the risk of aspiration on the basis of the evidence from these surrogate outcomes. We can however be more confident about the effect of the various fasting regimens on children's gastric pH and volume.</P>
<P>To permit inclusion within the review of trials that did not report (and the data were unavailable) mean and SD data, we calculated pseudo-means and pseudo-standard deviations (<LINK REF="REF-Arnold-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arnold 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Rourke-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Rourke 2002</LINK>) . The use of actual means and SDs would, of course, be preferential and we would encourage researchers and editors to report (or make available) such data for meta-analysis purposes - in addition to the median and ranges that better describe the study population characteristics. In fact, it would be preferable to report at least the mean, SD, median, minimum, maximum, 25th and 75th percentile for each group reported on and ideal to list the sorted outcome values for each group or the mean and SD and every nth outcome value as space permits.</P>
<P>After collecting and presenting the evidence in relation to the intake of fluids during a period of restricted intake there is no evidence to indicate that children permitted fluids up to 120 minutes preoperatively experience higher gastric volumes or lower gastric pH values than those children who fasted. Interestingly, the confidence intervals observed also suggest there is little possibility that a clinically important difference exists in relation to the children's gastric pH and volume. We found similar results in our review based on adults (<LINK REF="REF-Brady-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brady 2003</LINK>). Children permitted fluids up to 180 minutes preoperatively actually had a lower mean gastric volume (MD 0.12 ml/kg) than those who had experienced a prolonged fast, though this difference is not considered to be clinically significant. Where differences were noted, the children permitted fluids were also noted to be less thirsty and hungry and better behaved and more comfortable than the children who fasted. These findings are supported by the trials that made a direct comparison between the intake of fluids at two different time points. When compared with children permitted fluids at 150, 180 and 240 minutes preoperatively there was no difference in the groups' gastric volume or pH nor in their descriptions of hunger, behaviour or vomiting.</P>
<P>The outcome measures thirst, hunger and comfort were problematic. Not only are such outcomes based on subjective ratings transferred to a VAS, but the ratings for some children were made by proxy, with parents reporting on their child's thirst, hunger or other aspects of their child's preoperative experience. In addition, the difficulties of attempting to blind the raters as to whether they (or their child) were given something to drink or eat have already been mentioned. In some cases very young children (less than 5 years) were unable to complete a VAS and so their reports of the experience were not included within the results.</P>
<P>The evidence in relation to the intake of solid food was less definitive with only a handful of small pioneering trials conducted that employed alternation (now known to be inadequate) methods of randomisation. The type of solid intake varied between plain biscuits (Meakin 1985) and rice porridge (<LINK REF="STD-Kushikata-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kushikata 1996</LINK>), as did the timing of the solid intake which ranged from up to 120 and 330 minutes preoperatively. No aspiration or regurgitation was reported, although there was some indication (<LINK REF="STD-Meakin-1985b" TYPE="STUDY">Meakin 1985b</LINK>) that the children permitted biscuits and a drink 120 minutes preoperatively had a higher mean gastric volume than the fasted group (MD 0.25 ml/kg). Particles of ingested food were observed in the gastric aspirate of a quarter of children. At present, the available evidence does not support a shift in practice from the current established guidelines which permit children solid food up to 6 (or 8 hours) preoperatively until additional evidence can be reviewed. Additional large, high quality studies are required to extend the evidence in this area.</P>
<P>We also evaluated the available evidence relating to the type of fluid intake within the review. The range of fluids included water, clear fluid, dextrose solution (all of which could be classed as clear fluids) milk and other fluids (for example orange squash). The trials that investigated the preoperative intake of clear fluids demonstrated narrow confidence intervals and thus provide little support for the existence of a clinically important difference between the gastric volume or pH of children permitted clear fluids and those that fasted. Where there was a difference between the groups, the children given a drink were less thirsty and hungry, better behaved and more comfortable than the children who fasted. This finding again supports the finding of the adult review (<LINK REF="REF-Brady-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brady 2003</LINK>) and current preoperative fasting recommendations that indicate clear fluids can be permitted up to two hours preoperatively. As for most of the comparisons in this review, however, the trials were based on fewer than 100 children and additional evidence from larger studies would be welcome.</P>
<P>Other fluids administered preoperatively included orange juice, apple juice and orange squash. Some fruit juice interventions also included an H<SUB>2</SUB>-receptor antagonist co-intervention, so evaluations of the type of fluid intake within the review were often the result of a single trial conducted on a small number of children. Where direct comparisons of two different types of intervention were possible, some significant between group differences were noted and indicate further avenues for targeting through more rigorous investigations. For example, one small trial suggests that children who drank dextrose or Polyjoule had a lower volume of gastric contents than children that were given cows' milk. Conversely, the children who drank dextrose had more acidic gastric contents that those that drank cows' milk. Additional investigation of these issues is warranted.</P>
<P>The evidence in relation to the preoperative intake of milk was surprisingly lacking given the prominence this substance has amongst the young children for nutritional intake. Only van der Walt 1989 (cows' milk) and <LINK REF="STD-Cook_x002d_Sather-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cook-Sather 2003</LINK> (formula milk) addressed the intake of milk in their investigations. There is insufficient evidence on the basis of these two small trials to guide clinical practice though some additional non-randomised studies can also be referred to (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Litman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Litman 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sethi-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sethi 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-der-Walt-1990" TYPE="STUDY">van der Walt 1990</LINK>). For clinical purposes, guidance in relation to the intake of milk by children during the preoperative period should be sought from the available professional guidelines (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-ASA-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">ASA 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-RCN-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCN 2005</LINK>). This is a complex issue and will require detailed study given the variety of milk types available to children but this should not dissuade researchers from addressing the need for high quality evidence in this area.</P>
<P>The volume of the fluid intake permitted preoperatively did not did not appear to have an impact on children's gastric volume or pH when compared with a standard fast. The majority of trials permitted children to drink what was classified for the purposes of this review as a high volume [over 5 ml/kg] while others permitted children an unlimited volume of fluid intake. There were some reports of children refusing to drink the intervention or declining to drink the prescribed volume in full (for example <LINK REF="STD-Sandhar-1989a" TYPE="STUDY">Sandhar 1989a</LINK>). Across the trials that addressed the low, high and unlimited intake of fluid there was no significant difference in relation to the intra-operative gastric volume or pH contents from those who drank and those who fasted. Narrow confidence intervals amongst the trials that addressed the intake of unlimited fluids were noted in relation to gastric volume and pH supporting the assertion it is unlikely that a clinically important difference exists. The one small, high quality trial that directly compared two different volumes of intake (6 ml/kg and 10 ml/kg of apple juice) did not find a significant difference in volume of gastric contents or on any of the secondary outcome measures. The results of the parallel review based on adults (<LINK REF="REF-Brady-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brady 2003</LINK>) also suggested the volume of intake was unlikely to be of significance. Current national clinical guidelines have taken a pragmatic approach and omit mention of specific volumes in relation to preoperative fluid intake (<LINK REF="REF-AAGBI-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAGBI 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ASA-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">ASA 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NHSQIS-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHSQIS 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>As noted in the Methodological Quality section most trials within this review employed some of the procedures that minimise the possibility of bias. For example detailed listing of inclusion and exclusion criteria and using appropriate methods to generating the randomisation sequence in a non-biased manner. However, as has been previously discussed (<LINK REF="REF-Brady-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brady 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-S_x00f8_reide-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Søreide 1995</LINK>) additional steps towards methodological quality could have been taken in many preoperative fasting trials by ensuring concealment of the children's allocation to the control and intervention groups. Awareness of the importance allocation concealment in preventing bias in a randomised trial is a relatively new development (<LINK REF="REF-Schultz-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schultz 2001</LINK>) and so it is not surprising that only some of the more recently conducted trials adequately utilised this precaution. This is something that future research in this area should strive to incorporate within the study design.</P>
<P>This review failed to identify any RCT that specifically recruited children considered to be at an increased risk of regurgitation and aspiration. In most cases children were recruited from a very specific surgical population group i.e. healthy, ASA I-II children undergoing elective surgery. The findings are therefore applicable only to those patient populations and do not extend to many groups considered to be at high risk of regurgitation/aspiration, for example obese children or emergency cases. The global rising epidemic of obesity amongst children has been widely acknowledged (<LINK REF="REF-Lobstein-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lobstein 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>) together with the realisation of the concomitant problems this group of children will experience (for example diabetes, hypertension). In England obesity has tripled in the last twenty years and if childhood obesity continues unchecked by 2020 half of all children will be obese (<LINK REF="REF-Health-Select-Committee-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Health Select Committee 2004</LINK>). There is an urgent need to establish high quality evidence that relates specifically to the preoperative intake and fasting needs of this group. The only relevant evidence available at the moment is based on a single high quality trial within which obese adults permitted 300 ml of clear fluids two hours preoperatively had a statistically and clinically significant higher mean gastric volume than the group that fasted from midnight (<LINK REF="REF-Maltby-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maltby 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Only one trial included within the review recruited children who were classified as ASA III-IV undergoing cardiac surgical procedures. This ASA rating refers to children who have a severe systemic disease that is (at ASA IV) a constant threat to life. Only two children within this trial were classified as ASA IV. As the ASA classification system is an indicator of surgical risk and not as an indicator for risk of regurgitation and aspiration, a decision was made to include this trial within the main body of the review. The results of this high quality trial (n = 91) taken in isolation found no difference between the children permitted intake of unlimited clear fluids up to 120 minutes preoperatively and the control group that were permitted clear fluids. The children who followed the less conservative fast were also described as less thirsty, less hungry and more comfortable than the children who fasted. Other 'high-risk' preoperative groups also require closer consideration including children undergoing urgent and emergency surgery (<LINK REF="REF-NCEPOD-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCEPOD 2002</LINK>) or those with particular preoperative nutritional needs such as those with cancer (for example <LINK REF="REF-Sala-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sala 2004</LINK>). For other groups, for example children with gastrointestinal disease or disorders, there appears to be some debate as to whether they are actually at increased risk of regurgitation and aspiration (for example <LINK REF="REF-Schwartz-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwartz 1998</LINK>).</P>

<P>Multidisciplinary teams responsible for the care of surgical patients should be aware of the evidence in relation to preoperative fasting, the relevant clinical guidelines and local fasting policies. Whenever possible such policies should be prepared with the involvement of the whole team and presented in a simple and easy-to-follow format. Compliance with preoperative fasting instructions has always been crucial, but will become increasingly important with the growth and promotion of day surgery for elective surgical procedures (<LINK REF="REF-Audit-Commission" TYPE="REFERENCE">Audit Commission</LINK>). Staff will need to ensure that children and their parents are educated on the benefits of more relaxed fasting policies than the traditional fast.</P>
<P>Following this systematic review we can conclude there is evidence that children at normal risk of regurgitation and aspiration, given unlimited clear fluids up to two hours preoperatively are not at a clinically significant risk of increased gastric volume and pH than children who follow a standard fast. Similar conclusions with regard to risk of aspiration/regurgitation can only be reached with some cautious judgement. The risks of aspiration/regurgitation were very low in this group of patients (either 1 or 0 out of 1208). Given this, the size of relative effect would be unacceptable and the possibility that it may not be picked up via the surrogate outcomes needs to be carefully considered. Children permitted a drink during the preoperative period were found to be less thirsty, less hungry, better behaved and more comfortable that those who fasted. Clinical guidelines on the fasting of children before surgery have preceded the publication of this review and urge clinicians to permit the children to drink clear fluids up to two hours preoperatively (<LINK REF="REF-ASA-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">ASA 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Committee-on-Drugs-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Committee on Drugs 1992</LINK>) as do more generalist guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-NNCG-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">NNCG 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>It should be remembered however that this evidence (and the recommendations made by available guidelines) only applies to healthy children who are not considered to be at an increased risk of aspiration/regurgitation during anaesthesia. There is a paucity of evidence in relation to high-risk groups and so clear preoperative fasting recommendations for these groups cannot be made at this time. Conducting studies with some high-risk children (such as children requiring emergency surgery) may never be ethically possible. Additional sources of evidence and opinion including observational studies and best practice statements should be sought when considering the preoperative fasting preparations for these children.</P>
<P>Preoperative carers have an obligation to ensure that their patients are fully informed (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2004</LINK>) about the preoperative fasting procedure and that this information is based on the current evidence. Not only has a recent survey demonstrated that information given to many patients in the UK falls short of this (<LINK REF="REF-Markham-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Markham 2003</LINK>) but we also know that many sites still demand that healthy patients remain nil-by-mouth-from-midnight. This practice should no longer be tolerated.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-06-26 15:59:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Well designed, methodologically sound randomised controlled trials are still required to further examine the intake of solid food and some fluid types preoperatively. The paucity of evidence in relation to the intake of milk is especially surprising given the reliance of younger children on this form of nutritional intake. Some interesting developments in clinical practice indicate possible avenues of investigation with some children reportedly permitted breast milk and formula up to two hours prior to surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Hofer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofer 2001</LINK>). Such fasting regimens are more lenient than the evidence reviewed here would support and further investigation, reporting and monitoring of this development should be a matter of priority. Researchers should ensure that the numbers of children recruited to such investigations are based on upon a priori sample size calculations and that adequate concealment of children's allocation to the trial groups should be incorporated whenever possible. Given the tendency for the gastric volume and pH data to be skewed, we would also encourage researchers to report mean and standard deviation data thus permitting accurate representation of the data within meta-analyses when required.</P>
<P>In clinical settings there is a clear awareness of the different preoperative fasting requirements for neonates, infants, children and adolescents. This distinction is not reflected within the available evidence and further investigation of these boundaries and generation of additional age-group specific evidence should be pursued. In addition, many children considered to be at 'high-risk' of regurgitation and aspiration (e.g. the growing population of obese children or those with gastrointestinal disorders) have been specifically excluded from the evidence presented here. High quality trials that specifically target and recruit children from these groups would provide much needed evidence in this area. It remains crucial that the incidence of aspiration/regurgitation continues to be reported. For the moment, the surrogate measures of risk i.e. intra-operative gastric content volume and pH should continue to be used, though reliance on the 'critical values' (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1974</LINK>) should be discouraged. The possibility of developing a clinically meaningful composite surrogate outcome measure based on the two outcomes of gastric volume and pH as a statistically more powerful indicator of risk should be explored (<LINK REF="REF-DeMets-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeMets 2002</LINK>), though it is acknowledged the development and use of such an outcome would not be without its challenges (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Cannon-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cannon 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Freemantle-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freemantle 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite the availability of research evidence, thorough reviews of the literature and widely available guideline recommendations, kick starting an evolution in fasting policies remains a difficult task. Researchers should consider how best to communicate the evidence from this review (and others) to the preoperative multidisciplinary team so that it has a positive impact on clinical practice during the preoperative period. Exploration of this issue will no doubt raise issues such as the quality of patient (and parent) preoperative education, the information communicated regarding the preoperative fasting regimen and patient compliance.</P>

<P>The Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register has been complied through searching of the major health databases including MEDLINE, CINAHL and EMBASE and is regularly updated through searching of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, handsearching of wound care journals and relevant conference proceedings.</P>
<P>We searched the above databases using the specific search strategies detailed in <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>. The search strategies were constructed using controlled vocabulary (MeSH) and free text terms following consultation with the Cochrane Wounds Group. There were no language restrictions on the searches.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Personal communication</HEADING>
<P>We attempted to contact the main authors from all studies included in the review to ask if they had been involved in any further studies or articles or whether they were aware of any recent or on going studies (published or unpublished) on the topic of preoperative fasting. They were also asked if they were aware of any other individuals prominent or active in the field that the review authors should contact.<BR/>
