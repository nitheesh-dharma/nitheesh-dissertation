<P>When children are discharged from hospital, parents' understanding of how to continue care at home is better if they receive both written and verbal information. </P>
<P>When people are discharged from hospital, they and/or their carers are given information on how to manage care effectively at home. Hospital staff usually explain what is required verbally and may also give written, or even video-taped, information. The review of hospital discharge information found only studies looking at parents caring for their children. Parents had a better understanding of the care needed when given both written and verbal instructions, rather than verbal instructions alone. Further research is needed to determine if this leads to better health outcomes and faster recovery times, and on discharge information for other hospital patients.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2008-07-08 16:03:37 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>It is becoming commonplace for patients to be discharged earlier from acute hospital settings to their own homes and be required to manage various aspects of their own care. This has increased the need for detailed information to be given to patients and/or significant others to enable them to effectively manage care at home. It has been suggested that providing written health information can assist in this self management.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the effectiveness of providing written health information in addition to verbal information for patients and/or significant others being discharged from acute hospital settings to home. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Computerised searches from 1990 to September 2005 in the Cochrane Consumers and Communication Review Group Specialised Register and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ERIC, OVID (including Ageline, EBM Reviews, DARE, Best Evidence, Pre-MEDLINE and PsycARTICLES), Sociological abstracts, Austhealth and bibliographies in articles that met inclusion criteria.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Articles were selected if they were randomised control trials or controlled clinical trials; included patients discharged from acute hospital settings to home; the patient and/or significant others received written health information and verbal information in the intervention group, and verbal information only in the control group; and the intervention (written health information and verbal information) was provided at discharge.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two review authors independently screened abstracts to determine relevance. Relevant full paper copies were then reviewed against the inclusion criteria. The findings were extracted by one author and confirmed by the other author. The two trials that met the inclusion criteria were too disparate to warrant meta-analysis. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-07-08 16:03:37 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>The participants in the two trials were parents of children who were discharged from children's hospitals, one in the United States (n = 197) the other in Canada (n = 123). Provision of verbal and written health information significantly increased knowledge and satisfaction scores.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>This review recommends the use of both verbal and written health information when communicating about care issues with patients and/or significant others on discharge from hospital to home. The combination of verbal and written health information enables the provision of standardised care information to patients and/or significant others, which appears to improve knowledge and satisfaction. Many of our objectives could not be addressed in this review due to lack of trials which met the review's inclusion criteria. There is therefore scope for future research to investigate the effects of providing verbal and written health information on readmission rates, recovery time, complication rates, costs of health care, consumers' confidence level, stress and anxiety and adherence to recommended treatment and staff training in the delivery of verbal and written information. In addition there are other factors which impact on the effectiveness of information provided that were not considered in this review but are worthy of a separate systematic review, such as the impact of patient and/or significant others being involved in the development of the written information and cultural issues around development and provision of information. Due to concerns about literacy levels for some population groups, other systematic reviews should also focus on other modes of delivery of information besides the written format.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-07-08 16:08:39 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>It is becoming commonplace for patients to be discharged from acute hospital settings to their own homes following an episode of in-patient care, a same day admission or a visit to an emergency department, and be required to manage various aspects of their own care at home or have significant others (family members or other people important to that person's care and wellbeing) provide that care. This coupled with the decreasing lengths of hospital stay in in-patient care has increased the need for more detailed information to be given to patients and/or significant others so that they can effectively manage their care at home. For example, Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development health data (<LINK REF="REF-OECD-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">OECD 2001</LINK>) shows an international trend for a decrease in the average length of stay in in-patient care since the early 1990s. The majority of in-patients are now being treated in hospital for the minimum amount of time. This is in response to pressure to contain rising health costs within hospital-based services (<LINK REF="REF-Nutbeam-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nutbeam 1991</LINK>), and advances in medical and surgical treatments. Patients who had previously remained in hospital for days are now able to leave hospital a few hours after their procedure (<LINK REF="REF-Voepel_x002d_Lewis-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Voepel-Lewis 1992</LINK>). </P>
<P>These changes in health policy have significant impact on the practices of staff, but also result in a significant shift in responsibility, knowledge, and cost to patients and/or significant others. The transfer of care after discharge from an acute hospital setting to home care by the patient and/or significant others has meant that timely and effective delivery of information about that care has to be provided by staff and delivered in a format that ensures effective transfer of information and responsibility. Health professionals now often have much shorter time periods to inform patients and/or significant others on how to perform self care following discharge from hospital (<LINK REF="REF-Leino_x002d_Kilpi-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leino-Kilpi 1993</LINK>). To have access to comprehensive written information about care and treatment after discharge from an acute hospital setting, in a format that the patient and/or family member can understand, is a basic right for all health consumers (user of the service and/or significant others) (<LINK REF="REF-SAHC-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">SAHC 1996</LINK>). There is a growing demand from consumers of hospital services to be provided with spoken, written, pictorial or recorded information that will help them participate effectively in their own 'after care' and be able to make the best health choices for themselves and family members. </P>
<P>In response to this demand there has been a growing awareness among health professionals of the need to provide information to health consumers in a format that best meets their individual needs. These formats can include verbal and written instructions, audiotapes, videotapes, follow up phone calls, e-mail communication with their doctor; and websites to access further information. These delivery formats contrast to the provision of verbal information only at the time of discharge, which is an approach that leaves knowledge and authority in the hands of health professionals. It also has the potential to disempower consumers, as they are unable to refer to information after discharge or may not remember what they have been told (<LINK REF="REF-Linke-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Linke 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>It has been suggested that providing written information to consumers about 'after care' is one important strategy which has the potential to reduce demands on health services through more appropriate use of services (<LINK REF="REF-Fries-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fries 1998</LINK>); improve confidence of consumers to manage their own care (or the care of a family member) and seek appropriate follow up care (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1999</LINK>); decrease recovery time (<LINK REF="REF-Johnston-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnston 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Devine-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Devine 1995</LINK>); improve satisfaction with services provided whilst in hospital (<LINK REF="REF-Larson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Larson 1996</LINK>); decrease stress and anxiety (<LINK REF="REF-NHMRC-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHMRC 2000</LINK>); reduce hospital readmissions (<LINK REF="REF-Fries-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fries 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mamon-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mamon 1992</LINK>) and improve adherence to hospital aftercare regimes (<LINK REF="REF-Frith-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frith 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gibbs-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibbs 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mazzuca-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mazzuca 1982</LINK>). However, there has been a degree of doubt among some health professionals regarding the benefits of providing this type of written information to consumers and whether it serves any real purpose, or is just 'a nice thing to do' (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1999</LINK>). These doubts have been amplified by recognition of the cost of providing such resources to consumers, especially in the current economic climate facing hospitals. It is acknowledged that the provision of written information to consumers after an episode of care in an acute hospital setting is one of the many factors which may, in isolation or combination, impact on health outcomes and service utilisation and satisfaction (<LINK REF="REF-Henderson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leino_x002d_Kilpi-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leino-Kilpi 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>This systematic review sought to answer some of the questions raised about the benefits of providing care information on discharge to consumers in the written format, for example pamphlet, booklet or information sheet, in combination with providing verbal instructions, as opposed to providing verbal instructions only. While there are a number of delivery formats available to provide health information, for example pictorial, recorded (video and audio), counselling, follow up telephone calls, e-mail communications and the internet, the written format in addition to verbal instruction was specifically chosen as the focus for this review because it is the most common approach used in hospital settings at discharge. The effectiveness and benefits of using these alternative information delivery formats need to also be determined through separate systematic reviews. </P>

<P>We used appropriate variations of the above search strategy were utilised to search the following electronic databases:<BR/>

</UL>
<P>Studies that were identified through the above search strategy and appeared to meet the inclusion criteria (ie. included and excluded studies) were retrieved in full and their reference lists examined to identify any additional studies that met the inclusion criteria.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>There were five stages to the review process. Throughout the review process review authors were not blinded to trials.</P>
<P>Stage 1: Two review authors (AJ, JS) screened the abstracts of articles identified from the search strategy. Any disagreement regarding relevance of the abstracts was resolved through discussion. Full paper copies of articles were obtained and examined where there was insufficient information in the abstracts.</P>
<P>Stage 2: Two review authors (AJ, JS) independently examined full paper copies of articles and determined whether they fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The articles needed to fulfil all five inclusion criteria which were:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Randomised controlled trial or clinical controlled trial</LI>
<LI>Discharged from an acute hospital setting</LI>
<LI>Discharged to home</LI>
<LI>Intervention must be written discharge care information plus verbal information only</LI>
<LI>Intervention must be provided at discharge to home only</LI>
</UL>
<P> Any disagreements regarding inclusion were resolved by discussion.</P>
<P>Stage 3: Data was extracted from relevant trials using a data collection tool independently by each review author (AJ and JS) and then data were compared. Data extracted included: study population, study methods, interventions, assessment of outcomes, results, conclusions and limitations. Authors were contacted for further information as required. Any disagreements regarding information extracted were resolved by discussion. </P>
<P>Stage 4: Assessment of validity<BR/>Allocation concealment was used to assess validity, by asking 'Was allocation concealment adequate?' <BR/>This was described as adequate (A), unclear (B), inadequate (C), or that allocation concealment was not used (D). A sensitivity study was planned to be performed to exclude trials that were in the (C) and (D) categories. This was not necessary due to the included trials fulfilling categories (A) or (B).</P>
<P>Stage 5: Analysis<BR/>The primary analysis was a comparison of written health information and verbal information versus verbal information only for each of the questions outlined in the objectives of the review. All comparisons that were made are narratively described and presented in tables. Where methodological processes differed no meta-analysis was undertaken. As a consequence no sensitivity analyses were required. </P>
<P>Consumer participation:<BR/>The overall focus for this review was initially recommended by an editor of the Cochrane Consumers and Communication Review Group, and taken up and shaped by the current review authors.</P>
<P>The focus of this review as it relates specifically to the needs of the health services and health professionals is on reducing overall costs of health care, adhering to treatment regimes, improving satisfaction with care, improving health outcomes and reducing demands on health services.</P>
<P>Consumers' perspectives have broadened the focus of this review to also address knowledge, confidence, stress and anxiety. This has been determined by:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the importance to consumers of having written information to refer to during consultation with hospital staff in preparing for discharge, and then as a reference tool after discharge;</LI>
<LI>consumers' beliefs that health information enhances knowledge and confidence in managing care at home after discharge, and reduces stress and anxiety related to being uncertain of what to do.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>The review authors' understanding of these consumer perspectives, and their commitment to integrating them into the review, came from: <BR/>1. Reports in the literature, primarily of qualitative researchers presenting consumer views;<BR/>2. Anne Johnson's qualitative research on health information and the benefits to consumers and the needs of parents of children being discharged from hospital to home;<BR/>3. Anne Johnson's discussions with health professionals and consumers whilst working at the Women's and Children's Hospital, Adelaide and the National Resource Centre for Consumer Participation in Health, Melbourne; and <BR/>4. Jayne Sandford's discussions with consumers involved as members of a Health Information Reference Group at Flinders Medical Centre, Adelaide.</P>
<P>In addition, consumers were involved as external peer reviewers during the editorial process, through the Consumers and Communication Review Group. </P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2008-07-08 16:03:37 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>Electronic searching yielded a total of 1795 citations in the first review (to 2002) and 478 in the update in week 1 September 2005. No new studies were found in the update in September 2005. From the original search 15 studies initially appeared to meet the study criteria and were retrieved for further assessment. Two review authors (AJ, JS) reviewed these trials independently. Two trials met the inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Issacman-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Issacman 1992</LINK>). Thirteen studies were excluded as they did not meet the inclusion criteria. The reasons for exclusion are listed in the Table of Excluded Studies.</P>
<P>The participants in the two trials were parents of children who were discharged from children's hospitals, one in the United States and the other in Canada. The children in the Canadian trial (<LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 1996</LINK>) were discharged from a Burns Unit with acute thermal injury. The children in the United States trial (<LINK REF="STD-Issacman-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Issacman 1992</LINK>) were discharged from an Emergency Department with otitis media. The length of hospitalisation and the acuity of illness therefore varied between the trials. The mean age of parents in the otitis media trial (<LINK REF="STD-Issacman-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Issacman 1992</LINK>) was 27 years, with the children having a mean age of 26.6 months. In the burns trial (<LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 1996</LINK>) no mean ages of parents or children were included. Children in this trial (<LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 1996</LINK>) were only identified as being less than 17 years of age.</P>
<P>The sizes of the study groups in the two trials were similar. In the otitis media trial (<LINK REF="STD-Issacman-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Issacman 1992</LINK>) there was a total of 197 parents who participated and they were provided with one of three types of instruction on discharge. The control group received non standardised verbal information only (n = 84), one intervention group received standardised verbal instruction (n = 52) and the other intervention group received standardised verbal instruction plus standardised written information (n = 61). The burns trial (<LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 1996</LINK>) had a total of 123 participants, and provided participants with two types of instruction on discharge. The control group was provided with routine verbal discharge instruction (n = 61) and the intervention group received written and verbal discharge instructions (n = 62). In both trials the written information was provided on discharge.<BR/>
<BR/>Written information was provided in a book format for the burns trial (<LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 1996</LINK>) and leaflet format for the otitis media trial (<LINK REF="STD-Issacman-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Issacman 1992</LINK>). The otitis media trial (<LINK REF="STD-Issacman-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Issacman 1992</LINK>) used the Gunning-Fog Index to ensure the readability of the information was at the fifth grade educational level or above. The burns trial (<LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 1996</LINK>) wrote the book at fifth grade school readability level using Grammatique 5 and the Fogg index to determine readability. Parents were not involved in developing the written information in either trial.</P>
<P>The follow-up evaluation times varied between the two trials from 24 hours to greater than 15 days. In the otitis media trial (<LINK REF="STD-Issacman-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Issacman 1992</LINK>) evaluation was conducted at discharge, and then by telephone for all participants on day one and day three following discharge. On completion of interviews on exit and day one the interviewer provided reinforcing information to the parents to correct any incorrect answers or provide missing information. The burns trial (<LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 1996</LINK>) conducted evaluation by personal interview (120 participants) at the first outpatient appointment, and an additional three were completed by telephone interview. In this trial (<LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 1996</LINK>) the interviews were conducted over a period between less than seven days (35.8%), 8-14 days (35%) and 15 plus days (29.2%).</P>
<P>The trials included in the review both evaluated knowledge levels and satisfaction with discharge instructions. In the burns trial (<LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 1996</LINK>) knowledge was measured using a ten item questionnaire with open ended questions. This required the respondents to provide information on selected burns care related topics. Parents received one point for each incorrect answer to questions about burn care. Two points were given for partially correct answers, and three points were given for correct responses, except for two questions where four points were given for a predefined optimal answer. Two other questions were used to ascertain satisfaction in this trial using a five-point Likert scale (one = not at all satisfied and 5 = completely satisfied). In the otitis media trial (<LINK REF="STD-Issacman-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Issacman 1992</LINK>) knowledge was measured using a seven-item questionnaire with one point being given for each correct answer. On day three parents were asked to rate the quality of their discharge instruction on a ten point scale (ten being best) and they were also asked whether they had needed to return to an emergency department or physician for care or to seek additional medical advice by telephone. Neither trial identified if or how the tools used were validated.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>Allocation concealment was used to assess validity of the trials in this review. Neither of the two trials reported any concealment approach in the published articles. However on follow-up with one of the authors (<LINK REF="STD-Issacman-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Issacman 1992</LINK>) the allocation concealment was provided and considered adequate. The other author (<LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 1996</LINK>) was also contacted but did not report concealment methods, therefore adequacy of concealment was considered unclear in this trial.</P>
<P>Knowledge was measured at discharge and then at a period between 1 and 15 days following discharge. The otitis media trial (<LINK REF="STD-Issacman-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Issacman 1992</LINK>) stated that all efforts were made to contact and interview the parent or guardian who received the discharge instruction. However, no data was collected to accurately reflect the percentage of responders who received the initial discharge instruction and who answered the follow-up questions. The burns trial (<LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 1996</LINK>) reported that 85% of the parents who received the initial discharge instruction answered the follow-up questions. This lack of consistency in collecting and reporting who received the discharge instruction and who answered the follow-up questions may have resulted in the knowledge scores being underestimated. </P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-07-08 16:03:13 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>This review is important because providing information to patients on discharge from hospital to home is part of everyday practice for the majority of health workers and is relevant to all consumers being discharged. There are a number of delivery formats available for providing information, the written format in addition to verbal information was specifically chosen as the focus for this review because it is the most common approach used in hospital settings at discharge.</P>
<P>Conclusions regarding the impact of using verbal and written health information compared to verbal information only are limited due to there only being two trials elegible for inclusion in this review and the variability of the two trials. There is some evidence to suggest that verbal and written health information when compared to verbal information only does significantly increase knowledge of parents of children with burns and otitis media being discharged from hospital to home. However, due to the lack of consistency in collecting and reporting who received the discharge instruction and who answered the follow-up questions, this may have resulted in the knowledge scores being underestimated.</P>
<P>Both trials reported high satisfaction with discharge instruction in the control and intervention groups. In the otitis media trial (<LINK REF="STD-Issacman-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Issacman 1992</LINK>) a significantly higher score was achieved in the intervention groups compared to the control groups. It is possible these high scores are due to limitations in methods as described above, or related to the general nature of the questions asked. Studies of patient satisfaction surveys (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Draper-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Draper 1996</LINK>) have found that asking these types of general questions mask patients' concerns or dissatifaction.</P>
<P>Despite these limitations, the two trials were consistent in demonstrating that verbal and written health information provided together appear to be more effective for improving knowledge and satisfaction than just providing verbal information only.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Discussion of methodological processes</HEADING>
<P>Though both of these trials were measuring knowledge and satisfaction, the incompleteness of the data provided precluded the combination of data in a meta-analysis. In addition to this the methodological processes used by each trial were different, preventing the data being combined as described below.</P>
<P>In the burns trial (<LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 1996</LINK>) one follow-up interview was conducted at the first outpatient visit which occurred between less than 7 and greater than 15 days following discharge (no mean time was provided). In the otitis media trial (<LINK REF="STD-Issacman-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Issacman 1992</LINK>) a face to face interview was conducted at exit, followed by three follow-up phone interviews on day one and day three. On completion of each interview the interviewer provided reinforcing information to the parents to correct any incorrect answers or provide missing information. Due to this reinforcing information being provided on completion of each interview, it is only possible to consider the exit interview results in any comparison. It is not appropriate to compare the results of the first interviews in the two trials due to the large time differences (up to 15 days difference).</P>
<P>The types of knowledge that were tested in the two trials were quite different and this is another reason the trials cannot be combined in a meta-analysis. This is due to the different range of information required for discharge care for the diagnoses of the children (otitis media v burns). However what is important is the improved knowledge scores that have been shown in each trial between the control and intervention groups. Both trials identified that the difference in knowledge scores shown in the intervention groups could be attributed to the standardisation of the information, consistency of information provided and formalisation of the instruction process rather than necessarily the provision of written information. This is demonstrated in the otitis media trial (<LINK REF="STD-Issacman-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Issacman 1992</LINK>) where improvements were shown in both the intervention groups in comparison to the control, but no significant difference between the two intervention groups. Hence the author of the otitis media trial is suggesting that it is the standardisation of the information that makes the difference to the knowledge scores. In this trial (<LINK REF="STD-Issacman-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Issacman 1992</LINK>) the staff delivering the information in the two intervention groups had gone through an education training program to ensure they were familiar with the clinical condition and the important points when presenting the information to parents. This suggests that the knowledge of the practitioner on the topic and the way the supporting verbal information is delivered can also be contributing factors in improving knowledge scores. However the author of the trial did not measure or discuss this.</P>
<P>In the otitis media trial (<LINK REF="STD-Issacman-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Issacman 1992</LINK>) the knowledge scores for 'worrisome signs' were considerably lower compared to the other knowledge scores for 'medication data' and 'signs of improvement'. The authors of this trial suggest the reasons for this could be the order in which information is presented and/or the relative importance given to the information by the parent or physician may contribute to the retention of information.</P>
<P>This review is narrow in its focus, being restricted to verbal and written health information compared to verbal information only at discharge from hospital to home. Despite extensive searching, it is quite possible that the review authors missed some trials that met the inclusion criteria. The literature on verbal and written health information is not well indexed because it is scattered across traditional disease boundaries. The authors invite readers to send them any studies, published or unpublished, that may meet the inclusion criteria and can be incorporated in the update.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Consumer involvement </HEADING>
<P>Although consumer involvement was not part of our review objectives there is emerging evidence to say that consumer involvement leads to the production of quality information (<LINK REF="REF-Currie-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Currie 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Coulter-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coulter 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neuhauser-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neuhauser 1998</LINK>). Both of the trials used tools to determine reading levels at the fifth grade, but did not involve consumers in the development of the written information. The use of tools to determine reading levels can be a useful measure, but does not take into consideration diverse language and cultural issues for specific groups of consumers. This was highlighted in the burns trial (<LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 1996</LINK>) were it was indicated that Native American Indians (NAIs) who received the written information had significantly lower knowledge scores than the non-NAIs. Another factor that was raised in this trial was that the culture of the health professionals providing the information and conducting the interviews may have had an impact on their knowledge and satisfaction scores, however this was not measured. This factor is important to consider in future research in this area.<BR/>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>This review recommends the use of both verbal and written health information when communicating about care issues with patients and/or significant others on discharge from hospital to home. The combination of verbal and written health information enables the provision of standardised care information to patients and/or significant others, which appears to improve knowledge and satisfaction. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Many of our objectives could not be addressed in this review due to lack of trials which met the review's inclusion criteria. There is therefore scope for future research to investigate the effects of providing verbal and written health information on readmission rates, recovery time, complication rates, costs of health care, consumers' confidence level, stress and anxiety, adherence to recommended treatment and staff training in the delivery of verbal and written information. In addition there are other factors which impact on the effectiveness of information provided that were not considered in this review but are worthy of a separate systematic review such as the impact of patient and/or significant others being involved in the development of the written information and cultural issues around development and provision of information. Due to concerns about literacy levels for some population groups, other systematic reviews should also focus on other modes of delivery of information besides the written format.</P>
