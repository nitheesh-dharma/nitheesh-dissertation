<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-11-15 10:17:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>
<B>Background: </B>Acute respiratory failure is a common condition amongst adults admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) worldwide. Although respiratory failure has many causes, it may be due to a condition known as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This term describes a condition in which both of the lungs have become injured and inflamed from one of various causes, and they do not work as they normally would to provide oxygen to and remove carbon dioxide from the body. This leads to a reduced amount of oxygen in the blood. Patients may require connection to a ventilator (breathing machine) to support their breathing. This therapy is known as mechanical ventilation. Supportive care with mechanical ventilation is an important pillar of standard treatment for patients with ARDS.</P>
<P>Although it may be life-saving, mechanical ventilation may further contribute to lung injury by expanding and collapsing the lungs or overstretching lung tissue. To minimize damage to injured lungs, smaller volumes of air at lower pressures have been used in conjunction with a positive opening pressure at the end of expiration (PEEP). This ventilation strategy has been shown to shorten the time that patients require mechanical ventilation while improving survival; it has been adopted as standard care for patients with ARDS who are in intensive care.</P>
<P>Along with this strategy, additional ventilation techniques have been developed. One such technique is known as a recruitment manoeuvre; when combined with higher PEEP, it is called the open lung ventilation strategy. A recruitment manoeuvre uses sustained deep breaths to assist in the recruitment - or re-opening - of collapsed lung units. This may increase the number of lung units available for breathing and may improve patient outcomes. Effects of recruitment manoeuvres have not been well established.</P>
<P>
<B>Search date:</B> Evidence is current to August 2016.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics:</B> We included 10 trials in this review, which included a total of 1658 participants with acute respiratory distress syndrome.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results: </B>Low-quality evidence suggests that recruitment manoeuvres improve ICU survival but not 28-day or hospital survival. Recruitment manoeuvres have no effect on the risk of air leakage from the lungs.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence:</B> We found the evidence for most outcomes to be of low to moderate quality, primarily because of the design of included trials. Many trials used the recruitment manoeuvre in conjunction with other ventilation techniques or strategies, and this might have influenced outcomes. Caution should be applied when conclusions are drawn about the effectiveness of the recruitment manoeuvre alone.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-11-15 10:17:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Recruitment manoeuvres involve transient elevations in airway pressure applied during mechanical ventilation to open (&#8216;recruit&#8217;) collapsed lung units and increase the number of alveoli participating in tidal ventilation. Recruitment manoeuvres are often used to treat patients in intensive care who have acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but the effect of this treatment on clinical outcomes has not been well established. This systematic review is an update of a Cochrane review originally published in 2009.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-08-30 07:24:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our primary objective was to determine the effects of recruitment manoeuvres on mortality in adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome.</P>
<P>Our secondary objective was to determine, in the same population, the effects of recruitment manoeuvres on oxygenation and adverse events (e.g. rate of barotrauma).</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-11-15 10:17:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>For this updated review, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (OVID), Embase (OVID), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL, EBSCO), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences (LILACS) and the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) registry from inception to August 2016.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-11-15 10:17:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of adults who were mechanically ventilated that compared recruitment manoeuvres versus standard care for patients given a diagnosis of ARDS.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-11-15 10:17:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-11-15 10:17:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Ten trials met the inclusion criteria for this review (n = 1658 participants). We found five trials to be at low risk of bias and five to be at moderate risk of bias. Six of the trials included recruitment manoeuvres as part of an open lung ventilation strategy that was different from control ventilation in aspects other than the recruitment manoeuvre (such as mode of ventilation, higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) titration and lower tidal volume or plateau pressure). Six studies reported mortality outcomes. Pooled data from five trials (1370 participants) showed a reduction in intensive care unit (ICU) mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 0.97, P = 0.02, low-quality evidence), pooled data from five trials (1450 participants) showed no difference in 28-day mortality (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.01, P = 0.06, low-quality evidence) and pooled data from four trials (1313 participants) showed no difference in in-hospital mortality (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.01, P = 0.07, low-quality evidence). Data revealed no differences in risk of barotrauma (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.53, P = 0.60, seven studies, 1508 participants, moderate-quality evidence).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-11-15 10:17:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>We identified significant clinical heterogeneity in the 10 included trials. Results are based upon the findings of several (five) trials that included an "open lung ventilation strategy", whereby the intervention group differed from the control group in aspects other than the recruitment manoeuvre (including co-interventions such as higher PEEP, different modes of ventilation and higher plateau pressure), making interpretation of the results difficult. A ventilation strategy that included recruitment manoeuvres in participants with ARDS reduced intensive care unit mortality without increasing the risk of barotrauma but had no effect on 28-day and hospital mortality. We downgraded the quality of the evidence to low, as most of the included trials provided co-interventions as part of an open lung ventilation strategy, and this might have influenced results of the outcome.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-11-15 10:17:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-11-15 10:17:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an inflammatory condition of the lung parenchyma that causes impaired gas exchange (<LINK REF="REF-ARDS-Definition-Task-Force-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">ARDS Definition Task Force 2012</LINK>). According to the Berlin definition, each stage of mild, moderate and severe ARDS are associated with increasing mortality (<LINK REF="REF-ARDS-Definition-Task-Force-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">ARDS Definition Task Force 2012</LINK>). Patients with ARDS present with bilateral lung infiltrates on chest radiograph and hypoxaemia with concomitant systemic inflammatory mediator release, frequently causing multiple organ failure and death (<LINK REF="STD-Gattinoni-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gattinoni 2006</LINK>). In a recent international, multi-centre observational study, ARDS accounted for 10.4% of all intensive care unit (ICU) beds, with a mortality rate of 34.9% for mild ARDS, 40.3% for moderate ARDS and 46.1% for severe ARDS (<LINK REF="REF-Bellani-et-al_x002c_-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bellani et al, 2016</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-11-15 10:17:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Patients with ARDS in the ICU may require mechanical ventilation to survive (<LINK REF="STD-Amato-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Amato 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ARDS-Definition-Task-Force-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">ARDS Definition Task Force 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sevransky-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sevransky 2004</LINK>). However, mechanical ventilation can injure lungs through alveolar distension, cyclical collapse and reopening of alveolar units and failure to expand collapsed alveolar units (<LINK REF="STD-Gattinoni-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gattinoni 2006</LINK>). To minimize damage to injured lungs, small ventilatory tidal volumes and low plateau pressures have been used. Additionally, higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) reduces collapse of alveoli at the end of expiration and decreases atelectrauma (<LINK REF="REF-Briel-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Briel 2010</LINK>). These techniques when combined are known as protective lung ventilation; they may reduce mortality and the duration of mechanical ventilation (<LINK REF="STD-Amato-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Amato 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ARDSnet-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">ARDSnet 2000</LINK>) and have become standard care.</P>
<P>Recruitment manoeuvres (RMs) have been used in the ventilatory treatment of patients with ARDS (<LINK REF="REF-Fan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fan 2008</LINK>). Recruitment manoeuvres re-inflate collapsed regions of the lungs by briefly raising intrapulmonary pressure to levels higher than those achieved during tidal ventilation (<LINK REF="STD-Brower-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Brower 2003</LINK>). They may be used intermittently throughout the day, or on a single occasion, to re-inflate collapsed alveoli. A variety of RMs have been described, including prolonged continuous positive airway pressure (30 to 40 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O) and stepwise or staircase RMs, which are based on progressive incremental increases in PEEP at constant driving pressure. Recruitment manoeuvres (usually) are associated with short-term physiological benefits such as reduced intrapulmonary shunt and increased pulmonary compliance. They remain controversial because they may be harmful (<LINK REF="REF-Fan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fan 2008</LINK>). Recruitment manoeuvres increase intrathoracic pressure and can transiently reduce venous return and cardiac output (<LINK REF="REF-Odenstedt--2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Odenstedt 2005</LINK>). The increase in intrapulmonary pressure that results may cause barotrauma (<LINK REF="STD-Brower-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Brower 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Levy-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levy 2005</LINK>).</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-11-15 10:17:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Use of a ventilation strategy that included recruitment manoeuvres and higher positive end-expiratory pressure based on the pressure-volume curve, which was higher than in the control group, improved survival in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (<LINK REF="STD-Amato-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Amato 1998</LINK>). Recruitment manoeuvres have been investigated in animal models (<LINK REF="REF-Funk-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Funk 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lim-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lim 2004</LINK>) and in ventilated patients (<LINK REF="STD-Amato-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Amato 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brower-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Brower 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Levy-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levy 2005</LINK>) with variable outcomes.

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-11-15 10:17:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>This is an update of a Cochrane review that was first published in 2009 (<LINK REF="REF-Hodgson-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodgson 2009</LINK>). We have included eight new trials in this updated version (<LINK REF="STD-Cavalcanti-et-al_x002c_-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Cavalcanti et al, 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hodgson-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hodgson 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huh-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Huh 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kacmarek-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Kacmarek 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Xi 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2011</LINK>). Techniques used to apply a recruitment manoeuvre vary in duration, maximum pressure and end-expiratory pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Fan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fan 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Suzumura-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suzumura 2014</LINK>). This variation has made it difficult to extrapolate research findings to clinical practice. Effects of a recruitment manoeuvre may vary with the cause of lung injury (<LINK REF="REF-Borges-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borges 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brower-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Brower 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kacmarek-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kacmarek 2007</LINK>). A small number of papers have reported reviews on the safety and efficacy of recruitment manoeuvres in ventilated patients (<LINK REF="REF-Fan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fan 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fan 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lapinsky-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lapinsky 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Piacentini-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Piacentini 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Richard-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richard 2004</LINK>), including a recent meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Suzumura-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suzumura 2014</LINK>) and a Scandanavian clinical practice guideline for managing mechanical ventilation for patients with ARDS (<LINK REF="REF-Laake-et-al_x002c_-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laake et al, 2015</LINK>).</P>

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2016-11-15 10:17:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>We included RCTs that compared recruitment manoeuvres versus standard care. We defined a recruitment manoeuvre as any technique that transiently increased alveolar pressure above normal tidal ventilation (which may have included an increase in any pressure, such as plateau, peak or end-expiratory pressure) and sustained that pressure beyond the normal time. We defined standard care as protective lung ventilation including tidal volume and pressure limitation (<LINK REF="REF-ARDSnet-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">ARDSnet 2000</LINK>) without recruitment manoeuvres. We excluded any trial that did not use standard care ventilation, as the ventilation strategy in the control group may have caused a difference in outcomes.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-11-15 10:17:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>We included 10 trials in this systematic review (<LINK REF="STD-Cavalcanti-et-al_x002c_-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Cavalcanti et al, 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hodgson-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hodgson 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huh-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Huh 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kacmarek-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Kacmarek 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meade-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Meade 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oczenski-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Oczenski 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Xi 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2011</LINK>). We pooled data from eight of the nine randomized controlled trials that provided mechanical ventilation for participants with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with an intervention that included recruitment manoeuvres (RMs) compared with standard care (without RMs) (<LINK REF="STD-Cavalcanti-et-al_x002c_-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Cavalcanti et al, 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hodgson-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hodgson 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huh-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Huh 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kacmarek-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Kacmarek 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meade-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Meade 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Xi 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2011</LINK>). Trials varied with regards to the RM used (duration, maximum pressure, mode of delivery) and with regards to risk of bias. Six trials included an "open lung ventilation strategy" whereby the intervention group differed from the control group in providing co-interventions other than the RM (such as higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)) (<LINK REF="STD-Cavalcanti-et-al_x002c_-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Cavalcanti et al, 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hodgson-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hodgson 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huh-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Huh 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kacmarek-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Kacmarek 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meade-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Meade 2008</LINK>). Clinical heterogeneity of these studies makes it difficult to interpret results.</P>
<P>Six trials reported on events for our primary outcome (mortality) (<LINK REF="STD-Hodgson-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hodgson 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huh-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Huh 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kacmarek-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Kacmarek 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meade-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Meade 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Xi 2010</LINK>). The intervention group in five of these trials received open lung ventilation with co-interventions, such as increased PEEP, as well as RMs (<LINK REF="STD-Hodgson-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hodgson 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huh-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Huh 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kacmarek-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Kacmarek 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meade-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Meade 2008</LINK>). Recruitment manoeuvres were not allowed in control participants. Results demonstrated statistically significant differences in intensive care unit (ICU) mortality, but not in 28-day or hospital mortality. The composite design of these interventions means that any difference in outcomes between control and intervention groups could be due to any of the components of the intervention, or, as likely, to the combined synergistic effects of two or more of these components. A recent individual participant data meta-analysis reported an association between improved survival in participants with acute respiratory distress who were mechanically ventilated and reduced driving pressure during mechanical ventilation (<LINK REF="REF-Amato-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amato 2015</LINK>). It is possible that trials included in this review that provided an intervention with open lung ventilation including RMs may have also used reduced driving pressure (as a result of increased PEEP combined with protective lung ventilation), and this may have had an effect on mortality. Only one trial isolated the effects of RMs on our primary outcome and showed no difference between intervention and control groups (<LINK REF="STD-Xi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Xi 2010</LINK>); however, this trial had a moderately high risk of bias (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>).</P>
<P>Recruitment manoeuvres were performed at different time points following randomization in the included trials; they were performed in response to both disconnection and desaturation in several trials, further complicating interpretation of results. In the largest trial (<LINK REF="STD-Meade-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Meade 2008</LINK>), the intervention group (n = 423) received an RM at the start of the trial, and 366 received at least one additional RM following ventilator disconnection (but 57 did not receive the additional RM). <LINK REF="STD-Hodgson-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hodgson 2011</LINK> applied a daily staircase RM in the intervention group that lasted up to six minutes but performed brief RMs throughout the day for disconnection or desaturation. Three trials performed RMs eight-hourly (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Xi 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2011</LINK>). As a result of the clinical heterogeneity associated with dose and repetition of RMs, as well as the use of co-interventions, it is not clear whether one or multiple RMs might have caused the effect. Additionally, we found limited information on who was involved in ventilatory management within the ICU, so we can draw no conclusions about international differences in ventilatory management for patients with ARDS.</P>
<P>We pooled the results of seven randomized trials and found that RMs did not affect the rate of barotrauma (<LINK REF="STD-Hodgson-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hodgson 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huh-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Huh 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kacmarek-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Kacmarek 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meade-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Meade 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Xi 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2011</LINK>). These results support a recent systematic review of RMs and clinical outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Suzumura-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suzumura 2014</LINK>) and may indicate that RMs are safe; however, clinical heterogeneity between studies was significant. Evidence previously obtained by computerized tomography (<LINK REF="STD-Gattinoni-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gattinoni 2006</LINK>) indicated that response to high PEEP is heterogeneous in patients with ARDS and may lead to over-distension rather than to lung recruitment.Study authors reported that some participants with ARDS might benefit from an RM and high PEEP, although for others, this approach may be harmful. Future individual participant data meta-analyses may answer specific questions regarding response to RMs (i.e. responders vs non-responders).</P>
<P>This review reported an increase in oxygenation from baseline to 24 to 48 hours after RMs were commenced in six pooled trials (<LINK REF="STD-Cavalcanti-et-al_x002c_-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Cavalcanti et al, 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hodgson-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hodgson 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huh-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Huh 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meade-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Meade 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Xi 2010</LINK>). However, the isolated effect of RMs in <LINK REF="STD-Oczenski-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Oczenski 2004</LINK> increased the fraction of arterial oxygen to inspired oxygen (PaO<SUB>2</SUB>/FiO<SUB>2</SUB>) for three minutes (returning to baseline levels within 30 minutes). Similarly, two trials of RMs (in isolation from other components of open lung ventilation) reported that oxygenation was unchanged compared with control at 24 or 48 hours after RMs (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Xi 2010</LINK>). Additional studies are needed to determine effects of RMs in isolation from other co-interventions on sustained changes in oxygenation.</P>

<P>Although we judged the included trials to be at varying risks of bias overall, we drew evidence for our main outcomes from studies at low risk of bias. Effects of additional ventilatory co-interventions were not controlled (<LINK REF="STD-Cavalcanti-et-al_x002c_-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Cavalcanti et al, 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hodgson-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hodgson 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huh-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Huh 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kacmarek-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Kacmarek 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meade-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Meade 2008</LINK>). Recruitment manoeuvres were applied inconsistently and in some cases were linked to ventilatory disconnection and desaturation. Investigators did not blind treatment or assessor, and only one trial reported blinding of the analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Meade-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Meade 2008</LINK>). One trial did not use intention-to-treat analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Xi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Xi 2010</LINK>) and excluded 15 participants from the final analysis for failure to adhere to the study protocol; this limits the applicability of the evidence, and we rated this study as having high risk of bias.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-11-15 10:17:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>We identified several potential biases in the review process. First, we excluded studies with cross-over design, as we could not assess the primary outcome. However, other outcomes (barotrauma, oxygenation) may have been relevant to the review. Second, we excluded length of stay as an outcome measure (hospital length of stay; ICU length of stay), as survivors and non-survivors were not reported separately. In the future, we recommend that randomized controlled trials should report length of stay for both survivors and non-survivors separately. Third, we included studies with a transient increase in pressure from baseline as an RM. In doing so, we excluded studies of airway pressure release ventilation, which is a mode of ventilation that is used to recruit alveoli and may be considered a type of RM. The study by Kacmarek was completed in 2007 but was not published until 2014. Finally, one study not included in the review is awaiting classification, as we were unable to contact the study author (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2009</LINK>).</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-11-15 10:17:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Some issues remain open for debate. In particular, do recruitment manoeuvres, in isolation from other co-interventions, have an impact on outcomes such as survival? Data are currently insufficient to answer this question. It is plausible that RMs alone are not sufficient to improve longer-term outcomes, but they add value when used with co-interventions as part of an open lung ventilation strategy that includes low tidal volumes, high PEEP and limited plateau pressures (<LINK REF="REF-Amato-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amato 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ARDSnet-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">ARDSnet 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kacmarek-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kacmarek 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meade-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Meade 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Also, if RMs have a beneficial effect on outcomes, what would be the optimal inspiratory pulmonary pressure, length of time and level of PEEP needed to maintain such effects? All of the included studies used different inspiratory pressures for different lengths of time, with varying levels of PEEP (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). The mode of ventilation used to achieve an RM also varied widely. Any given inspiratory pressure might be effective in some patients, ineffective in some and harmful in others (for instance, by overdistending lung units). It may be important to determine the minimum PEEP that sustains the benefits of an RM (<LINK REF="REF-Briel-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Briel 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kacmarek-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kacmarek 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lapinsky-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lapinsky 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Evidence is insufficient to show the optimal frequency of delivering an RM in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-11-15 10:17:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Evidence in our review on delivery of recruitment manoeuvres for participants with acute ARDS shows considerable heterogeneity. Available evidence suggests that recruitment manoeuvres may improve intensive care unit survival, and that they are used predominantly as part of an open lung ventilation strategy. Oxygenation was increased from baseline to 24 to 48 hours after a recruitment manoeuvre, and no evidence suggests increased barotrauma. At this stage, recruitment manoeuvres delivered once per day as part of an open lung strategy during moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome may be beneficial. The largest studies to date have used a plateau pressure of 40 to 50 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O, with recent (<LINK REF="STD-Kacmarek-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Kacmarek 2016</LINK>) and incomplete trials (<LINK REF="STD-ART-STudy-Investigators" TYPE="STUDY">ART STudy Investigators</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PHARLAP-Group-Investigators" TYPE="STUDY">PHARLAP Group Investigators</LINK>) increasing inspiratory pressure stepwise to 55 to 60 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O. Ongoing studies in this area may have an influence on future practice (<LINK REF="STD-ART-STudy-Investigators" TYPE="STUDY">ART STudy Investigators</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PHARLAP-Group-Investigators" TYPE="STUDY">PHARLAP Group Investigators</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-11-15 10:17:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Recruitment manoeuvres generally are used as part of an open lung ventilation strategy, with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) titrated following the recruitment manoeuvre on an individual basis to maintain lung recruitment. Further research is required to determine the ideal recruitment manoeuvre with regards to duration, peak pressure and titration of PEEP. An individual participant data meta-analysis may reveal whether effects of recruitment manoeuvres vary with severity and cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome and with the type of recruitment manoeuvre provided. In addition, future research on recruitment manoeuvres may be required to separate effects of recruitment manoeuvres from those of co-interventions such as increased PEEP, although clinically, recruitment manoeuvres are rarely used in isolation, and a separate analysis of open lung ventilation (including limited tidal volumes and inspiratory pressure with recruitment manoeuvres and titrated PEEP) may be pertinent.</P>
