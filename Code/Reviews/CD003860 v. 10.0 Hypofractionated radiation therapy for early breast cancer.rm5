<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We asked if giving fewer radiation treatments (using a higher radiation dose at each visit) was as effective as the conventional 25 to 30 radiation treatments for women with early breast cancer who have breast conserving therapy (keep their breast).</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in women, with one in eight women in the United States and Australia, and one in nine women in the United Kingdom being diagnosed with the condition by age 85 years. Breast conserving therapy (removing the tumour but keeping an intact breast) has proven to be as effective as mastectomy (removing the breast tissue) in terms of survival for women with cancer confined to the breast (or the local lymph nodes, or both), as long as a five to six-week course of radiation therapy is delivered. This involves 25 to 30 visits to a radiation oncology department. Without radiation therapy after breast conserving surgery there is a significant risk of breast cancer returning in the breast (local recurrence). Furthermore, for every local recurrence avoided with radiation, one death is avoided at 15 years. Many women prefer breast conservation which has resulted in an increased demand for radiation services. Giving fewer daily radiation treatments (fractions) would be beneficial to women if this has the same effect on tumour control and survival, and cosmetic outcome. In order to reduce the number of treatments, the radiation dose delivered per fraction is increased. This may also reduce demand on radiation resources and be more convenient for women.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>Nine studies, involving 8228 women, were included in this review. Most of the women in the studies (91%) had tumours 3 cm or less in size, all had complete removal of the tumour on pathology and 68% had no evidence of cancer in their lymph nodes. Where the breast size was known, 83% had small or medium breasts.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence is current up to May 2015. Local recurrence was not different for women having fewer treatments (four fewer local relapses per 1000 (where the true value may be anywhere between 16 fewer to 10 more local relapses per 1000)). Breast appearance was not different for women undergoing fewer treatments (31 fewer fair/poor breast appearance per 1000 (where the true value may be anywhere between 59 fewer to 3 more per 1000 with fair/poor breast appearance)). Survival was not altered by having fewer treatments (13 fewer deaths per 1000 (where the true value could be between 31 fewer to 5 more deaths per 1000)) and there was no significant difference in late skin toxicity (4 more episodes of toxicity per 1000; where the true value may be anywhere between 14 fewer to 36 more episodes of toxicity per 1000) or radiation toxicity. Acute skin toxicity is decreased with fewer treatments (326 fewer events per 1000 (where the true value may be anywhere between 264 fewer to 374 fewer acute skin toxicity events per 1000)). This review indicates that for women who fit these criteria, using fewer radiation treatments after tumour removal gives the same cancer control, with less skin reaction at the time and the likely the same side-effects in the long term.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>We found high quality evidence for the following outcomes: local recurrence-free survival, breast appearance, toxicity, overall survival and breast cancer-specific survival. We found moderate quality evidence for relapse-free survival, and no data for mastectomy rate (mastectomy may be required because of local recurrence or unacceptable treatment-related toxicity) or costs.</P>

<P>Shortening the duration of radiation therapy would benefit women with early breast cancer treated with breast conserving surgery. It may also improve access to radiation therapy by improving efficiency in radiation oncology departments globally. This can only happen if the shorter treatment is as effective and safe as conventional radiation therapy. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2008 and updated in 2009.</P>

<P>We studied 8228 women in nine studies. Eight out of nine studies were at low or unclear risk of bias. Altered fraction size (delivering radiation therapy in larger amounts each day but over fewer days than with conventional fractionation) did not have a clinically meaningful effect on: local recurrence-free survival (Hazard Ratio (HR) 0.94, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.15, 7095 women, four studies, high-quality evidence), cosmetic outcome (Risk ratio (RR) 0.90, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.01, 2103 women, four studies, high-quality evidence) or overall survival (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.03, 5685 women, three studies, high-quality evidence). Acute radiation skin toxicity (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.45, 357 women, two studies) was reduced with altered fraction size. Late radiation subcutaneous toxicity did not differ with altered fraction size (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.05, 5130 women, four studies, high-quality evidence). Breast cancer-specific survival (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.06, 5685 women, three studies, high quality evidence) and relapse-free survival (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.05, 5685 women, three studies, moderate-quality evidence) did not differ with altered fraction size. We found no data for mastectomy rate. Altered fraction size was associated with less patient-reported (P &lt; 0.001) and physician-reported (P = 0.009) fatigue at six months (287 women, one study). We found no difference in the issue of altered fractionation for patient-reported outcomes of: physical well-being (P = 0.46), functional well-being (P = 0.38), emotional well-being (P = 0.58), social well-being (P = 0.32), breast cancer concerns (P = 0.94; 287 women, one study). We found no data with respect to costs.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-07-01 20:40:54 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found that using altered fraction size regimens (greater than 2 Gy per fraction) does not have a clinically meaningful effect on local recurrence, is associated with decreased acute toxicity and does not seem to affect breast appearance, late toxicity or patient-reported quality-of-life measures for selected women treated with breast conserving therapy. These are mostly women with node negative tumours smaller than 3 cm and negative pathological margins.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-07-05 14:00:06 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review is an update of a review previously published in the <I>Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews</I> 2009, Issue 11 on fraction size in radiation therapy for breast conservation in early breast cancer. Breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in women and the second most common cause of cancer death in women. The lifetime risk to age 85 years of being diagnosed with breast cancer for women living in Australia and the United States is one in eight, and one in nine for women living in the United Kingdom (<LINK REF="REF-AIHW-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">AIHW 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ONS-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">ONS 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ries-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ries 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>A significant change has occurred in the management of women with early breast cancer (cancer confined to the breast and nearby lymph nodes) over the last three decades. Previously most women with early breast cancer underwent removal of the whole breast (mastectomy). Evidence from several randomised controlled trials (<LINK REF="REF-Fisher-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fisher 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Veronesi-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Veronesi 1990</LINK>) and a meta-analysis of 36 trials (<LINK REF="REF-EBCTCG-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">EBCTCG 1995</LINK>) confirms that long-term overall survival is equivalent using breast conserving treatment compared with mastectomy. Breast conserving treatment comprises removal of the portion of the breast containing the tumour followed by radiation therapy to the remaining breast tissue. Other studies have shown that quality of life is enhanced in women who undergo breast conserving treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Al_x002d_Ghazal-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al-Ghazal 2000</LINK>). Consequently, breast conserving treatment has become the recommended option for women with early breast cancer in many Western countries (<LINK REF="REF-NBCC-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">NBCC 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NIH-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 1991</LINK>). Breast conserving surgery now accounts for 70% of breast cancer operations in some series (<LINK REF="REF-Chouillet-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chouillet 1994</LINK>) and, as a result, demand for radiation therapy services has increased. Some health services have struggled to meet this increasing demand because of a shortage of trained personnel and expensive radiation treatment machines (<LINK REF="REF-Ash-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ash 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mackillop-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mackillop 1994</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-09-30 17:35:25 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Brigid E Hickey">
<P>Radiation following breast conserving surgery involves treatment to the breast with ionising radiation. Typically the radiation is delivered over a period of five to six weeks using a standard 2 Gy (Gray) radiation dose per fraction, in 25 to 30 treatment episodes, to a total dose of 50 to 60 Gy.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-06-24 20:58:33 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Recently there has been interest from cancer service providers in shortening the overall treatment time. One method of achieving this is to increase the size of each fraction thereby decreasing the total number of fractions required. For example, case series using 40 Gy in 15 fractions or 36 Gy in 12 fractions have been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Ash-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ash 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olivotto-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Olivotto 1996</LINK>). Shorter fractionation schedules have the advantages of using machine and staff time more efficiently and reducing patient inconvenience.</P>
<P>Concerns have been raised, however, as to whether shorter fractionation schedules have equivalent outcomes in terms of local tumour control, breast appearance (cosmesis), late toxicity, overall survival and patient satisfaction. The concern with larger fraction sizes is based on radiobiological principles which state that the fraction size is the dominant factor in determining late side effects. The aim of conventional fractionation at 2 Gy per fraction is to decrease the rate of late tissue damage whilst aiming to maximise tumour control with acceptable acute toxicity (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 1994</LINK>). Higher fraction size could lead to increased scarring and retraction of breast tissue as well as skin atrophy (thinning) and telangiectasia (dilated blood vessels).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-07-01 21:39:44 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The optimal fractionation schedule is not well-established (<LINK REF="REF-Whelan-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whelan 1993</LINK>) but evidence from clinical trials suggests that the results of shorter schedules may be equivalent with respect to local control and cosmesis (<LINK REF="REF-Whelan-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whelan 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yarnold-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yarnold 1994</LINK>). Published trials to date have been too small to detect differences in cancer recurrence rates reliably.</P>
<P>If a shorter fractionation schedule was shown to provide equivalent outcomes for women this could lead to more efficient use of radiation services and more expedient treatment for women with early breast cancer.</P>

<P>Two authors (BH and ML) performed data extraction independently, with disagreements being resolved by discussion. We entered data into Review Manager 5.3 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>) for analysis. Where data were limited, we requested further information from the authors of the original studies. We received data from the authors of <LINK REF="STD-START-A-2008" TYPE="STUDY">START A 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-START-B-2008" TYPE="STUDY">START B 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Owen-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Owen 2006a</LINK>. Data for local recurrence events was derived from percentages (<LINK REF="STD-Whelan-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Whelan 2002b</LINK>) where raw numbers were not available (we assumed the denominators used were the numbers in each arm of the trial). Where there were two experimental arms using altered fraction size (<LINK REF="STD-Owen-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Owen 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-START-A-2008" TYPE="STUDY">START A 2008</LINK>), we combined the number of events and denominators to form a single experimental arm.</P>
<P>We calculated the log rank statistic (O-E) and its variance for time-to-event outcomes using an Excel spreadsheet developed by Matthew Sydes (Cancer Division) in collaboration with the Meta-analysis Group of the MRC Clinical Trials Unit, London (<LINK REF="REF-Sydes-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sydes 2007</LINK>). For <LINK REF="STD-START-B-2008" TYPE="STUDY">START B 2008</LINK>, to derive O-E and variance for: LR-FS, OS, BC-SS and RFS, we used Method four (where HR, number of events in each arm and the randomisation is 1:1). We used Method four to derive O-E and variance for OS (<LINK REF="STD-Whelan-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Whelan 2002b</LINK>). We used Method six to derive O-E and variance for LR-FS (<LINK REF="STD-Owen-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Owen 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-START-A-2008" TYPE="STUDY">START A 2008</LINK>) (where HR and total number of events are available and randomisation need not be 1:1), OS, RFS and BC-SS (<LINK REF="STD-START-A-2008" TYPE="STUDY">START A 2008</LINK>). We used Method eleven to derive LR-FS and R-FS (<LINK REF="STD-Whelan-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Whelan 2002b</LINK>; data extracted from the curve where numbers at risk are available). Method seven was used to derive O-E and variance for BC-SS (<LINK REF="STD-Whelan-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Whelan 2002b</LINK>; where P value, events in each arm available and randomisation ratio is 1:1).</P>
<P>We reported cosmetic outcome using a four-point scale (see additional <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>: <LINK REF="STD-Owen-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Owen 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taher-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Taher 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whelan-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Whelan 2002b</LINK>). This was dichotomised and those who had fair/poor results were counted as having events. For <LINK REF="STD-Owen-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Owen 2006a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Whelan-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Whelan 2002b</LINK>, we derived figures from percentages given in the text.</P>
<P>Acute toxicity: two different five-point scales were used (<LINK REF="REF-Cox-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cox 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NCI" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCI</LINK>); any woman who had Grade II toxicity or more was scored as having an event. Although they are both five-point scales, the <LINK REF="REF-NCI" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCI</LINK> does not always use all five grades. After examining the descriptions for each grade in the two different scales, we chose to report any women with Grade 2 toxicity or more as having an event (see <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>).</P>
<P>Late radiation therapy (RT) toxicity (telangiectasia, breast oedema, subcutaneous toxicity): any woman who had Grade 2 toxicity or more was scored as having an event.</P>
<P>Rib fractures: we reported radiologically confirmed rib fractures (excluding those related to metastases and trauma).</P>
<P>We reported ischaemic heart disease for those women with left-sided tumours, and those with pre-existing heart disease were excluded.</P>

DF resolved any discrepancies that arose. BH constructed and ML reviewed 'Risk of bias' tables for the included studies, with any discrepancies resolved by discussion. We constructed a 'Risk of bias' graph with review authors' judgements about each methodological quality item (presented as percentages across all included studies). We separated assessment of risk of bias into subjective (e.g. cosmesis) and objective outcomes (e.g. LR-FS).</P>
<P>We planned sensitivity analysis on the basis of study quality, which was to be performed with and without trials of low quality to assess the effect of quality on the results.</P>
</QUALITY_ASSESSMENT>
<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2016-06-24 23:07:33 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We presented results so that a result less than one favoured the experimental arm (hypofractionation). Summary statistics for dichotomous measures were presented as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2003</LINK>). Summary statistics for continuous variables were presented as mean differences (MD), where possible. We used Mantel-Haenszel methods to calculate pooled risk ratios (<LINK REF="REF-Greenland-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenland 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mantel-1959" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mantel 1959</LINK>). Where possible, we used the HR to present time-to-event data for the endpoints of LR-FS, OS, RFS, with 95% CI.</P>
<P>We deemed that a HR equal to or less than 0.75 and equal to or greater than 1.25 was clinically meaningful. In the absence of clear direction in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011b</LINK>), we made a pragmatic decision based on our expert opinions as clinicians and used the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) method (<LINK REF="REF-AHRQ-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">AHRQ 2011</LINK>) to choose (post-hoc) the minimal clinically important difference (MID), using a figure 50% of the difference tested for in a randomised study (<LINK REF="STD-START-A-2008" TYPE="STUDY">START A 2008</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-START-A-2008" TYPE="STUDY">START A 2008</LINK> was powered to detect a 5% difference in local relapse, so we chose 2.5% for our MID. We considered that for LR-FS, BC-SS and OS, a reasonable MID was 2.5%, as this is less than half the effect size sought in <LINK REF="STD-START-A-2008" TYPE="STUDY">START A 2008</LINK> (5%), and was chosen to be deliberately conservative. Therefore if the upper limit of the confidence interval indicated the intervention was less then 2.5% worse than the control, we concluded non-inferiority.</P>

Cosmetic outcome was assessed in the 735/1220 women with five years' follow-up at the time of assessment (<LINK REF="TBL-08" TYPE="TABLE">Table 8</LINK>). Cosmetic assessment was done for 1220 women at baseline and complete cosmetic data was reported for 735 women at five years (the time of interest for the outcome). We have no indication that these women were different to the remainder of those randomised. Triallists used a four-point scale (<LINK REF="REF-Aaronson-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aaronson 1988</LINK>) and the results were dichotomised as good or excellent versus poor or fair (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). The study reported these results as percentages at three and five years with the total number of women available for evaluation at each time period; as we did not know the numbers in each arm, we were unable to derive figures from these data. In <LINK REF="STD-Taher-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Taher 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Saha-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Saha 2009</LINK>, the same four-point scale was used to assess cosmesis, by an observer blinded to treatment arm (<LINK REF="STD-Taher-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Taher 2004</LINK>) and the results were dichotomised as in <LINK REF="STD-Whelan-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Whelan 2002b</LINK>.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Costs</HEADING>
<P>We found no data with respect to costs or women's preference for either altered or conventional fractionation.</P>
<P>For women with early breast cancer, achieving and maintaining local control in addition to maximising survival are the main goals of management. Whilst conservative surgery followed by radiation therapy allows preservation of the breast, the requirement for five to six weeks of radiation therapy, which may only be available at some distance from the woman's residence, can be a burden. The many costs involved (monetary and other) may mean that women choose mastectomy over breast-conserving therapy to avoid the necessity for radiation therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Nattinger-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nattinger 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Shortening the duration of postoperative breast radiation would provide the advantage of shorter disruption of normal activities and less time away from home and family. Reducing the number of fractions required would also free up radiation therapy machine time. This may reduce waiting lists and improve timely access to radiation therapy for other people with cancer. The ability to reduce the number of fractions required to treat women with early breast cancer safely may, therefore, result in many benefits at a personal, national and international level provided acceptable local control, toxicity and survival can be maintained with this approach.</P>
<P>This review set out to explore whether shortened (altered fraction size) regimens used to treat women who have had conservative surgery for early breast cancer can offer the same tumour control and cosmetic results as longer fractionation regimens. We have been able to include data from nine randomised controlled trials that compared different fractionation schemes. The comparison studied is altered fraction size (fraction size greater than 2 Gy) versus conventional fractionation (2 Gy per fraction).</P>
<P>The findings of this review provide reassurance that the practice of offering shortened radiation fractionation regimens to carefully selected groups of women with early breast cancer is equivalent in terms of local control, breast appearance, survival and late radiation breast toxicity, with associated improvements in some cosmetic parameters (telangiectasia and breast oedema). </P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Treatment and follow-up</HEADING>
<P>The length of follow-up was not adequate to detect differences in breast cancer mortality (not apparent before 15 years' follow-up) (<LINK REF="REF-EBCTCG-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">EBCTCG 2011</LINK>). If, however, there are truly no differences in local recurrence or late toxicity (e.g. cardiac morbidity) one would not expect to see differences in mortality. We did not see an increase in either late RT skin toxicity (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>) or late subcutaneous toxicity (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>) at either five or 10 years' follow-up. We found no differences in breast shrinkage (<LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>), rib fractures (<LINK REF="CMP-001.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.12</LINK>) or ischaemic heart disease (<LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>) with longer follow-up. With respect to radiation therapy-induced ischaemic heart disease (IHD), there is an excess risk of IHD after radiation therapy which is proportional to the mean heart dose (MHD) received. This increased risk is apparent at four years and persists for many years (<LINK REF="REF-Darby-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Darby 2013</LINK>). It is axiomatic that the reduction in MHD dose received may be of clinical benefit, reducing the risk of IHD for women with left-sided breast cancer treated with radiation therapy. The use of specialised radiotherapy techniques, such as deep inspiration breath hold (DIBH) can dramatically reduce MHD (<LINK REF="REF-Eldrege_x002d_Hindy-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eldrege-Hindy 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sixtel-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sixtel 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is possible that the reduction in acute radiotherapy toxicity seen when altered fraction size is used (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>), resulted in a reduction in consequential late radiation-induced effects, such as telangiectasia (<LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>) and breast oedema (<LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>).</P>

Using an alpha/beta ratio of four for breast tumour cells (<LINK REF="REF-Fowler-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fowler 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steel-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steel 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 1985</LINK>) allows conversion of radiation doses to EQD<SUB>2</SUB> (<LINK REF="REF-Maciejewski-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maciejewski 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Withers-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Withers 1983</LINK>). When the altered fraction size regimen radiation doses are converted to EQD<SUB>2</SUB> (see <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>), it is clear that some of the altered regimens (39 Gy in 13 fractions, 42.5 Gy in 13 fractions, 41.6 Gy in 13 fractions and 40 Gy in 15 fractions) (<LINK REF="STD-Owen-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Owen 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-START-A-2008" TYPE="STUDY">START A 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-START-B-2008" TYPE="STUDY">START B 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whelan-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Whelan 2002b</LINK>) have lower EQD<SUB>2</SUB> than the conventional 50 Gy in 25 fractions. Subgroup analysis by dose (less than 50 Gy versus 50 Gy) did not reveal any differences: Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 0.27, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, P = 0.06. <LINK REF="REF-Bartelink-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bartelink 2008</LINK> showed that all women irrespective of age showed improved local control with addition of a 16 Gy boost to conventionally fractionated radiotherapy. The reason for the lack of a difference in local control with lower EQD<SUB>2</SUB> used in the altered fraction size trials is uncertain. Possible reasons include the impact of the boost used in 44% of women treated (see <LINK REF="TBL-08" TYPE="TABLE">Table 8</LINK>), but it may reflect the effect of the use of more and better systemic therapy which also improves local control. For <LINK REF="STD-Shaitelman-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Shaitelman 2015</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-START-A-2008" TYPE="STUDY">START A 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-START-B-2008" TYPE="STUDY">START B 2008</LINK>, the use of a boost was roughly equally divided between the treatment arms. While boosts are associated with decreased local recurrence, they are also associated with poorer cosmesis (<LINK REF="REF-Bartelink-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bartelink 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Cost, peoples' preference and quality of life</B>
</P>
<P>It has not been possible at this time to answer questions of cost and patient preferences within this review. There was significantly less acute radiation toxicity in the altered arm and one could reasonably expect that shorter regimens are more readily tolerated and, therefore, would enhance the treatment experience for women. The use of altered fraction size was associated with less fatigue (both participant- and physician-reported) and there was no effect on patient-reported quality-of-life measures at six months, suggesting there was no detrimental effect on quality of life.</P>
<P>A detailed assessment of quality of life is planned for a subset of women enrolled in <LINK REF="STD-START-A-2008" TYPE="STUDY">START A 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-START-B-2008" TYPE="STUDY">START B 2008</LINK>, which may provide more information. These data have not yet been reported by study arm, so we could not include them in this version of the review. Little is known about patient preferences in this setting but as rural women have consistently been shown to have more mastectomies in comparison with women who live in bigger centres (<LINK REF="REF-Nattinger-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nattinger 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schroen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schroen 2005</LINK>) it may be that they choose mastectomy to reduce their time away from home (assuming they are offered conservative treatment as frequently as women in urban areas).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Adjuvant therapies</HEADING>
<P>We do not have information about combining other therapies (for example, trastuzumab) with these fractionation regimens, although observational data suggest it to be a safe practice with conventionally fractionated radiation therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Romond-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Romond 2005</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Optimum fraction size</HEADING>
<P>The optimum 'dose' of altered fraction size remains unknown.

We did not find a difference in LR-FS when we analysed by dose less than 50 Gy versus 50 Gy or more in the experimental arm (test for subgroup difference I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, P = 0.58). In addition, new techniques (such as accelerated partial breast irradiation) shorten treatment time even more by using larger fraction sizes to a smaller volume of breast tissue. These techniques are the subject of a number of ongoing trials.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Technological innovations</HEADING>
<P>New technology, for example, intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), which uses multiple radiation beams in order to make treatment highly conformal (thus reducing dose to normal structures) and improve dose distribution has been shown to decrease acute radiotherapy toxicity (<LINK REF="REF-Donovan-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donovan 2007</LINK>) and improve cosmesis (<LINK REF="REF-Pignol-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pignol 2008</LINK>).</P>

<P>In selected women with early breast cancer (with negative margins and size 3 cm or less, with small to medium sized breasts), shortened fractionation regimens are not detrimental for cancer-related outcomes (no clinically meaningful difference with the use of altered fraction size. Clinically meaningful benefits or harms excluded for local recurrence-free survival, overall survival, relapse-free survival and breast cancer-specific survival) and altered fraction size may be associated with a reduction in late radiation therapy toxicity. There still remains uncertainty about the effect of altered fraction size on ischaemic heart disease, although new radiation techniques, which avoid treating the heart, mean this of less importance.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-11-26 21:18:21 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Brigid E Hickey">
<P>There are a number of questions still unanswered with respect to costs and quality of life that relate to the use of altered fraction size in the treatment of early breast cancer for women undergoing breast cancer surgery. These questions are likely to be answered by both ongoing studies and future publications of completed studies.</P>

<P>We now report local recurrence-free survival as our primary outcome measure (in distinct to local recurrence). We have reported time-to event data where possible for cancer-related outcomes. We also report breast cancer-specific survival rather than cancer-specific mortality (as time-to-event endpoints are preferred for cancer outcomes) in order to be consistent.</P>

(Upfront pathologic stage cannot be assigned to patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. For such patients, the criteria for pathologic stage shall be applied to the initial clinical stage)<BR/>Treatment with breast conserving surgery<BR/>Final surgical margins must be negative, defined as no evidence for ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive breast cancer touching the inked surgical margin. If the invasive or in situ breast cancer approaches within less than 1 mm of the final surgical margin, then a re-excision is strongly encouraged. Lobular carcinoma in situ at the final surgical margin will be disregarded.<BR/>Age 40 years or older. This age cutoff is justified because breast cancers in women under the age of 40 are known to have a significantly higher risk of IBTR presumably due to underlying biologic differences<BR/>Female<BR/>Attending radiation oncologist declares intention to treat the whole breast only and that a third radiation field to treat regional lymph nodes is not planned (radiation of the un-dissected level I/II axilla with high tangents is allowed)<BR/>If the patient has a history of a prior non-breast cancer, all treatment for this cancer must have been completed prior to study registration and the patient must have no evidence of disease for this prior non-breast cancer<BR/>Patients must be enrolled on the trial within 12 weeks of the later of two dates: the final breast conserving surgical procedure or administration of the last cycle of cytotoxic chemotherapy</P>
