<P>Tocolytic drugs to help babies who have a shortage of oxygen during labour. </P>
<P>Most healthy babies cope well with the contractions of labour. However, some babies become short of oxygen, or cannot seem to get sufficient oxygen for their needs during labour. It can be difficult to identify these babies accurately, but they usually show some irregularity in their heartbeat patterns. If the mother lies on her back during labour, the weight of the uterus compresses her major blood vessels thus inhibiting the blood flow to the placenta and baby. If the mother is upright and moving around in labour, this can help to prevent such problems. However, the drug, syntocinon, given to push labour on more quickly, can contribute to such problems for the baby. Drugs that relax the uterus are thought to improve the blood circulation round the placenta and uterus. The review looked at the effectiveness of tocolytic drugs (drugs that relax the uterus) for helping babies in such situations prior to caesarean section. The review of trials found three studies involving just over 100 women. The studies seemed to show a benefit in terms of the acidity of the baby's blood at birth, and so showed a possible benefit in terms of 'buying time' and helping the baby whilst waiting for a caesarean section. However, the possibility of contributing to haemorrhage for the mother by relaxing the uterus needs proper investigation. So further research is needed.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Prophylactic tocolysis with betamimetics and other agents has become widespread as a treatment for fetal distress. Uterine relaxation may improve placental blood flow and, therefore, fetal oxygenation. However, there may also be adverse maternal cardiovascular effects. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this review was to assess the effects of tocolytic therapy for suspected fetal distress on fetal, maternal and perinatal outcomes.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group Trials Register (May 2006)</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised trials comparing tocolytic therapy with no treatment or treatment with another tocolytic agent for suspected fetal distress.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two review authors assessed trial quality and extracted data.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Three studies were included. Compared with no treatment, there were fewer failed improvements in fetal heart rate abnormalities with tocolytic therapy (relative risk (RR) 0.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13 to 0.53). Betamimetic therapy compared with magnesium sulphate showed a non-significant trend towards reduced uterine activity (RR 0.07, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.10).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Betamimetic therapy appears to be able to reduce the number of fetal heart rate abnormalities and perhaps reduce uterine activity. However, there is not enough evidence based on clinically important outcomes to evaluate the use of betamimetics for suspected fetal distress.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND>
<P>The use of acute tocolysis with betamimetic and other agents has become widespread in clinical practice in recent years on the basis of the presumption that uterine relaxation improves uteroplacental blood flow and, therefore, fetal oxygenation, and that this advantage outweighs adverse cardiovascular effects of the treatment on the mother. Surprisingly few well-controlled studies have addressed this question.</P>

</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>In the trial of <LINK REF="STD-Patriarco-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Patriarco 1987</LINK>, allocation of participants was by 'randomly generated numbers'. Blinding by placebo injections was not employed. No withdrawals after randomization were recorded. The assessment of fetal heart rate response may have been biased as evaluation of the tracings was not noted to have been blinded.</P>
<P>In the trial of <LINK REF="STD-Magann-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Magann 1993</LINK>, allocation was by a random number table using sealed opaque envelopes. The treatments were not blinded, but evaluation of the fetal heart rate traces and uterine contraction records were performed blind to the group allocation.</P>
<P>In the trial of <LINK REF="STD-Kulier-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kulier 1997</LINK>, allocation was by numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes. Randomization was done by computer-generated random numbers in blocks of ten. There were no withdrawals after randomization. The treatment was not blinded. The fetal heart rate tracings were analysed blinded with regard to group allocation.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Patriarco-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Patriarco 1987</LINK> studied 20 women with labours characterised by both ominous fetal heart rate changes and a fetal scalp blood pH of less than 7.25. Persistence of the heart rate pattern occurred in one of the 11 women treated with subcutaneous terbutaline, compared with all the randomly selected control group (Part 1). At birth, terbutaline-treated babies were less likely to be acidotic (mean pH 7.25 (SEM 0.03) versus 7.17 (0.02), p &lt; .025). Low Apgar scores also tended to be less common in the treatment group, though the 95% confidence intervals included the possibility of anything between a large benefit and no effect. There were no perinatal deaths in either group. Terbutaline was reported to have no adverse effects, other than transient maternal tachycardia.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Magann-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Magann 1993</LINK> compared magnesium sulphate 4 g intravenous bolus with terbutaline 0.25 mg subcutaneously in women awaiting caesarean section for fetal distress. Mean uterine activity after, compared with before, treatment was not significantly reduced with magnesium sulphate (200.45 Montevideo units, SD 36.9 versus 228.6, SD 49.35), but was with terbutaline (115.81, SD 57.5 versus 255.4, SD 108). Fewer women responded to magnesium sulphate than to terbutaline, and the response time for those who did respond was longer with magnesium sulphate. There was a trend towards persistent fetal heart rate abnormalities in more women treated by magnesium sulphate, and more had umbilical arterial pH values below 7.20.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Kulier-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kulier 1997</LINK> enrolled 37 women who had developed persistent fetal heart rate abnormalities consistent with fetal distress. The fetal heart rate pattern improved in more women after hexoprenaline 10 microgram intravenously than in the control group (8/13 or 61.6% versus 1/10 or 10%) and this difference reached statistical significance. Fewer babies in the hexoprenaline group had umbilical artery pH values of &lt;7.2 and base excess of &lt; -10, but this is not statistically significant. There were two stillbirths in the control group: one had gross hydrocephalus, which was discovered only at delivery; the second woman was referred for fetal distress from a peripheral hospital and delivered a stillborn baby after 55 minutes while waiting for caesarean section. Although there was a statistically significant increase in maternal pulse rate after treatment (89.4 versus 102.1 beats/minute before and 5 minutes after the injection respectively, p = 0.04), no maternal complaints were reported.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The conclusions of this review need to be tentative in view of the fact that they are based on two small trials comparing treatment with no treatment.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The limited evidence available suggests that intravenous betamimetics are a useful treatment for 'buying time' when fetal distress is diagnosed during labour. Such time may be useful for preparing for caesarean section or operative delivery, setting up regional analgesia, transferring a woman at home or in a unit without the necessary surgical or neonatal facilities, to an appropriate hospital, or reviewing the need for urgent delivery. Whether the need for operative delivery can in fact be reduced by this treatment remains to be demonstrated. On the basis of the one trial comparing magnesium sulphate with terbutaline as a tocolytic (<LINK REF="STD-Magann-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Magann 1993</LINK>), it appears that terbutaline (and presumably other betamimetics) are more likely to be effective than magnesium sulphate.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Because of the small sample sizes of the two trials comparing betamimetics with no treatment, evaluated in the primary comparison in this review, it is important that larger randomized trials be carried out to confirm these findings and to evaluate the effect of the treatment on meaningful measures of clinical outcome such as need for operative delivery and serious neonatal morbidity.</P>

<EXCLUDED_CHAR STUDY_ID="STD-Burke-1989">
<CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION>
<P>This study was excluded because an alternate month study/control allocation policy at three hospitals resulted in a large imbalance in group sizes (31 vs 19). Selection bias could not therefore be excluded with confidence. The experimental policy included intravenous terbutaline 0.25 mg prior to caesarean section for fetal distress. The control group included two women with twin pregnancies. Outcomes were apparently improved in terms of one-minute Apgar scores below seven (13/31 vs 15/21). Five-minute Apgar scores below seven were not significantly reduced (2/31 vs 5/21).</P>

</EXCLUDED_CHAR>
<EXCLUDED_CHAR STUDY_ID="STD-Eckblad-1988">
<CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION>
<P>This study was excluded because data are not available in an appropriate form for inclusion. Two hours before elective caesarean section at term, eight women were treated with ritodrine 300 micrograms per minute for 30 minutes, then 150 micrograms per minute, and seven received normal saline at similar infusion rates. During the infusion of ritodrine, maternal plasma levels of thromboxane were reduced, and 6-keto PGF1alpha (a metabolite of PGI2) were unchanged. In the control group, thromboxane levels were unchanged, and 6-keto PGF1alpha levels were increased. Cord blood prostaglandin levels were similar between the two groups.</P>
</CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION>
</EXCLUDED_CHAR>
<EXCLUDED_CHAR STUDY_ID="STD-Gerris-1980">
<CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION>
<P>This trial was excluded because two betamimetic agents were compared without a control group. Nulliparous women in normal established labour were allocated 'at random' to receive a 30 minute infusion of fenoterol, one, two or four micrograms per minute, or ritodrine 100, 200 or 400 micrograms per minute (four cases per sub-group). The short-term tocolytic effect and maternal and fetal side-effects were similar for the two drugs. After termination of the infusion, uterine activity resumed much more quickly after fenoterol than ritodrine, presumably an advantage when short-term tocolysis only is required, as in fetal resuscitation.</P>
</CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION>
</EXCLUDED_CHAR>
<EXCLUDED_CHAR STUDY_ID="STD-Hidaka-1987">
<CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION>
<P>This trial was excluded because allocation was not random. The obstetricians were divided into two groups, one of which used betamimetics, and one of which used oxygen inhalation for late fetal heart rate decelerations occurring three or more times (Hidaka, personal communication). Late fetal heart rate decelerations persisted less frequently in women who received 5 mg isoxuprine intravenously than in the group who received oxygen therapy (3/57 to 36/44, p &lt; 0.01). The numbers of women in the first and second stage of labour were unequally distributed between the groups.</P>
</CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION>
</EXCLUDED_CHAR>
<EXCLUDED_CHAR STUDY_ID="STD-Visser-1979">
<CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION>
<P>This study was excluded because exclusion of 13/60 enrolled women may have impaired the comparability of the groups. The 30 women who received salbutamol 250 micrograms had slightly better cord blood pO2 and base deficit values (relative to previous scalp blood samples) than did the 15 controls.</P>
