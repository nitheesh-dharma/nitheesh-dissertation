<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Based on 12 studies, including from eight to 160 people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes for at least an average four-month period, restricted protein intake appeared to slow progression of diabetic kidney disease, but not by much on average. However, individual variation existed, therefore a low-protein diet may benefit some individuals. A low-protein diet can be difficult to adhere to, especially over the long term. Reducing the amount of animal protein is the usual method but some evidence suggests that a shift from red meat to white meat and fish or vegetables may give similar results. We found no data on the effects of low-protein diet on health-related quality of life and costs.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Diabetic renal disease (diabetic nephropathy) is a leading cause of end-stage renal failure. Once the process has started, it cannot be reversed by glycaemic control, but progression might be slowed by control of blood pressure and protein restriction.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of dietary protein restriction on the progression of diabetic nephropathy in patients with diabetes.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, MEDLINE, EMBASE, ISI Proceedings, Science Citation Index Expanded and bibliographies of included studies.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and before and after studies of the effects of a modified or restricted protein diet on diabetic renal function in people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes following diet for at least four months were considered.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers performed data extraction and evaluation of quality independently. Pooling of results was done by means of random-effects model.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Twelve studies were included, nine RCTs and three before and after studies. Only one study explored all-cause mortality and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) as endpoints. The relative risk (RR) of ESRD or death was 0.23 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07 to 0.72) for patients assigned to a low protein diet (LPD). Pooling of the seven RCTs in patients with type 1 diabetes resulted in a non-significant reduction in the decline of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 0.1 ml/min/month (95% CI -0.1 to 0.3) in the LPD group. For type 2 diabetes, one trial showed a small insignificant improvement in the rate of decline of GFR in the protein-restricted group and a second found a similar decline in both the intervention and control groups. Actual protein intake in the intervention groups ranged from 0.7 to 1.1 g/kg/day. One study noted malnutrition in the LPD group. We found no data on the effects of LPDs on health-related quality of life and costs.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The results show that reducing protein intake appears to slightly slow progression to renal failure but not statistically significantly so. However, questions concerning the level of protein intake and compliance remain. Further longer-term research on large representative groups of patients with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus is necessary. Because of the variability amongst patients, there might perhaps be a six month therapeutic trial of protein restriction in all individuals, with continuation only in those who responded best. Trials are required of different types of protein.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Diabetes mellitus</HEADING>
<P>Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder resulting from a defect in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. A consequence of this is chronic hyperglycaemia (i.e. elevated levels of plasma glucose) with disturbances of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism. Long-term complications of diabetes mellitus include retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy. The risk of cardiovascular disease is increased. For a detailed overview of diabetes mellitus, please see under 'Additional information' in the information on the Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders Group on the Cochrane Library (see 'About the Cochrane Collaboration', 'Collaborative Review Groups'). For an explanation of methodology terms see the main Glossary on the Cochrane Library.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Diabetic Nephropathy</HEADING>
<P>Diabetic nephropathy is one of the most devastating complications in patients with diabetes. In diabetic nephropathy, damage to the kidneys occurs as a consequence of hyperglycaemia, which induces damage of blood vessels leading to several phenomena, including impaired blood flow. Features include increased excretion of protein in the urine, increased blood pressure and declining kidney function. Severe diabetic nephropathy can lead to kidney failure and end-stage renal disease (ESRD), when individuals must rely on haemo-dialysis, peritoneal dialysis or kidney transplantation to survive. The natural history of diabetic nephropathy includes several stages, starting with apparent normality in the first few years after diagnosis, followed by incipient nephropathy (characterised by the presence of small amounts of protein in the urine, known as microalbuminuria), then by overt clinical nephropathy leading to progressive renal failure (<LINK REF="REF-Gross-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gross 2005</LINK>). Kidney function is measured as the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which is a measure of the rate at which blood is filtered by the kidneys. Creatinine clearance measurements are often used as a surrogate for GFR. Once overt nephropathy develops, there is a progressive decline in GFR that can be assessed as an absolute decline in ml/min per year. In most patients with diabetic nephropathy, the decrease in GFR approaches linearity and is of the order of 9 to 14 ml/min/year (<LINK REF="REF-Mogensen-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mogensen 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parving-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parving 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Viberti-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Viberti 1983</LINK>).</P>
<P>With regard to progression to ESRD, the prognosis of type 1 diabetes has improved during the past four decades (<LINK REF="REF-Finne-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finne 2005</LINK>). Initial studies in the 1980s demonstrated that approximately. 80% of microalbuminuric type 1 diabetic patients progressed to proteinuria over a period of 6 to 14 years. In more recent studies, only 30% to 45% of microalbuminuric patients have been reported to progress to proteinuria over 10 years (<LINK REF="REF-Gross-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gross 2005</LINK>). However, diabetes is still the most important cause of ESRD in industrialised countries (<LINK REF="REF-Finne-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finne 2005</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-11-06 13:03:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Various nutritional guidelines for the treatment of diabetes have been published over the years (<LINK REF="REF-Connor-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Connor 2003</LINK>). The current UK recommendations suggest the amount of protein consumed should not exceed 1 g/kg/day (<LINK REF="REF-Connor-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Connor 2003</LINK>). The EURODIAB IDDM Complications Study notes that the average protein intake was 1.5 +/-0.5 g/kg/day (<LINK REF="REF-Toeller-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toeller 1996</LINK>). In patients with diabetes and nephropathy, dietary recommendations will change depending on the stage of the disease and treatment modality.</P>
<P>Traditionally low-protein diets (LPD) were rigid and restrictive and prescribed using an exchange system to include both high and low biological value protein. Prescribable low protein products were available to replace foods such as breads, milk and biscuits. Many patients described these products as unpalatable and therefore unhelpful. The energy, sodium and potassium intake would also be carefully assessed and monitored for each individual. Compliance with these regimes was difficult and would have required close dietetic monitoring in order to avoid protein energy malnutrition (PEM). PEM is known to adversely affect outcomes of patients treated by renal replacement therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Ikizler-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ikizler 1995</LINK>). The cause of PEM is often multifactorial and may include a reduced dietary intake and increased nutritional losses.<B>
<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>In the early 1980s, a number of studies suggested that restriction of dietary protein slowed progression to renal failure (<LINK REF="REF-Brenner-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brenner 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-El-Nahas-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">El Nahas 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maschio-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maschio 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rosman-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosman 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sitprija-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sitprija 1983</LINK>). Most of these studies were on groups of patients with renal failure due to a variety of causes, and results in the few diabetic patients were not reported separately. More recently there have been studies only in patients with diabetes. However protein restriction appears to be little used in routine diabetes care. This may be due to pessimism about compliance; people with diabetes already receive much dietary advice with which compliance is often poor. The lack of use may appear to be justified by the apparently disappointing results from the largest ever trial of protein restriction in renal disease; the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) study, in which a low-protein diet did not appear to affect the decline in renal function at three years (<LINK REF="REF-Klahr-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klahr 1994</LINK>). However, the MDRD study was again of a mixed group (glomerulonephritis and polycystic disease made up about half), and there were some promising features. Compliance to the LPD was shown to be possible, and a longer follow-up was more promising (<LINK REF="REF-Levey-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levey 1994</LINK>). Given the variation in response according to the aetiology of the renal impairment, recommendation on the use of LPDs in diabetes should be based on trials in patients with diabetes.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-11-06 13:03:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>We are aware of one previous meta-analyses having been carried out by Pedrini et al. (<LINK REF="REF-Pedrini-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pedrini 1996</LINK>). In five studies of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, a LPD significantly slowed the increase in urinary albumin level or the decline GFR or creatinine clearance (relative risk (RR) 0.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 0.77). The authors concluded that a LPD effectively slows the rate of progression of both diabetic and non-diabetic renal disease. However, there were only 108 patients included which may be too small to make firm conclusions (<LINK REF="REF-Pedrini-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pedrini 1996</LINK>). To our knowledge, the only other published review is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published as a book chapter in 2003 (<LINK REF="REF-Waugh-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waugh 2003</LINK>). The present review updates the original Cochrane review to include new evidence from studies which have been published since then.</P>

<P>Ideally, the diagnostic criteria for type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus should have been described in the trial.

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Diabetic nephropathy</HEADING>
<P>Nephropathy is a clinical diagnosis based upon the finding of proteinuria in a patient with diabetes and in whom there is no evidence of urinary infection. Conventionally, the level of proteinuria for a diagnosis of 'clinical nephropathy' or 'overt nephropathy' is 0.5 g/day, which is roughly equivalent to a urinary albumin excretion rate (UAER) of 300 mg/day. Patients with a UAER between 30 and 300 mg/day (or 20 to 200 mg/L) are defined as having 'microalbuminuria' or 'incipient nephropathy'. Although timed urine collections remain the 'gold standard' for diagnosis, they are cumbersome to use in routine clinical practice and most definitions of clinical or incipient nephropathy depend upon a 'spot' urine sample and thus a test of albumin concentration. Results in excess of 300 mg/day define clinical and incipient nephropathy. Sensitivity and specificity can be improved by using an early morning, first-voided specimen and correcting the albumin level for creatinine concentration (albumin:creatinine ratio) (<LINK REF="REF-Bilous-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bilous 2005</LINK>).</P>

Continuous data were expressed as weighted mean differences. Pooled results were analysed using a random-effects model. It was not possible to do a meta-analysis on trials with people with type 2 diabetes as insufficient studies were identified. We extracted the baseline and post-intervention means with standard deviations (SD) for the intervention and control groups. Any standard errors (SE) and confidence intervals (CI) were transformed into SDs where appropriate.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-11-06 13:09:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Overall, a restricted protein intake does appear to slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy albeit in a non-significant way. Progression rate without treatment has been reported to be a decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 9 to 14 ml/min/year in type 1 diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Mogensen-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mogensen 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parving-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parving 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Viberti-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Viberti 1983</LINK>). From the result of our meta-analysis, this implies that patients who comply with the low-protein diet can delay dialysis by, on average around one or two months. Variation among patients also needs to be taken into account. Studies did not give sufficient details to quantify this but a small average benefit may conceal larger benefits in some people.<BR/> <BR/>To explore the effect of a restricted diet on the progression of diabetic nephropathy further, we looked at the relationship between the difference in protein intake and the difference in the change in GFR between the two groups. Two studies were omitted because of insufficient data. The analysis showed a positive correlation, although not significant (r=0.59, n=10, P=0.07) suggesting improvement in GFR was greater if more restriction was achieved.</P>
<P>Compliance is clearly very important. People with diabetes are already asked to change their diets to conform to healthy eating guidelines. When we presented the results of this review to members of the Scottish Study Group for the Care of Diabetes in the Young, members identified compliance as important, but unlikely. Indeed some members wondered pessimistically if it was worth doing further research into low-protein diets (LPD) at all. In some of the studies it has been shown that even amongst the volunteer participants, the actual protein intake as indicated by urinary nitrogen output was higher than prescribed. In the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) study (<LINK REF="REF-MDRD-Study-Grp-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">MDRD Study Grp 1989</LINK>) the lower the prescribed level, the greater the excess taken. It was also noteworthy that the intake indicated by urinary nitrogen excretion was higher than indicated by dietary history. This has implications for monitoring of compliance in future studies.</P>
<P>Cianciaruso et al. noted that compliance was difficult to achieve, "adherence may be difficult, time consuming and unpleasant for the patients" (<LINK REF="STD-Cianciaruso-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Cianciaruso 1989</LINK>). They listed the problems: the use of special low-protein foods; the high cost; the time for separate cooking of meals; palatability; changes in lifestyle. However, they noted that compliance improved over three years, from about 30% in year one to about 80% by the end of year three. This may have been due to the onset of symptoms relieved by LPDs and fear of approaching dialysis. No data on the proportion with diabetes are given. The difficulty of adherence to low-protein restriction should not stop us giving people with diabetes the information on the options. </P>
<P>An important question is whether we could achieve almost as much by changing the type of protein in the diet, rather then the amount. Jibani et al. found that albumin excretion rates fell when patients with microalbuminuria were given a predominantly vegetarian diet, although the results were confounded by a sizeable drop in total protein intake, from 1.4 to 1.0 g/kg/day (<LINK REF="STD-Jibani-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Jibani 1991</LINK>). Pecis et al. compared three diets - usual diet with 1.4 g/kg/day, a LPD with 0.5 g/kg/day and a test diet in which chicken and fish replaced red meat (<LINK REF="STD-Pecis-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pecis 1994</LINK>). They found that the chicken and fish diet had similar effects on GFR to the LPD, but was much more acceptable. However, this was a short-term study with only three weeks on each diet. They hypothesize that this is due to the much lower levels of glycine, alanine and arginine in chicken and fish compared to red meat, these being the amino acids with greatest effect on GFR. If such diets are as effective as low-protein ones, then compliance becomes less of an issue. They might also have beneficial affects on cardiovascular risk. Compliance may be improved on a Mediterranean style diet, characterized by abundant plant foods, fresh fruit, olive oil, dairy products, fish and poultry consumed in low to moderate amounts and red meat consumed in low amounts. This review included five studies from Italy, three of which provided data on actual protein intake in the LPD group (<LINK REF="STD-Ciavarella-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Ciavarella 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meloni-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Meloni 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meloni-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Meloni 2004</LINK>). These studies report good compliance reporting mean protein intakes of 0.7, 0.7 and 0.9 g/kg/day.</P>
<P>In her very useful review, Zeller deals with the methodological problems of studies of protein restriction, such as the heterogeneity of aetiologies, the use of plasma creatinine as an indicator of renal function, the importance of measuring compliance and the need for an adequate duration of follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Zeller-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Zeller 1991</LINK>). </P>
<P>A severely restricted protein diet should be followed under the supervision of a specialist as there is a theoretical risk of nutritional deficiencies to occur (<LINK REF="REF-Connor-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Connor 2003</LINK>). In this review, only one study found evidence of malnutrition on an intended protein intake of 0.6 g/kg/day. It was reported that serum pre-albumin and serum albumin had significantly decreased in the LPD group (<LINK REF="STD-Meloni-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Meloni 2002</LINK>). In practice, however, the lack of compliance possibly protects against this side effect.</P>
<P>The present body of evidence is limited, and we need studies which are long term and which report important outcomes such as end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and which examine the balance between efficacy, adverse effects and compliance. We also need more studies in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Although the incidence of nephropathy here is less than in type 1, because type 2 is far commoner, the absolute numbers of patients proceeding to ESRD are similar (<LINK REF="REF-Raine-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raine 1995</LINK>). </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>This review has shown that a lower protein intake modestly slows the mean progression of diabetic nephropathy towards renal failure, although in a non-significant way. However it does not establish what level of protein restriction is most effective in achieving this decline. The optimum level of protein restriction in practice would probably be a compromise between efficacy and compliance. In the document Dietary Recommendations for People with Diabetes (1992), the British Diabetic Association recommend that 15% to 20% of energy intake is from a protein source. A pragmatic approach would be to reduce high protein intake to perhaps a maximum of 1 g/kg/day, or to 0.8 g/kg/day in those patients prepared to comply with that. Changing the type of protein, for example a vegetarian diet or white meat and fish replacing red meat, rather than the amount may achieve the same effects but with greater palatability.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further longer-term research on large representative groups of patients with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes is necessary. Also, taking into account the variability among patients, there might perhaps be a six month trial in all patients, with continuation only in those who responded best. We think the top priority should be for a trial of usual diet (unrestricted protein) versus reduction to say 0.8 g/kg/day (with chicken and fish instead of red meat) versus a vegetarian diet with no restriction in protein versus a vegetarian diet with modest intake (1 g/kg/day) with results both in terms of progression of diabetic nephropathy and compliance. Outcomes should include all of glomerular filtration rate (GFR), quality of life, cost-effectiveness and cardiovascular risk factors such as lipids. There is a research need in fully informed patients to assess whether dialysis can be postponed for worthwhile periods, even if only in some patients, without undue reduction in quality of life due to dietary restriction.</P>
