<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-05-27 16:47:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Prathap  Tharyan">
<P>Metastatic extradural spinal cord compression (MESCC) due to cancer from other parts of the body affecting the spine and causing compression of the spinal cord often results in pain, impaired functioning including reduced ability to walk, incontinence, and shortened survival. Radiation is the mainstay of treatment, but surgery, and corticosteroids are also used to treat people with MESCC. This update of a previous review published in 2008 evaluates the clinical trial evidence up to 3 March 2015 to determine how effective radiotherapy, surgery and corticosteroids are in improving functioning and survival, and in reducing pain; and how well tolerated they are in adults with MESCC.</P>
<P>We found seven studies conducted in high-income countries including 876 adults (aged 19 to 87 years) with MESCC. Follow-up ranged from one month to three years, and the number evaluated in each varied from 29 to 303. Two studies compared different doses of radiation, two compared surgery before radiation versus radiation alone, and three small trials evaluated the effects of high-dose corticosteroids versus moderate-dose steroids or placebo.</P>
<P>The key results are: 1. <U>For different doses of radiation:</U> one dose of radiation was as effective as two doses and two doses were as effective as eight doses of radiation in adults with spinal cord compression with stable spines who are expected to live for less than six months. Adults with a better prognosis may require the longer radiation course to prevent local cancer recurrence, but the immediate benefits of shorter courses might be important for people with MESCC who have only a short time to live. No serious adverse events were noted, and the incidence of diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting was low and no different with the different radiation doses. 2. <U>For surgery before radiation:</U> removing part of the vertebra to enlarge the spinal canal (laminectomy) before radiation offered no advantages over radiation alone. Direct decompressive surgery (directly accessing and removing affected parts of the vertebrae and, if required, fixing the spines using bone grafts and instruments) followed by radiation treatment was more effective than radiation alone in carefully selected adults younger than 65 years. Surgery plus radiation did not cause more harmful effects than radiation alone. 3. <U>For high dose steroids</U>: beneficial effects were not significantly different with high-dose versus moderate-dose steroids or placebo, but serious adverse effects were more frequent with high-dose steroids.</P>
<P>None of the studies reported on satisfaction with care or quality of life. We also did not find trials comparing different radiation doses in adults with MESCC with a good prognosis. We lacked full confidence in many results since they came from single trials or a few small trials. Also, in the study of decompressive surgery, some of the adults given radiation alone had cancers that were only moderately sensitive to radiation, and a third of patients in both intervention arms had unstable spines. In usual clinical practice, surgery, not radiation, is the preferred option in such instances. The overall GRADE quality of evidence was <I>moderate</I> for all outcomes for the comparisons of different radiation doses and for the adverse effects of high doses of corticosteroids, indicating reasonable confidence in the results, though future research could alter the estimates in this review and our confidence in the estimates. The GRADE quality of evidence was <I>very low</I> for all outcomes in the comparison of laminectomy, and <I>low </I>for the outcome of local tumour recurrence with different radiation doses, for all outcomes in the comparison with decompressive surgery, and for the efficacy outcomes in the comparison of high-dose corticosteroids. This indicates less confidence in these results, and acknowledges that future research is likely to alter the estimates in this review. More studies are required to clarify these uncertainties and some are in progress.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-05-28 03:08:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Prathap  Tharyan">
<P>In March 2015, we updated previous searches (July 2008 and December 2013) of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS, CANCERLIT, clinical trials registries, conference proceedings, and references, without language restrictions. We also contacted experts for relevant published, unpublished and ongoing trials.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2015-05-28 03:08:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Prathap  Tharyan">
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of radiotherapy, surgery and corticosteroids in adults with MESCC.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-04-10 16:41:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Prathap  Tharyan">
<P>Three authors independently screened and selected trials, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. We sought clarifications from trial authors.

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-08-13 12:58:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anna Hobson">
<P>This update includes seven trials involving 876 (723 evaluable) adult participants (19 to 87 years) in high-income countries. Most were free of the risk of bias.</P>
<P>
<U>Different radiotherapy doses and schedules</U>
</P>
<P>Two equivalence trials in people with MESCC and a poor prognosis evaluated different radiotherapy doses and schedules. In one, a single dose (8 Gray (Gy)) of radiotherapy (RT) was as effective as short-course RT (16 Gy in two fractions over one week) in enhancing ambulation in the short term (65% versus 69%; risk ratio (RR) was 0.93, (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82 to 1.04); 303 participants; <I>moderate quality evidence</I>). The regimens were also equally effective in reducing analgesic and narcotic use (34% versus 40%; RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.16; 271 participants), and in maintaining urinary continence (90% versus 87%; RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.1; 303 participants) in the short term (<I>moderate quality evidence</I>). In the other trial, split-course RT (30 Gy in eight fractions over two weeks) was no different from short-course RT in enhancing ambulation (70% versus 68%; RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.9 to 1.15; 276 participants); reducing analgesic and narcotic use (49% versus 38%; RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.67; 262 participants); and in maintaining urinary continence (87% versus 90%; RR 0.97, 0.93 to 1.02; 275 participants) in the short term (<I>moderate quality evidence</I>). Median survival was similar with the three RT regimens (four months). Local tumour recurrence may be more common with single-dose compared to short-course RT (6% versus 3%; RR 2.21, 95% CI 0.69 to 7.01; 303 participants) and with short-course compared to split-course RT (4% versus 0%; RR 0.1, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.72; 276 participants), but these differences were not statistically significant (<I>low quality evidence</I>). Gastrointestinal adverse effects were infrequent with the three RT regimens (<I>moderate quality evidence</I>), and serious adverse events or post-radiotherapy myelopathy were not noted.</P>
<P>We did not find trials comparing radiotherapy schedules in people with MESCC and a good prognosis.</P>
<P>
<U>Surgery plus radiotherapy compared to radiotherapy</U>
</P>
<P>Laminectomy plus RT offered no advantage over RT in one small trial with 29 participants (<I>very low quality evidence</I>). In another trial that was stopped early for apparent benefit, decompressive surgery plus RT resulted in better ambulatory rates (84% versus 57%; RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.90; 101 participants, <I>low quality evidence</I>). Narcotic use may also be lower, and bladder control may also be maintained longer than with than RT in selected patients (<I>low quality evidence</I>). Median survival was longer after surgery (126 days versus 100 days), but the proportions surviving at one month (94% versus 86%; RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.24; 101 participants) did not differ significantly (<I>low quality evidence). </I>Serious adverse events were not noted. Significant benefits with surgery occurred only in people younger than 65 years.</P>
<P>
<U>High dose corticosteroids compared to moderate dose or no corticosteroids</U>
</P>
<P>Data from three small trials suggest that high-dose steroids may not differ from moderate-dose or no corticosteroids in enhancing ambulation (60% versus 55%; RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.45; 3 RCTs, 105 participants); survival over two years (11% versus 10%; RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.24 to 5.05; 1 RCT, 57 participants); pain reduction (78% versus 91%; RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.20; 1 RCT, 25 participants); or urinary continence (63% versus 53%; RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.66 to 2.13; 1 RCT, 34 participants; <I>low quality evidence</I>). Serious adverse effects were more frequent with high-dose corticosteroids (17% versus 0%; RR 8.02, 95% CI 1.03 to 62.37; 2 RCTs, 77 participants; <I>moderate quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>None of the trials reported satisfaction with care or quality of life in participants.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-05-27 16:43:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Prathap  Tharyan">
<P>Based on current evidence, ambulant adults with MESCC with stable spines and predicted survival of less than six months will probably benefit as much from one dose of radiation (8 Gy) as from two doses (16 Gy) or eight doses (30 Gy). We are unsure if a single dose is as effective as two or more doses in preventing local tumour recurrence. Laminectomy preceding radiotherapy may offer no benefits over radiotherapy alone. Decompressive surgery followed by radiotherapy may benefit ambulant and non-ambulant adults younger than 65 years of age, with poor prognostic factors for radiotherapy, a single area of compression, paraplegia for less than 48 hours, and a predicted survival of more than six months. We are uncertain whether high doses of corticosteroids offer any benefits over moderate doses or indeed no corticosteroids; but high-dose steroids probably significantly increases the risk of serious adverse effects. Early detection; and treatment based on neurological status, age and estimated survival, are crucial with all treatment modalities. Most of the evidence was of low quality. High-quality evidence from more trials is needed to clarify current uncertainties, and some studies are in progress.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-05-28 03:08:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Prathap  Tharyan">
<P>This review is an update of a previously published review titled, 'Interventions for the treatment of metastatic extradural spinal cord compression in adults' that was published in the<I> Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews</I> (Issue 4, 2008) in <I>The Cochrane Library </I>(<LINK REF="REF-George-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">George 2008</LINK>).</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-05-28 03:08:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Prathap  Tharyan">
<P>Cancer that spreads to the spinal column, if untreated, can result in back pain, paraplegia, tetraplegia, urinary and bowel incontinence (<LINK REF="REF-Loblaw-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loblaw 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Holt-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holt 2012</LINK>). Metastatic extradural spinal cord compression (MESCC) is defined as "the compression of the dural sac and its contents, spinal cord or cauda equina, or both, by an extradural tumour mass.

In this definition, and in clinical practice, the term metastatic spinal cord compression refers to compression of the cord itself, or of the cauda equina more distally within the spinal canal.</P>
<P>Up to 40% of all people with cancer develop spinal metastases (<LINK REF="REF-Wong-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wong 1990</LINK>); and in 10% to 20% this can progress to symptomatic cord compression (<LINK REF="REF-Schaberg-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schaberg 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klimo-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klimo 2004</LINK>). A population-based study in Canada estimated that at least 2.5% of all people with cancer experienced one or more episodes of spinal cord compression in the five years preceding death (<LINK REF="REF-Loblaw-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loblaw 2003</LINK>). In this study, the cumulative five-year incidence of cord compression in different types of cancer were: myeloma 8%; prostate 7%; nasopharynx 6.5%; lung 6%; breast 5.5%; kidney 5%; cervix 2.5%; head and neck 0.9%; colorectum 0.8% and stomach 0.6% (<LINK REF="REF-Loblaw-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loblaw 2003</LINK>). The vast majority of spinal metastases in people with MESCC are found in the vertebral body with or without extension into the posterior elements; and also into paravertebral regions and the epidural space; these metastases most commonly affect the thoracic spine (70%), followed by the lumbar spine (20%), and less commonly the cervical spine, and sacrum (<LINK REF="REF-Sciubba-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sciubba 2010</LINK>). MESCC occurs when tumour elements or bone fragments displace the spinal cord within the canal.</P>
<P>MESCC is a condition that can cause significant morbidity and disability in large numbers of people across a spectrum of cancers. However there is surprisingly little evidence to guide clinicians and patients in choosing appropriate treatments.</P>

The management of cancer pain usually involves the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) therapy with mild and strong opioids, titrated to the severity of pain.<BR/>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Corticosteroids</HEADING>
<P>Corticosteroids reduce inflammation, oedema and pain; and are recommended both for immediate treatment and as an adjunct to radiotherapy or surgery, especially in patients with neurologic deficits (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Loblaw-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loblaw 2012</LINK>). Corticosteroids have demonstrated neurological improvement in human studies (<LINK REF="STD-Sorensen-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sorensen 1994</LINK>); and in rat experimental models of epidural tumours (<LINK REF="REF-Ushio-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ushio 1977</LINK>). The British and Canadian guidelines recommend starting with doses of around 16 mg per day (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-L_x2019_esp_x00e9_rance-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">L&#8217;espérance 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Loblaw-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loblaw 2012</LINK>) although some authors use doses up to 100 mg (<LINK REF="STD-Patchell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Patchell 2005</LINK>). In clinical practice corticosteroid doses vary widely. Studies have found a significant increase in serious adverse effects with high-dose corticosteroids. In a case control study, 14% of patients receiving 96 mg per day of dexamethasone developed serious adverse events, as compared to 0% of those receiving 16 mg per day (<LINK REF="REF-Delattre-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delattre 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heimdal-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heimdal 1992</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Radiotherapy</HEADING>
<P>Radiotherapy is the most commonly used definitive treatment modality. Radiation therapy can cause the tumour to shrink thereby reducing pressure; pain relief may also occur due to reduced pressure as well through neuropathic components. The outcome of radiotherapy depends on the pre- treatment neurologic status. Awareness, early detection and rapid access to treatment are crucial (<LINK REF="REF-Loblaw-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loblaw 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Maranzano-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maranzano 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2008</LINK>). A review of prospective non-randomised studies found that 94% of those who could walk unassisted before radiotherapy and 63% of those who needed assistance for walking, retained ambulation after radiotherapy. Much poorer outcomes were seen in patients who were already paraplegic (12%) or paraparetic (38%) (<LINK REF="REF-Loblaw-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loblaw 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The total dose and the number of radiotherapy treatment fractions vary widely (<LINK REF="REF-Falkmer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Falkmer 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Loblaw-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loblaw 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Loblaw-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loblaw 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rades-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rades 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rades-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rades 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rades-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rades 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rades-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rades 2011a</LINK>). In a prospective non-randomised study that recruited patients with motor deficits in Holland and Germany (&#8216;SCORE-1&#8217;), patients in Holland received short-course radiotherapy (1 × 8 Gray (Gy) or 5 × 4 Gy) completing treatment within a day or one week. Patients in Germany were treated for two to four weeks with long-course RT (10 × 3 Gy, 15 × 2.5 Gy or 20 × 2 Gy). Improvement in motor function (37% versus 39%) and one&#8211;year overall survival rates (23% versus 30%) were similar, but local control, (61% versus 81%) was significantly better in those who received long-course radiotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Rades-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rades 2011a</LINK>). The median survival was less than six months. The investigators concluded that short courses would suffice in patients with a poor prognosis. Longer courses and close follow-up would be needed in those who were likely to live long enough to develop a local recurrence.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Surgery</HEADING>
<P>The main goals of surgery in metastatic spine disease are relief of pain, spine stabilisation and preservation or improvement in neurological function. In addition, many clinicians would consider surgery only if the expected survival was greater than three months (<LINK REF="REF-Sciubba-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sciubba 2010</LINK>). Early surgical treatments such as laminectomy were abandoned as laminectomy alone does not address metastatic disease that is primarily in the vertebral body and the ensuing instability after laminectomy does not make the procedure worthwhile. Ventral approaches on the other hand directly deal with the tumour and provide adequate opportunity for interbody fusion.</P>
<P>A review of studies published from 1964 to 2005 clearly showed that outcomes improved with passing years with the introduction of more aggressive surgical approaches; and the addition of posterior stabilisation after laminectomy followed by RT resulted in substantial improvement in motor function and pain relief with similar mortality rates as laminectomy alone; whereas there was no difference in outcomes in studies using RT alone and in those comparing laminectomy with RT (<LINK REF="REF-Witham-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Witham 2006</LINK>). However, using anterior decompression with stabilisation demonstrated better motor outcomes but with higher mortality. <LINK REF="REF-Klimo-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klimo 2005</LINK>, in a meta-analysis of non-randomised single-arm radiotherapy and surgical case series, demonstrated that overall ambulatory success rates for surgery and radiation were 85% and 64% respectively. People who had recently lost the ability to walk were more than twice as likely to regain mobility with surgery compared to radiotherapy.</P>
<P>In people with MESCC with an unknown primary, either a percutaneous CT-guided biopsy or open surgery and RT are recommended. In patients with radioresistant tumours causing extradural cord compression and instability, surgical decompression with fixation is recommended (<LINK REF="REF-Sciubba-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sciubba 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Minimally invasive surgical procedures such as Video-Assisted Thoracostomy (VAST), Endoscopy-Assisted Posterior Decompression, and Minimal Access Spine Surgery (MASS), have been reported to offer benefit in people in whom aggressive surgeries are not feasible due to comorbid conditions such as malnourishment and diminished immune systems that make extensive surgical procedures unfeasible. Decreased complication rates, blood loss, and length of stay are considered to be among the benefits of minimally invasive surgery compared to open surgery, but their effects have to date been evaluated only by case reports, case series or retrospective study designs and these designs cannot accurately quantify their efficacy of effectiveness (<LINK REF="REF-Molina-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Molina 2011</LINK>). Their relative efficacy and safety compared to external radiotherapy is also unclear.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">The relationship between treatment modality and prognosis</HEADING>
<P>It is important to identify patients who would benefit from major spine surgery, minimally invasive surgery, or long courses of radiotherapy to optimise ambulation, pain relief and survival. In the earlier version of this review, we had discussed the need for good prognostic scoring systems, preferably based on hazard ratios from prospective studies or randomised trials (<LINK REF="REF-George-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">George 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Important prognostic factors for survival can be classified into the following domains:</P>
<P>1. The cancer: primary site, visceral metastases, skeletal metastases;</P>
<P>2.The patient&#8217;s condition: Karnofsky performance status, ability to walk;</P>
<P>3. The time course: the rate of tumour growth or rapidity of motor deficits, interval from the diagnosis of cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Maranzano-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maranzano 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Helweg_x002d_Larsen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Helweg-Larsen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rades-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rades 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rades-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rades 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wang-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-der-Linden-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van der Linden 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>A number of prognostic scoring systems are available:</P>
<P>The Global Spine Tumour Study Group, an international group of spine surgeons, recommends the use of the Tomita and the Tokuhashi scoring systems (<LINK REF="REF-Tokuhashi-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tokuhashi 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tokuhashi-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tokuhashi 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tomita-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tomita 2001</LINK>). The group have also initiated prospective data recording to refine a better score for surgical decision making (<LINK REF="REF-Choi-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Choi 2010</LINK>). For patients in whom radiotherapy is planned, prognostic scores can help to choose between long-course radiotherapy, short-course radiotherapy and supportive care (<LINK REF="REF-Rades-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rades 2010a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rades-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rades 2013</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-05-27 16:48:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Prathap  Tharyan">
<P>The original review identified six trials that randomised 544 adults with MESCC to different treatment regimens: short-course radiotherapy (16 Gy in two doses over a week) versus split-course radiotherapy (30 Gy in eight doses over two weeks); laminectomy followed by radiotherapy versus radiotherapy; decompressive surgery followed by radiotherapy versus conventional radiotherapy; and different doses of corticosteroids or no steroids in people undergoing radiotherapy for MESCC (<LINK REF="REF-George-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">George 2008</LINK>). The results showed equal benefit with short-course RT and the longer split courses of radiotherapy. There also was suggestive evidence for greater benefit with decompressive surgery and post-operative radiation over radiotherapy alone, though uncertainties remained about the specific patient subgroups that decompression surgery was best indicated in. The evidence also suggested that serious adverse events were less frequent with moderate-dose over high-dose steroids in people undergoing radiation for MESCC.<BR/>
</P>
<P>In this Cochrane review update we searched for additional trials evaluating the relative benefits and harms of surgery, radiotherapy, and corticosteroids. We incorporated the standard methods recommended for Cochrane Systematic Reviews (<LINK REF="REF-MECIR-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">MECIR 2011</LINK>) that includes more detailed 'risk of bias' assessments than were undertaken in the previous version of this review. We also summarised findings for comparisons using the GRADE approach (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2011</LINK>) that links the effect estimates for important outcomes with the overall confidence one can place in these estimates. As in the previous review, we noted, where reported, the prognostic factors that predicted survival and ambulatory outcomes, in order to discriminate between people who clearly benefit from combined modalities of treatment, those who do well with single modalities of treatment alone, and those with poor prognosis who should be spared complex or prolonged courses of treatment.</P>

<P>Three authors (RG, JJ, PT) independently assessed the risk of bias in the included trial reports. We assessed the standard six components: sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other biases. For each of these components we assigned a judgement regarding the risk of bias as 'high risk', 'low risk', or 'unclear risk' (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011a</LINK>). We attempted to contact the trial authors for clarifications if any of the six components were unclear or not stated in the report.

<P>We assessed heterogeneity between the trials by examining forest plots for inconsistency in the direction or magnitude of the effect estimates and non-overlapping confidence intervals. We used the Chi² test for heterogeneity with a 10% level of significance to detect inconsistency in study results that excluded random error, and the I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic to denote the percentage of inconsistency in results due to intertrial variability that exceeded random error (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). In general, we interpreted I<SUP>2</SUP> values of 50% or greater to denote significant heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>), though we acknowledged that this cut-off is arbitrary. We therefore interpreted I<SUP>2</SUP> values between 0% to 40% as possibly unimportant, 30% to 60% as possibly significant, 50% to 90% as possibly substantial, and 75% to 100% as possibly considerable; depending on whether the inconsistency in results was due to differences in the direction of effects estimates between trials, rather than due to differences in the magnitude of effects favouring an intervention; as well as the strength of the evidence for heterogeneity from the P value for the Chi² test for heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2011</LINK>).</P>

These tables provide information concerning the overall quality of the evidence from the trials, the magnitude of effect of the interventions examined, and the sum of available data on the primary outcome and selected secondary outcomes.The GRADE approach integrates evaluations regarding study limitations; unexplained inconsistency in the results; indirectness (how representative of clinical practice the populations studied were; the deviations from accepted practice in the way interventions and comparisons were given; the choice of outcomes as representative of those considered important to clinical decision making; and the methods used in assessing these outcomes); imprecision in the estimates (in terms of statistical significance as well as clinical importance); and the likelihood that publication bias affected the estimates.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Study design</HEADING>
<P>The seven trials were randomised parallel group trials with two intervention arms. Three were conducted before 1995 (<LINK REF="STD-Sorensen-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sorensen 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vecht-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Vecht 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Young-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Young 1980</LINK>); and the most recent trial was completed in 2007 (<LINK REF="STD-Maranzano-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Maranzano 2009</LINK>). One trial recruited participants over a period of 10 years (1992 to 2002) and was stopped early after recruiting 50% of the planned sample due to perceived benefit with one intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Patchell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Patchell 2005</LINK>). Another trial also had difficulty in recruiting sufficient participants over a three-year period (<LINK REF="STD-Graham-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Graham 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Three of the trials used stratified randomisation: <LINK REF="STD-Patchell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Patchell 2005</LINK> stratified participants by treating institution, tumour type, ambulatory status and relative stability of the spine; <LINK REF="STD-Sorensen-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sorensen 1994</LINK> stratified randomisation by primary tumour (breast or other cancers) and gait function (ambulant, non-ambulant); <LINK REF="STD-Vecht-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Vecht 1989</LINK> stratified for carcinoma versus reticular malignancy.</P>
<P>Two of the trials were powered to detect equivalence between interventions and achieved the required sample size and response rates within pre-set precision limits to demonstrate this (<LINK REF="STD-Maranzano-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Maranzano 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maranzano-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Maranzano 2009</LINK>). Only one included trial was registered in a clinical trials registry, and even this trial was retrospectively registered (<LINK REF="STD-Graham-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Graham 2006</LINK>). The duration of follow-up in the trials ranged from one week after treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Vecht-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Vecht 1989</LINK>); to nearly five years (<LINK REF="STD-Maranzano-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Maranzano 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maranzano-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Maranzano 2009</LINK>); with many trials following participants till death.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Sorensen-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sorensen 1994</LINK> was conducted in a single institution while the remainder were multi-institutional trials in the same country. None of the trials were conducted in low- or middle-income countries. Two trials were conducted in Italy (<LINK REF="STD-Maranzano-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Maranzano 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maranzano-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Maranzano 2009</LINK>); and two in the USA (<LINK REF="STD-Patchell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Patchell 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Young-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Young 1980</LINK>). The other trials were conducted in Australia (<LINK REF="STD-Graham-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Graham 2006</LINK>); Denmark (<LINK REF="STD-Sorensen-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sorensen 1994</LINK>); and the Netherlands (<LINK REF="STD-Vecht-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Vecht 1989</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>The seven trials randomised a total of 876 participants, 723 of whom were evaluable. The sample sizes of these trials ranged from 20 (<LINK REF="STD-Graham-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Graham 2006</LINK>); to 300 in <LINK REF="STD-Maranzano-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Maranzano 2005</LINK>; and 327 in <LINK REF="STD-Maranzano-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Maranzano 2009</LINK>. All trials recruited more males than females, except <LINK REF="STD-Sorensen-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sorensen 1994</LINK> that recruited more females (with the majority having primary breast malignancies). The age of participants in the trials ranged from 19 to 87 years.</P>
<P>The trials used different criteria to select participants with MESCC. All trials required the presence of a primary non-central nervous system tumour and the demonstration of cord compression by either MRI or CT (<LINK REF="STD-Graham-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Graham 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maranzano-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Maranzano 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maranzano-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Maranzano 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Patchell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Patchell 2005</LINK>), or by myelogram in the older studies (<LINK REF="STD-Sorensen-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sorensen 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vecht-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Vecht 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Young-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Young 1980</LINK>). Two trials specifically selected participants with a poor prognosis (life expectancy of six months or less, as defined by unfavourable histologies; or favourable histologies with poor performance status; or motor or sphincter dysfunction) (<LINK REF="STD-Maranzano-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Maranzano 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maranzano-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Maranzano 2009</LINK>). The two trials of surgical interventions selected participants with a better prognosis (<LINK REF="STD-Graham-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Graham 2006</LINK>; and particularly <LINK REF="STD-Patchell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Patchell 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The duration and rapidity of cord compression was not reported in any trial except <LINK REF="STD-Patchell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Patchell 2005</LINK>, where the onset of total paraplegia of less than 48 hours was an inclusion criterion. All trials except two reported the spinal level of cord compression (<LINK REF="STD-Vecht-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Vecht 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Young-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Young 1980</LINK>); the thoracic spine was the most commonly reported site of the compression in more than 50% of participants in these trials. Spinal instability was an exclusion criterion in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Maranzano-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Maranzano 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maranzano-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Maranzano 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sorensen-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sorensen 1994</LINK>); was a stratifying variable in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Patchell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Patchell 2005</LINK>); and was not reported in the other trials.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Maranzano-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Maranzano 2009</LINK>, in a multi-centre trial in Italy, randomised 327 adults with MESCC with no indications for primary surgery (diagnostic doubt, vertebral instability or bony impingement as the cause of cord compression, or previous radiotherapy of the same area) and an estimated survival of six months or less (due to unfavourable histologies; or, if the primary tumour histology was favourable, with motor or sphincter dysfunction, or poor performance status). Participants were randomised to a single dose of radiation (8 Gy) or to a short course of radiotherapy (8 Gy × 2; delivered as 8 Gy, 6 days' rest, and then 8 Gy to a total dose of 16 Gy in 1 week). Screening was actively done for early diagnosis of MESCC with MRI or CT in those with back pain or osteolysis, or a positive bone scan, even in the absence of neurological clinical signs of spinal cord compression. Radiotherapy (RT) was started within 24/48 hours of the radiologic diagnosis and was delivered by a 4 to 18 MV linear accelerator. Parenteral dexamethasone (8 mg twice daily) was administered from the first day of clinical-radiologic diagnosis until 4 to 5 days after the end of RT in both arms. Parenteral 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 receptor antagonists were also given to those in whom radiation included the upper abdomen (30% in each arm). Participants were assessed one month after the end of RT and the follow-up examination was continued once a month for one year, and four times per year until death. Of the 327 randomised, 303 (93%) were evaluable. The median follow-up was 36 months (range 4 to 58 months).</P>
<P>Of the 327 randomised, 134 (44%) had bone and visceral metastases (liver, lung, brain or a combination); 271 (89%) had back pain; 199 (65%) were able to walk pre-treatment (114 (37%) without support and 85 (28%) with support); 78 (26%) were non-ambulant; and 26 (9%) were paraplegic. Bladder dysfunction was present in 41 (14%) pre-treatment. In the 303 evaluable participants, 212 (70%) had unfavourable primary tumour histologies, and 91 (30%) had favourable primaries for response to RT. These baseline characteristics were similar in the intervention arms.<BR/>

<LINK REF="STD-Maranzano-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Maranzano 2005</LINK>, in an earlier multi-centre trial in Italy, randomised 300 participants with no indications for surgery and with a poor prognosis (as in <LINK REF="STD-Maranzano-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Maranzano 2009</LINK>) to receive eight fractions: "split-course regimen" (5 Gy x 3, 4 days rest; then 3 Gy x 5, to a total of 30 Gy in 2 weeks); or to two fractions: "short-course regimen" (8 Gy, 6-days rest, and then 8 Gy, to a total of 16 Gy in one week). RT was started within 24 hours of the radiologic diagnosis. The timing of intervention in relation to development of cord compression was not reported. Dexamethasone 8 mg twice daily was given to all participants and tapered after completion of RT. Parenteral 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 receptor antagonists were also given to those in whom radiation included the upper abdomen (60%). Here, too, assessments were done one month after the end of radiotherapy and follow-up examinations were continued once a month for one year, and four times per year until death. The median follow-up was 33 months (range: 4 to 61 months).</P>
<P>As in <LINK REF="STD-Maranzano-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Maranzano 2009</LINK>, in the majority (177 of 276 evaluable participants (64%)), the histology of the primary tumour was unfavourable, and 99 (36%) had favourable histological primary tumours.

<LINK REF="STD-Young-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Young 1980</LINK> was the first randomised trial in people with MESCC and was conducted in two centres in the United States of America (USA). Twenty-nine participants with haematologic and solid tumours, and a myelographic diagnosis of cord compression, were randomised to laminectomy and post-operative radiotherapy or radiotherapy alone. Participants were followed up till death, but the average duration of follow-up was not reported. Complete myelographic block (22/29) was significantly more common in the surgery group (15/16; 94%) than the RT group (7/13; 54%) and was a confounding factor that negatively influenced some outcomes.

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Patchell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Patchell 2005</LINK> was a randomised multicentric trial conducted in the USA. The trial recruited participants with an MRI diagnosis of a single area of MESCC, an expected survival of at least three months, and non-radiosensitive primaries. Participants should not have been paraplegic for greater than 48 hours. Over one third of participants had spinal instability or pathologic spine fractures. One hundred and one participants were randomised to surgical decompression and postoperative radiotherapy (with stabilisation if instability was present); or to radiotherapy alone, 30 Gy in 10 fractions. All patients were given high-dose dexamethasone 100 mg initially that was tapered until completion of radiotherapy. Ten patients from the radiotherapy arm crossed over to surgery because of deteriorating neurological status. After 10 years of recruitment, the study was stopped with 50% recruitment because results in the surgical arm were superior in an interim analysis with prespecified stopping rules.</P>

<P>All trials reported ambulation as a primary outcome but used different criteria to define ambulation. <LINK REF="STD-Patchell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Patchell 2005</LINK> reported a participant as ambulant if he or she was able to take at least two steps with each foot (four steps in total) either unassisted or with use of a cane or walker at completion of radiotherapy. <LINK REF="STD-Maranzano-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Maranzano 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Maranzano-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Maranzano 2009</LINK> used <LINK REF="REF-Tomita-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tomita 2001</LINK> grades for ambulation (group I &#8211; ability to walk without support; group II &#8211; ability to walk with support; group III &#8211; inability to walk; and group IV &#8211; paraplegic) where participants who were walking with or without support at one month were considered ambulant. The three corticosteroid studies measured ambulation in different ways and at different time points. <LINK REF="STD-Graham-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Graham 2006</LINK> used different definitions of ambulation within the trial but did not provide these definitions in the trial report; the report also noted variability in ambulatory outcomes depending on the definition used. <LINK REF="STD-Vecht-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Vecht 1989</LINK> used five grades of ambulation, with Grade I (walking independently) and Grade II (walking with support) used to denote good ambulation compared to Grade III (walking not possible but both legs can be lifted from the bed), Grade IV (lifting of legs not possible but muscle contraction is present in legs), and Grade V (absence of muscle contractions in legs). <LINK REF="STD-Young-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Young 1980</LINK> defined ambulation (in a similar manner to <LINK REF="STD-Patchell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Patchell 2005</LINK>) as the ability to take steps (number not specified) alone, even if a cane or walker was required.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Patchell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Patchell 2005</LINK> was prematurely terminated for apparent benefit after only 50% recruitment had been achieved. This is often considered a source of bias, since such truncated RCTs are associated with greater effect sizes than RCTs not stopped early, with this difference being greatest in smaller studies (particularly those that have fewer than 200 events), and independent of the presence of statistical stopping rules, even if they were pre-determined (<LINK REF="REF-Bassler-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bassler 2010</LINK>). However, following updated advice in <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011a</LINK> (Table 8.5b), we judged this trial as unclear for the risk of bias due to premature stopping.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.1 Single-fraction radiotherapy (8 Gy) versus a short course of radiotherapy (two fractions of 8 Gy)</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Maranzano-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Maranzano 2009</LINK> compared a single dose of radiotherapy (8 Gy) versus a short course of radiotherapy (8 Gy × 2, given as 8 Gy, 6 days rest, and then 8 Gy, to a total dose of 16 Gy over one week) in 327 randomised participants with poor prognosis, of whom 303 were evaluable. Parenteral dexamethasone (8 mg twice daily) was administered from the first day of clinical-radiologic diagnosis for 4 to 5 days. Follow-up was for a median duration of 31 months (range four to 58 months).</P>
<P>The trial was powered to demonstrate equivalence in the response rate one month after treatment with the two regimens. The response rate was separately evaluated for ambulatory status (maintaining or regaining ambulation), urinary continence (not requiring a catheter), and back pain (not requiring a narcotic). The sample size ensured an 80% probability to detect equivalence in these response rates with a two-sided precision of 15% if the response rate was similar and approximately 70%.</P>
<P>Since the data for this comparison comes from only a single study, we were not able to perform a meta-analysis for any of the outcomes assessed.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">1.1.1 Ambulation</HEADING>
<P>Overall ambulatory rates post-treatment were 65% with single-dose RT and 69% with short-course RT, and did not significantly differ (303 participants). Single-dose RT and short-course RT also did not differ significantly in the proportions who maintained ambulation (88% versus 90%; 199 participants), nor in the proportions who regained ambulation post-RT (16% versus 26%; 104 participants). The difference in ambulatory rates was within 15% (7% for overall ambulation; 2% for maintaining ambulation; and 10% for regaining ambulation), meeting pre-set criteria to demonstrate equivalence in enhancing ambulation with the two RT schedules.</P>
<P>
<B>1.1.2 Other outcomes</B>
</P>
<P>The median survival was four months in both intervention arms (excluding three early deaths and 21 lost to follow-up).</P>
<P>Reduction in analgesic or narcotic use was seen in both treatment arms (34% with single-dose RT and 40% with short-course RT) and did not significantly differ between the RT regimens (271 participants). The difference in response rate for pain of 6% was within the bounds pre-set to demonstrate equivalence.</P>
<P>Similar proportions (90% given single-dose RT versus 87% given short-course RT) had urinary continence after treatment (303 participants), with the difference of 3% again demonstrating equivalence in response with the two RT schedules .</P>
<P>Local recurrence was diagnosed by MRI in people with symptomatic progression in 4% of patients, at a median interval between the end of the first RT and diagnosis of 8 months (range two to 31 months). In-field recurrences were higher in the single-fraction arm (6% versus 3%), but the numbers with in-field recurrences were too few to rule out random error. Seven of the 13 with in-field recurrences were re-irradiated as decided by their treating clinicians and outside of the trial protocol. Those ambulant at the time of recurrence survived longer after irradiation compared to those non-ambulant; and maintained their ability to walk till the time of death. None who were non-ambulant at the time of recurrence regained ambulatory status after re-irradiation. Median survival after irradiation was six months (range: 1 to 13 months). None developed serious adverse events or radiation-induced myelopathy. In those re-irradiated, the cumulative BED Gy<SUB>2 </SUB>(Biologically Effective Dose with an &#945;/&#946; ratio of 2 Gy) did not exceed 120 Gy<SUB>2</SUB>.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">1.1.5. Subgroup analysis</HEADING>
<P>Although meta-analysis was not possible, and the planned subgroup analyses to investigate heterogeneity were not indicated, subgroup analyses in <LINK REF="STD-Maranzano-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Maranzano 2009</LINK> indicated that the duration of ambulation after treatment was influenced by tumour histology and was significantly longer with favourable histologies (median duration 11 months) than with unfavourable histologies (four months).</P>
<P>Survival was also associated with pre-treatment and post-treatment ambulatory status; median survival was five months and two months for pre-treatment ambulant and non-ambulant patients respectively, (P = 0.001); and six months and one month for post-treatment ambulant and no-ambulant patients respectively (P &lt; 0.001). The median survival was also influenced by tumour histology and was 9.5 months for favourable cancers and three months for unfavourable ones (P &lt; 0.001).</P>
<P>Ambulatory outcomes were also better in those ambulant pre-treatment, the majority of whom maintained ambulatory status (88% and 90% with single dose and two doses respectively), while only 16% and 28% of those non-ambulant pre-treatment regained ambulation with the two RT regimens.</P>
<P>Outcomes for those with and without visceral metastases were not available. Vertebral instability and bony impingement were exclusion criteria in this trial. All participants were detected to have MESCC after active screening by MRI or CT and the results of this trial pertain to those who are actively screened to enable an early diagnosis of cord compression and early RT within 24/48 hours after diagnosis.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Maranzano-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Maranzano 2005</LINK> was also powered to detect equivalence in response rates for the outcomes of ambulation, urinary continence and pain reduction based on narcotic use, using the same assumptions (80% power to detect equivalence in response rates with a precision of 15% if the response rates were roughly similar and around 70%) as described above in <LINK REF="STD-Maranzano-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Maranzano 2009</LINK>.</P>
<P>Data were from only one trial and we were unable to perform a meta-analysis for any outcome. The results are summarised below and there were no statistically significant differences between the two arms for any of the outcomes analysed.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">1.2.1 Ambulation</HEADING>
<P>Overall ambulatory rates were 70% for eight fractions versus 68% for two fractions and did not significantly differ (276 participants). There were no significant differences in the proportions who maintained ambulation (91% versus 89%; 184 participants), or who regained ambulation (28% versus 29%; 92 participants). The median duration of ambulation (excluding 17 early deaths) was 3.5 months in both arms. The difference in ambulatory rates with the two RT schedules were less than 15% (3% for overall ambulation and maintaining ambulation, and 1% for regaining ambulation), demonstrating equivalence in enhancing ambulation with split-course (eight fractions) and short-course (two fractions) radiotherapy.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">1.2.2 Other outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The median survival was four months in both intervention arms (excluding 17 early deaths).</P>
<P>The proportion of participants with reduction in the use of analgesics and narcotics was not significantly different (49% versus 38%; 262 participants); and the difference in response rates (9%) was within the pre-set limits to demonstrate equivalence in response rates between the split-course and short-course RT regimens.</P>
<P>The overall proportion of participants with urinary continence after treatment was also not significantly different (87% versus 90%; 275 participants) for split-course versus short-course RT, and the difference in urinary continence rates (3%) again demonstrated equivalence.</P>
<P>Local recurrence was diagnosed on MRI in 5/142 (4%) given the short-course RT regimen and none of 134 given the longer-course RT regimen, but this difference was not statistically significant given the small number of local recurrences. The five with recurrences were re-irradiated with different RT schedules at the discretion of their treating clinicians and outside the trial protocol. The two non-ambulant before irradiation continued to be non-ambulant till death (three and four months later) while the three ambulant maintained ambulation till death in two (one and seven months later) and at 20 months' follow-up in the third. Radiation-induced myelopathy was not detected in any of the five. In this trial, as in <LINK REF="STD-Maranzano-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Maranzano 2009</LINK>, the cumulative BED Gy<SUB>2 </SUB>did not exceed 120 Gy<SUB>2 </SUB>in those with in-field recurrences who were irradiated.</P>

<P>Data were from only a single trial but subgroup analyses in <LINK REF="STD-Maranzano-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Maranzano 2005</LINK> revealed that the duration of ambulation post-treatment was influenced by tumour histology (six months with favourable histologies and three months for unfavourable histologies). Survival was also significantly correlated with ambulant status. Median survival was five months for those ambulant pre-treatment and three months for those non-ambulant pre-treatment; median survival was five months for those ambulant after treatment and two months for those non-ambulant post-treatment. Median survival was also influenced by tumour histology and was significantly longer (six months) with favourable histologies compared to unfavourable histologies (three months).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Patchell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Patchell 2005</LINK> recruited 101 participants with an MRI diagnosis of a single area of MESCC, an expected survival of at least three months, and non-radiosensitive primaries. All had a duration of paraplegia less than 48 hours; and were immediately randomised to emergency surgical decompression and postoperative radiotherapy (with stabilisation if instability was present) or radiotherapy alone (30 Gy in 10 fractions). All patients were given high-dose dexamethasone, 100 mg, initially that was tapered by completion of radiotherapy.

Of them, 94% versus 74% previously ambulant patients maintained ambulation (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.57; 69 participants). Of those in the decompressive surgery followed by RT arm, 63% versus 19% given RT alone who were previously non-ambulant regained ambulation; (RR 3.33, 95% CI 1.12 to 9.90; 32 participants). The median duration of ambulation also significantly favoured surgical decompression (122 days versus 13 days; P = 0.003).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-05-28 05:01:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Prathap  Tharyan">
<P>Although metastatic extradural spinal cord compression (MESCC) is a common and distressing problem in many people with cancer, there is limited evidence from RCTs to inform optimal treatment. We found only seven eligible trials with a total of 876 (723 evaluable) participants that compared three different sets of comparisons in adults with MESCC: different radiotherapy schedules; surgery plus RT versus RT; and high-dose steroids versus moderate-dose steroids versus no steroids. Meta-analysis was not possible for most outcomes.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">1. Radiotherapy doses and schedules</HEADING>
<P>Radiotherapy (combined with corticosteroids) is the most widely used treatment for cord compression, and was part of the treatment protocol in all the seven trials reviewed. Only <LINK REF="STD-Maranzano-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Maranzano 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Maranzano-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Maranzano 2009</LINK> directly compared the effects of different radiotherapy fractionation schedules combined with steroids in people with MESCC with a poor prognosis.</P>
<P>These two Italian trials were powered to demonstrate equivalence and showed that in patients with MESCC with no indications for primary surgery and an estimated survival of six months or less, the short-term results were similar with a single dose of 8 Gray (Gy) to two fractions of 8 Gy given over a week (<I>moderate quality evidence</I>; <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>); as were two fractions of 8 Gy compared to eight fractions (30 Gy) of RT (<I>moderate quality evidence</I>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>). In both trials, those who were ambulant pre-treatment and who had favourable histologies were ambulant longer and survived longer post-treatment than those not ambulant pre-treatment or with unfavourable histologies.</P>
<P>With the three radiotherapy fractionation regimens, around 90% of ambulant patients maintained ambulation; around 3% had a documented overall in-field recurrence rate; median survival was four months; and toxicity was minimal. This suggests that shorter courses of radiotherapy are probably justified in patients with MESCC and a poor prognosis, who constitute a significant proportion of the MESCC population, particularly in many resource-constrained settings.</P>
<P>The incidence of in-&#64257;eld recurrences with single-dose RT was 6%. With two doses of RT recurrences ranged from 2.5% to 3.5% in the two trials where short-course RT was a comparator, and was 0% with eight doses. Though not statistically significant due to the small number of recurrences, these differences in recurrence rates suggest that people with an expected survival more than three to six months who decline, or are not suitable candidates for surgical interventions, should perhaps be offered courses longer than a single dose or even two doses of RT, if local tumour recurrence is to be delayed or averted. Further comparative studies with larger samples would be required to confirm this impression. Data from a prospective non-randomised study also suggests that local control is poorer (61% versus 81%) in those given short courses of RT (8 Gy or 20 Gy in five fractions) compared to longer courses of RT (37.7 Gy in 15 fractions or 40 Gy in 20 fractions) (<LINK REF="REF-Rades-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rades 2011a</LINK>). In those who develop recurrences, re-irradiation may be considered, particularly in those ambulant; while ensuring that the cumulative BED does not exceed 120Gy<SUB>2</SUB> in order to reduce the chances of developing radiation-induced myelopathy (<LINK REF="REF-Rades-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rades 2008</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
<P>The results in non-ambulant patients with the short-course (16 Gy in two fractions) or the split-course ( 30 Gy in eight fractions) RT regimens were similar to rates in reports from non-randomised prospective studies with 28% to 29% of non-ambulant patients regaining ambulation (<LINK REF="REF-Rades-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rades 2011a</LINK>). Though the results in non-ambulant participants in the comparison of short-course RT with a single dose of 8 Gy did not differ significantly, the smaller proportion regaining ambulation with a single dose (9/55; 16%) in <LINK REF="STD-Maranzano-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Maranzano 2009</LINK> is worrying. It is possible that the proportions that will regain ambulation with single-dose RT may be similar to that with a short course or with longer RT courses, since the 95% CI for this estimate in <LINK REF="STD-Maranzano-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Maranzano 2009</LINK> ranged from 9% to 29%. This would need confirmation in future trials; until which time, non-ambulant people with MESCC who are considered for RT could be offered two or more doses of treatment.</P>
<P>We did not find trials comparing different radiotherapy doses, schedules or techniques in people with MESCC and a good prognosis; and no conclusions can be drawn regarding the optimal radiotherapy dose or schedules in this population.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">2. Surgery plus radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Laminectomy followed by radiotherapy</HEADING>
<P>Data from <LINK REF="STD-Young-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Young 1980</LINK> comparing outcomes in 16 people with a single lesion, no prior RT and who were fit to undergo surgery indicate that ambulation and survival at four months and urinary continence one month after treatment may not differ significantly with the addition of laminectomy prior to RT compared to RT alone (<I>low quality evidence</I>; <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>). Laminectomy for a ventrally located tumour is undesirable as direct decompression of the cord through removal of the compressive element is not achieved. Moreover, removal of the laminae and posterior ligaments of the spine in the setting of vertebral body disease quite often further destabilises the spine (<LINK REF="REF-Klimo-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klimo 2005</LINK>). In two separate retrospective matched pair analyses of people with radiosensitive and radio-resistant tumours, outcomes with laminectomy were not different to radiation alone (<LINK REF="REF-Rades-2010b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rades 2010b</LINK>); or were poorer than with radiotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Rades-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rades 2011b</LINK>). Thus, though we are uncertain about the results of <LINK REF="STD-Young-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Young 1980</LINK>, they are indicative of the lack of benefit expected with laminectomy and RT without spinal stabilisation compared to RT alone in metastatic spine disease.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Direct decompressive surgical resection followed by radiotherapy</HEADING>
<P>Progress in spine surgery, particularly with regard to sophisticated instrumentation and ventral approaches through the neck, thorax and abdomen, provides an opportunity for direct decompression of the cord and stabilisation of the spine. In <LINK REF="STD-Patchell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Patchell 2005</LINK> surgery was undertaken by experienced teams and was tailored to the location of the compression: that is, a ventral approach was employed for vertebral body disease, a lateral approach for predominantly laterally located compression and a posterior approach when the posterior elements were primarily involved. When required the spines were fixed using bone grafts and instrumentation.</P>
<P>The results of <LINK REF="STD-Patchell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Patchell 2005</LINK> suggest that surgery may result in an incremental benefit of 27% in short-term ambulatory rates compared to RT, in selected people with MESCC. For those regaining ambulation this benefit may be as much as 43%. With ambulation as a primary endpoint, <LINK REF="STD-Patchell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Patchell 2005</LINK> reported that 63% of non-ambulant patients regained the ability to walk with surgery and radiotherapy as compared with only 19% in those receiving radiotherapy alone. Median survival was short in both treatment arms although statistically significantly longer in the surgery group versus radiotherapy alone. However, the overall quality of the evidence was graded as <I>low quality, </I>with full confidence in these estimates limited by the highly selected sample that was biased in favour of better outcomes in those undergoing decompression, and by the evidence for this intervention limited to one trial from a high-income country that was stopped prematurely for perceived benefit.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Patchell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Patchell 2005</LINK> acknowledges the restrictive selection criteria used in the trial and partly concedes that the results do not apply to the entire MESCC population. Subsequently the same group performed a secondary analysis of their data, stratifying patients into two groups based on age greater or less than 65. They concluded that patients over 65 years of age did not benefit from surgery, in terms of ambulation or survival (<LINK REF="REF-Chi-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chi 2009</LINK>). This conclusion is supported by <LINK REF="REF-Rades-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rades 2012</LINK>, an independent matched-pair analysis where data from 42 elderly people over 65 years of age from Europe offered surgery plus radiotherapy were retrospectively matched 1:2 to 84 people given radiotherapy alone for 10 potential prognostic factors and compared regarding motor function, local control, and survival. Additional matched-pair analyses were performed for the subgroups of patients receiving direct decompressive surgery plus stabilisation of involved vertebrae (N&#8201;=&#8201;81) and receiving laminectomy alone (N&#8201;=&#8201;45). <LINK REF="REF-Rades-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rades 2012</LINK> concluded that elderly people with MSCC did not benefit from surgery (decompressive surgery plus stabilisation or laminectomy) in addition to radiotherapy for functional outcomes, local control, or survival.</P>
<P>We feel that the case for the routine use of direct decompressive surgery in patients with good neurological function and stable spines is not established based on current evidence. We suggest that in a patient with localised cord compression, clinicians need to consider the following questions:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Are there prognostic features to suggest that the patient would have poor ambulatory outcomes with radiotherapy?</LI>
<LI>Will the patient survive long enough to benefit from major surgery?</LI>
</OL>
<P>In summary, the evidence from this review indicates that non-ambulant adults with MESCC below 65 years of age, with an onset of paraplegia less than 48 hours, a single site of compression, radio-resistant primary tumours, and an expected survival of more than three months, may benefit more from decompressive surgery followed by radiotherapy compared to radiotherapy alone. Radiotherapy alone may suffice for many ambulant patients with stable spines and radiosensitive tumours, while decompressive surgery followed by RT may be offered as first-line therapy in those ambulant patients with factors predicting a poor outcome with radiotherapy and with good predicted survivals.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">3. High dose corticosteroids versus no or moderate dose corticosteroids</HEADING>
<P>Although corticosteroids have been used in the treatment of MESCC for many years, we found only three small trials that were inadequately powered to determine clinical benefit and optimal dosage (<LINK REF="STD-Graham-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Graham 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sorensen-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sorensen 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vecht-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Vecht 1989</LINK>). No significant differences in ambulation, survival, and urinary continence, or for pain reduction were seen with high-dose steroids compared to moderate-dose or no steroids (<I>low quality evidence</I>). However, high-dose corticosteroids were associated with serious drug-related adverse effects (<I>moderate</I> <I>quality evidence</I>; <LINK REF="SOF-05" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 5</LINK>).</P>
<P>Considering the widespread clinical use of corticosteroids in MESCC, it is unlikely that a trial comparing corticosteroids to placebo will be undertaken in the future; but the serious adverse effects reported with high-dose steroids should be noted.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>One of our secondary objectives was to compare the adverse effects between different interventions but these were not always systematically recorded or graded. Serious adverse effects were infrequent in both arms of the <LINK REF="STD-Maranzano-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Maranzano 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Maranzano-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Maranzano 2009</LINK> studies evaluating radiotherapy schedules. <LINK REF="STD-Patchell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Patchell 2005</LINK> reported more adverse effects in patients who had preoperative rather than postoperative radiotherapy after surgical decompression. In the corticosteroid dose comparison trials, serious gastrointestinal, infectious and central nervous system adverse effects were reported in 15% to 22% of participants receiving high-dose corticosteroids.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Completeness</HEADING>
<P>We had planned to evaluate radiotherapy schedules, surgical interventions and adjunctive therapies. However, high-dose corticosteroids versus moderate-dose corticosteroids versus no corticosteroids was the only comparison for which there was more than one trial to allow meta-analysis. We did not find trials eligible for inclusion that evaluated corticosteroid doses intermediate between 16 mg to 20 mg and 96 mg to 100 mg, or that evaluated the optimal duration of steroid therapy. We also found no trials comparing different doses of radiotherapy in people with MESCC with a good prognosis; nor did we find trials evaluating the role of decompressive surgery in health care settings outside that in a high-income country. Trials evaluating newer treatment modalities such as minimally invasive surgical techniques, intensity modulated RT, and radiosurgery in MESCC were also not available for inclusion. The modern management of MESCC involves a variety of interventions, and a multidisciplinary approach; but trials that included education, rehabilitation, screening and supportive care as components of the interventions used were also lacking. Although we had not specified these in our search terms, our broad search strategy should have detected such RCTs.<BR/>
</P>
<P>We assessed different comparisons in a heterogeneous population of adult patients with MESCC. Many of the trials included here had small numbers of participants making it difficult to draw precise or firm conclusions. Nor can our conclusions apply to all subgroups: patients with haematologic tumours, post-RT recurrences, or paraplegia longer than 48 hours constituted a very small (or undeterminable) proportion of participants in the trials included in this review.</P>
<P>Clinically important outcomes such as patient-reported pain relief, satisfaction with treatment, and quality of life were not assessed in the included studies, and survival rates were not always adequately reported. Local recurrence was not reported in any of the trials apart from those evaluating different radiotherapy schedules. Not all reported data could be reliably used for analysis, for example when results are reported as medians, or as percentage probability of survival.</P>
<P>The body of evidence to date is therefore incomplete to fully answer questions of current clinical relevance to the optimal management of people with MESCC.<BR/>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Applicability</HEADING>
<P>Differences in inclusion criteria, and in the definition of ambulation used in the studies limit the applicability of the results of this review to clinical settings. Evidence for the superiority of surgical decompression over radiotherapy in <LINK REF="STD-Patchell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Patchell 2005</LINK>; and the equivalence of single dose over two doses in <LINK REF="STD-Maranzano-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Maranzano 2009</LINK> and of two doses and eight doses of radiotherapy in <LINK REF="STD-Maranzano-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Maranzano 2005</LINK> were from trials done in high-income countries. The early detection of MESCC and the early institution of interventions that were critical in achieving the high response rates seen in these trials may not always be possible in many resource-constrained settings,</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Differences in inclusion criteria</HEADING>
<P>Within the seven trials inclusion criteria varied and while <LINK REF="STD-Maranzano-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Maranzano 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Maranzano-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Maranzano 2009</LINK> recruited patients with a poor prognosis, <LINK REF="STD-Patchell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Patchell 2005</LINK> required an estimated survival of at least three months. <LINK REF="STD-Maranzano-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Maranzano 2005</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Maranzano-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Maranzano 2009</LINK> excluded patients with spinal instability but such patients comprised over a third of the <LINK REF="STD-Patchell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Patchell 2005</LINK> population. While <LINK REF="STD-Graham-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Graham 2006,</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Patchell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Patchell 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sorensen-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sorensen 1994</LINK> excluded radiosensitive tumours other trials included haematologic and germ cell tumours (<LINK REF="STD-Maranzano-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Maranzano 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maranzano-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Maranzano 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vecht-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Vecht 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Young-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Young 1980</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Patchell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Patchell 2005</LINK> also excluded patients with cauda equina lesions. These differences in inclusion criteria are likely to impact on the expected outcomes for interventions used in people with MESCC in clinical settings.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Differences in the definition of ambulation</HEADING>
<P>Although ambulation was the primary outcome in all seven trials, there were differences in the definition of ambulation. <LINK REF="STD-Patchell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Patchell 2005</LINK> reported a participant as ambulant if he or she was able to take at least two steps with each foot (four steps in total) either unassisted or with use of a cane or walker at completion of radiotherapy. In <LINK REF="STD-Maranzano-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Maranzano 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Maranzano-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Maranzano 2009</LINK>, participants who were walking with or without support at one month were considered ambulant, but this was not quantified. The three corticosteroid studies measured ambulation at different time points and in different ways. It is important that ambulation be defined in a manner that is uniform, meaningful and worthwhile, for patients considering the intervention.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Surgical decompression versus external radiotherapy</HEADING>
<P>The assertion by <LINK REF="STD-Patchell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Patchell 2005</LINK> that, "However, the results of our trial do not lend support to the use of radiation alone as first-line treatment"; and the concluding remarks, "..the best treatment for spinal cord compression caused by metastatic cancer is surgery as initial treatment followed by radiotherapy," are important to address from a clinical decision-making perspective. A cost effectiveness analysis from this group also supported this assertion (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 1996</LINK>). Another cost-utility analysis suggested that adopting surgery plus RT as standard for patients with MSCC would result in improved outcome but would increase health care costs (<LINK REF="REF-Furlan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furlan 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are a number of reasons why surgery may not uniformly offer the best option as first line treatment in people with MESCC. They include the potential selection bias favouring better outcomes with decompressive surgery in <LINK REF="STD-Patchell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Patchell 2005</LINK>; the applicability of the results of this trial to resource-constrained settings; and the potential biases arising from the premature termination of the trial. The overall quality of the evidence for ambulatory and survival outcomes for which comparative data were available was rated as of <I>low quality (</I>
<LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>
<I>). </I>
</P>
<P>One reason for our lack of confidence in the reported effect estimates translating to real world settings was the bias in the trial in the selection of participants. <LINK REF="STD-Patchell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Patchell 2005</LINK> selected patients who were good candidates for surgery and excluded participants who were good candidates for radiotherapy (those with radiosensitive tumours). Most common carcinomas in adults are (moderately) radiosensitive. Radio-resistant tumours like melanomas and osteogenic/soft tissue sarcomas are uncommon. Some highly radio-sensitive tumours such as hematologic, round cell or germ cell tumours are generally treated with chemotherapy. However, as also noted by <LINK REF="REF-Sciubba-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sciubba 2010</LINK>, other radiosensitive tumours such as small cell lung carcinoma were excluded from both RT and surgical groups in <LINK REF="STD-Patchell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Patchell 2005</LINK>. Moreover, 18/51 patients (35%) given RT had unstable spines, precluding them from being mobilised early; and the secondary effects of non-ambulation were significantly associated with 30-day morbidity and mortality (due to infections and deep vein thrombosis etc) in the trial. Only 45% of those treated with RT maintained or regained ambulation compared to 75% treated with surgery and RT. This contrasts with the 66% to 70% ambulatory rates seen in clinical practice (<LINK REF="REF-Maranzano-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maranzano 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rades-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rades 2010a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rades-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rades 2011b</LINK>), and in trials after RT alone (<LINK REF="STD-Maranzano-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Maranzano 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maranzano-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Maranzano 2009</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Patchell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Patchell 2005</LINK> did not provide the results in patients with unstable spines treated with radiotherapy alone, but unstable spines were a predictor for poor outcome in the study population as a whole. Twenty per cent of ambulant patients randomised to the radiotherapy arm crossed over to surgery on the occurrence of neurological deterioration and lost the ability to walk. Thirty per cent of them regained the ability to walk, but the complication rate was higher in this group. <LINK REF="STD-Patchell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Patchell 2005</LINK> therefore justified the use of surgery as the first line of therapy even in ambulant patients. However, the selection criteria appear to have biased the results in <LINK REF="STD-Patchell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Patchell 2005</LINK> against radiotherapy. It also took 10 years in <LINK REF="STD-Patchell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Patchell 2005</LINK> to recruit 50% of their estimated sample size, adding support to the contention that those selected for this trial represent only a fraction (probably around 15%) of those with MESCC seen in clinical practice, and do not represent the usual candidates given RT for MESCC (<LINK REF="REF-Maranzano-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maranzano 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rades-2010b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rades 2010b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rades-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rades 2011b</LINK>), since radiotherapy does not relieve compressions caused by bone fragments; nor does it correct deformities such as vertebral collapse (<LINK REF="REF-Wise-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wise 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klimo-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klimo 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The secondary analysis of data from <LINK REF="STD-Patchell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Patchell 2005</LINK> revealed that patients over 65 years of age did not benefit from surgery, compared to younger patients, for ambulation or survival (<LINK REF="REF-Chi-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chi 2009</LINK>). This observation was supported by the matched-pair analysis in <LINK REF="REF-Rades-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rades 2012</LINK>. In two other retrospective matched-pair analyses from Europe that currently constitute the largest available database of malignant spinal cord compression, <LINK REF="REF-Rades-2010b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rades 2010b</LINK> first demonstrated in 324 patients with MESCC from a variety of tumour types, who were matched on 11 prognostic variables, that surgery (decompressive surgery plus vertebral stabilisation and laminectomy) followed by RT did not significantly differ from RT alone in the proportions who maintained or regained ambulation; or for local control, or survival. <LINK REF="REF-Rades-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rades 2011b</LINK> further evaluated outcomes with surgery followed by RT (N = 67) and RT alone (N = 134) in a retrospective matched-pair analysis of people with MESCC with an unfavourable primary tumour (non-small cell lung cancers, cancer of unknown primary, renal cell carcinoma and colorectal cancer), and concluded that decompressive surgery plus RT (but not laminectomy) improved ambulation compared to RT alone, especially if the interval between surgery and RT did not exceed two weeks. These observations add to the body of evidence indicating that decompressive surgery followed immediately by radiotherapy primarily benefits people with MESCC with poor prognostic factors for RT. Both studies called for further adequately powered definitive RCTs to evaluate the role of surgical decompression in people with MESCC representative of those usually seen in clinical practice (<LINK REF="REF-Rades-2010b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rades 2010b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rades-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rades 2011b</LINK>).</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Patchell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Patchell 2005</LINK>, emergency surgery was offered within 24 hours of the diagnosis of cord compression and within 48 hours of onset of paraplegia and within two weeks of the onset of symptoms in the majority. RT was also offered as an emergency treatment. These may not be feasible for all people with MESCC in many healthcare settings outside a clinical trial, and particularly in resource-poor settings. The effect estimates in <LINK REF="STD-Patchell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Patchell 2005</LINK> are therefore not likely to reflect the effects achievable in practice in many parts of the world, if surgery were to be routinely offered as first-line treatment for people with MESCC. The results of the <LINK REF="REF-Rades-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rades 2011b</LINK> matched-pair analysis of people with unfavourable primaries indicate that optimal outcomes with decompressive surgery also depend on RT being given within two weeks of decompressive surgery, as was done in <LINK REF="STD-Patchell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Patchell 2005</LINK>. Delays in offering RT within this time period may also occur in different parts of the world, due to resource constraints, delays in referral, and due to post-operative complications (as was seen in 53% of 17 patients with RT delayed beyond two weeks after surgery in <LINK REF="REF-Rades-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rades 2011b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Another reason that limited our confidence in the results of <LINK REF="STD-Patchell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Patchell 2005</LINK> was that this trial was stopped early for apparent benefit after recruiting only 50% of the estimated sample. Truncated RCTs are at high risk of over-estimating benefits (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2012</LINK>), particularly when the total number of events are less than 500, and even more so when events number less than 200 (<LINK REF="REF-Bassler-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bassler 2010</LINK>). The evidence in favour of surgery as a potential first-line treatment in MESCC comes from only one RCT with 101 participants. It is also likely that the premature termination of this trial due to apparent benefit prevented the conduct of more definitive trials, since it would have been considered unethical to do so (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Finally, circumferential decompression or combined (anterior, posterior, and lateral) approaches are only feasible in healthier patients and are not feasible for the majority of patients with MESCC who often have numerous comorbid conditions precluding such aggressive interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Molina-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Molina 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Current evidence suggests that decompressive surgery with external fixation, if needed, is indicated in people (younger than 65 years) with MESC who are expected to live for three months or more, are medically fit for surgery, have spinal instability or bony impingement and a recent onset of paraplegia; or who have tumours not sensitive to radiation; and particularly when RT can be offered within two weeks of surgery. Evidence of moderate or high quality is currently lacking to recommend the routine use of decompressive surgery for all people with MESCC. The optimal dose, schedules and duration of post-operative RT are currently unclear.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">General implications</HEADING>
<P>Early detection and institution of treatment are crucial. Patients and clinicians should be educated about the symptoms of spinal cord compression, and patients should ideally be assessed by a multidisciplinary team, with treatment decisions taking into account the neurologic status, age and estimated survival. Prognostic scores for survival and spinal instability are available.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Radiotherapy</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Radiotherapy is an essential component of treatment in adults with MESCC. Radiotherapy could be considered as the primary treatment for ambulant people with MESCC and stable spines and for those who do not meet the criteria for decompressive surgery listed below.</LI>
<LI>Short courses of radiotherapy (one to two fractions) could be considered for people with MESCC with a predicted survival of less than three to six months, particularly if they are ambulant, and have radio-sensitive tumours. Evidence from this review indicates that non-ambulant patients have only a 16% chance of regaining ambulation with a single dose of radiotherapy and 29% with short courses of radiotherapy.</LI>
<LI>Since short courses of radiotherapy (8 Gy to 16 Gy in one or two fractions) may be associated with a higher risk of local recurrence than longer courses (8 fractions; 30 Gy) or more, patients with a good prognosis could be considered for longer courses of radiotherapy. In people with MESCC who only have a short time to live, the benefits with the shorter courses may be important.</LI>
<LI>The optimum dose and fractionation for RT in people with MESCC who have a good prognosis is currently uncertain.</LI>
<LI>Since the overall GRADE quality of evidence for the efficacy and safety outcomes with different radiation doses was only of <I>moderate</I> <I>quality</I> (and <I>low quality</I> for local recurrence), it is possible that future research may impact on our confidence in the estimates of effect, and alter these estimates and the implications for practice.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Decompressive surgery</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Decompressive surgery could be considered in people younger than 65 years with MESCC, who are fit to undergo surgery, have lost motor function for less than 48 hours, have localised cord compression, unfavourable histologies, and an estimated survival of greater than three months.</LI>
<LI>Decompressive surgery could also be considered in ambulant patients with poor prognostic factors for radiotherapy (e.g. spinal instability, bony compression, rapidly progressive neurologic deficits, tumours not sensitive to radiation), provided good prognostic factors for survival are present.</LI>
<LI>Decompressive surgery should ideally be followed immediately by postoperative radiotherapy for optimal ambulatory and survival outcomes. Postoperative RT was instituted within two weeks after surgery in the trial in this review and the evidence from another observational study also indicates that optimal outcomes with decompressive surgery depend on RT being given within two weeks of decompressive surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Rades-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rades 2011b</LINK>). The optimal fractionation schedules and dose for postoperative RT are uncertain.</LI>
<LI>Since the overall GRADE quality of evidence for all outcomes with decompressive surgery was of <I>low quality</I>, it is likely that future research could affect the implications for practice.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Corticosteroids</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>High doses of corticosteroids (96 mg to 100 mg dexamethasone) carry a significant risk of serious adverse effects.</LI>
<LI>It is uncertain if they offer any additional benefit over moderate doses of steroids (16 mg to 32 mg of dexamethasone) or no steroids.</LI>
<LI>The optimal dose and duration of corticosteroid treatment to be given with radiation or decompressive surgery is currently unclear.</LI>
<LI>The overall GRADE quality of evidence was <I>moderate</I> for the risk of serious adverse effects and <I>low</I> for all other outcomes; hence it is possible that future research may affect the implications for practice.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-08-13 13:00:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anna Hobson">
<P>The two ongoing trials (<LINK REF="STD-ISRCTN97555949" TYPE="STUDY">ISRCTN97555949</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NCT00968643" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00968643</LINK>), when completed and reported, will provide more data to help clarify the effects of different short RT regimens in people with MESCC not selected for having a poor prognosis. The first, being conducted in the UK, is comparing a single fraction of 8 Gy to 20 Gy in five fractions (<LINK REF="STD-ISRCTN97555949" TYPE="STUDY">ISRCTN97555949</LINK>; SCORAD). The second, underway in Ireland, is comparing a single fraction of 10 Gy to 20 Gy in five fractions (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00968643" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00968643</LINK>; IRCOG).</P>
<P>Adequately powered, multinational RCTs are needed to:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>define appropriate radiotherapy schedules for good-prognosis patients with MESCC (if deemed necessary after the results of the ongoing trials are included in an update of this review);</LI>
<LI>clarify the role of decompressive surgery in different prognostic groups and health care settings;</LI>
<LI>determine the optimal radiotherapy dose and fractionation regimens after surgical interventions;</LI>
<LI>determine the optimal dosage and duration of corticosteroids. (If future studies comparing different doses of corticosteroids are conducted, they should be adequately powered to ascertain the balance between benefits and adverse effects with different doses of corticosteroids, but should also optimally select patients for their suitability for RT or decompressive surgical interventions as the primary treatment modalities);</LI>
<LI>determine the efficacy and safety of minimally invasive surgical techniques, intensity modulated RT, and radiosurgery in the primary treatment of MESCC; and in those with local recurrences.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Trials should report results in accordance with the <LINK REF="REF-CONSORT-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">CONSORT 2010</LINK> guidelines. Various prognostic scales are currently available; and stratification by prognostic factors is important in future RCTs comparing different interventions. These trials would need to be adequately powered to detect differences between subgroups. Where appropriate, outcomes and endpoints should be patient- and caregiver-defined.</P>
<P>Additionally, there is need for both qualitative and quantitative research into education, rehabilitation, screening and supportive care for patients with MESCC.</P>

<P>We updated the background section to incorporate important developments published since the 2008 review was published.</P>
<P>We amended the following sections in the methods: <LINK TAG="QUALITY_ASSESSMENT" TYPE="SECTION">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</LINK>; <LINK TAG="UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS" TYPE="SECTION">Unit of analysis issues</LINK>; <LINK TAG="MISSING_DATA" TYPE="SECTION">Dealing with missing data</LINK>; <LINK TAG="HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT" TYPE="SECTION">Assessment of heterogeneity</LINK>; <LINK TAG="BIAS_ASSESSMENT" TYPE="SECTION">Assessment of reporting biases</LINK>, to reflect the current standards for Cochrane Reviews (<LINK REF="REF-MECIR-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">MECIR 2011</LINK>). We generated 'Risk of bias' for the included studies in this review update using the methods described in <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011a</LINK>.</P>
<P>Following recommendations from the editorial group, we removed analyses from single studies presented in the 2008 review and summarised the overall findings from single studies, without effect estimates, in the text of the results section. PaPaS suggests that meta-analysis is only considered when there are at least two studies with at least 200 total participants. Following editorial suggestions, we retained meta-analysis for only two outcomes for the comparison of 'high dose versus moderate dose or no steroids'.</P>
<P>We used GRADE profiler (<LINK REF="REF-GRADE-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADE 2004</LINK>) and interpreted the evidence for each important and critically important outcome for the comparisons in the included trials using the GRADE approach to create 'Summary of findings' tables for each comparison (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2011</LINK>). We selected outcomes to include in these tables through discussion before evaluating the search results. We described in our methods section the GRADE approach to assessing overall study quality, and the meaning of each grade of quality.</P>
<P>Compared to the 2008 review, this update includes one new study with 303 additional participants, and an additional comparison (single-dose versus short-course radiotherapy). This update also has data for one additional secondary outcome (local recurrence) for the new comparison and for one other existing comparison. This update includes a more detailed discussion section than in the 2008 review. Finally, this update also contains 'Summary of findings' tables for five comparisons that link the effect estimates for key outcomes with the confidence one can place in these estimates. These have altered the conclusions as detailed in the results, discussion and conclusions.</P>

<LI>This study was powered for equivalence: 270 patients (approximately 135 in each arm) were estimated as needed to "ensure an 80% probability (power) that the two-sided 95% CI for the difference in response rates would be within the interval 15% to 15% if the two response rates were in fact equal and approximately 70%." In addition, assuming a dropout rate of 10% of patients, a &#64257;nal accrual of 300 patients was planned</LI>
<LI>The authors' analysis excluded 8% of participants (seven lost to follow-up and seventeen deaths that occurred within the first 10 days). Intention-to-treat analysis was used for survival outcome and did not differ from completer analysis</LI>
<LI>Characteristics of participants who benefit from treatment: favourable histology; pre-and post-treatment ambulatory status</LI>
<LI>All assessment were done 1 month after the end of RT and the follow-up examination was continued once a month for 1 year, and four times per year until death. Median follow-up was 33 months (range, 4 to 61 months).</LI>

<P>Quote from report: "327 patients entered the trial, of which 303 (93%) are assessable (150 in arm A, i.e., 8 Gy 2, and 153 in arm B, i.e., 8 Gy). Twenty-four patients are not assessable because they lost to follow-up (21 cases, of whom 11 in arm A and 10 in arm B) or for early death (3 cases, of whom 2 died of myocardial infarction 8 and 14 days after the start of RT, respectively, and the other one died of ictus 9 days after the start of RT)".</P>

<SUP>1</SUP> Data from <LINK REF="STD-Patchell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Patchell 2005</LINK>: surgery - direct circumferential decompression with or without stabilisation within 24 hours of randomisation; Radiotherapy- 3 Gy x 10, starting within 24 hours after randomisation (in most), or within 14 days of surgery. All patients were given 100 mg dexamethasone immediately at diagnosis, then 24 mg every 6 hours until the start of radiotherapy or surgery, after which steroids were then reduced and continued until completion of radiotherapy.<BR/>
<SUP>2</SUP> Serious indirectness: this trial selected patients who were good candidates for surgery and excluded participants with radiosensitive tumours; 18 patients given RT had unstable spines. These biased the results against radiotherapy and the participants given RT were not representative of the usual candidates for RT. Emergency surgery was offered within 24 hours of the diagnosis of cord compression, within 48 hours of onset of paraplegia and within two weeks of the onset of symptoms in most. RT was also offered as an emergency. These may not be feasible outside a clinical trial setting and in healthcare systems in resource poor countries. Downgraded 1 level.<BR/>
<SUP>3</SUP> Serious imprecision. This trial was stopped early for apparent benefit after recruiting only 50% of the estimates sample. Truncated RCTs are at risk of over-estimating benefits (<LINK REF="REF-Bassler-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bassler 2010</LINK>). The evidence in favour of surgery comes from only one trial with 101 participants, and the sample size is smaller than the optimal information size. Downgraded 1 level.</P>
