<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-11-11 19:32:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Weight gain is thought to be a side effect of birth control methods. Many women and healthcare providers believe that pills and patches cause weight gain. Concern about weight gain can limit the use of these effective birth control methods. Fear of weight gain keeps some women from starting the pill or patch. Women may stop using the pill because they think it caused weight gain. This review looked at trials of birth control pills or patches where the woman's weight was measured.</P>
<P>In November 2013, we did a computer search for studies of pills or patches containing two types of hormones. For the initial review, we also wrote to researchers and manufacturers to find other trials. We included randomized trials in the English language if they had at least three treatment cycles. The studies also had to compare two types of birth control methods or one type with a 'dummy' method.</P>
<P>We found 49 trials. These trials compared 52 different pairs of birth control methods, or a birth control method and a 'dummy' method. The four trials with a dummy or no method group did not show that these pills or patches led to weight change. Most studies of different birth control methods showed no large weight difference. Also, women did not stop using the pill or patch because of weight change. The evidence was not strong enough to be sure that these methods did not cause some weight change. However, we found no major effect on weight. To look at the link between these birth control methods and weight change, studies should have a 'dummy' method or a group not using hormones. Having that type of control group would help remove other factors, such as weight change over time.</P>

The four trials with a placebo or no intervention group did not find evidence supporting a causal association between combination oral contraceptives or a combination skin patch and weight change. Most comparisons of different combination contraceptives showed no substantial difference in weight. In addition, discontinuation of combination contraceptives because of weight change did not differ between groups where this was studied.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2014-01-02 15:35:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-08-09 03:37:26 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Weight gain is often considered a side effect of using combination contraceptives (that is, an estrogen plus a progestin) (<LINK REF="REF-IOM-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">IOM 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nelson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 2007</LINK>), and many women and clinicians believe that an association exists. Almost three-quarters of women in a random survey conducted in the United Kingdom reported believing that weight gain was related to oral contraceptive use (<LINK REF="REF-Turner-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 1994</LINK>). In a Canadian survey of women filling an oral contraceptive (OC) prescription (<LINK REF="REF-Gaudet-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gaudet 2004</LINK>), 68% had counseling from their physician on weight gain and the pill. Of those who had counseling, 36% said their weight would stay the same while on the pill compared to 50% of those who had no counseling. In the United States, 45% of adolescents starting OC use believed that oral contraceptive use increased the risk of weight gain (<LINK REF="REF-Emans-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emans 1987</LINK>). Also, in a large German convenience sample, about 27% of ever users reported gaining weight from oral contraceptive use (<LINK REF="REF-Oddens-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oddens 1999</LINK>). In a representative sample of 3600 females in France, aged 15 to 45 years, 1665 were taking OCs (<LINK REF="REF-Le-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Le 2003</LINK>). Of these women using the pill, 30% claimed to have gained weight on their most recent pill.</P>
<P>Concern about weight gain can deter the initiation of combination contraceptives and cause early discontinuation among users. Weight gain was the most frequently cited reason for oral contraceptive discontinuation in a national study of adult women in the United States (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenberg-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenberg 1998</LINK>). A second survey found that about 20% of women claimed that weight gain was a reason for oral contraceptive discontinuation or failure to initiate use (<LINK REF="REF-Wysocki-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wysocki 2000</LINK>). In a convenience sample of oral contraceptive users in five European nations, women who reported weight gain had a relative risk of 1.4 (95% CI 1.2 to 1.6) of method discontinuation before two years of use compared to those who did not report a gain in weight (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenberg-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenberg 1995</LINK>). Furthermore, even the perception of weight gain can lead to contraceptive discontinuation. A United States study found that women who stopped using OCs were more likely to report weight gain than those who continued using the method, even with no significant difference in measured weight gain between the two groups (<LINK REF="REF-Emans-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emans 1987</LINK>). Thus, concern about weight gain limits the use of a highly effective method of contraception.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, a causal relationship between combination contraceptives and weight gain has not been established. Several mechanisms by which combination contraceptives could lead to weight gain have been hypothesized. In general, weight gain is due to an increase in one or more factors of fluid retention, muscle mass, and fat deposition. Fluid retention could be induced by the mineralocorticoid activity that occurs when ethinyl estradiol, the estrogen in combination oral contraceptives, enters the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (<LINK REF="REF-Corvol-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corvol 1983</LINK>). Estrogen has been associated with increased subcutaneous fat, especially in the breasts, hips, and thighs (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 2007</LINK>). The anabolic properties of combination contraceptives could result in increased food intake through a physiological effect on satiety and appetite. Androgens may stimulate nitrogen retention and increase muscle mass, although it is unlikely that oral contraceptives would cause such weight gain (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>The possible causal association between combination contraceptives and weight gain is difficult to study for several reasons. During adolescence, some weight gain is developmentally normal and appropriate. Also, women tend to gain weight over time (<LINK REF="REF-Flegal-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flegal 2000</LINK>). A contemporaneous control group is needed, but a randomized controlled trial comparing a combination contraceptive method with a placebo or non-hormonal method for contraception raises ethical issues. Few such studies have been conducted. Comparing combination contraceptive products is complicated by the variety of formulations and regimens. In addition, most combination contraceptive studies have been of short duration (that is, six cycles or fewer); more time might be required for the weight gain to become evident. Finally, no consensus exists regarding what constitutes excessive weight gain. Ideally, studies would set an a priori definition of clinically important weight gain, but this is rarely specified, perhaps because weight change is not a primary outcome in most comparison trials of combination contraception. Most studies that present a dichotomous classification for weight gain selected either 2.0 or 2.3 kilograms as the cut point; however, the justification for this decision is not apparent. Even if clinically important weight gain was well specified, any gain in weight could still be relevant since the mere perception of weight gain is associated with discontinuation of oral contraception.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The aim of the review was to evaluate the potential association between combination contraceptive use and changes in weight. The primary hypothesis was that combination contraceptives do not result in weight changes greater than that of a placebo. The secondary hypothesis was that different formulations and regimens of combination contraceptives are not associated with differences in weight changes.</P>

<P>The abstracted data were entered into RevMan and were double-checked by a second author. The analysis depended on the data available. For the mean change in weight between baseline and post-treatment measurements, the mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated using a fixed-effect model. Alternatively, the Peto odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI was calculated using the proportion of women who gained or lost more than a specified amount of weight.</P>
<P>Significant weight change could be considered a negative side effect of contraceptive use. We used a consistent direction for the graph labels even though the outcomes differed. Therefore, the intervention &#8216;favors treatment&#8217; if the change is greater in the control group.

<P>The validity of trials was critically appraised by assessing potential biases; however, summary quality scores were not calculated since the available evidence does not support their use (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2011-08-09 03:46:37 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite some trials reporting weight change data for multiple cycles, only one weight change measure was abstracted for each intervention group. We chose the cycle 12, cycle 6, or last treatment cycle data (in this order of preference) to facilitate comparisons between trials. For trials that included more than two interventions, comparisons were made between the control group and the other groups. If the authors did not identify a control group, all possible combinations were included in the review. We did not use any technique to control for multiple testing.</P>
<P>Significance testing has been criticized for forcing the decision to recognize a difference between two interventions to rest on an arbitrary alpha-level. Rather than determine differences solely based on a dichotomous classification of the P value, analyses using interval estimation consider both the location of the point estimate and the spread of the CI (<LINK REF="REF-Rothman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rothman 1998</LINK>). While this process introduces more subjectivity, borderline 'statistically significant' results are not overlooked and clinically insignificant results are not ascribed undue importance. Although interval estimation is a preferable method, given the reliance on significance testing, we presented results based on both considerations.</P>

<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2011-08-09 03:48:07 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For the initial review, we wrote to the authors of 94 trials that either did not report weight data or reported insufficient details. At that point we revised and broadened the search strategy and decided that continuing to contact the authors of trials that appeared to be eligible except for a lack of weight data was no longer feasible. The 14 trials with additional, unpublished data supplied by the authors contacted before the protocol change were included in the present review.</P>
<P>Since point estimates that are not accompanied by a measure of sampling variation have limited interpretation, trial reports that did not include the standard error, standard deviation, or CI for the mean change in weight were not included in the review. For trials that did not report the denominators used to calculate the mean weight difference, or the percentage of women experiencing weight change, we estimated these numbers based on denominators used for other outcomes or the number of women who completed the trial.</P>

<P>The initial search strategy in 2002 yielded 570 reports of randomized controlled trials that compared a combination contraceptive to a placebo or to another combination contraceptive. Of those, 476 articles were not eligible for inclusion due to a study length less than three treatment cycles in duration or a lack of reported weight change. An additional 53 articles with weight data were excluded since they lacked an estimate of the sampling variability for the mean difference in weight. The 41 eligible articles, including the 14 articles with additional unpublished data from the authors, reported on 44 trials. One article (<LINK REF="STD-Oelkers-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Oelkers 2000</LINK>) described two trials, and two articles (<LINK REF="STD-Coney-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Coney 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaunitz-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kaunitz 2000</LINK>) each reported pooled results from two eligible trials with similar or identical protocols.

The proportions of women who discontinued due to weight changes were small (zero to 5%) and did not differ between the study groups. <LINK REF="STD-Sang-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sang 1995</LINK> included the mean weight gain for the women who cited weight gain as the primary or secondary reason for early discontinuation. In the group with injectable medroxyprogesterone acetate 25 mg and estradiol cypionate 5 mg, the 18 women who attributed weight gain to the contraceptive had a mean gain of 2.8 kg compared to 3.1 kg for the 16 women in the group assigned to the injectable norethisterone enanthate 50 mg and estradiol valerate 5 mg (<LINK REF="STD-Sang-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sang 1995</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-12-23 19:05:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The four trials that included a placebo group or 'no intervention' group (<LINK REF="STD-Coney-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Coney 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goldzieher-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Goldzieher 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Procter_x002d_Gray-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Procter-Gray 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sibai-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sibai 2001</LINK>) did not find evidence supporting the putative association between combination contraceptive use and weight change. The lack of an association in those trials could be due to the limited number of contraceptives evaluated. <LINK REF="STD-Goldzieher-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Goldzieher 1971</LINK>, conducted more than three decades ago, studied three high-estrogen dose oral contraceptives. <LINK REF="STD-Coney-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Coney 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Procter_x002d_Gray-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Procter-Gray 2008</LINK> evaluated one oral contraceptive each. <LINK REF="STD-Sibai-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sibai 2001</LINK> studied one skin patch. Given the numerous combination contraceptive drugs, doses, and regimens, the possibility that one or more combination contraceptives could cause weight change cannot be eliminated with the data from the four placebo-controlled randomized trials conducted to date.</P>
<P>Of the 79 weight change comparisons evaluating two combination contraceptives, seven showed a difference in the mean weight change or the proportion of women gaining or losing more than a set amount of weight. Even if no association existed between combination contraceptives and weight, one would expect several significant results (Type I errors) since numerous comparisons were made. Regardless of statistical significance, the clinical significance seems negligible. The point estimates for the mean difference in weight between the comparison groups were small. The largest notable difference was 1.80 kg (95% CI -0.73 to 4.33) after 12 treatment cycles (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2001</LINK>). The ORs for the proportions of women who gained or lost more than a set amount were generally either weak or too imprecise to convey much meaning. The CI from <LINK REF="STD-Oelkers-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Oelkers 1995</LINK> was very wide since no one in the levonorgestrel and EE group lost more than the specified 2 kg.</P>
<P>If a mechanism for weight gain were estrogen-dependent, two contraceptives containing the same progestin and estrogen types but different hormone doses might show more weight gain with the higher-estrogen contraceptive. In this review, 11 of the 51 comparison pairs included two oral contraceptives with identical progestin and estrogen types but different hormone doses or regimens. Only <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2001</LINK> detected a possible difference in weight change between the groups, and the higher weight gain was for the group assigned less estrogen. While a dose-related effect would have supported the hypothesized causal link between estrogen and weight gain, the lack of this finding does not disprove the possible association. The studies could have been underpowered to detect a dose-gradient response between the estrogen content and weight gain.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-08-09 04:17:34 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Only one trial examined weight change as a primary outcome, so most trials did not use rigorous methods for measuring weight. The reliability of the measurements could be affected by numerous factors, such as the use of calibrated scales, the time of day and cycle when measurements were collected, the use of a fasting state, and the amount of clothing on the participant. The degree of error in measuring weight change is likely to be similar between study groups and to dilute the effect estimate toward the null value of no difference.</P>
<P>The trials also could have failed to detect differences in weight if the rates for early discontinuation or loss to follow up had systematically differed between intervention groups for women who gained or lost weight. Ten trials reported the proportion of women for whom weight change was the primary reason for early discontinuation, and did not find differences by study group. Also, the one trial that reported the mean weight gain for the women who discontinued early for this reason found similar mean weight changes for the two combination injectable groups. The interpretation of the trial results would have been strengthened by including weight change data for women who did not complete the trial.</P>

<P>More than 25% of the trials had high risk of bias due to lack of blinding or incomplete outcome data (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). The majority of studies had unclear risk of bias due to missing information on randomization sequence generation or allocation concealment. However, most of those trials were published before CONSORT (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CONSORT-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">CONSORT 2009</LINK>) (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>).</P>

<P>The four trials with a placebo or no intervention group did not find evidence supporting a causal association between combination contraceptives and weight change. Also, most comparisons of different combination contraceptives showed no substantial difference in weight or difference in discontinuation rates due to weight change. Available evidence is insufficient to determine the effect of combination contraceptives on weight, but no large effect is evident. The medical usefulness of weighing women who use combination contraceptives appears to be limited. Appropriate and accurate counseling about typical weight gain over time may help reduce discontinuation of contraceptives due to perceptions of weight gain.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-06-01 19:16:11 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomized controlled trials to evaluate the link between combination contraceptives and weight change require a placebo or non-hormonal group to control for other factors, including changes in weight over time. In addition, improved reporting of study methods and results would permit the inclusion of more trials and strengthen the interpretation. Trials should also attempt to collect and report weight data for those who discontinue early or are excluded from the trial.</P>
