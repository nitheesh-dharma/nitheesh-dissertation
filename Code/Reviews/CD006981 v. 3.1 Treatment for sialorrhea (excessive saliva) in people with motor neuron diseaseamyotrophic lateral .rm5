<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-03-21 12:39:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Jewitt">
<P>Unintentional drooling of saliva (sialorrhea) is a distressing symptom suffered by up to 25% of patients with motor neuron disease. The management of sialorrhea currently involves the use of suction, drug treatments and more invasive approaches, including injection of botulinum toxin to the salivary glands, radiotherapy to the salivary glands and ligation (surgery to tie off) of the salivary gland ducts.</P>
<P>An extensive search of the literature identified only one randomized controlled trial, of 20 patients, which could be included in the review. This study reported a beneficial effect of botulinum toxin type B injected into the parotid and submandibular salivary glands in patients with MND on a single occasion. The study appeared to have low risk of bias, and no serious adverse events were recorded.</P>
<P>Although other treatments are supported by case control studies, there was no evidence to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for sialorrhea. Further research is needed to compare the different treatments available and to optimise treatment regimens.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-03-21 10:49:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Jewitt">
<P>Motor neuron disease (MND), also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, is a progressive, neurodegenerative condition which may cause dysphagia, as well as limb weakness, dysarthria, emotional lability and respiratory failure. Since normal salivary production is 0.5 to 1.5 litres daily, loss of salivary clearance due to dysphagia leads to salivary pooling and sialorrhea, often resulting in distress and inconvenience to patients.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2011-03-21 12:40:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Jewitt">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-03-21 10:52:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Jewitt">
<P>Motor neuron disease (MND), also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterised by relatively selective death of upper motor neurons in the cerebral cortex and lower motor neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord (<LINK REF="REF-Shaw-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaw 1999</LINK>). This gives rise to a combination of upper and lower motor neuron signs and symptoms such as weakness in the limb and bulbar muscles with atrophy, spasticity and weight loss. The onset of MND can be insidious and it may take up to 18 months to diagnose the condition. By the time diagnosis is made, the person may have significant functional deficits and symptom control needs. Death occurs in most patients within two to five years after diagnosis, usually from ventilatory muscle weakness causing respiratory failure (<LINK REF="REF-Rowland-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowland 2001</LINK>). The incidence of ALS/MND is one to two per 100,000 of the population (<LINK REF="REF-Worms-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Worms 2001</LINK>). At any one time, there are approximately 5000 affected people in the United Kingdom (<LINK REF="REF-Shaw-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaw 1999</LINK>) and 25,000 in North America (<LINK REF="REF-McGuire-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGuire 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>In MND, approximately 70% of people present with limb involvement and 30 (<LINK REF="REF-Abhinav-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abhinav 2007</LINK>) with bulbar symptoms such dysphagia, dysarthria, hoarseness and hypophonia. Eighty per cent of people with MND will develop bulbar weakness at some stage of the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Oliver-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oliver 1996</LINK>). Many people benefit from alternative feeding methods such as percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) or radiologically inserted gastrostomy (RIG/PRG) (<LINK REF="REF-Leigh-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leigh 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mitsomoto-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitsomoto 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Sialorrhea, the unintentional loss of saliva from the mouth, occurs in up to 25% of people with MND. Veis and colleagues showed that for people with MND, sialorrhea is not caused by increased production of saliva but by the inability to swallow secretions because of tongue spasticity, weakness of face, mouth and pharyngeal muscles, and loss of oropharyngeal co-ordination and function (<LINK REF="REF-Veis-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Veis 2000</LINK>). There are two main types of saliva produced by the three major salivary glands; serous saliva, which is thin and watery, and mucoidal saliva, which is thicker and more viscous. The nose and lungs also contribute to the flow of secretions, usually in the form of thick, tenacious 'phlegm' (<LINK REF="STD-Newall-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Newall 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>All these forms of secretions can cause patient discomfort. Serous saliva can be watery and constantly dribbling from the side of the mouth, and mucoidal saliva may be tenacious and thick, making it difficult to clear and contributing to the sensation of choking and associated panic. It is important to distinguish between thin, runny saliva and thick, mucous secretions because the treatment options differ (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1999</LINK>). The skin may become excoriated from constant exposure to moisture, voice quality may be compromised and sleep may be disturbed by secretion build-up. These symptoms may lead to increased fatigue, embarrassment, social withdrawal and isolation. Therefore, sialorrhea can significantly affect quality of life.</P>
<P>Riluzole, a putative glutamate release blocker, is currently the only drug licensed for human use in MND. Its effect is modest, only prolonging survival by about two to three months in people with MND (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2007</LINK>). Therefore, symptom control and maximisation of quality of life are the principal aims of any treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Oliver-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oliver 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>At present, the treatment of sialorrhea is largely a matter of trial and error, using a variety of drug treatments, natural remedies, oral suction, and more invasive approaches, such as injection of botulinum toxin into salivary glands, radiotherapy to salivary glands or ligation of salivary gland ducts. Behavioural techniques are also advocated in the early management stages such as purposeful swallowing of the saliva as it builds up in the mouth and before speaking. This has been shown to be effective in people with Parkinson's disease where a metronome brooch was used as a reminder to cue a conscious saliva swallow (<LINK REF="REF-Marks-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marks 2001</LINK>). Management appears largely governed by the personal preference of the clinician, and in the case of more invasive measures, the local availability of these techniques. Frequently, the person with MND will need to try a number of treatment options with varying degrees of success.</P>
<P>Several potential treatments have been described in the literature. Salivation is mainly mediated through parasympathetic stimulation. Acetylcholine is the active neurotransmitter, binding at muscarinic receptors in the salivary glands (<LINK REF="REF-Meningaud-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meningaud 2006</LINK>). Thus, cholinergic muscarinic receptor antagonists or drugs with these properties, such as atropine, scopolamine (hyoscine), glycopyrronium bromide and tricyclic antidepressants can be used to treat sialorrhea in MND (<LINK REF="REF-Borasio-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borasio 1997</LINK>). Whereas the stimulation of cholinergic receptors produces thin, serous secretions, that of beta adrenergic receptors produce thick protein and mucus-rich secretions. Beta blockers have been shown to produce relief from thick secretions in 12 of 16 people with bulbar MND (<LINK REF="STD-Newall-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Newall 1996</LINK>). The mucolytic drug carbocisteine may also be beneficial in MND as it reduces elastic modules of mucus and improves mucociliary transport (<LINK REF="REF-Sakakura-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sakakura 1985</LINK>).</P>
<P>Use of botulinum toxin to reduce salivary flow in MND was first hypothesised in modern day literature by Bushara in 1997 (<LINK REF="REF-Bushara-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bushara 1997</LINK>). It is thought that botulinum toxin injections reduce sialorrhea by blocking the release of acetylcholine at the cholinergic neurosecretory junction of salivary glands (<LINK REF="REF-Burgen-1949" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burgen 1949</LINK>). There are now several series reported, utilising different preparations of botulinum toxin and treatment regimens, administered by direct injection or a transductal approach, with varying outcome measures (<LINK REF="STD-Contarino-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Contarino 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Costa-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Costa 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Giess-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Giess 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jackson-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lipp-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lipp 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Manrique-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Manrique 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Porta-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Porta 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scott-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Scott 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Verma-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Verma 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>In addition, various destructive measures have been trialled in open label studies as a means to reduce salivary production. One approach is radiotherapy to the salivary glands, either once or in divided fractions (<LINK REF="STD-Andersen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harriman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Harriman 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Neppelberg-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Neppelberg 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stalpers-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stalpers 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Winterholler-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Winterholler 2001</LINK>). Another area is surgical interventions, to excise salivary glands, or destroy nerve supply to the gland by neurectomy of the tympanic nerve (<LINK REF="REF-Janzen-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Janzen 1988</LINK>).</P>
<P>This literature review shows that several treatments have been described in case series and open label studies, utilising a variety of outcome measures and treating a range of case severity. A systematic review may benefit clinicians and inform better practice.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2011-03-14 15:29:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Jewitt">
<P>We assessed risk of bias according to the methods in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). The methodological quality assessment took into account sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding (for patient reported outcomes, objective outcomes, clinician reported outcomes, carer reported outcomes), whether incomplete outcome data was addressed, selective outcome reporting and other sources of bias such as exactness of the description of the clinical status, explicit outcome criteria, and how studies dealt with baseline differences between the experimental groups. We graded these items 'Yes' for a low risk of bias, 'No' for a high risk of bias and 'Unclear' when the risk of bias was uncertain or the item was not relevant to the study. We specified that if agreement was poor, we would reassess the studies and reach agreement by consensus. We have described the risk of bias of included studies, and discussed the overall reliability of the evidence in the light of this. Had data been appropriate for this, we would have undertaken sensitivity analyses to demonstrate the effect of downweighting or ignoring those studies that had received low scores in the individual aspects of quality criteria on the meta-analyses.</P>

<P>We planned to test for heterogeneity across trials, and if found we undertook to do sensitivity analyses by repeating the calculation omitting the trials which had low scores on individual quality items. If heterogeneity was not explained by variations in trial quality we undertook to use a random-effects approach to obtain the pooled estimates from the group of trials.</P>

<P>Electronic searches produced 158 references. The number of references retrieved from each database was MEDLINE = 86, EMBASE = 46, AMED = 2, CINAHL Plus = 22, CENTRAL = 10, Register = 14 but most of these were excluded because of duplication between databases, or because they did not report a clinical trial (reviews, case reports, and so on). We screened 19 studies in full text and excluded a further study on the basis of the translation of the abstract.</P>
<P>Of the remaining studies, the majority did not meet eligibility criteria as randomized controlled trials in patients with MND. There was an uncontrolled trial of beta antagonists (<LINK REF="STD-Newall-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Newall 1996</LINK>). A number of studies of botulinum toxin injections to the parotid and/or submandibular glands (<LINK REF="STD-Contarino-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Contarino 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Costa-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Costa 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Giess-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Giess 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Manrique-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Manrique 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Porta-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Porta 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scott-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Scott 2005</LINK>; and <LINK REF="STD-Verma-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Verma 2006</LINK>) were not controlled. One placebo-controlled study randomized patients to three different doses of botulinum toxin or placebo, using an unspecified method, but it was not possible to separate the data on the 12 MND patients from the 20 other participants suffering from Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy or corticobasal degeneration (<LINK REF="STD-Lipp-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lipp 2003</LINK>). Levitski compared botulinum toxin to amitriptyline but randomization was not described and patients purchased their treatment which may have biased results (<LINK REF="STD-Levitskii-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Levitskii 2005</LINK>). There were several uncontrolled studies on the effect of radiotherapy to the submandibular and parotid glands (<LINK REF="STD-Andersen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harriman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Harriman 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Neppelberg-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Neppelberg 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stalpers-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stalpers 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Winterholler-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Winterholler 2001</LINK>). See <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>.</P>
<P>We identified one randomized controlled trial in MND (<LINK REF="STD-Jackson-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 2009</LINK>) (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). This study randomized 20 patients with MND and sialorrhea refractory to medical therapy to either botulinum toxin type B to parotid and submandibular glands, or placebo. Participants were assessed at baseline which was the day of randomization and injection under electromyographic guidance, and then at 2,4,8 and 12 weeks, with a telephone follow-up at 1 week which could trigger an attendance if the Revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) swallowing or respiratory scale had changed by more than one point.</P>
<P>Two injections were given to each of the parotid and submandibular glands bilaterally, i.e.eight injections per patient. The injection, via a monopolar electromyography needle attached to a 1 ml syringe, contained either 1 ml normal saline, or botulinum toxin type B 2,500 units diluted with normal saline to a total volume of 1 ml. Absence of motor unit activity was used to confirm needle placement in glandular/soft tissue. Each parotid gland received 0.1 ml at two sites, directing the needle between the sternocleidomastoid muscle and angle of mandible. Each submandibular gland received two injections of 0.15 ml, placing the needle in the submandibular triangle. Pretreatment with topical lidocaine/prilocaine (EMLA cream) was available if requested prior to the injection.</P>
<P>The primary outcome was the participant's global impression of change recorded on a 5 point Likert scale 8 weeks after injection. Secondary outcome measures were listed as change in saliva volumes, number of times suctioned, patient and caregiver assessment of benefit, ALSFRS-R, and quality of life measured using the schedule for evaluation of individual quality of life directing weighting (SEIQoL-DW), a quality of life self rating scale using five cues chosen and rated by the patient. Concomitant treatment with anticholinergic drugs was kept stable or allowed to reduce during the trial and outcome measures were collected at the same time of day and after the patients had refrained from eating or drinking for one hour. Questionnaires were done independently by patient and caregiver and completed before any interaction with the study physicians.</P>
<P>Following the 12 week double-blind phase, participants could enrol into an open label extension for three months. This used the same method of injection except that the dose of botulinum toxin could be adjusted so that the total dose did not exceed 5,000 units.</P>

<P>Only one study met criteria to be included in the review (<LINK REF="STD-Jackson-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 2009</LINK>). In this study, all participants had probable or definite ALS according to World Federation of Neurology criteria and had to have sialorrhea which was refractory to treatment with at least two anticholinergic medications (or be intolerant of anticholinergic treatments.) Participants were aged 21 to 85 years, had forced vital capacity &gt;20% predicted, could not have received any previous treatment with botulinum toxin, and were recruited from three "ALS centers".</P>
<P>Randomisation assignment was by a random numbers table (even botulinum toxin, odd normal saline) stratified in blocks of four for each of the three sites. Opaque envelopes retained securely by an unblinded investigator were opened sequentially whenever a patient was randomized, this investigator would then prepare an injection containing botulinum toxin or saline in a closed room away from the blinded investigator and participant. The unblinded investigator had no direct contact with the patients.</P>
<P>The 20 participants showed no statistically significant differences between treatment and placebo groups for age, disease duration, bulbar involvement, medical treatment, ALSFRS-R, SEIQOL-DW, baseline patient assessment of saliva thickness or problem severity, or volume of saliva. There was a higher proportion of male patients in the placebo group (67% versus 36%).</P>
<P>Of 20 subjects randomized, 18 completed the double-blind phase with one lost to follow-up and one suffering fatal cardiac arrest, both from the treatment arm. The investigator and the safety monitor felt the death was unrelated to study medication. Fifteen of 18 eligible patients entered the open label extension, 7/9 treatment group and 8/9 placebo group. No information was given about why patients declined the open label study. One further patient was lost to follow-up during the open label study, from the arm which was originally placebo. No data are provided about outcomes from the open label phase.</P>
<P>An unblinding questionnaire was done for both patients and investigators at 12 weeks. Seventy per cent of investigators and 90% subjects guessed the treatment allocation correctly, suggesting that despite excellent attempts to maintain blinding the double-blind was not preserved. This may have produced bias in the primary outcome and other self report measures.</P>
<P>The study appeared to be at low risk of bias. A summary of the review authors's judgements on each risk of bias item can be found at <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Primary outcome</HEADING>
<P>The primary outcome measure of the subjective improvement in sialorrhea reported by participants in the short-term was ascertained by asking patients eight weeks after the injection. This outcome measure of patient-rated impression of change was dichotomised to improvement or not, and analysed using Fisher's exact test. It showed a consistent difference in favour of botulinum toxin, which was statistically significant at week 2 (treatment 82% improved, placebo 38%, P &lt; 0.05) and week 4 (treatment 90%, placebo 44%, P &lt; 0.05). However the difference was not statistically significant at week 8, which was the <I>a priori</I> primary outcome.</P>
<P>At two weeks 38% placebo patients and 82% of botulinum toxin treated patients reported improvement on a patient global impression of change measure, and at four weeks the figures were 44% and 90% respectively. These proportions were statistically significantly different at P &lt; 0.05. At 8 weeks and 12 weeks there was no significant difference (8 weeks placebo 22%, botulinum 67%; 12 weeks placebo 14%, botulinum 50%).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Secondary outcomes  </HEADING>
<P>The objective outcome measure of change in volume of saliva produced, as measured with funnel and tube over 5 minutes, consistently favoured botulinum toxin. This difference reached statistical significance at week 2 (treatment 0.07, SD 0.2; placebo 0.84, SD 0.8, P &lt; 0.05) and week 4 (treatment 0.02, SD 0.04; placebo 0.97, SD 0.5, P &lt; 0.05) but not thereafter. No data were provided on number of times suctioned.</P>
<P>Other secondary outcome measures of patient assessment of saliva problem and thickness, and caregiver assessment of saliva problem, showed trends in favour of botulinum toxin. These reached statistical significance (VAS analysed with repeated measures of variance, P &lt; 0.05) at different times in the 12 week follow-up, with patient assessment of both saliva thickness and problem statistically significant at 12 weeks. It should be noted that the unblinding questionnaire done at this time point revealed 90% patients could correctly guess their treatment allocation.</P>
<P>Quality of life of participants measured by using the SEIQOL-DW favoring botulinum toxin. The clinicians' assessment of marked improvement showed a statistically significant difference with botulinum toxin but not placebo at week 2 only.</P>
<P>Treatment appeared safe with no increase in aspiration pneumonia, dysphagia or deteriorating vital capacity related to the trial medication. There were no severe adverse events related by investigators or safety monitors to study medication. As this was a single dose study, cessation of treatment from adverse events does not apply. However, the paper does not describe any restrictions from the investigators on participants entering the open label phase, although reasons for three patients not to proceed to the open label study (two from treatment and one from placebo arms) were not specified.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-03-21 12:40:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Jewitt">
<P>Extensive literature review identified just one randomized controlled study of treatment of sialorrhea in MND. This was a positive study of a single session of botulinum toxin type B injections to parotid and submandibular glands, which produced both subjective and objective benefits in patients for some weeks after the injection. The eligibility criteria specified that the study population had to have inadequate response to, or intolerance of, anticholinergic medications, and concomitant drug treatment had to be stable or reducing during follow-up. Randomisation and analysis appeared good and data completeness was satisfactory. The intervention was described with sufficient detail to allow replication by other clinicians.</P>
<P>Despite excellent methodology to maintain blinding, the majority of participants and investigators correctly guessed their treatment allocation at the end of the double-blind phase. This loss of blinding may be a corollary of identifying an effective treatment. The clinical context is that patients with MND almost always show an inexorably progressive course, and thus sialorrhea does not spontaneously remit but instead would be anticipated to worsen as bulbar function deteriorates. Therefore, drug effect is a major source of unblinding in a controlled trial. When choosing outcome measures it may therefore be preferable to utilise objective quantitative measures less influenced by unblinding, such as volume of saliva produced in unit time, as the primary outcome.</P>
<P>Careful consideration of trial design for future studies will be important. Ethical considerations suggest that the placebo controlled phase should be as short as the postulated mechanism of action of the treatment allows. Volunteers who commence on placebo phase might also be automatically offered the active intervention unless safety considerations have arisen in the first phase (delayed commencement design). Trials will have greater scientific utility if all patients remain blinded but this is more difficult with such a design where participants will know they are all on active agent in the second half of the study. With blinding maintained the patients on active treatment throughout contribute data on long-term safety and sustained response, and the patients who switch to active provide more information on efficacy. Trials are likely to need multi-centre involvement, and the randomization may include comparing more than one dose against placebo, given the lack of preliminary data.</P>
<P>There are other non randomized trials, typically open label, on use of botulinum toxin to reduce saliva production in MND. These support a beneficial effect of botulinum toxin, some utilising objective, quantitative outcome measures. Giess and colleagues injected botulinum toxin in the parotid glands only of three MND patients and in the parotid and submandibular glands of two MND patients (<LINK REF="STD-Giess-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Giess 2000</LINK>). A significant reduction in the number of paper handkerchiefs used daily was found four weeks after the last injection. Four of the five participants reported improvement in quality of life associated with marked reduction of sialorrhea, evidenced by reduced radiotracer uptake on parotid salivary gland scintigraphy after the botulinum injections. One participant with rapidly progressive disease did not show clinical benefit after repeated parotid and submandibular gland injections, despite a markedly reduced radiotracer uptake in the parotid glands. In another open-labelled study, botulinum toxin was injected in the parotid glands of 10 participants with MND (<LINK REF="STD-Verma-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Verma 2006</LINK>). Of the eight people who completed the study, five showed improvement of 2.5 or more on the visual analogue scale (VAS). In addition, the paper tissue count was significantly lower at four weeks after treatment. Injection of both parotid and submandibular glands was reported by Costa and colleagues, who showed 70% mean reduction in VAS of sialorrhea severity in 12/16 patients, and 60% reduction in cotton roll weight to judge saliva production (<LINK REF="STD-Costa-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Costa 2008</LINK>). Porta and colleagues reported improvement in sialorrhea in three of the four participants with MND who had ultrasound guided botulinum toxin injections in both parotid and submandibular glands (<LINK REF="STD-Porta-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Porta 2001</LINK>). In this study, a visual analogue scale completed by participants was used to assess the rate of salivation. In a study by Manrique and colleagues, four of the five participants with MND injected with botulinum toxin in the parotid and submandibular glands reported significant improvement of symptoms and quality of life based on a clinical questionnaire (<LINK REF="STD-Manrique-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Manrique 2005</LINK>). Another study reported an overall significant reduction of sialorrhea, as measured by cotton rolls weight, and significant improvement in four clinical evaluation scales in a group of 18 participants (nine with MND and nine with Parkinson's disease) who had undergone ultrasound guided injections of botulinum toxin in the parotid and mandibular glands (<LINK REF="STD-Contarino-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Contarino 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Botulinum toxin injections to the salivary glands have a number of potential side effects, the more common ones include viscous saliva, local pain, chewing weakness and, because the individual dose response is unpredictable, dry mouth (<LINK REF="STD-Costa-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Costa 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Porta-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Porta 2001</LINK>). Treatment generally appears well tolerated, though serious adverse effects such as infection of salivary gland and dysphagia are reported (<LINK REF="STD-Winterholler-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Winterholler 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>The published data on radiotherapy of salivary glands to reduce saliva production in MND is all open label. Andersen and colleagues reported on a prospective pilot study of low-dose radiation therapy to the parotid and submandibular glands of participants with MND (<LINK REF="STD-Andersen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 2001</LINK>). On each side, the radiation dose was 7 gray (Gy) (Gy as a single dose in the first 13 participants and 7.5 Gy in the last five participants. Sixteen of the 18 participants treated reported satisfactory to good reduction in drooling lasting up to four to six months, one participant developed xerostomia and needed saliva substitutes and another participant reported no effect. Another study reported treating the submandibular and parotid glands of five MND participants with a single fraction of 8 Gy and four participants with two fractions of 6.25 Gy (total 12.5 Gy) (<LINK REF="STD-Harriman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Harriman 2001</LINK>). It was found that 8 Gy of radiation was effective in controlling drooling and increasing the dose did not improve initial control. In the 8 Gy group, four of the five participants had significant subjective benefit at two weeks post-treatment. In this group, three of five participants completed the two-month visit and of these, two had significant benefit both subjectively (measured by a questionnaire) and objectively (measured by the weight of tissue rolls). In the 12.5 Gy group, one of three participants alive at two weeks post-treatment reported subjective benefit, while both the participants that completed the two-month visit showed subjective and objective improvement. Long-term control of sialorrhea was difficult to evaluate as the participants entered in the study were very ill and their life expectancy was very short. Stalpers and Moser reported treating 19 participants with MND with radiotherapy to the parotid glands (<LINK REF="STD-Stalpers-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stalpers 2002</LINK>). The prescribed radiation dose in all participants was 12 Gy in two fractions once a week (<LINK REF="STD-Stalpers-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stalpers 2002</LINK>). Three participants received one fraction only, of which two already had a satisfactory response after the first fraction, and one did not want a second fraction. Fourteen participants reported a satisfactory response within two to three weeks of the initial radiation, complete in 11 and partial in three. Four participants without improvement after initial treatment were re-irradiated, with only one showing partial improvement. Adverse effects of radiotherapy in these studies were mild, such as parotid pain and dry mouth (<LINK REF="STD-Andersen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 2001</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>From a surgical point of view, there are very few published case series. In one small series, five MND patients having submandibular gland excisions had only limited control of drooling whereas one having unilateral tympanic neurectomy showed better treatment response (<LINK REF="REF-Janzen-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Janzen 1988</LINK>).</P>

<P>There is extremely limited evidence from randomized controlled trials about treatments to reduce sialorrhea in MND. The well designed trial on botulinum toxin type B injected into parotid and submandibular glands showed beneficial effects for four or more weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Jackson-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 2009</LINK>).</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-03-14 15:57:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Jewitt">
<P>There is a need for considerable further work on treating this distressing symptom. Fundamental understanding of the nature of sialorrhea is required to differentiate between thick, mucous secretions and watery, salivary drooling. It would also be useful to validate a patient self report measure, as the previous studies have used different VAS and many unvalidated questionnaires. Future research designs must also reflect the need for objective outcome measures such as rate of production of saliva or salivary gland scintigraphy. These are necessary because an effective intervention may have an unblinding effect. Placebo controlled trials with intent-to-treat analysis are still important, as there may be many unpredictable factors which influence sialorrhea, such as mouth breathing, general hydration, diet, disease stage, and concomitant medication. </P>

<P>Non randomised study. Open label pilot of botulinum toxin A 12.5 U injected into each parotid and sublingual gland by transductal approach. Response measured by measuring saliva production, and technetium 99 m scintigraphy. 2/2 bulbar MND patients showed benefit. Pilot stopped due to severe adverse events (severe swelling of sublingual gland in first and worsening of dysphagia in second patient)</P>
