<DESCRIPTION>
<P>It has recently transpired that the MADRS scores used in our analyses for the trial by Bot et al (2010) were reversed between intervention and placebo groups. These data resulted from correspondence with the authors of this trial and they have recently confirmed an error. Reversal of the data for these groups changes our results minimally, does not change our interpretation of our results and does not change our conclusions.</P>
<P>Reversal of these data results in the following changes to the results of the following analyses:</P>
<P>1.1: n-3PUFAs vs placebo: depressive symptomology (continuous data)(Figures 4,5): original published result &#8211; SMD = -0.32 (95% CI -0.52 to -0.12), I<SUP>2</SUP> = 58%; revised result - SMD = -0.30 (95% CI -0.50 to -0.10), I<SUP>2</SUP> = 59%. This result represents a difference between groups in scores on the HDRS (17-item) of approximately 2.1 points (95% CI 0.7 to 3.5).</P>
<P>3: n-3PUFAs vs placebo: depressive symptomology (continuous data) subgroup analyses based on presence/absence of comorbidities (Figure 13):</P>
<P>Individuals with comorbidities: original published result - SMD = -0.65 (95% CI -1.28 to -0.02), I<SUP>2</SUP> = 74%; revised result - SMD = -0.54 (95% CI -1.21 to 0.12), I<SUP>2</SUP> = 77%. Statistical evidence of a difference between subgroups remains (p = 0.04), and evidence of heterogeneity between subgroups remains high (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 68%).</P>
<P>4: n-3PUFAs vs placebo: depressive symptomology (continuous data) subgroup analyses based on presence/absence of adjunctive therapies (Figure 14):</P>
<P>Individuals receiving adjunctive therapy: original published result - SMD = -0.21 (95% CI -0.42 to 0.01), I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%; revised result - SMD = -0.16 (95% CI -0.38 to 0.05), I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%. No statistical evidence of a difference between subgroups remains (p = 0.48), and no evidence of heterogeneity between subgroups remains (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%).</P>
<P>5.1: n-3PUFAs vs placebo: depressive symptomology (continuous data) sensitivity analyses based on selection bias: original published result - SMD = -0.21 (95% CI -0.45 to 0.03), I<SUP>2</SUP> = 59%; revised result - SMD = -0.18 (95% CI -0.42 to 0.06), I<SUP>2</SUP> = 60%.</P>
<P>5.2: n-3PUFAs vs placebo: depressive symptomology (continuous data) sensitivity analyses based on performance bias: original published result - SMD = -0.14 (95% CI -0.55 to 0.26), I<SUP>2</SUP> = 69%; revised result - SMD = -0.07 (95% CI -0.48 to 0.35), I<SUP>2</SUP> = 70%.</P>
<P>6: n-3PUFAs vs placebo: depressive symptomology (continuous data) sensitivity analyses using fixed effects models: original published result - SMD = -0.20 (95% CI -0.31 to -0.09); revised result - SMD = -0.19 (95% CI -0.30 to -0.08).</P>
<P>7.1: n-3PUFAs vs placebo: depressive symptomology (continuous data) sensitivity analyses based on use of a treatment that was solely EPA: original published result - SMD = -0.45 (95% CI -0.74 to -0.15), I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%; revised result - SMD = -0.37 (95% CI -0.66 to -0.08), I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%.</P>
<P>11: n-3PUFAs vs placebo: depressive symptomology (continuous data) sensitivity analyses based on consideration of multiple comparison groups from the same study as individual studies: original published result - SMD = -0.34 (95% CI -0.56 to -0.12), I<SUP>2</SUP> = 67%; revised result - SMD = -0.32 (95% CI -0.54 to -0.10), I<SUP>2</SUP> = 68%.</P>

<P>
<B>Why is this review important?</B>
</P>
<P>Major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterised by depressed mood and/or a markedly decreased pleasure or interest in all activities. It has negative impacts on the individual and on society, often over the long term. One possible treatment for MDD is n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3PUFAs), also known as omega-3 oils, naturally found in fatty fish, some other seafood and some nuts and seeds. Various lines of evidence suggests that n-3PUFAs may impact on depressive symptoms, but a lot of studies have different findings, making it difficult to draw conclusions.</P>
<P>
<B>Who will be interested in this review?</B>
</P>
<P>Health professionals, including general practitioners, mental health and psychiatric specialists; individuals with MDD, more mild or additional depressive disorders; and the people around them.</P>
<P>
<B>What questions does this review aim to answer?</B>
</P>
<P>Do n-3PUFAs, compared to an alternative, have an effect on depressive symptoms, negative side effects, rates of recovery, quality of life, and rates of dropout from studies, in individuals with a diagnosis of MDD?</P>
<P>
<B>Which studies were included in the review?</B>
</P>
<P>We searched scientific databases for all randomised controlled trials in adults with a diagnosis of MDD, where individuals received either n-3PUFAs or an alternative, that were carried out up to May 2015.</P>
<P>We found 26 relevant studies: 25 studies involving 1438 people compared the impact of n-3PUFAs with that of placebo, and one study involving 40 people compared the impact of n-3PUFAs with that of antidepressants. All studies were of direct relevance to our review, but we considered the quality of the evidence to be low to very low.</P>
<P>
<B>What does the evidence from the review tell us?</B>
</P>
<P>At present, we do not have enough high quality evidence to determine the effects of n-3PUFAs as a treatment for MDD. We found a small-to-modest positive effect of n-3PUFAs compared to placebo, but the size of this effect is unlikely to be meaningful to people with depression, and we considered the evidence to be of low or very low quality, with many differences between studies. There was also insufficient high quality evidence to determine the effects of n-3PUFAs on negative side effects or numbers failing to complete trials.</P>
<P>
<B>What should happen next?</B>
</P>
<P>We need more evidence, particularly to explain the differences between study findings, e.g. by looking at individuals who may and may not benefit from n-3PUFAs. Future studies should also compare n-3PUFAs with usual antidepressant treatment, and investigate the way these treatments may work.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-10-05 12:28:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Major depressive disorder (MDD) is highly debilitating, difficult to treat, has a high rate of recurrence, and negatively impacts the individual and society as a whole. One emerging potential treatment for MDD is n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3PUFAs), also known as omega-3 oils, naturally found in fatty fish, some other seafood, and some nuts and seeds. Various lines of evidence suggest a role for n-3PUFAs in MDD, but the evidence is far from conclusive. Reviews and meta-analyses clearly demonstrate heterogeneity between studies. Investigations of heterogeneity suggest differential effects of n-3PUFAs, depending on severity of depressive symptoms, where no effects of n-3PUFAs are found in studies of individuals with mild depressive symptomology, but possible benefit may be suggested in studies of individuals with more severe depressive symptomology.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2015-10-10 15:40:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess the effects of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (also known as omega-3 fatty acids) versus a comparator (e.g. placebo, anti-depressant treatment, standard care, no treatment, wait-list control) for major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-10-05 12:39:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group&#8217;s Specialised Registers (CCDANCTR) and International Trial Registries over all years to May 2015. We searched the database CINAHL over all years of records to September 2013.<BR/>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2015-10-05 12:40:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included studies in the review if they: were a randomised controlled trial; provided n-3PUFAs as an intervention; used a comparator; measured depressive symptomology as an outcome; and were conducted in adults with MDD. Primary outcomes were depressive symptomology (continuous data collected using a validated rating scale) and adverse events. Secondary outcomes were depressive symptomology (dichotomous data on remission and response), quality of life, and failure to complete studies.</P>

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-12-12 16:08:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sarah  R Davies">
<P>We found 26 relevant studies: 25 studies involving a total of 1438 participants investigated the impact of n-3PUFA supplementation compared to placebo, and one study involving 40 participants investigated the impact of n-3PUFA supplementation compared to antidepressant treatment.</P>
<P>For the placebo comparison, n-3PUFA supplementation results in a small to modest benefit for depressive symptomology, compared to placebo: standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.30 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.10 to -0.50; 25 studies, 1373 participants, very low quality evidence), but this effect is unlikely to be clinically meaningful (an SMD of 0.30 represents a difference between groups in scores on the HDRS (17-item) of approximately 2.1 points (95% CI 0.7 to 3.5)). The confidence intervals include both a possible clinically important effect and a possible negligible effect, and there is considerable heterogeneity between the studies. Although the numbers of individuals experiencing adverse events were similar in intervention and placebo groups (odds ratio (OR) 1.24, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.62; 19 studies, 1207 participants; very low-quality evidence), the confidence intervals include a significant increase in adverse events with n-3PUFAs as well as a small possible decrease. Rates of remission and response, quality of life, and rates of failure to complete studies were also similar between groups, but confidence intervals are again wide.</P>
<P>The evidence on which these results are based is very limited. All studies contributing to our analyses were of direct relevance to our research question, but we rated the quality of the evidence for all outcomes as low to very low. The number of studies and number of participants contributing to all analyses were low, and the majority of studies were small and judged to be at high risk of bias on several measures. Our analyses were also likely to be highly influenced by three large trials. Although we judge these trials to be at low risk of bias, they contribute 26.9% to 82% of data. Our effect size estimates are also imprecise. Funnel plot asymmetry and sensitivity analyses (using fixed-effect models, and only studies judged to be at low risk of selection bias, performance bias or attrition bias) also suggest a likely bias towards a positive finding for n-3PUFAs. There was substantial heterogeneity in analyses of our primary outcome of depressive symptomology. This heterogeneity was not explained by the presence or absence of comorbidities or by the presence or absence of adjunctive therapy.</P>
<P>Only one study was available for the antidepressant comparison, involving 40 participants. This study found no differences between treatment with n-3PUFAs and treatment with antidepressants in depressive symptomology (mean difference (MD) -0.70 (95% CI -5.88 to 4.48)), rates of response to treatment or failure to complete. Adverse events were not reported in a manner suitable for analysis, and rates of depression remission and quality of life were not reported.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-10-30 13:11:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>At present, we do not have sufficient high quality evidence to determine the effects of n-3PUFAs as a treatment for MDD. Our primary analyses suggest a small-to-modest, non-clinically beneficial effect of n-3PUFAs on depressive symptomology compared to placebo; however the estimate is imprecise, and we judged the quality of the evidence on which this result is based to be low/very low. Sensitivity analyses, funnel plot inspection and comparison of our results with those of large well-conducted trials also suggest that this effect estimate is likely to be biased towards a positive finding for n-3PUFAs, and that the true effect is likely to be smaller. Our data, however, also suggest similar rates of adverse events and numbers failing to complete trials in n-3PUFA and placebo groups, but again our estimates are very imprecise. The one study that directly compares n-3PUFAs and antidepressants in our review finds comparable benefit. More evidence, and more complete evidence, are required, particularly regarding both the potential positive and negative effects of n-3PUFAs for MDD.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2016-12-14 16:30:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sarah  R Davies">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-12-14 16:24:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-10-19 14:37:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterised by: depressed mood; markedly diminished pleasure or interest in all activities; significant weight loss or weight gain, or decrease or increase in appetite; insomnia or hypersomnia; psychomotor agitation or retardation; fatigue or lethargy; feelings of worthlessness or inappropriate guilt; disruptions to concentration and decision making; and recurrent thoughts of death (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2013</LINK>). Diagnosis is achieved by: the presence of four or more symptoms (as above) plus depressed mood or markedly diminished pleasure or interest in all activities, for a consecutive period of two weeks; significant distress or impairment in functioning as a result of symptoms; and an inability to attribute symptoms to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2013</LINK>). MDD is currently estimated to affect approximately 7% of western populations, with resulting impact both at an individual and a societal level (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2013</LINK>). MDD can be highly debilitating; can affect all areas of an individual's life; can be difficult to treat, with a high rate of recurrence; and often exists in combination with other conditions and disorders, such as cardiovascular disease and anxiety disorders (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2013</LINK>). Recent figures (2011) published by the World Health Organization estimate major depressive disorders to account for 3% of global ill health in terms of disability-adjusted life years (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2014</LINK>), and projections for 2030 suggest an increase to 6% or 7% (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2014</LINK>). Given this increasing trend, there is an urgent need for effective treatments and strategies for prevention.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-12-14 16:24:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>One emerging potential treatment for MDD is n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3PUFAs), also known as omega-3 fatty acids.</P>
<P>n-3PUFAs are a family of polyunsaturated fatty acids, named as such because of the positioning of the first double carbon bond on the third atom from the methyl end of the acyl chain. All members of the family are derived from parent fatty acid 18:3n-3 (Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA)), via desaturation and elongation. ALA, however, can not be synthesised by humans, and thus must be obtained from the diet (<LINK REF="REF-Haag-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haag 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ruxton-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruxton 2005</LINK>). Longer-chain n-3PUFAs can be formed in humans, but biological conversion is slow and inefficient, making diet an important source for these fatty acids as well (<LINK REF="REF-Ma-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ma 1995</LINK>). Dietary sources of ALA include certain nuts and seeds, such as walnuts, flaxseed and rapeseed (canola) oil. Dietary sources of the longer n-3PUFAs eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) include fatty fish, some white fish, shellfish and other seafood such as seaweed, and certain eggs and animal products, depending on the animal's diet (<LINK REF="REF-BNF-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-James-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">James 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ruxton-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruxton 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simopolous-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simopolous 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Links between n-3PUFAs and MDD were suggested following recognition of a reduction in the dietary consumption of n-3PUFAs in recent decades and an increase in depressive conditions (<LINK REF="REF-Simopolous-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simopolous 1999</LINK>). Coupled with the reduction in n-3PUFA intakes, intakes of n-6 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-6PUFAs) have also increased. Closely related to n-3PUFAs, n-6PUFAs (named from the positioning of the first double bond on the sixth carbon atom from the methyl end of the acyl chain) are derived from parent essential fatty acid 18:2n-6 (linoleic acid (LA)), and for synthesis, share the same desaturases and elongases as n-3PUFAs. n-3PUFAs and n-6PUFAs thus compete for synthesis from their parent fatty acids. Dietary sources of LA and n-6PUFAs include plant and vegetable seeds and oils, as found in margarines and many processed foods (<LINK REF="REF-James-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">James 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simopolous-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simopolous 1999</LINK>). Our traditional diet is thought to have contained approximately equal amounts of energy from n-3PUFAs and n-6PUFAs (<LINK REF="REF-Simopolous-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simopolous 1999</LINK>). By comparison, a current western diet is estimated to contain approximately five to 20 times more energy from n-6PUFAs than from n-3PUFAs (<LINK REF="REF-Gregory-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gregory 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simopolous-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simopolous 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Early work investigating population consumption levels of n-3PUFAs and n-3PUFA-rich foods, such as fish, suggested links with population levels of MDD and various psychiatric conditions (<LINK REF="REF-Hibbeln-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hibbeln 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Noaghiul-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noaghiul 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peet-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peet 2004</LINK>), and studies since have found similar associations. Within countries, n-3PUFA intakes have been negatively associated with depressive illness (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Silvers-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silvers 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tanskanen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tanskanen 2001</LINK>). In clinical studies, low levels of n-3PUFAs have been found in individuals diagnosed with MDD (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Edwards-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peet-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peet 1998</LINK>) and depressive disorders (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Garland-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garland 2007</LINK>), and reporting high levels of depressed mood (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Mamalakis-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mamalakis 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mamalakis-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mamalakis 2006</LINK>), compared to controls. Continuous relationships between n-3PUFA status and depressive symptoms have also been found (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Edwards-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 1998</LINK>). In randomised controlled trials (RCTs), beneficial effects of supplementation with n-3PUFAs compared to placebo have been reported for MDD (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Nemets-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Nemets 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Su-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Su 2003</LINK>) and depressive disorders (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Frangou-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frangou 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stoll-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 1999</LINK>).</P>

<P>The positive effects of n-3PUFAs on depressive illness are thought to occur as a result of changes to cell membrane structure and function, impacting particularly on cell communication, inflammatory processes and neurotransmitter activities (<LINK REF="REF-Haag-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haag 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-James-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">James 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ruxton-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruxton 2005</LINK>).

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-10-26 13:35:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>n-3PUFAs are known to be important in brain development and function, and have been linked to depression in a variety of studies, see <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>. Not all studies, however, report beneficial effects (see <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>), and reviews and meta-analyses clearly demonstrate variability between studies (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Appleton-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Appleton 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Appleton-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Appleton 2008b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Appleton-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Appleton 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lin-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parker-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2006b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stahl-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stahl 2008</LINK>). Meta-analyses reveal some small benefit of n-3PUFAs for depressive disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Appleton-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Appleton 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lin-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 2007</LINK>), but investigations of the heterogeneity also suggest differential effects of n-3PUFAs, depending primarily on severity of depressive symptoms at baseline (<LINK REF="REF-Appleton-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Appleton 2010</LINK>). Sensitivity analyses based on severity of depressive symptoms at baseline suggest no benefits of n-3PUFAs for individuals with mild depressive symptoms or without a diagnosis of depression, but provide some evidence of benefits in individuals with severe depressive symptoms or with depressive diagnoses (<LINK REF="REF-Appleton-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Appleton 2010</LINK>). These findings suggest a possible benefit of n-3PUFAs for MDD. This review investigates a role for n-3PUFAs as a treatment for MDD.</P>
<P>Other reviews investigating a role for n-3PUFAs in depressive disorders have recently been conducted (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Bloch-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bloch 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grosso-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grosso 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Martins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martins 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sublette-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sublette 2011</LINK>). These reviews typically use a very broad definition of depression to include a variety of depressive disorders and conditions, in a number of populations, including children. This review considers solely major or unipolar depressive disorder, and focuses on adults.</P>
<P>Various reviews of other treatments for MDD and other depressive disorders are also available. A recent search of the Cochrane Library revealed 407 completed reviews or reviews in progress focusing on treating or preventing depression. The majority of these reviews investigate pharmacological (e.g. antidepressant) or psychological (e.g. cognitive behavioural therapy) treatments for depressive conditions, or focus on specific clinical populations, e.g. people with stroke or people with diabetes mellitus. Only two of these reviews include n-3PUFAs, both focusing on antenatal and postnatal depression. One review investigates 'dietary supplements for preventing postnatal depression' (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2013</LINK>), and includes one study of n-3PUFAs. This study found no preventive impact of n-3PUFAs on the presence of postnatal depression. The other review (<LINK REF="REF-Dennis-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dennis 2013</LINK>) includes two trials investigating the use of n-3PUFAs for antenatal depression, and reports a beneficial effect on depression in one trial and no benefit in the other. One further review also focuses on a herbal treatment (St John's Wort) for depression (<LINK REF="REF-Linde-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Linde 2008</LINK>), but the active component of this plant-based treatment is unrelated to n-3PUFAs or other fatty acids.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR)</HEADING>
<P>The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group (CCDAN) maintain two clinical trials registers at their editorial base in Bristol, UK: a references register and a studies-based register. The CCDANCTR-References Register contains over 39,000 reports of RCTs in depression, anxiety and neurosis. Approximately 60% of these references have been tagged to individual, coded trials. The coded trials are held in the CCDANCTR-Studies Register and records are linked between the two registers through the use of unique Study ID tags. Coding of trials is based on the EU-Psi coding manual, using a controlled vocabulary (please contact the CCDAN Trials Search Co-ordinator for further details). Reports of trials for inclusion in the Group's registers are collated from routine (weekly), generic searches of MEDLINE (1950-), EMBASE (1974-) and PsycINFO (1967-); quarterly searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and review-specific searches of additional databases. Reports of trials are also sourced from international trials registers through the World Health Organization's trials portal (the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (<A HREF="http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/">ICTRP</A>)), pharmaceutical companies, the handsearching of key journals, conference proceedings and other (non-Cochrane) systematic reviews and meta-analyses.<BR/>Details of <A HREF="http://ccdan.cochrane.org/search-strategies-identification-studies">CCDAN's generic search strategies</A> (used to identify RCTs) can be found on the Group's website.</P>

<P>We investigated heterogeneity using the I² statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). We reported I² statistics and appropriate P values. We grouped the I² statistic into four bands for interpretation, as recommended in the<I> Cochrane Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). These bands were 0% to 40%: might not be important; 30% to 60%: may represent moderate heterogeneity; 50% to 90% may represent substantial heterogeneity; and 75% to 100%: considerable heterogeneity. We identified a priori possible sources of heterogeneity, to include the comparator used, publication bias, the presence or absence of comorbid conditions (physical and psychiatric), use of n-3PUFAs as a sole or adjunctive therapy, and the risks of bias. We investigated heterogeneity between studies based on the type of participants involved using subgroup analyses, and based on the risks of bias using sensitivity analyses. We also identified additional potential sources of heterogeneity during the review process. These included the use of EPA specifically as a treatment, the inclusion of ALA in placebo capsules, the use of data from per protocol analyses, the use of imputed standard deviations from other studies in analyses, and the consideration of multiple comparison groups from the same trial as individual studies. We explored these potential sources of heterogeneity using sensitivity analyses.</P>

<P>We combined trials reporting mean and standard deviation data using meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Sterne-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sterne 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>For continuous data, we calculated the standardised mean effect for all trials using Hedges' adjusted g (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2001</LINK>). Hedges&#8217; adjusted g is a formulation of effect size used in the SMD method that includes an adjustment to correct for small sample bias (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2001</LINK>). Studies were weighted using the inverse-variance method. We used random-effects models primarily to estimate the SMDs for all analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Egger-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sterne-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sterne 2001</LINK>). The random-effects model assumes non-identical effects in different studies, and can be preferable to a fixed-effect model where heterogeneity between studies is high and unexplained. We also applied a fixed-effect model as sensitivity analyses. Effect sizes are provided as means and standard deviations, and are related to specific scales to allow understanding by clinicians and practitioners.</P>

<P>This review includes 20 trials with a total of 1458 participants. The searches identified 677 records of potential relevance to our review. Following the removal of duplicates, 575 remained. Initial screening by title and abstract resulted in the removal of a further 422 records, to result in the retrieval of 153 full-text papers. Of these, 85 records were found to relate to RCTs of relevance to our review, while 68 records were excluded. Records were excluded at this stage because they did not: refer to an RCT, involve individuals or a subgroup of individuals with MDD, involve adults, test n-3PUFAs, involve a comparator, or they did not include depression outcomes. We only included trials in the review if we were sure that they met the eligibility criteria. Records that related to trials that are currently 'ongoing' and currently 'awaiting classification' remained in the review at this stage, but may be excluded once full details of these trials become available. We provide full details of the search results in the PRISMA flow diagram (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). We give the primary references to the trials they relate to as references for each study. Of these, the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Lucas-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lucas 2009</LINK> involves individuals both with and without MDD (and participants were stratified by diagnosis for randomisation), so we have included only the subgroup of individuals with MDD in our review. The Coryell trial includes tests of two doses of n-3PUFA (approximately 1 g/d, and approximately 2 g/d); the Da Silva 2005 trial involves individuals who were randomised depending on antidepressant status (antidepressants use/no antidepressant use) at trial entry; the Jazayeri 2008 trial involves two separate comparator groups (placebo/antidepressant); the Mischoulon 2015 trial includes tests of an enriched EPA treatment and an enriched DHA treatment; and the Peet 2002 trial includes tests of three doses of n-3PUFA (1 g/d, 2 g/d, 4 g/d). In these five trials, all groups were independent, and we have considered each as a separate study. This has resulted in the inclusion in analyses of 26 independent studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bot-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bot 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carney-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Carney 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coryell-_x0028_1g_x002f_d_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Coryell (1g/d)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coryell-_x0028_2g_x002f_d_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Coryell (2g/d)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Da-Silva-_x0028_AD_x0029_-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Da Silva (AD) 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Da-Silva-_x0028_nAD_x0029_-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Da Silva (nAD) 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gertsik-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Gertsik 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gharekhani-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Gharekhani 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gonzalez-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Gonzalez 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grenyer-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Grenyer 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jazayeri-_x0028_v-placebo_x0029_-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Jazayeri (v placebo) 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jazayeri-_x0028_v-AD_x0029_-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Jazayeri (v AD) 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lesp_x00e9_rance-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lespérance 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lucas-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lucas 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marangell-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Marangell 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mischoulon-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Mischoulon 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mischoulon-_x0028_DHA_x0029_-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Mischoulon (DHA) 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mischoulon-_x0028_EPA_x0029_-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Mischoulon (EPA) 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nemets-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Nemets 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Park-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Park 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peet-_x0028_1g_x002f_d_x0029_-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Peet (1g/d) 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peet-_x0028_2g_x002f_d_x0029_-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Peet (2g/d) 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peet-_x0028_4g_x002f_d_x0029_-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Peet (4g/d) 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rondanelli-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rondanelli 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Silvers-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Silvers 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Su-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Su 2003</LINK>).</P>

Details are based on trial registrations (we have had no correspondence with authors of ongoing studies).

Some of the studies that are currently included as ongoing studies may be excluded from updates of the review once study details become clearer following completion and publication. Only subgroups of participants in some studies may also be included in subsequent updates, depending on inclusion/exclusion criteria and randomisation procedures. Some trials, for example, focus on adolescents, but include individuals aged up to 25 years (<LINK REF="STD-Amminger-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Amminger 2013</LINK>), and while the majority of respondents in this trial may not be relevant to our review, it may be possible to include a subset of individuals over 18 years, dependent on randomisation procedures.</P>

<P>We judged six studies to be at low risk of bias for blinding of study participants and personnel to treatment allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Bot-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bot 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lesp_x00e9_rance-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lespérance 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lucas-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lucas 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nemets-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Nemets 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rondanelli-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rondanelli 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Silvers-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Silvers 2005</LINK>). In these studies, blinding was undertaken by adding a small amount of fish oil to the comparator treatment to control for fishy aftertaste and/or adding flavours to both treatments to mask a fishy aftertaste, and following investigation, blinding was found to be successful. We judged 13 studies at high risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Carney-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Carney 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Da-Silva-_x0028_AD_x0029_-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Da Silva (AD) 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Da-Silva-_x0028_nAD_x0029_-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Da Silva (nAD) 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gertsik-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Gertsik 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gharekhani-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Gharekhani 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grenyer-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Grenyer 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jazayeri-_x0028_v-placebo_x0029_-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Jazayeri (v placebo) 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jazayeri-_x0028_v-AD_x0029_-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Jazayeri (v AD) 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mischoulon-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Mischoulon 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Park-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Park 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peet-_x0028_1g_x002f_d_x0029_-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Peet (1g/d) 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peet-_x0028_2g_x002f_d_x0029_-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Peet (2g/d) 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peet-_x0028_4g_x002f_d_x0029_-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Peet (4g/d) 2002</LINK>). In these studies, there were no reports of attempting to mask the fishy taste of the intervention, despite good descriptions of the placebo otherwise, and no assessment to check successful concealment. In one study, the majority of participants correctly guessed their allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Grenyer-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Grenyer 2007</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Blinding of Outcome assessment</HEADING>
<P>We judged the blinding of outcome assessments depending on the individuals making the assessment (participant, researcher, clinician) and the blinding of those persons, as detailed in the blinding of participants and personnel. Thus, we rated participant-rated measures at a low risk of bias if we considered participants to be successfully blinded to treatment allocation, at unclear risk of bias if blinding was unclear, and at high risk of bias if we considered participants not to be successfully blinded. We treated personnel-rated measures in a similar fashion. In all cases, we used study reports of the individuals making the assessment if possible, or used standard assessments if details were not specified, e.g. in standard practice, the BDI is a self-report instrument for completion by patients. Where multiple outcome measures were used and these were given different judgements of risk of bias, we took the key risk of bias judgement to be the one applicable to the outcome measure we used in our analyses.</P>

<P>n-3PUFAs were more effective than placebo: SMD = -0.30 (95% CI -0.50 to -0.10) (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>, <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>, <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>), but effect sizes are small to modest, and there was substantial evidence of heterogeneity between studies (I² = 59%). Confidence intervals also range between a very small and a modest effect size, and suggest a possible clinically important effect at their upper end. Using GRADE criteria, we judged the quality of the evidence to be very low.

We reversed scores for the GAF and SF-36, so that in all scales a higher score denotes poorer quality of life.</P>
<P>There was no strong evidence of a statistical difference in quality of life between n-3PUFA and placebo groups: SMD = -0.47 (95% CI -0.99 to 0.06). Confidence intervals range between a negligible and a large effect size, suggesting both a possible absence of effect at the lower end, and a possible important effect at the upper end.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Analyses based on comorbidities</HEADING>
<P>There was a suggestion of greater effect sizes (n-3PUFAs compared to placebo) in depressive symptomology (continuous) in studies including individuals with comorbid conditions: SMD = -0.54 (95% CI -1.21 to 0.12; 5 studies, 229 participants), and in studies including individuals without comorbid conditions: SMD = -0.99 (95% CI -1.71 to -0.27; 3 studies, 104 participants), compared to studies with a mix of individuals with comorbid and without comorbid conditions: SMD = -0.13 (95% CI -0.30 to 0.05; 17 studies, 1040 participants) (see <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>, <LINK REF="FIG-13" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 13</LINK>). The number of studies and the number of individuals in each subgroup however were small, particularly in the subgroup of studies including individuals without comorbid conditions (3 studies, 104 participants), confidence intervals are very wide, suggesting that effects could range from much stronger effects to those that are negligible, and the evidence of heterogeneity within each subgroup was high (I² = 28% to 77%). There was statistical evidence of a difference between subgroups (P = 0.04), but the evidence of heterogeneity between subgroups was high (I² = 68%).</P>
<P>Rates of adverse events were similar across the subgroups. Analysis of studies including individuals with comorbid conditions (OR = 2.66 (95% CI 0.22 to 31.93); 3 studies, 201 participants), studies including individuals without comorbid conditions (OR = 0.82 (95% CI 0.19 to 3.50) 2 studies, 69 participants), and studies with a mix of individuals with and without comorbid conditions (OR = 1.40 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.89) 14 studies, 937 participants) indicated no statistical evidence of a difference between subgroups (P = 0.68), and no evidence of heterogeneity between subgroups (I² = 0%) (see <LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>). Heterogeneity was high in the subgroup of studies including individuals with comorbid conditions (I² = 71%), but low in the other two subgroups (I² = 0%), and confidence intervals are again very wide, suggesting possible effects that could range between a reduction in events with n-3PUFAs of 89% to an increase in events of 3193%.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">4. Analyses based on adjunctive therapy</HEADING>
<P>The effect of n-3PUFAs compared to placebo in depressive symptomology (continuous) in studies with a mix of individuals receiving and not receiving adjunctive therapy was SMD = -0.43 (95% CI -0.82 to -0.04; 7 studies, 709 participants), in studies with individuals not receiving adjunctive therapy was SMD = -0.32 (95% CI -0.86 to 0.21; 6 studies, 308 participants), and in studies only including individuals receiving adjunctive therapy was SMD = -0.16 (95% CI -0.38 to 0.05; 12 studies, 356 participants). There was no statistical evidence of a difference between subgroups (P = 0.48) (see <LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>, <LINK REF="FIG-14" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 14</LINK>). However, the number of studies and the number of individuals in each subgroup were small, and confidence intervals are very wide, suggesting that effects could range from a large beneficial effect of n-3PUFAs to a small negative effect, compared with placebo. There was no evidence of heterogeneity between subgroups (I² = 0%), and evidence of heterogeneity was low in the subgroup of studies including individuals receiving adjunctive therapy (I² = 0%). However, heterogeneity was high in the other two subgroups (I² = 76% and 77% respectively).</P>
<P>Rates of adverse events were similar across the subgroups. Analysis of studies with a mix of individuals receiving and not receiving adjunctive therapy: OR = 1.16 (95% CI 0.81 to 1.65; 6 studies, 644 participants), studies including individuals not receiving adjunctive therapy: OR = 2.04 (95% CI 1.03 to 4.03; 4 studies, 259 participants), and studies including individuals receiving adjunctive therapy: OR = 0.97 (95% CI 0.56 to 1.70; 9 studies, 304 participants) indicated that there was no statistical evidence of a difference between subgroups (P = 0.23) and some evidence of heterogeneity between subgroups (I² = 32%), see <LINK REF="CMP-004.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.2</LINK>. However, confidence intervals are very wide and suggest possible effects ranging from a reduction in adverse events with n-3PUFAs to a large increase in adverse events, compared with placebo.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-12-14 16:30:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sarah  R Davies">
<P>We found trials comparing the impact of n-3PUFAs on major depressive disorder (MDD) to two different comparators. Twenty-five studies involving 1438 participants investigated the impact of n-3PUFAs in MDD compared to placebo, and one study involving 40 participants investigated the impact of n-3PUFAs in MDD compared to antidepressant treatment.</P>
<P>For the comparison with placebo, we provide a 'Summary of findings' table (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Our primary outcomes were depressive symptomology assessed using a continuous measure, and adverse events. Mean depressive symptomology in n-3PUFA groups was 0.30 (95% CI 0.10 to 0.50) standard deviations lower than placebo following treatment. This small-to-modest effect size represents a difference between groups in scores on the HDRS (17-item) of approximately 2.1 (0.7 to 3.5 respectively). NICE guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2004</LINK>) have previously suggested a reduction in HDRS score of 3 or more to be clinically meaningful, thus the clinical significance of our effect size is small. The confidence intervals do not exclude a clinically meaningful effect, but also include a negligible effect at the lower end. Furthermore, the completeness and quality of the evidence was very low (see below).</P>
<P>Numbers of individuals experiencing adverse events were similar between intervention and placebo groups, although assessments of adverse events were suitable for analysis in only 19 of the 25 studies, and our confidence intervals suggest that effects could range from a small reduction to a modest increase in adverse events in n-3PUFA groups compared with placebo. Furthermore, the completeness and quality of the evidence providing these results was also very low.</P>
<P>Rates of depression remission and response were also similar following n-3PUFA supplementation compared to placebo, but confidence intervals again suggest a range of possible effects from a small reduction in remission and response rates to a large increase. Quality of life was similar in n-3PUFA compared with placebo groups, although our confidence intervals again suggest both a possible negligible effect and a possible clinically important benefit of n-3PUFAs compared to placebo. Rates of failure to complete were also similar between intervention and placebo groups, although our confidence intervals again suggest possible effects that could range from a small reduction to a modest increase in study withdrawals in n-3PUFA groups compared with placebo.</P>
<P>There was only one study involving 40 participants for the comparison with antidepressants. This study found no differences between treatment with n-3PUFAs and treatment with antidepressants in depressive symptomology (MD (HDRS(24 item))= -0.70 (95% CI: -5.88 to 4.48)), rates of response to treatment, or failure to complete. Adverse events were not reported in a manner suitable for analysis, and rates of depression remission and quality of life were not reported.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-10-30 13:46:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sarah  R Davies">
<P>The evidence for both comparisons and for all outcomes is limited and highly heterogeneous, resulting in findings that are imprecise and potentially biased.</P>
<P>Firstly, for the comparison with placebo, the evidence comes from 25 studies, involving only 1438 participants and with only 1373 participants contributing to the analysis. While data are available from all studies for the analyses on our primary outcome of depressive symptomology, only small numbers of studies contributed to some of our outcomes.</P>
<P>The studies available were highly heterogeneous. All studies were directly relevant to our research question, but we found considerable differences in all aspects of study methodology. Studies differed in the type of participants involved, the interventions used, the comparators used, the duration of supplementation, and the range and measurement of outcomes assessed.</P>
<P>The majority of available studies were also small. Almost half of all participants derive from only three trials: <LINK REF="STD-Carney-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Carney 2009</LINK> (122 participants), <LINK REF="STD-Lesp_x00e9_rance-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lespérance 2011</LINK> (432 participants), and the Mischoulon 2015 trial (196 participants). We judged these trials to be at low risk of bias on most measures, but the contribution of these three trials to our overall outcomes was high, even using a random-effects model (depressive symptomology - 26.9%; adverse events - 82%), and the outcomes of our meta-analyses reflect the outcomes of these specific trials. All three trials found a negligible mean difference between n-3PUFA and placebo groups following supplementation. Biases or methodologically specific outcomes in these trials may have contributed to our overall result. All three trials, for example, include participants with comorbidities, use an intervention composed of a combination of EPA and DHA, and assess effects of supplementation after eight to ten weeks. All of these factors may have affected study outcomes, which in turn may have affected our overall outcome.</P>
<P>The funnel plot also suggests an absence of small studies showing null findings. This asymmetry suggests probable publication bias, and suggests that our analyses and overall effect size estimates may be biased towards a positive finding for n-3PUFAs compared to the true situation. Sensitivity analyses using a fixed-effect model also demonstrated a smaller standardised mean difference between n-3PUFA and placebo groups than that found using a random-effects model, suggesting a positive influence from small positive studies in our main analyses.</P>
<P>Sensitivity analyses using only the studies that we judged to be at low risk of bias also suggest bias in our main analyses towards a positive finding for n-3PUFAs. Many studies we judged to be at high risk of bias in various domains. Analyses using only studies that we judged to be at low risk of selection bias, performance bias and attrition bias report smaller effect sizes than those found in our main analyses, and confidence intervals include the possibility of no differences between groups. This evidence, alongside that of the funnel plot and the findings using a fixed-effects model suggest that the true effect of n-3PUFAs is likely to be smaller than that reported in our main analyses.</P>
<P>Imprecise effect size estimates were found for all outcomes. In all analyses, possible effects range from negligible (and in some analyses from negative) effects to important clinical benefits. While this imprecision does not rule out clinically relevant effects, considerable caution must be used in interpreting all effect size estimates. Further evidence, in the form of adequately-powered well-designed trials, is clearly required before firm conclusions can be drawn.</P>
<P>Findings in our primary outcome of depressive symptomology and our secondary outcome of quality of life also demonstrate considerable evidence of heterogeneity. Subgroup analyses investigated possible sources, based on the inclusion of individuals with/without comorbid conditions and the inclusion of individuals using/not using adjunctive therapy, but we found little explanation for this heterogeneity. There is some evidence of different effects depending on the presence or absence of comorbid conditions, and this has also been suggested in individual trials (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Lesp_x00e9_rance-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lespérance 2011</LINK>), but effects are currently far from clear. Limited studies contribute to each subgroup in our analyses, there is considerable evidence of heterogeneity, and there is considerable overlap in effect size estimates for different subgroups. Limited explanation was also gained from the analyses on adjunctive therapy, where few differences between subgroups were found, although findings again are far from conclusive.</P>
<P>Sensitivity analyses also investigated the impact of other aspects of study methodology. Analyses investigating the effects of treatment solely or predominantly with EPA revealed a stronger beneficial effect of n-3PUFAs compared to placebo than we found in our main analyses, although precision also decreases further, allowing the possibility of negligible effects. Effects size estimates also increase with the removal of studies that use placebos containing ALA. This analysis suggests that ALA may confer some impacts on depressive symptomology similar to those of the longer chain n-3PUFAs EPA and DHA, but very few studies were available for assessment. The possibility of different effects depending of n-3PUFA type is interesting, and has been suggested elsewhere in the literature (<LINK REF="REF-Martins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martins 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ross-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ross 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sublette-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sublette 2011</LINK>), although much of this speculation is based on post-hoc observation, and only one current trial directly compares the impact of EPA and DHA treatments (<LINK REF="STD-Mischoulon-_x0028_DHA_x0029_-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Mischoulon (DHA) 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mischoulon-_x0028_EPA_x0029_-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Mischoulon (EPA) 2015</LINK>), and found no differences. Mechanisms of action to explain different effects from different n-3PUFAs are hypothesised (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Ross-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ross 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sublette-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sublette 2011</LINK>). Proposed mechanisms for action, however, largely focus on the specific actions of EPA and DHA, while offering little suggestion for a potential impact of ALA.</P>
<P>Sensitivity analyses investigating the methods used to conduct analyses reveal few differences in findings from those in our main analyses, although the removal of studies where we imputed standard deviations reduced effect sizes and improved precision.</P>
<P>Only one study was available for the comparison with antidepressant treatment. This study was small, with 20 participants randomised to each treatment arm, and 20% of participants in each arm failed to complete the study. Adverse events were reported by the number of events rather than the number of individuals suffering, remission rates were not reported, but response rates and failure to complete data were supplied.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-10-30 13:50:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The quality of the evidence for both comparisons for all outcomes is very low to low. Our judgements of quality according to GRADE are given in the <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>For the placebo comparison, for our primary outcome of depressive symptomology, we considered the quality of evidence to be very low. The body of evidence was composed of limited, predominantly small studies, within which there was substantial evidence of heterogeneity that remains unexplained. Furthermore, the majority of the contributing studies include judgements of high risk of bias in at least one of the domains assessed, and sensitivity analyses reveal different findings in analyses using all studies and analyses using only studies judged to be at low risk of selection bias, performance bias or attrition bias. In all analyses using only studies judged to be at low risk of bias, regardless of the measure of bias used, we found that n-3PUFAs did not impact on depressive symptomology, compared to placebo. We found similar results from the three large well-conducted trials mentioned earlier (<LINK REF="STD-Carney-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Carney 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lesp_x00e9_rance-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lespérance 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mischoulon-_x0028_DHA_x0029_-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Mischoulon (DHA) 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mischoulon-_x0028_EPA_x0029_-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Mischoulon (EPA) 2015</LINK>). As stated earlier, the consideration of risk of bias suggests bias in our main analyses towards a positive finding for n-3PUFAs, as a result of a high risk of bias in many of the contributing studies. These findings suggest that the positive effect of n-3PUFAs in our main analyses is a consequence predominantly of the inclusion of studies that may be at high risk of bias. The true effect size estimate is thus likely to be smaller than that provided by our main analyses.</P>
<P>For our second primary outcome of adverse events, the quality of evidence was very low. There was limited evidence of heterogeneity between studies in this analysis, but confidence intervals are wide, suggesting a range of possible effects; data were only available from selected studies, and visual inspection of the funnel plot suggests probable publication bias. Analyses using only studies judged to be at low risk of selection bias, low risk of performance bias, or low risk of attrition bias suggest similar effects as those presented in our main analyses.</P>
<P>For our secondary outcomes of depression remission and response rates, the quality of the evidence was low. Heterogeneity between studies was low, but confidence intervals are very wide, suggesting a broad range of possible effects, selected studies only were available for these analyses, and we judged various elements of these studies to be at high risk of bias.</P>
<P>For our secondary outcome of quality of life, the quality of the evidence was very low. Selected studies only were available for these analyses, confidence intervals are very wide, suggesting a broad range of possible effects, there was high heterogeneity, and we judged various elements of these studies to be at high risk of bias.</P>
<P>For our secondary outcome of failure to complete, the quality of the evidence was low. Most studies were available for this analysis, and heterogeneity between studies was low, but confidence intervals are again wide, suggesting a range of possible effects, and visual inspection of the funnel plot suggests a high probability of publication bias.</P>
<P>For the antidepressant comparison, the quality of the evidence was low. Evidence for this analysis came from only one study. We judged this study to be at high risk of bias for allocation concealment, because the randomisation sequence was not concealed from researchers; for performance bias, because no steps were reported to mask the fishy taste of the intervention or check concealment; for attrition bias, due to a 20% dropout rate; and for reporting bias, because some outcomes have not yet been published. We judged data on depressive symptomology to be at low risk of bias due to good blinding of study personnel, but we judged data on adverse events to be at high risk of detection bias because these were reported by participants, and adequate blinding was unclear. We considered risk of attrition bias for adverse events to be low.</P>
<P>Inconsistency in trial reporting for both comparisons was obvious. Depressive symptomology was frequently reported and analysed using non-ITT data (assuming a definition of ITT based on number randomised). Adverse events were reported in a variety of ways: by individual and event for all events, by individual for all events, by individual for only serious, likely or frequent events, by event type for all events, by event type for only serious, likely related or frequent events, or a combination of these. Adverse events were included for analysis (based on the number of individuals) in 19 of 25 of the studies. Our secondary outcomes of remission and response in depressive symptomology and quality of life were not well reported. Numbers of participants who failed to complete each trial were well reported.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-10-19 15:35:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The findings of this review are likely to be biased, due to the evidence available to contribute to analyses. Only a limited number of studies were available for assessing all outcomes for both comparisons, only a few studies were available for assessing some outcomes, and there was a high relative weighting in all analyses for the placebo comparison from three large studies.</P>
<P>The review process also may have been biased. Our searches were more likely to detect articles published in English and in mainstream journals. We tried to minimise this bias by including translated articles, but translations were only undertaken for full articles that we selected for inclusion based on titles and abstracts. We were also unable to contact authors of some articles that may have been relevant. We excluded these articles, based on the information available to us, but increased information would have reduced this bias. We made judgements of risk of bias according to predefined rules, but the information required to make these judgements was infrequently published, and our correspondence with authors was again incomplete. Judgements of risk of bias, however, were completed following all data collection, so did not impact on the review process. Reliance on available data (even from authors), also meant that only a few studies could contribute to certain analyses. Remission and response rates were not assessed in all studies, but could have been calculated had raw data been available. Most studies did not assess quality of life. We relied on authors of existing relevant studies or trial registrations for information on unpublished studies. Our searches covered relevant conference-based publications, but we made no further attempts to find or identify unpublished literature.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-12-14 16:30:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sarah  R Davies">
<P>Published reviews and meta-analyses are available investigating a role for n-3PUFAs for depression compared to placebo. Many of these have focused on randomised controlled trials, but most use a broad definition of depression to consider studies of individuals with a range of depressive diagnoses, including bipolar disorder and postpartum depression, and studies of individuals with depressive symptomology regardless of psychiatric condition. Early reviews tended to use a broader working definition of depressive symptomology, to allow inclusion of adequate studies for analyses, but more recent reviews have used tighter inclusion criteria.</P>
<P>Of recent reviews, the review by <LINK REF="REF-Grosso-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grosso 2014</LINK> reports two meta-analyses, one of studies of individuals with a formal diagnosis, and one of studies of individuals with high levels of depressive symptomology but no formal diagnosis. The analysis of studies of individuals with a formal MDD diagnosis includes nine of the studies included in our analyses, but also includes two additional reports of <LINK REF="STD-Rondanelli-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rondanelli 2010</LINK>, and includes both the placebo and the antidepressant comparisons in <LINK REF="STD-Jazayeri-_x0028_v-placebo_x0029_-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Jazayeri (v placebo) 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Jazayeri-_x0028_v-AD_x0029_-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Jazayeri (v AD) 2008</LINK>), without taking account of the use of the same placebo group. This analysis provides a combined effect size estimate, representing a beneficial effect of n-3PUFAs, of SMD = 0.56 (95% CI 0.20 to 0.92). The analysis of studies of individuals with high depressive symptomology but no formal diagnosis of MDD includes four of the studies included in our analysis (although individuals in the control group in <LINK REF="STD-Peet-_x0028_1g_x002f_d_x0029_-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Peet (1g/d) 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peet-_x0028_2g_x002f_d_x0029_-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Peet (2g/d) 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peet-_x0028_4g_x002f_d_x0029_-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Peet (4g/d) 2002</LINK> are included repeatedly), but also includes seven other studies that we discounted from our review on the basis that individuals with low or moderate depression were also included in intervention groups, and could confound findings. This analysis produced a combined effect size estimate of SMD = 0.22 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.43), and the two analyses together result in a combined effect size estimate of SMD = 0.38 (95% CI 0.18 to 0.59) (I² = 55%). This combined estimate is very similar to that achieved in our analyses, even though these additional studies were included and six of those identified for inclusion in our review did not contribute, including the large trial by <LINK REF="STD-Lesp_x00e9_rance-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lespérance 2011</LINK>.</P>
<P>The review by Bloch and Hannestad (<LINK REF="REF-Bloch-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bloch 2012</LINK>) is a review of 13 studies of individuals with MDD. This analysis includes nine studies that we included in our review, but also includes one study in mild-moderate depression (<LINK REF="REF-Rogers-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rogers 2008</LINK>), and three studies in MDD associated with pregnancy. The use of the full study or only the relevant subgroup in <LINK REF="STD-Lucas-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lucas 2009</LINK> is also unclear. Ten of the studies in our review, all published in 2008 or later, were not included. The analysis reports no effects of n-3PUFAs compared to placebo (SMD = 0.11, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.26, P = 0.14), but has been criticised elsewhere (<LINK REF="REF-Lin-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 2012</LINK>) for the inclusion of the trials by <LINK REF="REF-Rogers-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rogers 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Lucas-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lucas 2009</LINK>, due to their inclusion of individuals without a formal MDD diagnosis. Reanalysis of the results of the remaining 11 studies demonstrates a small beneficial effect of n-3PUFAs for MDD compared to placebo, of SMD = 0.29 (95% CI 0.10 to 0.48). This result is very similar to that provided by our analyses.</P>
<P>The review by <LINK REF="REF-Martins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martins 2011</LINK> includes 35 studies of depressive symptomology, and includes a separate analysis of 14 studies of individuals with MDD. Thirteen of these studies were also included in our review, and their analyses provide a combined effect size estimate, representing a benefit of n-3PUFAs: SMD = -0.45 (95% CI -0.75 to -0.15). This finding is larger than that found in our analyses, but the confidence intervals are wide and include the effect size estimates from our analyses.</P>
<P>The review by <LINK REF="REF-Sublette-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sublette 2011</LINK> covers 19 trials, 13 of which are also included in our review, while two trials were studies of individuals with a primary diagnosis of bipolar disorder, three were studies of individuals with postpartum depression, and one study included individuals with mild-moderate as opposed to severe depression. This review investigates specifically the percentage of EPA provided (&#8805; 60% vs &lt; 60%) as a source of heterogeneity, and does not report a combined effect size estimate for all studies.</P>
<P>Similar findings from several meta-analyses, despite the inclusion and exclusion of different trials, may suggest a consistent effect of n-3PUFAs versus placebo, but the consistency is more likely in the limited evidence available for investigating these effects. All reviews are based on the same very limited pool of studies, and report wide confidence intervals and so a wide range of possible effects, substantial heterogeneity between studies, and a high probability of publication bias.</P>
<P>Our effect size estimate is also comparable to some degree with that suggested by recent meta-analyses of the effects of antidepressants for MDD, compared to placebo. <LINK REF="REF-Kirsch-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirsch 2008</LINK> reports a weighted mean difference using the HDRS between antidepressant and placebo groups in 35 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) registered studies of 1.8 HDRS scores, SMD = 0.32 (95% CI 0.25 to 0.40). <LINK REF="REF-Turner-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 2008</LINK> reports a mean weighted effect size of 0.37 (95% CI 0.33 to 0.41) from published and 0.15 (95% CI 0.08 to 0.22) from unpublished US FDA-registered studies. <LINK REF="REF-Fountoulakis-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fountoulakis 2013</LINK>, in an analysis of recent meta-analyses, confirms a SMD of 0.32 (95% CI: 0.25 to 0.40), as the result from the most appropriate analysis of the <LINK REF="REF-Kirsch-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirsch 2008</LINK> data set. Some evidence is available again suggesting greater effect sizes dependent on depression severity, e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Fournier-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fournier 2010</LINK> reports an effect size of d = 0.17 (95% CI 0.04 to 0.30) in a patient-level analysis of severe MDD cases, and of d = 0.47 (95% CI 0.34 to 0.59) in very severe MDD cases, but limitations in the data available reduce the value of these conclusions. Confidence intervals, however, are much tighter for the analyses of antidepressants than was found in our analyses, suggesting greater precision in these effect size estimates. Analyses of antidepressants suggest effect size estimates that range from small to modest, while our findings on n-3PUFAs also allow the inclusion of possible negligible effects. The apparent comparability in effect size estimates between our findings and those of reviews on antidepressants should not be taken as evidence in support of n-3PUFAs. The small size of the overall effect size estimate for both n-3PUFAs and antidepressants should argue not for a favourable comparison of n-3PUFAs with antidepressants, but for increased demand for more effective treatments for depressive symptomology from elsewhere.</P>

<P>At present, we do not have sufficient high quality evidence to determine the effects of n-3PUFAs as a treatment for MDD. Our primary analyses suggest a small-to-modest, non-clinically beneficial effect of n-3PUFAs on depressive symptomology compared to placebo, although the effect size estimate is imprecise, and the quality of the evidence on which this result is based is low to very low. Sensitivity analyses, funnel plot inspection and comparison of our results with those of large well-conducted trials also suggest that this effect size estimate is likely to be biased towards a positive finding for n-3PUFAs, and that the true effect is likely to be smaller. The one study in our review that directly compares n-3PUFAs and antidepressants finds comparable benefit, but the quality of the evidence here is very low. Our data suggest similar rates of adverse events and numbers failing to complete trials in n-3PUFA and placebo groups. The data on adverse events and failure to complete are again of low quality, but given the high rates of adverse events associated with some antidepressants, n-3PUFAs may offer an alternative treatment of possible benefit and reduced side effects. However, whether all possible negative side effects are studied in trials is questionable, and high dropout rates as a result of lack of improvement testify to the negative side effects of false hope. Failure to seek or administer conventional treatment, as a result of treatment with n-3PUFAs, may also represent an opportunity cost. We need more evidence, and particularly more complete evidence, regarding both the positive and negative effects of n-3PUFAs for MDD.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-10-30 14:01:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>More adequately-powered well-designed studies are required to increase the evidence base, and explore particularly the heterogeneity found between studies investigating the impact of n-3PUFAs on depressive symptomology. Many studies are currently underway, but studies that compare n-3PUFAs with usual antidepressant treatment, and studies to investigate differing effects depending on individual characteristics and study methodology are important. Our review suggests similar effects for n-3PUFAs and antidepressant treatment for depressive symptomology, but benefits of n-3PUFAs in terms of adverse events, compliance and patient acceptability are often provided by practitioners. Studies that compare n-3PUFAs with antidepressant treatment on all possible outcomes are required. Long-term benefits, long-term acceptability and long-term compliance are rarely considered, and neither is cost effectiveness. Studies comparing individuals and different treatments are also needed. Studies do find positive effects, and identification of those who are likely to benefit, or the particular treatments of beneficial impact would be of value. Mechanistic studies are also preferentially required. Hypotheses investigating differential effects depending on participant type or study methodology should be based on proposed mechanisms to increase efficacy, as opposed to post hoc comparisons of individual studies. Future research should target the elucidation of mechanisms both for the development and treatment of MDD, and should identify the possible actions in these pathways for n-3PUFAs.</P>

<PRO_REV_DIFF MODIFIED="2015-10-19 15:55:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The following differences between protocol and review have arisen, for the reasons provided:</P>
<P>Protocol: "Only studies involving adults (18 years and over) will be included". Review: One study involving adults (16 years and over) is included (<LINK REF="STD-Gharekhani-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Gharekhani 2014</LINK>). Age 16 years is the definition of adult in the country in which this study was undertaken.</P>
<P>Protocol: "Studies will be included regardless of participant medication". Review: Studies were included regardless of participant medication and other treatments for depressive symptomology, so we have stated "Studies were included regardless of participant use of adjunctive therapy".</P>
<P>Protocol: "Experimental intervention: Studies will be included regardless of source of n-3PUFA provided ..., but records of differences will be made". Review: Records of differences based on source of n-3PUFA provided were made and have been investigated in sensitivity analyses. We conducted sensitivity analyses following the publication of a number of similar comparisons since the conception of this review, and following reviewers' comments.</P>
<P>Protocol: "Where studies use multiple time points, data will be tabulated for all outcomes at all time points where assessments have been made, but only those of longest follow-up will be included in statistical analyses". Review: Data for all time points have not been tabulated. This has not been done due to the variety of time points used across studies, and the difficulty and low value of comparing across varied time points.</P>
<P>Protocol: "Complementary searches will be conducted .... in BIOSIS Citation Index (1969 to date), and Web of Science (1900 to date)". Review: These searches were not completed. We decided that due to the topic of the review, searches in Biosis and Web of Science would be very unlikely to reveal additional studies.</P>
<P>Protocol: "We will assess the risk of bias according to the following domains. 1. Random sequence generation, 2. Allocation concealment, 3. Blinding of participants and personnel, 4. Blinding of outcome assessment, 5. Incomplete outcome data, 6. Selective outcome reporting, 7. Other bias". Review: We have made assessments of outcome data (blinding of outcome assessment, and incomplete outcome data) separately for each primary outcome. This was done because different judgements could be given to different outcome assessments for some studies, depending on methods of measurement, and it was meaningless to try and combine these.</P>
<P>Protocol: "Data from subgroups of little relevance to the research question, e.g. groups of males and females, will be recorded as reported, and subsequently combined for analysis". Review: Data have not been presented separately for subgroups of little relevance to the research question, because we found none.</P>
<P>Protocol: "Adverse effects and failure to complete data will not be statistically summarised". Review: We have statistically summarised data on adverse effects and failure to complete, where data were available. We did this becuase of the amount of data available and the value of these statistical summaries.</P>
<P>Protocol: Subgroup analyses will be conducted "using only studies in which participants are clearly identified as having comorbid conditions, and using only studies in which participants are clearly identified as being without comorbid conditions. Studies where participants with and without comorbid conditions were mixed, and studies that do not clearly identify whether participants have comorbid conditions or not, will not be included in this analysis". Review: We have conducted subgroup analyses based on comorbidities using all studies. We did this to allow investigation of effects of comorbidities in the whole data set.</P>
<P>Protocol: Subgroup analyses will be conducted "using only studies in which participants are clearly identified as receiving adjunct therapy, and using only studies in which participants are clearly identified as not receiving adjunct therapy. Studies where participants with adjunct therapies are mixed, and studies that do not clearly identify whether participants are receiving or not receiving adjunct therapies will not be included in this analysis". Review: We have conducted subgroup analyses based on adjunctive therapy using all studies. We did this to allow investigation of effects of adjunctive therapy in the whole data set. For these analyses, We have defined adjunctive therapy as including psychotherapy as well as antidepressant medication, and we have limited it to adjunctive therapies for depression.</P>
<P>Protocol: Sensitivity analyses on risk of bias will be conducted where "low risk of bias will be defined as in the <I>Cochrane Handbook </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>)". Review: we have further defined low risk of bias as "using (i) selection bias, measured using allocation concealment; (ii) performance bias, using blinding of participants and personnel; (iii) attrition bias, using incomplete outcome data. We conducted three separate analyses, one for each type of bias".</P>
<P>We conducted sensitivity analyses that we had not proposed in the protocol. These analyses investigated possible methodological sources of heterogeneity that became apparent during the review or the write-up processes, or both. These sensitivity analyses are provided in the review as "additional sensitivity analyses", to distinguish them from our preplanned sensitivity analyses. We applied the sensitivity analyses using a fixed-effect model to all outcomes for completeness, but restricted all other sensitivity analyses to testing only our primary outcomes.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Planned methods not used in the review</HEADING>
<P>Protocol: Unit of analysis issues: Cross-over RCTs: We will include only the first study phase of cross-over RCTs in analyses. We think cross-over RCTs are unlikely to be used in this field. Cluster-RCTs: We will include cluster-RCTs in primary analyses, where cluster will act as the unit of investigation. We think cluster-RCTs are unlikely to be used in this field. Review: We have not used these methods because we did not find any cross-over or cluster-RCTs during our searches. The statements in the protocol will be applied where appropriate in future updates of the review.</P>

<P>The positive effects of n-3PUFAs on depressive illness are thought to occur as a result of integration into the cell membrane phospholipid bilayer, resulting in changes in structure and function (<LINK REF="REF-Haag-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haag 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-James-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">James 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ruxton-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruxton 2005</LINK>). Incorporation into the cell membrane can influence the physical state of the membrane, resulting in increased fluidity and permeability (<LINK REF="REF-Ehringer-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ehringer 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hirashima-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirashima 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tappia-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tappia 1997</LINK>), possibly aiding cross-cell membrane transport and communication (<LINK REF="REF-Haag-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haag 2003</LINK>). Secondly, n-3PUFAs are also thought to have effects on surrounding molecules and cell functions via enzyme activity which results in the release of fatty acids from the phospholipid bilayer to form a number of anti-inflammatory eicosanoids, prostaglandins, and leukotrienes (<LINK REF="REF-Calder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Calder 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-James-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">James 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ruxton-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruxton 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stahl-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stahl 2008</LINK>), and via enzyme activity of direct involvement in various neurotransmitter pathways (<LINK REF="REF-Haag-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haag 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-James-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">James 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ruxton-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruxton 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stahl-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stahl 2008</LINK>). Supplementation with n-3PUFAs has been found to result in: reduced production of inflammatory cytokines - tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFa), interleukin 1B, interleukin-6, C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A (<LINK REF="REF-Calder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Calder 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Caughey-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caughey 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-James-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">James 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rallidis-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rallidis 2003</LINK>); increased serotonergic and dopaminergic activity; and decreased concentrations of noradrenalin (<LINK REF="REF-Chalon-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalon 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-De-la-Presa-Owens-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">De la Presa Owens 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hamazaki-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamazaki 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sawazaki-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sawazaki 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yao-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yao 2004</LINK>). Additionally, n-3PUFA-deficient diets have been associated with reduced receptor density and disruptions to neurotransmitter activity in serotonergic (<LINK REF="REF-De-la-Presa-Owens-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">De la Presa Owens 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Delion-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delion 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Delion-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delion 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McNamara-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">McNamara 2006</LINK>), dopaminergic (<LINK REF="REF-Chalon-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalon 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-De-la-Presa-Owens-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">De la Presa Owens 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Delion-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delion 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Delion-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delion 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McNamara-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">McNamara 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Takeuchi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Takeuchi 2002</LINK>), and adrenergic systems (<LINK REF="REF-Takeuchi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Takeuchi 2002</LINK>) compared to controls. Disruptions to and abnormal cell signalling, inflammatory processes and neurotransmitter system activities have been implicated in MDD (<LINK REF="REF-Parker-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2006b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stahl-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stahl 2008</LINK>).</P>

<P>n-3PUFAs have been linked to depression in a variety of epidemiological studies (<LINK REF="REF-Hibbeln-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hibbeln 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Noaghiul-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noaghiul 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peet-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peet 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Silvers-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silvers 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tanskanen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tanskanen 2001</LINK>); clinical studies (<LINK REF="REF-Edwards-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Garland-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garland 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mamalakis-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mamalakis 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mamalakis-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mamalakis 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peet-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peet 1998</LINK>); and RCTs (<LINK REF="REF-Frangou-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frangou 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nemets-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Nemets 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stoll-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Su-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Su 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>However, several epidemiological studies have found no association between n-3PUFA intake and depressive illness (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Appleton-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Appleton 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Frangou-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frangou 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hakkarainen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hakkarainen 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miyake-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miyake 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stoll-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Su-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Su 2003</LINK>). Clinical studies have reported no differences in n-3PUFA levels between individuals diagnosed with MDD and controls (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Browne-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Browne 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mamalakis-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mamalakis 2004</LINK>) and no clear associations (<LINK REF="REF-Appleton-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Appleton 2008a</LINK>). Several RCTs have also reported no effects of supplementation on MDD (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Grenyer-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Grenyer 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Silvers-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Silvers 2005</LINK>), depressive illness (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Keck-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keck 2006</LINK>) or depressed mood (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Rogers-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rogers 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Reviews in this area clearly demonstrate considerable variability between studies (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Appleton-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Appleton 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Appleton-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Appleton 2008b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Appleton-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Appleton 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lin-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parker-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2006b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stahl-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stahl 2008</LINK>). Meta-analyses also report considerable heterogeneity between studies ( <LINK REF="REF-Appleton-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Appleton 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Appleton-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Appleton 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lin-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 2007</LINK>). Meta-analyses reveal some small benefit of n-3PUFAs for depressive disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Appleton-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Appleton 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lin-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 2007</LINK>), but investigations of the considerable heterogeneity also suggest differential effects of n-3PUFAs dependent primarily on severity of depressive symptoms at baseline (<LINK REF="REF-Appleton-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Appleton 2010</LINK>). Sensitivity analyses based on severity of depressive symptoms at baseline suggest no benefits of n-3PUFAs for individuals with mild depressive symptoms or without diagnosis of depression, but also provide some evidence of benefits in individuals with severe depressive symptoms or with depressive diagnoses (<LINK REF="REF-Appleton-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Appleton 2010</LINK>). These findings suggest a possible benefit of n-3PUFAs for MDD.</P>
