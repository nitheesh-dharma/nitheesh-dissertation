<DESCRIPTION>
<P>We updated the extensive searches, including the search of the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register, to July 2016. In the six years since the previous version of this Cochrane review was published, no further prospective randomised trials have been performed, so there are still only three included trials involving 6343 participants. Therefore, the conclusions are the same as in the previous version. We identified a non-Cochrane systematic review (2012) of the same topic as our review, which had a similar conclusion.</P>

<P>We have updated the extensive searches to March 2010 and updated the search of the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register to July 2010. In the 11 years since the previous version of this Cochrane review was published, no further prospective randomised or quasi-randomised trials have been performed. However, we have added the pooled analysis of individual patient data from the three largest randomised trials, including subgroup analyses. Although the qualitative conclusions about the effects of surgery have not changed since 1999, we have added data on effects in important categories of patients.</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-05-10 14:04:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Question: </B>What are the benefits of surgical removal of the fatty deposits and blood clots from inside the carotid artery wall (carotid endarterectomy) for patients who have recently (within four to six months) had symptoms due to carotid stenosis (narrowing of the artery that supplies blood to the brain).</P>
<P>
<B>Background: </B>Strokes cause long-term disability and death. The chances of dying from the first stroke are 15% to 35%, and increase to 69% in subsequent strokes, which often occur within one year of the first attack. Carotid endarterectomy may reduce the risk of stroke, but carries a risk of complications immediately before, after, and during the operation, including disabling stroke and death. There is a 7% risk of stroke and death within 30 days of and endarterectomy, which includes an ocular (eye) or cerebral (brain) stroke, with symptoms lasting longer than 24 hours.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics: </B>This review identified three randomised controlled trials (6343 participants randomised), which compared carotid surgery with no carotid surgery (i.e. best medical therapy plus surgery versus best medical therapy alone) in participants with carotid stenosis and recent transient ischaemic attacks (TIA) or minor ischaemic strokes in the territory of that artery. The trials were carried out in Europe, USA, and Canada and included some centres in Israel, South Africa, and Australia. The gender ratio of participants was 2.6:1 (72% men and 28% women); 90% of participants were younger than 75 years old.</P>
<P>The results of the three trials were initially conflicting because they differed in how they measured carotid stenosis and how they defined the outcomes. To address this discrepancy, we reassessed the patient data using the same methods and definitions, so results could be compared.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results: </B>The results of the review are current up to July 2016. Results showed that older male participants with 70% to 99% stenosis, without occlusion, and recent (within two weeks) TIA or stroke, had the most benefit from surgery, assuming they were well enough for surgery, and their surgeons had a record of low complication rates (less than 7% risk of stroke and death). Carotid endarterectomy also benefited participants with 50% to 99% carotid stenosis and symptoms. For participants whose carotid artery was nearly occluded, benefit was uncertain in the long term. Surgery tended to harm participants with less than 30% stenosis.</P>
<P>The second European Carotid Surgery Trial, which is currently recruiting participants, is exploring whether a lipid lowering agent (statin) might be a better choice than carotid endarterectomy to prevent ischaemic stroke in ipsilateral carotid stenosis, which may benefit those who did not benefit from surgery in these trials.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence: </B>We found the evidence to be high quality for near occlusion and less than 30% carotid stenosis; and moderate quality for 50% to 99% carotid stenosis for any stroke or operative death, as well as ipsilateral ischaemic stroke and any operative stroke or death outcome.</P>

<P>Stroke is the third leading cause of death and the most common cause of long-term disability. Severe narrowing (stenosis) of the carotid artery is an important cause of stroke. Surgical treatment (carotid endarterectomy) may reduce the risk of stroke, but carries a risk of operative complications.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-05-02 15:34:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We included three trials involving 6343 participants. As the trials differed in the methods of measurement of carotid stenosis and in the definition of stroke, we did a pooled analysis of individual patient data on 6092 participants (35,000 patient years of follow-up), after reassessing the carotid angiograms and outcomes from all three trials using the primary electronic data files, and redefined outcome events where necessary, to achieve comparability.</P>
<P>On re-analysis, there were no significant differences between the trials in the risks of any of the main outcomes in either of the treatment groups, or in the effects of surgery. Surgery increased the five-year risk of ipsilateral ischaemic stroke in participants with less than 30% stenosis (N = 1746, risk ratio (RR) 1.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 2.01), had no significant effect in participants with 30% to 49% stenosis (N = 1429, RR 0.93, 95%CI 0.62 to 1.38), was of benefit in participants with 50% to 69% stenosis (N = 1549, RR 0.84, 95%CI 0.60 to 1.18), and was highly beneficial in participants with 70% to 99% stenosis without near-occlusion (N = 1095, RR 0.47, 95%CI 0.25 to 0.88). However, there was no evidence of benefit (N = 271, RR 1.03, 95%CI 0.57 to 1.84) in participants with near-occlusions. Ipsilateral ischaemic stroke describes insufficient blood flow to the cerebral hemisphere, secondary to same side severe stenosis of the internal carotid artery.<BR/>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-05-09 13:15:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-05-02 15:35:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Stroke is the third leading cause of death and probably the most important cause of long-term disability (<LINK REF="REF-Bonita-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bonita 1992</LINK>). The case fatality rate is between 15% and 35% with the first attack, and rises to 65% for subsequent strokes. The majority of recurrences occur within one year, and in the same anatomic region as the first stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Mohr-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mohr 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sacco-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sacco 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soltero-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soltero 1978</LINK>). Disability in survivors is a burden to the patients, their families, and to society. Eighty-five per cent of strokes are ischaemic (<LINK REF="REF-Bamford-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bamford 1990</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Fieschi-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fieschi 1989</LINK> found that in conscious people with an acute ischaemic stroke requiring admission to a stroke unit, 76% had angiographic evidence of complete occlusion of the internal carotid artery, the middle cerebral artery, or one of its branches. The majority of these occlusions were thought to be embolic and of cerebrovascular origin.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-11-01 17:23:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Atherosclerotic plaques can rupture and lead to thrombosis and emboli, which can cause stroke if it occurs in a carotid artery (<LINK REF="REF-Eliasziw--1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eliasziw 1994</LINK>). Carotid endarterectomy is a surgical procedure to remove the endothelium and atherosclerotic plaque from inside the carotid artery wall. This has been proven to reduce the risk of stroke in certain groups of people. Two techniques have been described for carotid endarterectomy. In a standard endarterectomy, the most popular technique, carotid plaque is removed by a longitudinal arteriotomy. An eversion endarterectomy is performed through an oblique transection of the internal carotid artery from the common carotid artery, endarterectomy by eversion of the internal carotid artery, and reimplantation of the internal carotid artery on the common carotid artery.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-05-02 15:35:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>As previously stated, atherosclerotic plaque can cause embolic stroke. Since carotid endarterectomy removes plaque from the carotid artery, the source of a cerebral embolism is also removed. In addition, the procedure removes the stenotic part of the carotid artery, so blood flow to the brain can be increased.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-05-09 13:15:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Carotid endarterectomy was introduced in the 1950s and increasing numbers of people have undergone this procedure over the last three decades (from 14,000 performed in the USA in 1971 to 107,000 in 1985; <LINK REF="REF-Pokras-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pokras 1988</LINK>). In 1985, the Extracranial/Intracranial (EC/IC) Bypass Study showed no benefit for this form of surgery, increasing uncertainties about the value of carotid endarterectomy (<LINK REF="REF-EC_x002f_IC-Bypass-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">EC/IC Bypass 1985</LINK>). By 1989, the number of carotid endarterectomies performed in North America had declined to 70,000 (<LINK REF="REF-Dyken-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dyken 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hsia-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hsia 1992</LINK>). These uncertainties led to large randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy of the procedure in different clinical settings.</P>
<P>There have been five randomised controlled trials of endarterectomy in people with a recent symptomatic carotid stenosis. The first two studies were small, performed over 30 years ago, included a high proportion of people with non-carotid symptoms, and did not stratify results by severity of the stenosis (<LINK REF="STD-Fields-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Fields 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shaw-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 1984</LINK>). In 1991, the Veterans Affairs trial reported a non-significant trend in favour of surgery (<LINK REF="STD-VACSP-1991" TYPE="STUDY">VACSP 1991</LINK>), but this trial was stopped early when the two largest trials, the European Carotid Surgery Trial (<LINK REF="STD-ECST-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECST 1998</LINK>), and the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (<LINK REF="STD-NASCET-1991" TYPE="STUDY">NASCET 1991</LINK>), reported their initial results. The final reports for <LINK REF="STD-ECST-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECST 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-NASCET-1991" TYPE="STUDY">NASCET 1991</LINK> were published in 1998. <LINK REF="STD-ECST-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECST 1998</LINK> reported benefit from surgery only in participants with 80% to 99% stenosis, and further limited this to 90% to 99% stenosis in women. In contrast, <LINK REF="STD-NASCET-1991" TYPE="STUDY">NASCET 1991</LINK> reported significant benefit from surgery in participants with 50% to 99% stenosis. In the previous version of this review, an attempt was made to reconcile and pool these apparently conflicting results (<LINK REF="REF-Rerkasem-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rerkasem 2011</LINK>). The differences between the trial results were partly due to differences in the methods of measurement of the degree of carotid stenosis on the pre-randomisation catheter angiograms: the method used in <LINK REF="STD-ECST-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECST 1998</LINK> produced higher values than the method used in the <LINK REF="STD-NASCET-1991" TYPE="STUDY">NASCET 1991</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-VACSP-1991" TYPE="STUDY">VACSP 1991</LINK> trials. There were also other differences, such as in the definitions of outcome events. Only by detailed re-analysis of the individual patient data and reassessment of the original angiograms can the results be properly compared or combined. In this version of the review, we have also included a pooled analysis of individual patient data from the three largest trials, in which the original angiograms were reassessed and analyses done, using the same method of measurement of stenosis and the same definitions of outcomes.</P>
<P>However, the overall trial results may not help patients and clinicians in making decision about surgery. It would be useful to be able to identify in advance, and operate on, only those people with a high risk of stroke on medical treatment alone, but relatively low operative risk. In addition to the degree of carotid stenosis, there are several other factors that might influence the risks and benefits of surgery, including the delay between presenting symptoms and surgery, and certain clinical and angiographic characteristics (<LINK REF="REF-Alamowitch-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alamowitch 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Benavente-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benavente 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eliasziw--1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eliasziw 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Henderson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kappelle-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kappelle 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morgenstern-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morgenstern 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rothwell-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rothwell 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rothwell-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rothwell 1999</LINK>). Neither <LINK REF="STD-ECST-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECST 1998</LINK> nor <LINK REF="STD-NASCET-1991" TYPE="STUDY">NASCET 1991</LINK> were powered to determine the effect of surgery in subgroups. Subgroup analyses of pooled individual patient data from <LINK REF="STD-ECST-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECST 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-NASCET-1991" TYPE="STUDY">NASCET 1991</LINK> have greater power to determine subgroup treatment interaction reliably and therefore, several such clinically important analyses have been added in this updated version.</P>

<P>We included all participants included in the final analysis of the results of the original trials in the combined analysis, using the Mantel Haenszel method (fixed-effect). We stratified the main analyses according to the stenosis groups that were used in the <LINK REF="STD-NASCET-1991" TYPE="STUDY">NASCET 1991</LINK> trial (less than 30%, 30% to 49%, 50% to 69%, 70% to 99%), and analysed near-occlusions separately (<LINK REF="REF-Rothwell-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rothwell 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>We performed all analyses of the effect of surgery on an intention-to-treat basis according to the randomised treatment allocation. We assessed significance of the differences between treatment groups by the log rank test stratified by study. We determined estimates of the absolute treatment effect (and 95% confidence intervals) at five-year follow-up from the Kaplan-Meier event-free survival curves. We tested significance of the differences in baseline data between trials and treatment groups using the Chi² test or Student&#8217;s t-test, as appropriate. We used the Cochrane Review Manager 5 software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>) and SPSS for Windows version 10.0 for all analyses (<LINK REF="REF-SPSS-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">SPSS 1999</LINK>). We used the fixed-effect model for meta-analysis in the absence of clinical, methodological, and statistical heterogeneity. If the I² statistic was greater than zero, we also applied a random-effects model to see whether the conclusions differed, and we noted any difference.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Reassessment of carotid angiograms and identification of near-occlusions</HEADING>
<P>We collected all <LINK REF="STD-ECST-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECST 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-NASCET-1991" TYPE="STUDY">NASCET 1991</LINK> pre-randomisation angiograms and reviewed them centrally for a previous version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Rerkasem-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rerkasem 2011</LINK>). The analyses could, therefore, be consistently stratified by the degree of symptomatic carotid stenosis. As the first version of this review was performed without reclassifying angiograms, it was difficult to compare the results between studies (<LINK REF="STD-ECST-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECST 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NASCET-1991" TYPE="STUDY">NASCET 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VACSP-1991" TYPE="STUDY">VACSP 1991</LINK>). This was due to different grading of the carotid stenosis used by the trials. One observer, who was blind to outcome events, re-measured the 3018 <LINK REF="STD-ECST-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECST 1998</LINK> angiograms and re-calculated the degree of stenosis by the method used in <LINK REF="STD-NASCET-1991" TYPE="STUDY">NASCET 1991</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-VACSP-1991" TYPE="STUDY">VACSP 1991</LINK>. The <LINK REF="STD-NASCET-1991" TYPE="STUDY">NASCET 1991</LINK> method was based on measurement of the minimum residual lumen at the point of maximum stenosis and the diameter of the normal internal carotid artery well beyond the carotid bulb, where the walls of the artery were parallel. We assessed observer agreement between one observer and the <LINK REF="STD-NASCET-1991" TYPE="STUDY">NASCET 1991</LINK> principal neuroradiologist on 120 randomly selected angiograms (60 from <LINK REF="STD-ECST-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECST 1998</LINK> and 60 from <LINK REF="STD-NASCET-1991" TYPE="STUDY">NASCET 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>The degree of stenosis could not be calculated by the method used in the <LINK REF="STD-NASCET-1991" TYPE="STUDY">NASCET 1991</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-VACSP-1991" TYPE="STUDY">VACSP 1991</LINK> trials on angiograms, in which the post-stenotic internal carotid artery (ICA) was narrowed to the point of near occlusion. In the original <LINK REF="STD-NASCET-1991" TYPE="STUDY">NASCET 1991</LINK> reports, these 'near-occlusions' were identified and assigned as 95% stenosis for the purpose of analysis. Therefore, we identified near-occlusions during the reassessment of the <LINK REF="STD-ECST-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECST 1998</LINK> angiograms for this review. We used the previously reported <LINK REF="STD-NASCET-1991" TYPE="STUDY">NASCET 1991</LINK> angiographic criteria for near-occlusion: severe stenosis with evidence of reduced flow in the distal ICA (delayed arrival of contrast into the distal ICA, or evidence of collateral flow of contrast towards the symptomatic cerebral hemisphere from other arterial territories, or both) and evidence of narrowing of the post-stenotic ICA (lumen diameter similar to, or less than, the ipsilateral external carotid artery, and less than the contralateral ICA). To ensure comparability with <LINK REF="STD-NASCET-1991" TYPE="STUDY">NASCET 1991</LINK>, the <LINK REF="STD-NASCET-1991" TYPE="STUDY">NASCET 1991</LINK> principal neuroradiologist assessed all potential near-occlusions identified in <LINK REF="STD-ECST-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECST 1998</LINK>. The <LINK REF="STD-VACSP-1991" TYPE="STUDY">VACSP 1991</LINK> trial angiograms were not available for further review, and were not included in the analysis of near-occlusions. For the purpose of analysis, all <LINK REF="STD-VACSP-1991" TYPE="STUDY">VACSP 1991</LINK> trial angiograms with stenosis of 70% or more were considered to have stenosis of 70% or more without near-occlusion.</P>

In <LINK REF="STD-ECST-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECST 1998</LINK>, they were not, although they were recorded.

<SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2017-05-02 15:36:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>To reduce the risk of chance findings, the collaborators met in 1999, prior to the pooling of data, to predefine a limited number of subgroups on the basis of potential clinical importance and availability in both trials (<LINK REF="REF-Rothwell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rothwell 2004</LINK>). These subgroups were derived from the risk factors that had been predefined at the beginning of <LINK REF="STD-NASCET-1991" TYPE="STUDY">NASCET 1991</LINK>. The following subgroup analyses were specified:</P>
<UL>
<LI>male versus female;</LI>
<LI>age (less than 65 years old versus 65 to 74 years old versus 75+ years);</LI>
<LI>time from most recent symptomatic ischaemic event to randomisation (less than two weeks, two to four weeks, four to 12 weeks, more than two weeks);</LI>
<LI>primary ischaemic event in the territory of the stenosed artery during the six months prior to randomisation; this was defined in a hierarchical manner as hemispheric stroke versus hemispheric TIA but no stroke versus retinal event only;</LI>
<LI>diabetes versus no diabetes;</LI>
<LI>irregular or ulcerated symptomatic carotid plaque versus smooth plaque on the pre-randomisation angiogram; and</LI>
<LI>contralateral carotid occlusion versus no occlusion.</LI>
</UL>
<P>To identify any important but unexpected treatment effect modifiers, we identified seven post-hoc subgroup variables, on the basis that comparable baseline data were available from the two trials:</P>
<UL>
<LI>duration of cerebral TIA (one hour or less versus more than one hour);</LI>
<LI>previous TIA or stroke (i.e. events prior to the six-month eligibility period as well as recent events);</LI>
<LI>previous myocardial infarction;</LI>
<LI>previous angina;</LI>
<LI>treated hypertension (defined as that requiring a blood-pressure-lowering drug);</LI>
<LI>treated hyperlipidaemia (defined as that requiring a dietary change or cholesterol-lowering drug); and</LI>
<LI>regular smoking during the previous year.</LI>
</UL>
<P>We first assessed the relationship between each subgroup variable and: 1) the risk of ipsilateral carotid territory ischaemic stroke in participants randomised to medical treatment (medical risk); and 2) any stroke or death which occurred within 30 days after trial surgery (perioperative risk). We determined the five-year cumulative risks of ipsilateral ischaemic stroke in relation to each subgroup variable. We also determined the associations in a Cox proportional hazards model with adjustment for source trial and degree of carotid stenosis.</P>
<P>Determination of the significance of treatment effect modification by subgroup is complicated by the differential changes in event rate with time in the two treatment groups. Nevertheless, we initially performed a Cox proportional hazard model with treatment allocation, a source study term, degree of stenosis, a subgroup by treatment allocation interaction term, and a stenosis by treatment allocation interaction term. We also performed an additional test for trend for the analysis of the effects of age and time from last event to randomisation. To maximise statistical power to detect treatment effect modification by subgroup, we performed these analyses of subgroup by treatment interaction across all degrees of stenosis. We considered it unlikely that the direction of any treatment effect modification by subgroup would differ qualitatively with degree of stenosis. However, we performed a further Cox model to test the significance of the three-way interaction between stenosis, subgroup, and treatment allocation.</P>

From the records identified in the previous versions of this review, six randomised trials of endarterectomy plus medical treatment versus medical treatment alone for symptomatic carotid stenosis were identified: we included three (<LINK REF="STD-ECST-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECST 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NASCET-1991" TYPE="STUDY">NASCET 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VACSP-1991" TYPE="STUDY">VACSP 1991</LINK>), excluded two (<LINK REF="STD-Fields-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Fields 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shaw-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 1984</LINK>), and one was an ongoing study in Europe (<LINK REF="STD-ISRCTN97744893" TYPE="STUDY">ISRCTN97744893</LINK>).

<P>We identified and included three relevant randomised studies (<LINK REF="STD-ECST-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECST 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NASCET-1991" TYPE="STUDY">NASCET 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VACSP-1991" TYPE="STUDY">VACSP 1991</LINK>). Because of re-measurements of the degree of carotid stenosis and certain other baseline clinical characteristics, and changes in the definitions of outcome events, the data reported below differ slightly from the original trial reports. Individual patient data were available for all 6092 participants randomised and included in the final analysis of the three original trials. Of these, one participant in the <LINK REF="STD-VACSP-1991" TYPE="STUDY">VACSP 1991</LINK> trial had no follow-up data at the time the trial was stopped, nine <LINK REF="STD-ECST-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECST 1998</LINK> participants had an occlusion of the symptomatic carotid artery on the pre-randomisation angiogram, and the degree of stenosis was unknown in one <LINK REF="STD-ECST-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECST 1998</LINK> participant. We did not include these cases in the analyses of the effect of surgery by stenosis group. Thus, we included 6081 (99.8%) participants in the analyses of the effect of surgery stratified into the pre-specified stenosis groups. Mean follow-up was 65 months (standard deviation (SD) = 34, range = 1 day to 167 months), giving a total of 35,000 patient-years of follow-up, with 1711 stroke outcomes in 1265 participants.</P>
<P>At the outset of <LINK REF="STD-NASCET-1991" TYPE="STUDY">NASCET 1991</LINK>, of those participants in the medical arm, 16% were on lipid-lowering drugs, 60% on antihypertensive medication, and 98% on antithrombotic medication (45% on aspirin of less than 650 mg/day, 38% on aspirin of at least 650 mg/day, 17 on other medication). In <LINK REF="STD-ECST-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECST 1998</LINK>, the proportions on medication for at least 50% of follow-up visits were 79% for aspirin, 18% for other antithrombotic drugs, 8% for anticoagulants, and 8% for lipid-lowering drugs. In neither trial did medication use differ significantly between the randomised treatment groups.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparability of trial designs</HEADING>
<P>The methods of the three included trials were very similar. Briefly, participants were recruited if they had suffered a recent carotid distribution TIA, a non-disabling ischaemic stroke, or a retinal infarction, and had a stenosis of the ipsilateral (symptomatic) carotid artery. Prior to randomisation, each trial required that potential participants were seen by a neurologist or a stroke physician to confirm their eligibility, and ensure that the symptomatic carotid artery (and preferably the contralateral carotid artery and intracranial circulation) was imaged by angiography (usually selective catheter angiography). Treatment (immediate carotid endarterectomy plus best medical treatment versus best medical treatment alone) was allocated by central telephone randomisation, stratified by centre. Follow-up was performed at pre-specified intervals by a neurologist or a stroke physician.</P>

<P>We re-measured the degree of carotid stenosis by the method used in the <LINK REF="STD-NASCET-1991" TYPE="STUDY">NASCET 1991</LINK> and the <LINK REF="STD-VACSP-1991" TYPE="STUDY">VACSP 1991</LINK> trials on the 3018 angiograms from <LINK REF="STD-ECST-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECST 1998</LINK> participants in the previous version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Rerkasem-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rerkasem 2011</LINK>).

For example, on average, 50% and 70% stenosis by the <LINK REF="STD-NASCET-1991" TYPE="STUDY">NASCET 1991</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-VACSP-1991" TYPE="STUDY">VACSP 1991</LINK> method were equivalent to 65% and 82% stenosis, respectively, by the <LINK REF="STD-ECST-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECST 1998</LINK> method.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participant characteristics</HEADING>
<P>Each of the included studies randomised only people who had suffered a recent neurological event in the territory of a stenosed carotid artery. The qualifying events were non-disabling strokes and TIAs, and were variously but sensibly defined. All three studies dealt with an elderly population, predominantly male. All three studies used explicit exclusion criteria, and in addition, <LINK REF="STD-ECST-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECST 1998</LINK> used the 'uncertainty principle'. The uncertainty principle refers to the state of equipoise relating to the intervention. If the patient's physician felt that the patient would clearly benefit, or clearly not benefit, from the surgery, the patient was excluded. Exclusion criteria in common between the studies were: severe coexisting medical disease; possible cardiac causes of emboli; major stroke; angiographic evidence of a second stenotic lesion in the surgically inaccessible portion above the level of the second cervical vertebra (also known as a tandem lesion); and prior ipsilateral carotid endarterectomy.</P>
<P>Comorbidities in the form of ischaemic heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, and smoking were well represented among the participants. Participants included in the <LINK REF="STD-VACSP-1991" TYPE="STUDY">VACSP 1991</LINK> trial were all male and all had at least 50% symptomatic carotid stenosis. However, they were also less likely to have had a stroke as the presenting event than participants in the other two trials, and they tended to have more vascular risk factors than those in <LINK REF="STD-ECST-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECST 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-NASCET-1991" TYPE="STUDY">NASCET 1991</LINK>.

For example, <LINK REF="STD-NASCET-1991" TYPE="STUDY">NASCET 1991</LINK> included more elderly people, and the median time from last symptoms to randomisation was less than in <LINK REF="STD-ECST-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECST 1998</LINK>.

<P>Two other randomised studies of carotid endarterectomy did not meet inclusion criteria. The first trial was a joint study of extracranial arterial disease. This included not only carotid endarterectomy, but also surgery of the aortic arch branches and vertebral arteries, in symptomatic and 'a few asymptomatic' people. A subgroup analysis of people with unilateral carotid disease undergoing carotid endarterectomy included 54% with vertebrobasilar symptoms (<LINK REF="STD-Fields-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Fields 1968</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison of the results of the individual trials</HEADING>
<P>Of the participants who were randomised to surgery, 1742/1807 underwent trial surgery in <LINK REF="STD-ECST-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECST 1998</LINK>, 1415/1436 in <LINK REF="STD-NASCET-1991" TYPE="STUDY">NASCET 1991</LINK> and 91/91 in the <LINK REF="STD-VACSP-1991" TYPE="STUDY">VACSP 1991</LINK> trial. The median time from randomisation to trial surgery was two days in the <LINK REF="STD-VACSP-1991" TYPE="STUDY">VACSP 1991</LINK> trial, three days in <LINK REF="STD-NASCET-1991" TYPE="STUDY">NASCET 1991</LINK>, and 14 days in <LINK REF="STD-ECST-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECST 1998</LINK>. There was no significant difference between the trials in the operative risk of stroke and death (X² = 1.1, degrees of freedom (df) = 2, P = 0.6). There was a non-significant trend towards higher operative stroke morbidity in participants with 50% to 69% stenosis in the <LINK REF="STD-ECST-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECST 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-VACSP-1991" TYPE="STUDY">VACSP 1991</LINK> trials compared with <LINK REF="STD-NASCET-1991" TYPE="STUDY">NASCET 1991</LINK>, but there was no significant difference in operative mortality.</P>
<P>In each of the trials, some of the participants who were randomised to medical treatment had endarterectomy of the symptomatic carotid artery during follow-up. This occurred in a total of 458 participants: 118/1211 (9.7%) in <LINK REF="STD-ECST-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECST 1998</LINK>, 331/1449 (22.8%) in <LINK REF="STD-NASCET-1991" TYPE="STUDY">NASCET 1991</LINK>, and 9/98 (9.2%) in the <LINK REF="STD-VACSP-1991" TYPE="STUDY">VACSP 1991</LINK> trial. The median (IQR) time from randomisation to such surgery was 536 (162 to 975) days in <LINK REF="STD-ECST-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECST 1998</LINK>, 555 (217 to 963) days in <LINK REF="STD-NASCET-1991" TYPE="STUDY">NASCET 1991</LINK>, and 79 (4 to 182) days in the <LINK REF="STD-VACSP-1991" TYPE="STUDY">VACSP 1991</LINK> trial. Surgery was performed most commonly in participants who had severe stenosis at randomisation: 33/114 (28.9%) near-occlusions; 161/506 (31.8%) at least 70% stenosis without near-occlusion; 132/721 (18.3%) 50% to 69% stenosis; 87/662 (13.1%) 30% to 49% stenosis; 44/751 (5.9%) less than 30% stenosis. The vast majority of these crossovers occurred after the announcement of benefit from surgery in participants with at least 70% stenosis by <LINK REF="STD-ECST-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECST 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-NASCET-1991" TYPE="STUDY">NASCET 1991</LINK> in 1991, and most of the participants who had less than 70% stenosis at baseline and who were subsequently operated upon had progressed to at least 70% stenosis by the time of surgery.</P>
<P>There were no significant differences between the trials in the risks of the main outcomes in any of the stenosis groups for either treatment group. There was also no significant heterogeneity between the trials in the effect of the randomised treatment allocation on the relative risks of any of the main outcomes in any of the stenosis groups. The effect of surgery on the relative risks of the main outcomes at five years of follow-up is shown, along with the corresponding absolute risk reductions, by degree of stenosis for <LINK REF="STD-ECST-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECST 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-NASCET-1991" TYPE="STUDY">NASCET 1991</LINK> in the <LINK TAG="ANALYSES_AND_DATA" TYPE="SECTION">Data and analyses</LINK> section. The results of the <LINK REF="STD-VACSP-1991" TYPE="STUDY">VACSP 1991</LINK> trial were also included, but were calculated at two years of follow-up, because the trial was stopped early, before follow-up was complete. The apparent lack of benefit from surgery in the <LINK REF="STD-VACSP-1991" TYPE="STUDY">VACSP 1991</LINK> trial compared with <LINK REF="STD-ECST-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECST 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-NASCET-1991" TYPE="STUDY">NASCET 1991</LINK> reflects the low risk of stroke in the medical treatment group at this early stage of follow-up. The trend towards greater harm from surgery in the less than 30% stenosis group in <LINK REF="STD-ECST-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECST 1998</LINK> versus <LINK REF="STD-NASCET-1991" TYPE="STUDY">NASCET 1991</LINK>, reflected the fact that a higher proportion of participants in this group in <LINK REF="STD-ECST-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECST 1998</LINK> had very mild (less than 10%) stenosis: 62% in <LINK REF="STD-ECST-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECST 1998</LINK> and 27% in <LINK REF="STD-NASCET-1991" TYPE="STUDY">NASCET 1991</LINK>.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Analyses of pooled data</HEADING>
<P>Since there were no significant differences between the trials, either in the risks of the study outcomes during follow-up in the medical or surgical groups, or in the effects of surgery, we performed analyses on the pooled data. There were no imbalances in baseline characteristics between the surgery and medical groups in the original trials.</P>
<P>Of the 3334 participants who were randomised to surgery, 3248 (97.5%) underwent trial surgery. The median time from randomisation to trial surgery was six days. The median time from last symptoms to randomisation of <LINK REF="STD-NASCET-1991" TYPE="STUDY">NASCET 1991</LINK> was less than in <LINK REF="STD-ECST-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECST 1998</LINK>. The median time from the last ischaemic event to randomisation was 36 days in <LINK REF="STD-NASCET-1991" TYPE="STUDY">NASCET 1991</LINK> and 45 days in <LINK REF="STD-ECST-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECST 1998</LINK>. In <LINK REF="STD-NASCET-1991" TYPE="STUDY">NASCET 1991</LINK>, the percentage of participants who were randomised within 30 days of event was 42% for the medical treatment group and 41% for the surgical treatment group.There were 229 strokes or deaths within 30 days of surgery (7.1%, 95% CI 6.3 to 8.1). There were no significant differences in surgical risk across the stenosis groups. The risk of death within 30 days of endarterectomy was 1.1% (36/3248, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.5), and the 30-day case-fatality for operative strokes was 9.6% (20/209, 95% CI 5.9 to 14.4).</P>
<P>There was no significant effect of surgery on the risk of death during follow-up in any of the stenosis groups, in either the individual trials or the pooled data. The relative risks of each of the main study outcomes at five-year follow-up, derived from the pooled data, are shown in <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>, and <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>. Surgery tended to be harmful in participants with less than 30% stenosis. In participants with 30% to 49% stenosis, the risks of each of the main outcomes were higher in the surgery group for the first two years of follow-up. Thereafter, the risks were similar in both treatment groups, with no significant benefit from surgery for any of the main outcomes.</P>
<P>In participants with 50% to 69% stenosis, surgery was also associated with a higher risk of each of the main outcomes for the first two years of follow-up, but this trend reversed during subsequent follow-up, resulting in significant benefit from surgery for any stroke or operative death (number needed to treat to prevent one event at five years (NNTB) = 13, 95% CI 8 to 28)), and for ipsilateral carotid territory ischaemic stroke and operative stroke or death (NNTB = 22, 95% CI 12 to 80; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). Benefit was non-significant for disabling or fatal ipsilateral ischaemic, or operative stroke and death.</P>
<P>In participants with 70% to 99% stenosis without near-occlusion, there was a highly significant reduction in the surgery group in the risks of each of the main outcomes. Benefit was apparent during the first year of follow-up, reached a maximum by three years, and was still present at eight years. The NNTB to prevent one event at five years was 6 (95% CI 5 to 9) for ipsilateral carotid territory ischaemic stroke and operative stroke or death, and 14 (95% CI 8 to 35) for disabling or fatal ipsilateral ischaemic or operative stroke and operative death <I>(</I>
<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>).</P>
<P>The results for participants with near-occlusion were difficult to interpret because of relatively small numbers of patients and outcome events. However, there was no long-term significant benefit from surgery for any of the main outcomes. The difference in the effectiveness of surgery between participants with near-occlusion and participants with 70% or more stenosis without near-occlusion was significant for each outcome: any stroke or operative death (Chi<SUP>2 heterogeneity</SUP>
 = 4.1, P = 0.04), ipsilateral carotid territory ischaemic stroke and operative stroke or death (Chi<SUP>2 heterogeneity</SUP> = 7.9, P = 0.005), and disabling or fatal ipsilateral ischaemic or operative stroke and operative death (Chi<SUP>2 heterogeneity</SUP> = 5.4, P = 0.02)</P>
<P>Although we presented results in the analyses using the fixed-effect method, where I² &gt; 0, we also analysed the data by using the random-effects method; the results were similar.</P>

Of these, nine <LINK REF="STD-ECST-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECST 1998</LINK> participants had an occlusion of the symptomatic carotid artery on the pre-randomisation angiogram, and the degree of stenosis was unknown in one <LINK REF="STD-ECST-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECST 1998</LINK> participant. We excluded these cases from our analyses, leaving 5893 (99.8%) participants.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Risk of ipsilateral stroke in the medical group</HEADING>
<P>The risk of ipsilateral stroke in the medical group was significantly related to all of the subgroup variables, apart from contralateral ICA occlusion and smoking (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Among the predefined subgroups, the risk of ipsilateral ischaemic stroke decreased with time since the last event, increased with age, and was higher in men, in people presenting with hemispheric events than retinal events, in diabetics, and in people with irregular or ulcerated plaques.  </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Perioperative risk of stroke or death</HEADING>
<P>Among the 3157 participants who underwent trial surgery, there were 222 operative strokes or deaths (7.0%, 95% CI 6.2 to 8.0). Among the predefined subgroups, the perioperative risk of stroke or death was higher in women (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>), and in people with hemispheric events, diabetes, contralateral carotid occlusion, and irregular or ulcerated plaques (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). Among the post-hoc subgroups, perioperative risk was reduced in people with angina, and increased in people with hypertension and with a previous TIA or stroke. 
 

</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Subgroup-treatment effect modifiers</HEADING>
<P>As in the original trials, the primary outcome for analyses of the effect of surgery was time-to-first ipsilateral ischaemic stroke in the territory of the symptomatic carotid artery, and any stroke or death that occurred within 30 days after trial surgery. <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK> showed the significance of the tests of subgroup treatment effect modification in relative and absolute reductions in the risk of the primary outcome with surgery. Among the predefined subgroups, there was significant heterogeneity of risk reduction by each of the different tests in relation to sex, age, and time since last event. The overall patterns in treatment effect were consistent across the stenosis categories. For example, benefit from carotid endarterectomy in participants with 50% to 69% stenosis was significantly less in women (P = 0.04), fell significantly with increasing time since last event (P = 0.009), and tended to increase with age (P = 0.23). The three-way interaction terms in the Cox model did not identify significant relationships between the treatment effect by subgroup interaction and degree of stenosis for any of the subgroups, although there were borderline significant trends that the effect of irregular plaque (P = 0.09) and primary symptomatic event (P = 0.08) on treatment effect was greater at higher degrees of stenosis. Benefit tended to be greatest in people with stroke, and to decline progressively in people with cerebral TIA and retinal events, in both the 50% to 69% and 70% to 99% stenosis groups. Analysis also showed a trend towards greater benefit in people with irregular plaque than a smooth plaque in both stenosis groups. However, these treatment effects by subgroup interactions still failed to reach significance when the analysis was restricted to people with 50% to 99% stenosis: P = 0.06 for irregular plaque, and P = 0.1 for primary symptomatic events.</P>
<P>No subgroup-treatment effect interaction term was significant at the P &lt; 0.01 level set for the post-hoc subgroups.</P>
<P>To assess the consistency of the effects of sex, age, and time since last event on the benefit of carotid endarterectomy, we analysed <LINK REF="STD-ECST-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECST 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-NASCET-1991" TYPE="STUDY">NASCET 1991</LINK> separately for people with 50% to 99% stenosis. Both trials showed the same patterns. For participants with 50% to 99% stenosis, the estimates of the number of people needed to undergo surgery to prevent one ipsilateral stroke in five years from the pooled data were nine for men versus 36 for women, five for age 75 years or older versus 18 for age less than 65 years, and five for people randomised within two weeks versus 125 for people randomised more than 12 weeks (10 and 18 for people randomised two to four weeks and four to 12 weeks, respectively).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Benefit of surgery in relation to degree of carotid stenosis</HEADING>
<P>With the exception of near-occlusions, the degree of stenosis above which surgery is beneficial was shown to be 50% (by the measurement used in the <LINK REF="STD-NASCET-1991" TYPE="STUDY">NASCET 1991</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-VACSP-1991" TYPE="STUDY">VACSP 1991</LINK> trials: equivalent to about 65% stenosis by the method used in <LINK REF="STD-ECST-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECST 1998</LINK>). Benefit in people with 50% to 69% stenosis became more modest with longer duration of follow-up. Lack of benefit for moderate stenosis in the original <LINK REF="STD-ECST-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECST 1998</LINK> report is not inconsistent with this, but reflects the differences between the analyses in the measurement of stenosis and the definition of outcome events. The re-analysis of individual patient data has shown that the effects of surgery in <LINK REF="STD-ECST-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECST 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-NASCET-1991" TYPE="STUDY">NASCET 1991</LINK> in people with 50% to 69% stenosis were consistent.</P>
<P>It is possible that the intention-to-treat analysis may have underestimated the benefit of endarterectomy in the near-occlusions because of the relatively high rate of endarterectomy during follow-up in the medical treatment group in <LINK REF="STD-NASCET-1991" TYPE="STUDY">NASCET 1991</LINK>. However, the rate of endarterectomy was the same in the participants with 70% to 99% stenosis without near-occlusion, and yet there was considerable benefit by intention-to-treat analysis in this group. Moreover, there was no benefit from surgery in the near-occlusion group in <LINK REF="STD-ECST-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECST 1998</LINK>, where the rate of endarterectomy in the medical group was lower than in <LINK REF="STD-NASCET-1991" TYPE="STUDY">NASCET 1991</LINK>. The confidence intervals around the estimates of treatment effect in the near-occlusions were wide, but the difference in the effect of surgery between this group and people with 70% to 99% stenosis without near-occlusion was significant for each of the three main outcomes. Some people may still wish to undergo surgery, particularly if they experience recurrent TIAs, but they should be informed that the benefit from endarterectomy in preventing a stroke is likely to be modest in the short-term and unknown in the long-term.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Operative risk</HEADING>
<P>The 7% operative risk of stroke and death within 30 days of endarterectomy included any stroke (ocular or cerebral) with symptoms lasting longer than 24 hours. It is consistent with surgical case-series in which patients were also assessed post-operatively by a neurologist. The benefits of surgery outlined above will only be obtained in routine clinical practice if the operative risk is similarly low. Since it is likely that minor strokes are regularly missed in routine clinical practice outside strictly organised clinical trials, an audit of operative risk should be performed by an independent neurologist or stroke physician (<LINK REF="REF-Bond-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bond 2004</LINK>). The 30-day case-fatality for operative stroke in the pooled analysis was 9.6% (95% CI 5.9 to 14.4), and the ratio of non-fatal to fatal operative strokes was 10:1. The possibility that non-fatal strokes have been missed should be considered in any surgical audit in which the ratio of non-fatal to fatal outcomes is lower.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analyses</HEADING>
<P>The pooled analysis of <LINK REF="STD-ECST-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECST 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-NASCET-1991" TYPE="STUDY">NASCET 1991</LINK> found three significant and clinically important subgroup treatment effect modifiers among the predefined subgroup variables. Benefit from surgery was greater in men than in women, and in the elderly, and benefit decreased with time since the last symptoms. These observations were consistent across the 50% to 69% and 70% to 99% stenosis groups, and across the two trials. Taken with other evidence discussed below, these subgroup observations were sufficiently robust to be used to guide the use of carotid endarterectomy in routine clinical practice.</P>
<P>In most trials of treatments for vascular disease, such as trials of blood-pressure lowering or lipid lowering therapies, the effects of risk factors on the main outcome events are qualitatively similar in the treatment and control groups. The analysis of subgroup effects in the case of carotid endarterectomy is more complicated because the overall effect of surgery is determined by the balance of two different outcomes (ipsilateral carotid territory ischaemic stroke on medical treatment versus the perioperative risk of stroke or death within 30 days of carotid endarterectomy), which have very different mechanisms. Therefore, particular risk factors might have qualitatively different effects on each outcome. This was the case in our analysis for sex, increasing age, and decreasing time from last event to randomisation.</P>
<P>Women had a lower risk of ipsilateral ischaemic stroke on medical treatment and a higher operative risk in comparison with men. These same patterns have also been shown in the two large trials of carotid endarterectomy for asymptomatic stenosis (<LINK REF="REF-ACAS-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACAS 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ACST-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACST 2004</LINK>). Carotid endarterectomy is very clearly beneficial in women with 70% to 99% symptomatic stenosis, but not in women with 50% to 69% stenosis. Whether surgery is still indicated in individual women will depend on the balance of their other risk factors.</P>
<P>It could be argued that the increased benefit from surgery in people over 75 years old might not be generalisable to routine clinical practice, because trial participants generally have a good prognosis, and elderly people might have a greater operative risk in clinical practice (<LINK REF="REF-Bond-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bond 2005</LINK>). However, there is no justification for withholding carotid endarterectomy in people over 75 years old who are deemed to be medically fit to undergo surgery. The subgroup analyses of <LINK REF="STD-ECST-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECST 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-NASCET-1991" TYPE="STUDY">NASCET 1991</LINK> indicated that benefit was likely to be greatest in this group, because of their high risk of stroke on medical treatment, although it is important to note that the trials included very few participants over the age of 80 years.</P>
<P>The urgency with which carotid endarterectomy should be performed has been much debated. The risk of stroke on medical treatment after a TIA or minor stroke falls rapidly over the subsequent year, possibly because of the 'healing' of the unstable atheromatous plaque or an increase in collateral blood flow to the symptomatic hemisphere, but there have been no reliable data on the extent to which the effectiveness of carotid endarterectomy also falls with time. There has been concern that the operative risk may be increased if surgery is performed early, particularly in people with major cerebral infarction or stroke-in-evolution (<LINK REF="REF-Rerkasem-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rerkasem 2009</LINK>). For neurologically stable people, such as those enrolled in the trials, benefit from carotid endarterectomy was greatest in those randomised within two weeks of their last event, and fell rapidly with increasing delay. However, the vast majority of people who undergo carotid endarterectomy for symptomatic stenosis in Europe and North America are currently being operated on more than two weeks after their presenting event, and many are operated on more than 12 weeks after the event, when benefit is considerably reduced in people with 70% to 99% stenosis, and absent in those with 50% to 69% stenosis (<LINK REF="REF-Rothwell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rothwell 2004</LINK>).</P>

<P>Generally, the three included trials had adequate strategies to avoid bias in their study except <LINK REF="STD-VACSP-1991" TYPE="STUDY">VACSP 1991</LINK>, which did not provide information on allocation concealment. Analysis of individual patient data has advantages over meta-analysis of overall trial results, and was essential for the endarterectomy trials. Differences between the trials in the method of measurement of carotid stenosis and in the definition of outcome events made it impossible to combine tabular results satisfactorily. By re-analysing the individual patient data and reassessing the carotid angiograms we showed that the results of <LINK REF="STD-ECST-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECST 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-NASCET-1991" TYPE="STUDY">NASCET 1991</LINK> were consistent, removing the uncertainty that was generated by the apparent disparities between the originally reported results of the trials. In summary, the quality of the evidence for near occlusion and less than 30% of carotid stenosis is high. The quality of the evidence for 50% to 99% of carotid stenosis is moderate for any stroke or operative death as well as ipsilateral ischaemic stroke and any operative stroke or death outcome.</P>

<P>The dangers of subgroup analysis, particularly the selective reporting of multiple post-hoc analyses, are well documented. However, we believe that the subgroup analyses of the pooled data from <LINK REF="STD-ECST-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECST 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-NASCET-1991" TYPE="STUDY">NASCET 1991</LINK> were reliable. We chose the predefined analyses prior to pooling the trial data, and we reported all of the analyses that we performed. Significance testing was based on the overall interaction of the subgroup variable with the treatment effect, rather than the significance of the treatment effect within each subgroup category. Statistical tests of subgroup-treatment effect interaction terms were conservative, and a P value &lt; 0.1 is generally regarded as significant. However, to reduce the risk of chance findings, P &lt; 0.05 was required for predefined subgroups and P &lt; 0.01 for post-hoc subgroups. It was also fortunate to have two major trials with very similar methods, and therefore, to be able to assess the consistency of observations in two completely independent studies. Indeed, the consistency in the subgroup effects between the trials was more convincing than the statistical significance of the overall effects.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-05-02 15:37:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>In 2012, a systematic review was carried out to compare long-term rates of stroke or death for carotid endarterectomy plus medical treatment versus medical therapy alone, in people suffering from carotid artery stenosis (<LINK REF="REF-Guay-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guay 2012</LINK>). This systematic review included evidence up to August 2011. For symptomatic carotid stenosis, <LINK REF="STD-ECST-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECST 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-NASCET-1991" TYPE="STUDY">NASCET 1991</LINK> were included. The review reported that for people with symptomatic carotid stenosis (50% to 99% <LINK REF="STD-NASCET-1991" TYPE="STUDY">NASCET 1991</LINK>), there was a significantly lower risk of stroke or death among people who had carotid endarterectomy plus medical treatment compared with people who received medical treatment alone from two to five years of follow-up (relative risk 0.69, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.81). The number needed to treat for a beneficial outcome was 11 patients (95% CI 8 to 17). For people without stenosis (less than 50% stenosis), there was no significant differences in the risk of stroke or death between the two groups. These results are similar to the findings in our review.</P>
<P>In 2015, a systematic review was performed of all available guidelines for the treatment of carotid artery stenosis, published in any language between 1 January 2008 and 28 January 2015. There were 33 guidelines for symptomatic carotid stenosis. Thirty-one of these guidelines (94%) recommended that carotid endarterectomy should be performed in people with average risk symptomatic carotid stenosis of 50% to 99% (<LINK REF="REF-Abbott-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abbott 2015</LINK>). The remaining two guidelines did not recommend carotid endarterectomy for all symptomatic carotid stenosis, because of a limited number of surgeons with high volume experience in carotid endarterectomy. To some extent, they also preferred carotid artery stenting to carotid endarterectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Bladin-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bladin 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Liu-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2012</LINK>).</P>

<P>Endarterectomy was of some benefit to people with 50% to 69% symptomatic stenosis, and highly beneficial for those with 70% to 99% stenosis without near-occlusion; benefit in people with carotid near-occlusion was not found. These results are only generalisable to surgically-fit people who receive the surgery, with some caveats, including the length of delay between the presenting event and surgery. In particular, in people with only 50% to 69% stenosis, there was no evidence of benefit in women, and little evidence of benefit if surgery was delayed by more than two weeks after the presenting event.</P>
<P>The trials included in this review were performed in the 1980s and early 1990s, prior to the widespread use of statins and other more recent developments in medical treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Marquardt-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marquardt 2010</LINK>). It is possible that the benefits of endarterectomy would be less, and current best medical treatment by statins and other new generation medication may be a better choice to prevent ipsilateral ischaemic stroke, and avoid operative stroke and operative death for a moderate degree of carotid stenosis. The ongoing ECST-2 trial is addressing this question (<LINK REF="STD-ISRCTN97744893" TYPE="STUDY">ISRCTN97744893</LINK>). </P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-05-02 15:37:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Medical therapy for stroke prevention has improved since <LINK REF="STD-ECST-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECST 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-NASCET-1991" TYPE="STUDY">NASCET 1991</LINK> reported their findings, with more widespread use of statins, more effective antiplatelet medication, and a more active use of antihypertensive medication. Lower optimum targets have been determined for risk factor control e.g. blood pressure. Therefore, carotid endarterectomy might not be beneficial in many people with carotid stenosis treated by modern optimised medical therapy. It is timely to re-evaluate the efficacy of carotid intervention in a new trial, such as the ongoing ECST-2 trial (<LINK REF="STD-ISRCTN97744893" TYPE="STUDY">ISRCTN97744893</LINK>). Furthermore, there remains scope for research aimed at reducing the operative risk of endarterectomy, particularly in relation to patient selection (risk factors), ancillary surgical and anaesthetic techniques (e.g. patching, shunting, and local anaesthetic), and the optimal timing of surgery (e.g. emergency versus urgent versus semi-urgent).</P>

<APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2017-04-27 17:28:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>1. Was the allocation sequence randomly generated?</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Low risk of bias </B>
</P>
<P>The investigators describe a random component in the sequence generation process such as: referring to a random number table; using a computer random number generator; coin tossing; shuffling cards or envelopes; throwing dice; drawing of lots.</P>
<P>
<B>High risk of bias </B>
</P>
<P>The investigators describe a non-random component in the sequence generation process. Usually, the description would involve some systematic, non-random approach, for example: sequence generated by odd or even date of birth; sequence generated by some rule based on date (or day) of admission; sequence generated by some rule based on hospital or clinic record number.</P>
<P>
<B>Unclear</B>
</P>
<P>Insufficient information about the sequence generation process to permit judgement of low or high risk of bias.</P>
<P>
<B>2. Was the treatment allocation adequately concealed?</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Low risk of bias </B>
</P>
<P>Participants and investigators enrolling participants could not foresee assignment because one of the following, or an equivalent method, was used to conceal allocation: central allocation (including telephone, web-based and pharmacy-controlled randomisation); sequentially-numbered drug containers of identical appearance; sequentially-numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes.</P>
<P>
<B>High risk of bias </B>
</P>
<P>Participants or investigators enrolling participants could possibly foresee assignments and thus introduce selection bias, such as allocation based on: use of an open random allocation schedule (e.g. a list of random numbers); assignment envelopes without appropriate safeguards (e.g. envelopes were unsealed, non-opaque or not sequentially numbered); alternation or rotation; date of birth; case record number; any other explicitly unconcealed procedure.</P>
<P>
<B>Unclear</B>
</P>
<P>Insufficient information to permit judgement of low or high risk of bias. This is usually the case if the method of concealment is not described or not described in sufficient detail to allow a definite judgement, for example if the use of assignment envelopes is described, but it remains unclear whether envelopes were sequentially numbered, opaque, and sealed.</P>
<P>
<B>3. Blinding - was knowledge of the allocated interventions adequately prevented during the study?</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Low risk of bias</B>
</P>
<P>Any one of the following:</P>
<P>&#8226; No blinding, but the review authors judge that the outcome and the outcome measurement are not likely to be influenced by lack of blinding.</P>
<P>&#8226; Blinding of participants and key study personnel ensured, and unlikely that the blinding could have been broken.</P>
<P>&#8226; Either participants or some key study personnel were not blinded, but outcome assessment was blinded and the non-blinding of others unlikely to introduce bias.</P>
<P>
<B>High risk of bias</B>
</P>
<P>Any one of the following:</P>
<P>&#8226; No blinding or incomplete blinding, and the outcome or outcome measurement is likely to be influenced by lack of blinding.</P>
<P>&#8226; Blinding of key study participants and personnel attempted, but likely that the blinding could have been broken.</P>
<P>&#8226; Either participants or some key study personnel were not blinded, and the non-blinding of others likely to introduce bias.</P>
<P>
<B>Unclear</B>
</P>
<P>Either of the following:</P>
<P>&#8226; Insufficient information to permit judgement of low or high risk of bias.</P>
<P>&#8226; The study did not address this outcome.</P>
<P>
<B>4. Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed?</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Low risk of bias</B>
</P>
<P>Any one of the following:</P>
<P>&#8226; No missing outcome data.</P>
<P>&#8226; Reasons for missing outcome data unlikely to be related to true outcome (for survival data, censoring unlikely to be introducing bias).</P>
<P>&#8226; Missing outcome data balanced in numbers across intervention groups, with similar reasons for missing data across groups.</P>
<P>&#8226; For dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes compared with observed event risk not enough to have a clinically relevant impact on the intervention effect estimate.</P>
<P>&#8226; For continuous outcome data, plausible effect size (difference in means or standardised difference in means) among missing outcomes not enough to have a clinically relevant impact on observed effect size.</P>
<P>&#8226; Missing data have been imputed using appropriate methods.</P>
<P>
<B>High risk of bias</B>
</P>
<P>Any one of the following:</P>
<P>&#8226; Reason for missing outcome data likely to be related to true outcome, with either imbalance in numbers or reasons for missing data across intervention groups.</P>
<P>&#8226; For dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes compared with observed event risk enough to induce clinically relevant bias in intervention effect estimate.</P>
<P>&#8226; For continuous outcome data, plausible effect size (difference in means or standardised difference in means) among missing outcomes enough to induce clinically relevant bias in observed effect size.</P>
<P>&#8226; &#8217;As-treated&#8217; analysis done with substantial departure of the intervention received from that assigned at randomisation.</P>
<P>&#8226; Potentially inappropriate application of simple imputation.</P>
<P>
<B>Unclear</B>
</P>
<P>Either of the following:</P>
<P>&#8226; Insufficient reporting of attrition or exclusions to permit judgement of low or high risk of bias (e.g. number randomised not stated, no reasons for missing data provided).</P>
<P>&#8226; The study did not address this outcome.</P>
<P>
<B>5. Are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting?</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Low risk of bias</B>
</P>
<P>Either of the following:</P>
<P>&#8226; The study protocol is available and all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified (primary and secondary) outcomes that are of interest in the review have been reported in the pre-specified way.</P>
<P>&#8226; The study protocol is not available but it is clear that the published reports include all expected outcomes, including those that were pre-specified (convincing text of this nature may be uncommon).</P>
<P>
<B>High risk of bias</B>
</P>
<P>Any one of the following:</P>
<P>&#8226; Not all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified primary outcomes have been reported.</P>
<P>&#8226; One or more primary outcomes are reported using measurements, analysis methods or subsets of the data (e.g. subscales) that were not pre-specified.</P>
<P>&#8226; One or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified (unless clear justification for their reporting is provided, such as an unexpected adverse effect).</P>
<P>&#8226; One or more outcomes of interest in the review are reported incompletely, so that they cannot be entered in a meta-analysis.</P>
<P>&#8226; The study report fails to include results for a key outcome that would be expected to have been reported for such a study.</P>
<P>
<B>Unclear</B>
</P>
<P>Insufficient information to permit judgement of low or high risk of bias. It is likely that the majority of studies will fall into this category.</P>
<P>
<B>6. Other sources of potential bias</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Low risk of bias</B>
</P>
<P>The study appears to be free of other sources of bias.</P>
<P>
<B>High risk of bias</B>
</P>
<P>There is at least one important risk of bias. For example, the study:</P>
<P>&#8226; had a potential source of bias related to the specific study design used; or</P>
<P>&#8226; has been claimed to have been fraudulent; or</P>
<P>&#8226; had some other problem.</P>
<P>
<B>Unclear</B>
</P>
<P>There may be a risk of bias, but there is either:</P>
<P>&#8226; insufficient information to assess whether an important risk of bias exists; or</P>
<P>&#8226; insufficient rationale or evidence that an identified problem will introduce bias.</P>
