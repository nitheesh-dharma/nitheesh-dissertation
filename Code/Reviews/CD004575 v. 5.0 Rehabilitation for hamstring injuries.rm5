<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-10-22 12:31:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Hamstring injuries are commonly encountered in sports medicine, and clinical management of this problem differs widely. Only two randomised studies, totaling 104 participants, were found that compared rehabilitation programmes for this condition. This means that many proposed techniques have not been subjected to proper scrutiny. There is limited evidence from one study to suggest that rate of recovery can be increased with an increased daily frequency of hamstring stretching exercises. There is preliminary evidence from another small study of mixed ability athletes to suggest that exercise to correct movement dysfunction could reduce time to return to full activity and the risk of re-injury. Further studies are required to check these findings and to inform on current practice and the widely published rehabilitation protocols for these injuries.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-10-23 10:30:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>Hamstring injuries are a common musculoskeletal disorder, particularly amongst athletes. Many factors have been associated with these injuries, including motor control and strength, soft tissue length and postural alignment. Well-established rehabilitation protocols are commonly used in the treatment of this condition, but their effectiveness remains questionable. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2007.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate the effectiveness of all rehabilitation strategies employed to promote the return to full strength, range of movement and function of those individuals presenting with all forms of hamstring injury, regardless of site, severity, onset or level of chronicity. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-10-26 10:23:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (to September 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (<I>The Cochrane Library</I>, 2011 Issue 3), MEDLINE (including in-process &amp; other non-indexed citations: 1966 to August 2011), EMBASE (1980 to September 2011), PEDro (2006 to June 2012), CINAHL (1937 to September 2011), AMED (1985 to September 2011), SPORTDiscus (1859 to February 2006), and the World Health Organisation International Clinical Trials Registry platform (April 2012).</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-10-23 10:30:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>Randomised clinical trials investigating the effect of at least one rehabilitation strategy, in isolation or combination with another, compared with another strategy or control, performed on individuals presenting with hamstring injuries.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-10-23 12:39:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>Two review authors performed study selection. All review authors performed data extraction and assessed risk of bias. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-10-23 10:31:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>Two trials were included in the review, totaling 104 participants. One trial assessed additional (four times a day) versus once daily stretching and the other assessed exercise for movement dysfunction versus stretching and strengthening. The first trial, involving 80 elite athletes, suggested additional stretching could reduce time to return to full activity (mean difference (MD) -1.8 days, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.1 to -1.5, P &lt; 0.001). The second trial, involving 24 participants from a diverse sporting background, did not find conclusive evidence of a difference (MD -14.5 days, 95% CI -30.64 to 1.64, P = 0.08). It did, however, report reduced re-injury rates using exercise for movement dysfunction of 8% versus 64% (odds ratio (OR) 0.05, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.52, P = 0.01). No other outcomes relevant to this review were reported by either study: most notably pain and participant satisfaction.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-10-22 12:31:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Most proposed physiotherapy techniques for rehabilitation of hamstring injuries have not been assessed using randomised trials. Those that have only have single studies with a limited range of participants and outcomes. There is limited evidence to suggest that time to recovery for elite athletes can be reduced with an increased daily frequency of hamstring stretching exercises. There is preliminary evidence from another small study of mixed ability athletes to suggest that exercise to correct movement dysfunction could reduce time to return to full activity and the risk of re-injury. Further studies are required to check these findings. Until further evidence is available, current practice and widely published rehabilitation protocols cannot either be supported or refuted.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-10-23 11:12:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-08-24 16:22:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>Hamstring injuries are amongst the most common in the field of sports medicine. A study by <LINK REF="REF-Orchard-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orchard 2002</LINK> found them to be responsible for 15% of injuries to Australian Rules footballers over the course of a season, with a high rate of recurrence in 34% of cases. They are commonplace amongst soft tissue injuries in many mainstream sports and can prove particularly disruptive to an athlete's training and preparation, often resulting in a lengthy absence from competition due to their slow rate of healing (<LINK REF="REF-Kroll-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kroll 1997</LINK>). Despite the frequency of their occurrence there is very little consensus as to how they are most effectively managed through the stages of soft tissue healing and rehabilitation (<LINK REF="REF-Worrell-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Worrell 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Hamstring injuries are defined by the muscles that are affected; injury must be present in one or more of the component muscles, biceps femoris, semimembranosus, and semitendinosus. Hamstring injuries are also defined by the anatomical site within the muscle that is affected. The musculo-tendinous junctions of the biarticular hamstring muscles extend down nearly the entire length of the muscle (<LINK REF="REF-Woodley-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woodley 2005</LINK>); it is impossible to differentiate between injuries of the muscle bellies and musculo-tendinous junctions based on a clinical assessment. Thus the definitions based on anatomical sites may be unreliable. Other sites to be included are the tendon and the teno-osseous junction (the insertion of the tendon into the bone). Finally, consideration needs to be given to the extent of the injury; this is commonly classified for soft tissue injuries as grades one, two and three. Grade one (first degree) is mild pain at the time (or within 24 hours) of injury, especially when stress is applied to the injury. Local tenderness may or may not be present. Grade two (second degree) strains are present when the individual notices pain during activity and usually has to stop; pain and local tenderness are moderate to severe when the injury is stressed. In a grade three (third degree) injury, there is complete, or near complete, rupture or avulsion of at least a portion of a ligament or tendon with severe pain or loss of function; a palpable defect may be present (<LINK REF="REF-Kellett-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kellett 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>The relevance to the practitioner, of site and grade of lesion, lies in the length of time it takes to rehabilitate these injuries. Injuries to the tendinous or myotendinous junction are believed to take longer to rehabilitate than those in the muscle tissue (<LINK REF="REF-Garrett-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garrett 1984</LINK>). Higher grades of injury will take longer to rehabilitate due to the extent of damage to the tissues awaiting repair. It has been found in more severe cases that the convalescence interval prior to return to full activity can be longer than six weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Pomeranz-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pomeranz 1993</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-10-23 11:00:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>Rehabilitation is the act of restoration of functional capability of a person, towards normality, by appropriate intervention. As in the case of any soft tissue injury, this will optimally involve treatment from the moment of injury until the individual has regained complete, unimpeded return to as close to normal function as is possible. Many interventions are widely employed by therapists treating hamstring injuries to achieve complete rehabilitation. These include rest; PRICE (Protection, Rest, Ice, Compression and Elevation); exercise therapy including stretching; electrotherapy; massage and mobilisation; and functional rehabilitation.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-10-23 11:12:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>It is generally anticipated that the main effects of key interventions are as follows: PRICE, to reduce inflammation (<LINK REF="REF-ACPSM-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACPSM 1998</LINK>); exercise therapy, to strengthen, stabilise and lengthen (<LINK REF="REF-Croisier-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Croisier 2002</LINK>); electrotherapy, to physiologically increase healing rates (<LINK REF="REF-Van-der-Windt-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van der Windt 1999</LINK>); and massage and mobilisation to realign and enhance recovery directed towards soft tissues (<LINK REF="REF-Brosseau-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brosseau 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hunter-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hunter 1998</LINK>), articular structures (<LINK REF="STD-Cibulka-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Cibulka 1986</LINK>) and neural tissue (<LINK REF="STD-Turl-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Turl 1998</LINK>).</P>

<P>This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2007. Although we have identified no additional randomised trials, the review methods have been revised in light of current standards for systematic reviews.

<STUDY_SELECTION MODIFIED="2012-10-23 11:31:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>From the title and the abstract, two review authors (DM and VD) screened the search results for potentially eligible studies, all of which were retrieved in full text. These authors also performed study selection. Any differences in opinion were resolved by discussion or adjudication by a third party (AV).</P>
</STUDY_SELECTION>
<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2012-10-23 12:44:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>Data were extracted by one review author (AV), using data extraction forms. Further information was required to complete the data extraction and the trial authors were contacted to verify data and standard deviations.</P>
</DATA_EXTRACTION>
<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2012-06-28 16:49:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>Risk of bias was independently assessed, without masking of the source and authorship of the trial reports, by at least two authors for newly included trials, and by at least one author for trials that had been assessed in previous versions of the review. The assessment form was piloted on one trial. Between rater and between versions consistency in assessment was checked by one author at data entry. All differences were resolved by discussion. We used the tool outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). This tool incorporates assessment of randomisation (sequence generation and allocation concealment), blinding (of participants and treatment providers, and outcome assessors), completeness of outcome data, selection of outcomes reported and other sources of bias.</P>
</QUALITY_ASSESSMENT>
<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2012-06-28 16:52:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>Results for binary outcomes were summarised using odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. We planned to use Peto odds ratios for very rare events. Where possible, results for continuous outcomes were summarised using mean differences and 95% confidence intervals. If, in future updates, studies use different scales to measure the same underlying constructs, such as participant satisfaction, we will calculate standardised mean differences. The results will be translated back into one of the original scales for reporting purposes. Ordinal scales will be treated as continuous outcomes unless and until accepted meta-analytic techniques for ordinal outcome data become available.</P>
</EFFECT_MEASURES>
<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2012-10-23 12:45:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>None has been identified to date. It is unlikely that anyone would use a cross-over design in this context and hamstring injuries do not usually occur simultaneously on both left and right sides to allow a within-patient comparison. It is plausible that cluster trials may be reported in the future or that studies using multiple therapists in each treatment group could use more advanced statistical methods to account for possible clustering due to therapist effects. If this occurs in future updates, contact will be made with authors to obtain appropriate data for use in general inverse variance meta-analysis.</P>

Twenty eight athletes, aged between 14 and 49 years, were allocated between the two groups but four were excluded having been unable (three further injuries) or unwilling (one loss to follow-up) to complete the programme.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-10-22 12:21:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>Both studies investigated hamstring stretching as an element of their intervention. This reflects the importance associated with this technique in contemporary approaches to hamstring rehabilitation in the available literature. <LINK REF="STD-Malliaropoulos-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Malliaropoulos 2004</LINK> suggested that an increased frequency of daily stretching (four times a day compared with once) accelerates the rehabilitation process and therefore suggests a positive effect over the short term. It would seem that an important outcome which could have been considered in this study would be the re-injury rate, although we accept that this was unlikely to be an important outcome for a comparison of frequency of the chosen technique. The outcomes used, being time taken to return to full training and therefore competition, directly reflect the usual priorities of athletes. It could be argued that to remain injury free, following this return to sporting activity, should be an equally important factor, certainly for the clinician managing the athlete's rehabilitation. The research fails to state any figures for re-injury; it also fails to include details of continued performance of stretching during full return to sporting activity.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Sherry-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sherry 2004</LINK> established that those athletes performing a progressive agility and trunk stabilising programme presented with a significantly lower re-injury rate at both two weeks and 12 months following full return to sporting activity. It was recommended that participants continued their exercise programmes at least three times a week for two months following this return. They suggest that the reduced incidence of recurrence could possibly be attributed to enhanced neuromuscular control of the lumbar spine and pelvis (from where the hamstrings take attachment on the ischial tuberosity). However, as no measures were taken of trunk stabilisation or neuromuscular control during the course of the study, they concede that it is not possible to identify a relationship. It could be due to another aspect of motor control. The authors also suggest differences between the groups could be attributed to features of the agility and trunk stability exercises, which allow for earlier loading of the injured tissue to enhance tissue healing, and earlier hamstring eccentric activity, which reduces the effects of muscle wasting.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Malliaropoulos-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Malliaropoulos 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sherry-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sherry 2004</LINK> both investigated the impact of their rehabilitation programmes on athletes. With reference to the same outcomes investigated, namely full rehabilitation and a return to sporting activity, they presented differing results. The time taken for this by <LINK REF="STD-Malliaropoulos-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Malliaropoulos 2004</LINK> (elite athletes) was markedly quicker when compared with the recreational athletes in <LINK REF="STD-Sherry-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sherry 2004</LINK>. The level of performance of those involved in the Greek study would seem to be of a relatively high standard. The factor of dealing with more highly trained individuals could explain the differences. It could be possible that they had a differing healing rate and more opportunity and support to adhere to an optimal rehabilitation protocol. Another factor explaining these differences could be time for recruitment; participants were recruited within 48 hours in Greece, slightly earlier than the mean of 3.4 and 4.1 days (ranging up to 10 days) in <LINK REF="STD-Sherry-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sherry 2004</LINK>.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-07-20 15:18:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is evidence of a benefit from increased intensity of stretching in terms of time to return to full activity for elite athletes, but no information regarding possible adverse events including re-injury. Exercise to correct movement dysfunction shows early promise in a small, under-powered study of mixed ability athletes including reduced time to return to full activity and reduced re-injury rates.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-10-22 11:52:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There was no evidence comparing any intervention versus rest. There was also no evidence to support the use of most of the proposed methods versus standard care or versus each other. The only evidence from randomised trials for any approach comes from two small randomised controlled trials, neither of which reports on pain or patient satisfaction and only one of which reports on re-injury. Neither reported any other adverse events. One trial involved elite athletes with grade two muscle strains whereas the other involved a broader range of participant and strain levels.</P>
<P>A now excluded study, <LINK REF="STD-Cibulka-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Cibulka 1986</LINK>, randomised 20 participants with ungraded hamstring muscle strain to a single session of sacroiliac joint manipulation in addition to moist heat and passive stretching. This study identified greater increases in peak muscle torque of hamstrings, possibly attributable to baseline differences between the groups. Ignoring the control group and interpreting the experimental group results as a 'before and after' study, these results suggest improvement in the experimental group that warrants further investigation. Concurrent changes in pelvic position were also identified, offering support to explain the increase in hamstring peak torque, namely that altered pelvic alignment relieves the stresses on structures which are involved in producing knee flexion. Like <LINK REF="STD-Sherry-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sherry 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Cibulka-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Cibulka 1986</LINK> suggests a relationship may exist between alignment of the kinetic chain and the occurrence of hamstring injuries, with their finding that all participants present with malalignment. Although research evidence is still lacking to support this concept, it may be an important consideration to include assessment of the sacroiliac and lumbar spine in the overall management of this condition.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-07-20 15:18:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Both included studies were small and restricted in terms of their clinically relevant outcomes. In this context, it is not possible to blind practitioners or participants who have been informed regarding study protocols. As the primary outcome of return to full activity is a decision made by these two parties there must always be a high risk of bias associated with studies with regard to blinding. Beyond these limitations the studies were not clearly deficient.</P>
<P>Of more concern in this review is the quality of the evidence base. It is plausible that the discrepant data in terms of average time taken to return to full activity, variation in this time, and group differences in this time are related as much to the difference between elite and general athletes as to any rehabilitation received. The maximum time taken to return to full activity by participants in <LINK REF="STD-Malliaropoulos-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Malliaropoulos 2004</LINK> was less than the average time taken by those in <LINK REF="STD-Sherry-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sherry 2004</LINK> despite the latter including lower grade injuries.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-10-22 12:19:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is limited evidence to suggest that rate of recovery for elite athletes can be increased with an increased daily frequency of hamstring stretching exercises. There is preliminary evidence from a small study of mixed ability athletes to suggest that exercise to correct movement dysfunction could reduce time to return to full activity and the risk of re-injury. Until further evidence is available, current practice and widely published rehabilitation regimens cannot either be supported or refuted.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-10-23 12:07:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Future studies investigating differing rehabilitation techniques need to be performed on people with hamstring injuries rather than on healthy individuals and need to pursue a course of rehabilitation to compare clinical outcomes. Studies need to be performed to evaluate the relationship and effects of re-education of movement dysfunction, including trunk stabilising programmes, on neuromuscular control. Further investigations are required, evaluating the frequency of stretching of hamstring muscles, along with duration and type of stretching on injured individuals. Components of 'standard therapy' control groups should be clearly specified. We recommend that outcomes should include incidence of recurrence of injury, pain and patient satisfaction, as well as rate of recovery.</P>
