<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-11-09 14:39:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne-Marie Stephani">
<P>If people eat eggs from the pork tapeworm (Taenia solium), these eggs can move from the gut and then lodge in different tissues of the body forming cysts. When these cysts form in the brain, this is called neurocysticercosis. Some people may have no symptoms if this happens, but others may suffer from seizures, headaches, or more rarely from confusion, loss of balance or brain swelling. More rarely still, someone may die.</P>
<P>The condition is mainly found where people live in close contact with pigs and where the sanitation is poor. It affects around 50 million people worldwide, and in some areas is the leading cause of adult-onset epilepsy.</P>
<P>The number, size and location of the cysts help to guide treatment of neurocysticercosis, as do the patient&#8217;s symptoms; for example, giving anticonvulsants to someone with seizures. Two drugs, praziquantel and albendazole, can be used specifically in neurocysticercosis to help kill the parasite; these drugs are known as anthelmintics. Some cysts, called non-viable lesions are generally in the process of degenerating and resolving spontaneously; many experts recommend not treating this type of cyst. However, treating viable lesions (ie those lesions that may or may not resolve spontaneously) with these drugs may help kill the parasite, although treatment remains controversial due to the potential side effects and the fact the parasite may die without treatment.</P>
<P>In this review of 21 relevant randomized controlled trials, most studies examined the effects of albendazole. In patients with viable lesions, there is only evidence available for adult patients; this suggests that albendazole may reduce the number of lesions. In patients with non-viable lesions, there is only evidence available for children; this suggests that seizure recurrence was lower with albendazole, which goes against the opinions of some experts. There is insufficient evidence available to assess praziquantel.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-11-11 09:39:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne-Marie Stephani">
<P>For viable lesions in children, there were no trials. For viable lesions in adults, no difference was detected for albendazole compared with no treatment for recurrence of seizures (116 participants, one trial); but fewer participants with albendazole had lesions at follow up (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.70; 192 participants, two trials).</P>
<P>For non-viable lesions in children, seizures recurrence was less common with albendazole compared with no treatment (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.75; 329 participants, four trials). There was no difference detected in the persistence of lesions at follow up (570 participants, six trials). For non-viable lesions in adults, there were no trials.</P>
<P>In trials including viable, non-viable or mixed lesions (in both children and adults), headaches were more common with albendazole alone (RR 9.49, 95% CI 1.40 to 64.45; 106 participants, two trials), but no difference was detected in one trial giving albendazole with corticosteroids (116 participants, one trial).</P>

<P>In patients with viable lesions, evidence from trials of adults suggests albendazole may reduce the number of lesions. In trials of non-viable lesions, seizure recurrence was substantially lower with albendazole, which is counter-intuitive. It may be that steroids influence headache during treatment, but further research is needed to test this.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2009-11-11 09:42:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne-Marie Stephani">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-11-09 14:43:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne-Marie Stephani">
<P>Neurocysticercosis is an infection of the central nervous system by the larval stage of the pork tapeworm<I> Taenia solium.</I> If eggs (cysticerci) from the faeces of humans infected with the intestinal parasites are ingested, they can migrate from the gut to lodge in various tissues of the body, where they form cysts (cysticercosis). This review is confined to treating neurocysticercosis, where the cysts lodge in the brain.</P>
<P>The cysts naturally evolve, over a period of years, through stages beginning with viable larvae and ending with the death of the parasite and resorption or calcification of the cyst. Individuals may have one or more cysticerci in the brain. The following types of neurocysticercosis have been recognized, depending on where the cysts are lodged: parenchymal; intraventricular; racemose type found in the basal cisterns; and spinal. Symptoms may or may not occur, depending on the number, location, and stage of the cysts, as well as the infected person's immune response. Seizures are the most common symptom, present in most of the presenting cases, followed by headaches. Rarely, it causes confusion, lack of attention to people and surroundings, difficulty with balance, paralysis, swelling of the brain, and very rarely, death. Symptoms may be associated with the host's immune response or due to calcifications left once the cysts have been eliminated (<LINK REF="REF-Leite-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leite 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>The condition is found where people live in close contact with pigs and where sanitation is poor. It is common in much of South and Central America, China, the Indian subcontinent and South-East Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa. It affects around 50 million people worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Kossoff-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kossoff 2005</LINK>), with men and women equally affected, and has a peak of incidence at the ages of 30 to 40 years (<LINK REF="REF-Burneo-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burneo 2005</LINK>). In endemic areas, it is the leading cause of adult-onset epilepsy and an important cause of seizures in children (<LINK REF="REF-Roman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roman 2000</LINK>). It has also been estimated to cause at least 50,000 deaths worldwide each year (<LINK REF="REF-Roman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roman 2000</LINK>). It is therefore a significant public health problem, with significant associated costs in health care and lost productivity.</P>
<P>The cysts in the brain can be visualized using CT or MRI scanning. Over the course of the infection, radiological images change from 'non-enhancing' (after intravenous injection of a radiographic contrast), indicating a viable cyst with little host immune response, to 'ring-enhancing' indicating a degenerating cyst with surrounding immune response, to calcification or total resolution (<LINK REF="REF-DeGiorgio-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeGiorgio 2004</LINK>). Cysts may be located in the parenchyma (brain tissue) or within structures and spaces around the brain (extraparenchymal cysts). Infection burden varies widely; a recently published guideline classified infection burdens from mild (one to five cysts) to moderate (five to 99 cysts) to heavy (more than 100 cysts) (<LINK REF="REF-Garcia-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Treatment options depend on the number, size, and location of the cysts, and on the symptoms. Initial symptomatic treatment includes anticonvulsant drugs for seizures and analgesics for headache. Some extraparenchymal cysts are treated with surgery, either to remove the cyst or to relieve intracranial pressure. Where serious inflammation of the brain is present (usually associated with degeneration of the cysts), corticosteroids may be prescribed.</P>
<P>Cysts may degenerate and resolve spontaneously. For this reason, specific anthelmintics are usually considered for people with viable cysts, as the treatment may help kill the parasites. When lesions are non-viable, many experts do not recommend these drugs. </P>
<P> There are two anthelmintics used in neurocysticercosis: praziquantel, available since 1979, and albendazole, available since 1987. If anthelmintics are used, corticosteroids are often prescribed with them to prevent inflammation of the brain caused by the host immune response to the destroyed parasites.</P>
<P>Treatment with anthelmintics remains controversial, due to potential adverse events and the natural history of the parasite, which may eventually die without treatment. The original version of this Cochrane Review found no evidence that the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the potential harms (<LINK REF="REF-Salinas-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salinas 1999</LINK>). This review was undertaken as a substantive update of the original Cochrane Review to take trials published since 1999 into account. We have stratified patients by age (children and adult) and by whether patients have predominantly viable or non-viable cysts, given the natural history and assumptions about when anthelmintics may or may not be effective.</P>

<P>Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of the included trials using a pro forma. In case of disagreement, we planned to consult a third person. We categorized the generation of the allocation sequence and allocation concealment as adequate, unclear, or inadequate as in <LINK REF="REF-J_x00fc_ni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jüni 2001</LINK>. We assessed whether the participants, care providers and investigators were blinded to which participants received which drug regimen. For all outcomes, we assessed that incomplete outcome data had been adequately addressed if 85% or more of the participants were included in the analysis, or if less than 85% were included but adequate steps were taken to ensure or demonstrate that this did not bias the results. We also examined the trial reports for any evidence of selective reporting of outcomes or any other issues that may bias the results. We reported the results of the assessment in a table.</P>

<P>We assessed heterogeneity between trials by examining the forest plot for overlapping confidence intervals, and using the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic for heterogeneity. We investigated potential sources of heterogeneity by performing subgroup analyses by co-medications or treatments used and, where possible, length of follow up. We planned also to investigate potential sources of heterogeneity by performing subgroup analyses for participant age (adults or children), and number of lesions, but there were insufficient trials to enable this.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Eligibility</HEADING>
<P>We included 21 completed trials. (see '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>') We excluded nine studies (see reasons in '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>'). Three studies are classified as awaiting assessment because it was unclear from the reports whether or not they were randomized. We have emailed and written to the authors for more detailed information about the methods.The search also identified one ongoing trial that met the inclusion criteria (see '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_ONGOING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of ongoing studies</LINK>').</P>
<P>In detail, the search strategy identified 48 potentially relevant reports of completed studies; of these, 35 initially seemed relevant, and we obtained the full texts. One was in Portuguese (<LINK REF="STD-Antoniuk-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Antoniuk 1991</LINK>), the others in English. We obtained the help of a Portuguese reader to assess the relevant report for inclusion. Two reports were unclear as to whether the groups were randomly allocated: we attempted to contact the trial authors for clarification but were unsuccessful; these trials are reported as 'awaiting classification'. Following inspection of the reference lists of the included reports, we identified a further two relevant trials for inclusion (<LINK REF="STD-Padma-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Padma 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sotelo-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Sotelo 1990</LINK>), and another report that initially seemed relevant but did not meet the inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Medina-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Medina 1993</LINK>).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-11-09 14:45:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne-Marie Stephani">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Summary of main results</HEADING>
<P>The results of trials comparing anthelmintic treatment with no anthelmintic are mixed and therefore difficult to interpret. Most trials assessed albendazole, which has largely taken over from praziquantel. We found only one small trial comparing praziquantel with no active treatment from which we could not come to any meaningful conclusions on its efficacy. Reduction in seizures with albendazole did not appear to correlate with radiological clearance of lesions. Findings for the three major outcomes categories of this review are described below.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Seizure recurrence</HEADING>
<P>For seizure recurrence, most trials tended towards a benefit of albendazole, and this benefit was significant in the case of children with a single, non-viable lesion. This finding runs counter to most expert opinion which is of a view that treatment is unlikely to be beneficial for cases with non-viable lesions only. There was no significant benefit shown for people with viable lesions only, which seems counter-intuitive, but only one small trial reported on this outcome, hence a larger study is needed to ascertain the efficacy of albendazole in this group. One trial, including participants with both viable and non-viable lesions (<LINK REF="STD-Das-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Das 2007</LINK>), showed a harmful effect of albendazole. This trial, which combined albendazole with steroids, also showed increased encephalopathy and admission to hospital with albendazole, and two deaths from encephalopathy.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Radiological clearance of lesions</HEADING>
<P>For radiological clearance of lesions during the first 12 months, trials including people with viable lesions only showed a significant benefit of albendazole, while trials including only people with non-viable lesions, or a mixture of viable and non-viable lesions, showed no significant effect of albendazole. The majority of trials on viable lesions involved adults only, while those on non-viable lesions involved only children; the observed differences between trial results may also have been affected by the ages of the participants.</P>
<P>Our analysis showed no significant effect of duration of treatment on persistence of lesions at follow up. Assuming that presence of symptoms is associated with presence of lesions (<LINK REF="REF-Murthy-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murthy 2006</LINK>), these results suggest that a shorter duration of treatment is as effective as a longer course. Shorter courses were also associated with fewer cases of nausea or other gastrointestinal symptoms during treatment. One trial assessed albendazole in combination with praziquantel compared with albendazole alone; the findings suggested that the combination of two anthelmintics was better in the short term.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse events</HEADING>
<P>Participants treated with either albendazole or praziquantel experienced significantly more adverse events during treatment than those receiving no active treatment. Albendazole was associated with headache, dizziness, and nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. There is some indirect (weak) evidence that corticosteroids used in conjunction with albendazole may protect against headache during treatment, as in trials using corticosteroids there was no significant difference between albendazole and no active treatment in this outcome.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Overall completeness and applicability of evidence</HEADING>
<P>We identified 21 relevant published trials. Most were published since the last update of this Cochrane Review (<LINK REF="REF-Salinas-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salinas 1999</LINK>). We also identified one relevant ongoing trial. All the trials were small; the largest enrolled 300 participants and the smallest enrolled 18. All trials, published and ongoing, were based in Central and South America and South-East Asia; there were no trials from Africa or China, where the disease is also endemic.</P>
<P>The trial participants varied, including children and adults and people with different numbers and types of lesions, although trials in children tended to include only non-viable lesions, while trials in adults mostly included only viable lesions. Together the trials included very few people with large numbers of lesions, or with lesions other than parenchymal cysts or lesions.</P>
<P>Treatment comparisons of the included trials were wide ranging, enabling analysis by type of drug (albendazole or praziquantel) and duration of treatment. We were also able to indirectly compare the frequencies of adverse events during treatment when anthelmintics were administered with or without corticosteroids.</P>
<P>Two comparisons reported by the included trials are not presented in the analysis because their comparisons did not fit into its structure. <LINK REF="STD-Gongora_x002d_Rivera-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gongora-Rivera 2006</LINK> compared only different doses of albendazole given for just one day; this was not presented as we had no other trials using albendazole for just one day, and hence no evidence that it was better than placebo. <LINK REF="STD-Sotelo-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Sotelo 1990</LINK> compared praziquantel given for different durations; this comparison was not presented because we found no evidence that praziquantel was effective in treating neurocysticercosis.</P>
<P>Just over half of the included trials reported on the presence or severity of seizures, which are probably the most important outcomes to most patients. Three other trials reported on symptom severity or presence of symptoms, of which seizures would be the most common, and one trial reported separately on symptoms other than seizures. All the trials assessed and reported on the radiological presence or changes in the neurocysticerci, which may not be directly correlated with the presence or severity of seizures or other symptoms. Radiological outcomes are easy to assess, specific to neurocysticercosis, and perhaps clinically useful, as there is evidence that anti-epileptic drugs can usually be withdrawn following radiological clearance of lesions, and this may be a criteria for withdrawing anti-epileptic drugs in some patients and practices (<LINK REF="REF-Murthy-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murthy 2006</LINK>). However, in this review, children with a single non-viable lesion, and treated with albendazole compared with no anthelmintic, had a lowered risk of recurrence of seizures despite no difference in the radiological persistence of lesions.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Quality of the evidence</HEADING>
<P>The risk of bias varied between trials, with the trials published most recently tending to be assessed as better for all indicators. Six trials reported an adequate method of allocation concealment; one trial including viable lesions only, four including non-viable lesions only, and two including both viable and non-viable lesions.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Potential biases in the review process</HEADING>
<P>All of the included trials were small. In addition, unexplained heterogeneity was introduced by one relatively large, but poorly reported trial (<LINK REF="STD-Das-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Das 2007</LINK>) with results mostly running in the opposite direction to those reported in other trials.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Agreements and disagreement with other studies and reviews</HEADING>
<P>Our results slightly vary from other recent meta-analyses assessing albendazole compared with placebo or usual care, but the conclusions reached are similar.</P>
<P>A meta-analysis in children (four trials, 400 participants) with neurocysticercosis revealed a higher remission of seizures in those treated with albendazole compared to controls (RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.46). This agrees with our findings in children with non-viable lesions only. The authors also reviewed 10 observational studies and found conflicting results (<LINK REF="REF-Mazumdar-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mazumdar 2007</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
<P>Del Brutto and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Del-Brutto-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Del Brutto 2006</LINK>) reported a meta-analysis of 11 randomized trials of patients with neurocysticercosis located in or adjacent to the cerebral parenchyma. Anthelmintic drug therapy was associated with complete resolution of viable lesions (44% versus 19%; P = 0.025) at follow up. Trials on non-viable lesions showed a trend toward lesion resolution favouring anthelmintic drugs (72% versus 63%; P = 0.38), but this was not significant. In patients with non-viable lesions, risk for seizure recurrence was lower after anthelmintic treatment (14% versus 37%; P &lt; 0.001). The single trial evaluating the frequency of seizures in patients with non-viable lesions showed a 67% reduction in the rate of generalized seizures with treatment (P = 0.006).</P>
<P>As far as we know, there have been no other meta-analyses undertaken to compare different durations of treatment.</P>
<P>Ongoing trials are still using regimens of 10 days albendazole (<LINK REF="STD-Gilman-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gilman 2007</LINK>) despite evidence that shorter treatment durations may be as effective. These findings have implications relating to cost and patient choice and adherence in what may be an expensive disease to treat; a recent study in India reported that the total costs per patient of treating seizures associated with a single cysticerci in the brain may be equivalent to around half the per capita Gross National Product of the country (<LINK REF="REF-Murthy-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murthy 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Current consensus guidelines for the treatment of neurocysticercosis (<LINK REF="REF-Garcia-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nogales_x002d_Gaete-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nogales-Gaete 2006</LINK>) do not give any definitive advice on anthelmintic treatment for patients with five or fewer, or more than 100, viable lesions, or fewer than 100 non-viable lesions. This review presents evidence that albendazole treatment may reduce the recurrence of seizures in children with a single non-viable lesion, and reduce the persistence of lesions in neuroimaging in persons with small numbers of viable lesions<B>. </B>We did not find enough evidence to draw any conclusions on the safety and effectiveness of treatment for heavy parenchymal infection or extra-parenchymal (subarachnoid or ventricular) neurocysticercosis. There is also no current consensus on the use of corticosteroids when anthelmintics are used in cases of five or fewer viable cysts, or fewer than 100 non-viable lesions. This review presents evidence that corticosteroids may reduce the incidence of adverse events during treatment, even in people with only non-viable lesions or with small numbers of viable lesions.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-11-11 09:40:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne-Marie Stephani">
<P>For children with parenchymal neurocysticercosis, and with small numbers of non-viable neurocysticercosis lesions in the brain, albendazole treatment at the standard dose may reduce the risk of recurrence of seizures in the medium term (six to 18 months). However, it is still unclear whether and how different groups benefit from albendazole treatment. There is some evidence that parasite clearance may be speeded up in patients with viable lesions, but no evidence that this has any impact on seizure recurrence. Short courses of seven days or less are as effective as longer courses,<B> </B>although there is not enough evidence to say what the optimum duration of treatment is. Adverse events during treatment, including headache, dizziness, and gastrointestinal symptoms, are common. There is some indirect evidence that they may be reduced by giving corticosteroids with the albendazole and prescribing albendazole for the minimum effective duration, but this needs to be evaluated through randomized comparisons.</P>
<P>There is not enough evidence available to assess the effects of praziquantel treatment in any group, or albendazole treatment in people with moderate or heavy infections or extra-parenchymal cysts. It is not known whether people who are HIV positive will respond to treatment in the same way, as it is assumed that most participants in the included studies were HIV negative.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-11-09 14:45:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne-Marie Stephani">
<P>Further good quality, randomized controlled trials are needed to assess the effectiveness of albendazole treatment in different groups of patients, including adults and children, and people with different stages and numbers of lesions (less than five, five to 100 and more than 100). Some trials should include participants with heavy parenchymal infections, and those with any kind of extra-parenchymal infection. At least one trial should also include participants who are HIV positive, as HIV infection is common in Africa where neurocysticercosis is also common. Trials should carefully assess, record, and analyse the outcomes likely to be of most interest to the patient, including adverse events during treatment, recurrence of seizures, and successful withdrawal of anti-epileptic drugs.</P>
<P>Once it is clear which groups might benefit from albendazole treatment, trials should assess the optimal dosage and duration of albendazole treatment for different groups of people with different forms of neurocysticercosis. These should compare treatment of seven days duration with shorter durations, including treatment for as few as three days.</P>
