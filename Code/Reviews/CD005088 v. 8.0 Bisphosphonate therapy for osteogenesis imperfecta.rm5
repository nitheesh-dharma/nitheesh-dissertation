<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We reviewed the evidence about the effect and safety of bisphosphonates in increasing bone mineral density, reducing fractures and improving clinical function in people with osteogenesis imperfecta. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Osteogenesis imperfecta is also known as brittle bone disease. It is a genetic condition which can be passed on from a parent to child or occur in the child without any other family history. An affected person is at risk for frequent breaks of the long bones or collapse of the bones of the spine. There is no cure for osteogenesis imperfecta and treatment is mostly supportive.</P>
<P>
<B>Search date</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence is current to: 28 April 2016.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>This review looked at trials studying one of the groups of medications known as bisphosphonates which are more typically used to treat osteoporosis. They are used in osteogenesis imperfecta to try and reduce the number of bone fractures in affected individuals.</P>
<P>We included 14 trials, and most of these did not show a major reduction in fractures in affected individuals when treated with bisphosphonates.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Each trial independently showed significant improvements in bone mineral density after treatment with oral or intravenous bisphosphonates. Bone pain, growth and quality of life indicators were not reported in enough detail and the effects of this treatment need further investigation. The long-term effectiveness and safety of bisphosphates, as well as dose and duration of therapy, require extended evaluation</P>

<P>Osteogenesis imperfecta is caused by a genetic defect resulting in an abnormal type I collagen bone matrix which typically results in multiple fractures with little or no trauma. Bisphosphonates are used in an attempt to increase bone mineral density and reduce these fractures in people with osteogenesis imperfecta.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-10-17 10:30:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Fourteen trials (819 participants) were included. Overall, the trials were mainly at a low risk of bias, although selective reporting was an issue in several of the trials. Data for oral bisphosphonates versus placebo could not be aggregated; a statistically significant difference favouring oral bisphosphonates in fracture risk reduction and number of fractures was noted in two trials. No differences were reported in the remaining three trials which commented on fracture incidence. Five trials reported data for spine bone mineral density; all found statistically significant increased lumbar spine density z scores for at least one time point studied. For intravenous bisphosphonates versus placebo, aggregated data from two trials showed no statistically significant difference for the number of participants with at least one fracture, risk ratio 0.56 (95% confidence interval 0.30 to 1.06). In the remaining trial no statistically significant difference was noted in fracture incidence. For spine bone mineral density, no statistically significant difference was noted in the aggregated data from two trials, mean difference 9.96 (95% confidence interval -2.51 to 22.43). In the remaining trial a statistically significant difference in mean per cent change in spine bone mineral density z score favoured intravenous bisphosphonates at six and 12 months. Data describing growth, bone pain, and functional outcomes after oral or intravenous bisphosphonate therapy, or both, as compared to placebo were incomplete among all studies, but do not show consistent improvements in these outcomes. Two studies compared different doses of bisphosphonates. No differences were found between doses when bone mineral density, fractures, and height or length z score were assessed. One trial compared oral versus intravenous bisphosphonates and found no differences in primary outcomes. Two studies compared the intravenous bisphosphonates zoledronic acid and pamidronate. There were no significant differences in primary outcome. However, the studies were at odds as to the relative benefit of zoledronic acid over pamidronate for lumbosacral bone mineral density at 12 months.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-07-17 13:21:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Bisphophonates are commonly prescribed to individuals with osteogenesis imperfecta. Current evidence, albeit limited, demonstrates oral or intravenous bisphosphonates increase bone mineral density in children and adults with this condition. These were not shown to be different in their ability to increase bone mineral density. It is unclear whether oral or intravenous bisphosphonate treatment consistently decreases fractures, though multiple studies report this independently and no studies report an increased fracture rate with treatment. The studies included here do not show bisphosphonates conclusively improve clinical status (reduce pain; improve growth and functional mobility) in people with osteogenesis imperfecta. Given their current widespread and expected continued use, the optimal method, duration of therapy and long-term safety of bisphosphonate therapy require further investigation. In addition, attention should be given to long-term fracture reduction and improvement in quality of life indicators.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-10-17 10:05:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>A definition of terms is available at: <A HREF="http://www.cochrane.org/glossary">www.cochrane.org/glossary</A>.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-10-17 10:05:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is an inherited, and most often autosomal dominant condition, caused by mutations in genes encoding type I collagen (<LINK REF="REF-Steiner-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steiner 2013</LINK>). Several recessive genetic defects have been identified as causing OI. This condition (sometimes called brittle bone disease) is characterized by bone fragility, and predisposition to fractures, in many cases with minimal or no trauma. Low bone mass is a common but not universal feature. In addition to multiple fractures, individuals with OI also commonly exhibit joint hypermobility, blue or grey-blue scleral colour, dentinogenesis imperfecta (a genetic disorder of tooth development), and premature hearing loss (<LINK REF="REF-Cole-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cole 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Type I collagen is the most abundant protein of bone and is also present in ligaments, tendons, dentin, sclera, and skin. Normal bone matrix is composed of 90% Type I collagen fibers and 10% non-collagenous proteins. These collagen fibers are usually oriented in a preferential direction with hydroxyapatite [Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2] crystals located in the ground substance within these fibers. Hydroxyapatite crystals provide mechanical rigidity and strength to bone whereas collagen fibers provide resilience. Individuals with OI have less or poorer quality (or both) type-I collagen than unaffected people, causing their bones to deform or fracture (or both). In 80% to 90% of people with OI, mutations in one of the two genes encoding type I collagen chains, COL1A1 and COL1A2, are found (<LINK REF="REF-Byers-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Byers 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>The exact incidence of OI is unknown as milder forms may be unrecognized. Finnish data published in 2002 by Kuurila suggests six per 100,000 individuals are affected with the disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Kuurila-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuurila 2002</LINK>). Other studies suggest the incidence of severe OI may be as high as 1 in 25,000 live births (<LINK REF="REF-Byers-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Byers 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Connor-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Connor 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Orioli-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orioli 1995</LINK>). Parents with OI caused by collagen mutations have a dominant disorder and 50% risk of having an affected child with each pregnancy. The majority of children with OI have inherited the disorder from a parent. <I>De novo</I> mutations account for approximately 35% of children with OI (<LINK REF="REF-OIF-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">OIF 2008</LINK>). There are a number of less common causes of OI which are inherited as a recessive disorder in which case the risk is 25%. In general, these recessive forms of OI are more severe.</P>
<P>Prior to the availability of molecular genetic analyses, four major phenotypic classifications of OI were identified based on Sillence criteria which includes inheritance mode, clinical presentation and radiographic findings (<LINK REF="REF-Sillence-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sillence 1979</LINK>). Further refinement of these classifications was made with molecular genetic analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Byers-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Byers 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Byers-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Byers 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glorieux-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glorieux 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-OIF-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">OIF 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steiner-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steiner 2013</LINK>). However, recently, the classification has once again been reviewed as the clinical utility of multiple subtypes of OI based on molecular diagnoses was limited. A return to the more clinically useful classification scheme has been recommended as represented in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> (<LINK REF="REF-Sillence-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sillence 2012</LINK>). The diagnosis is made by a combination of history including family history, clinical examination, and radiographic findings with genetic and/or biochemical testing available for diagnostic confirmation.</P>
<P>In about 80% to 90% of individuals affected by OI, mutations in either of the genes encoding the pro-&#945;1 or pro-&#945;2 chains of type I collagen (COL1A1 or COL1A2) can be identified (<LINK REF="REF-Byers-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Byers 2013</LINK>). Of those without collagen gene mutations, a number will have mutations in proteins involved in post-translational modification or transport of type 1 collagen. These mutations tend to result in the progressively deforming type of OI (formerly Type III) or lethal OI (formerly Type II) and are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Genes involved include the following; CRTAP, P3H1/LEPRE1, PPIB, FKBP10, SERPINH1, SP7/OSX, SERPINF1, BMP1 and WNT1 (<LINK REF="REF-Alanay-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alanay 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Barnes-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Becker-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Becker 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cabral-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cabral 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cho-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cho 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Christiansen-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Christiansen 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lapunzina-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lapunzina 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Martinez_x002d_Glez-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martinez-Glez 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pyott-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pyott 2013</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Van-Dijk-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Dijk 2009</LINK>). The subtype of OI associated with interosseous calcification and hypertrophic callus and inherited in an autosomal dominant manner was recently identified to be caused by a 5'UTR mutation of the IFITM5 gene (<LINK REF="REF-Semler-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Semler 2012</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-01-24 12:49:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is no cure for OI and therapy is largely supportive at present. Therapy is varied and individualized depending upon OI severity, degree of impairment and age of the individual. Orthopedic management is paramount; surgical intervention or bracing of lower limbs, or both, is often required. Physical and occupational therapy are mainstays of therapy. Pharmacologic agents including growth hormone, calcitonin, parathyroid hormone, sodium fluoride, and vitamins have been administered in attempts to reduce fractures and deformities in OI. Oral and intravenous (IV) bisphosphonates are currently the most promising pharmacologic therapy and are routinely used for OI, since clinical trials of these agents have consistently shown improvements in bone mineral density (BMD) in people with OI. A prior version of this review and other systematic reviews have since found consistent improvements of BMD in people with OI who are treated with various bisphosphonates (<LINK REF="REF-Castillo-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Castillo 2009</LINK>). Some trials also show fracture risk reduction and growth enhancement.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-01-24 12:07:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Bisphosphonates act by inactivating osteoclasts, the cells that break down bone tissue, thereby inhibiting bone resorption (<LINK REF="REF-Fisher-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fisher 1999</LINK>). There are two different types of bisphosphonates, nitrogenous and non-nitrogenous. Nitrogenous bisphosphonates disrupt osteoclast formation, survival and cytoskeletal dynamics. Non-nitrogenous bisphosphonates initiate osteoclast apoptosis. The bisphosphonates vary in their efficacy and absorption when taken orally, making direct comparison challenging. An additional table lists the currently available bisphosphonates (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>Bisphosphonates are widely used in post-menopausal women to treat osteoporosis where they have been shown to increase bone density, decrease bone turnover (<LINK REF="REF-Reid-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reid 2002</LINK>) and reduce fractures (<LINK REF="REF-Black-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Black 1996</LINK>). Although increases in BMD are not expected to alter the underlying defective Type I collagen in OI, it is anticipated that increased BMD might lead to decreased fracture rates analogous to bisphosphonate therapy in post-menopausal women with osteoporosis (<LINK REF="REF-Reid-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reid 2002</LINK>). Animal models give reason for optimism as increases in BMD in a mouse model of OI are accompanied by decreases in fracture rate (<LINK REF="REF-Camacho-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Camacho 2001</LINK>). Still, caution is advised, since the biology of OI differs from osteoporosis and improving bone density without altering resiliency may not lead to desired functional improvements (<LINK REF="REF-Marini-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marini 2003</LINK>). A report of bisphosphonate-induced osteopetrosis validates these concerns (<LINK REF="REF-Whyte-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whyte 2003</LINK>). </P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-08-30 11:09:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>There is currently no consensus on the effectiveness and safety of these agents in the treatment of OI. Optimal timing of treatment in both children and adults remains undefined, as does dose and duration of treatment. Additionally, it is not fully understood whether fracture healing or post-surgical healing (or both) in people with OI will be impacted by bisphosphonate therapy. The optimal duration of bisphosphonate use is unclear even in post-menopausal women (<LINK REF="REF-FDA-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 2011</LINK>). Emerging data from clinical trials and observational studies support an association between bisphosphonate use and atypical subtrochanteric femur fractures. These observations prompted the FDA to issue a warning regarding this possible adverse event (<LINK REF="REF-Erviti-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Erviti 2013</LINK>). One of the authors (RS) observed such a complication in a teenage patient treated with alendronate.</P>
<P>Children's natural proclivity towards increased BMD and growth, coupled with the tendency for decreased fractures with advancing age in children with OI, make data comparison between adults and children difficult. Large, multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled trials to better assess the specific effects of bisphosphonate therapy for OI are still indicated. The goals for use of pharmacologic agents in OI include increased bone density as measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), decreased fracture incidence, lessening of deformity, reduced pain, and improved growth and mobility.</P>

When summary statistics from two studies were calculated, there was no statistically significant differences between treatment and control groups in spine BMD at six months, MD 9.96 (95% CI -2.51 to 22.43) (I² = 89%) and at 12 months, MD 14.68 (95% CI -6.08 to 35.45) (I² = 95%) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>) (<LINK REF="STD-Adami-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Adami 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gatti-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gatti 2005</LINK>). However, it should be noted that the I² values are very large, representing a considerable amount of heterogeneity, I² = 89% and 95% respectively, although there are only two studies.

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-10-17 10:32:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>All trials assessing BMD independently reported statistically significant increases after treatment with either oral or IV bisphosphonate and sometimes at separate sites (spine, hip, femur). However, it is difficult to compare these trials directly as different populations were included (adults versus children; for accurate comparisons children cannot be compared to adults due to high bone turnover during childhood and adolescence and open epiphyses). Additionally, different reporting indices were used (z score versus t score versus total BMD). As previously mentioned, the expected growth and BMD increases in children and adolescents with OI, coupled with their tendency for decreased fractures, make data comparison challenging. Statistically significant gains in spine and hip BMD were not seen with IV bisphosphonate administration at six and 12 months with combined summary statistics, indicating the need for continued rigorous study (<LINK REF="STD-Adami-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Adami 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gatti-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gatti 2005</LINK>). Interestingly, multiple trials reported the largest gains in BMD in the first year of therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Adami-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Adami 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bishop-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bishop 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chevrel-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Chevrel 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gatti-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gatti 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Letocha-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Letocha 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rauch-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Rauch 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ward-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ward 2010</LINK>) and gains in BMD were independent of administration of therapy in a placebo-controlled cross-over trial (<LINK REF="STD-Seikaly-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Seikaly 2005</LINK>). Two trials showed greater increases with higher dosing (<LINK REF="STD-Bishop-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bishop 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Senthilnathan-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Senthilnathan 2008</LINK>); one of which showed a statistically significant increase in BMD only at the higher dosing schedule (<LINK REF="STD-Bishop-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bishop 2010</LINK>). These data possibly argue for the study and consideration of short-course bisphosphonate therapy. When oral and IV bisphosphonates were directly compared, both statistically significantly increased spine BMD z scores at 12 and 24 months, but there were no differences in BMD between groups when route of administration was considered (<LINK REF="STD-DiMeglio-2006" TYPE="STUDY">DiMeglio 2006</LINK>) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>).</P>
<P>The combined data analyses supporting a change in fracture incidence after bisphosphonate therapy are less straightforward. Adami reported a 14% reduction of fractures after adults were treated with IV neridronate (<LINK REF="STD-Adami-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Adami 2003</LINK>). Sakkers found a 31% reduction in the relative risk of fracture of long bones after treatment with oral olpadronate in children affected with OI (<LINK REF="STD-Sakkers-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sakkers 2004</LINK>). Relative risk of fracture was also reduced by 0.36% in another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Gatti-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gatti 2005</LINK>). Seikaly noted a non-significant trend toward decreased fractures (<LINK REF="STD-Seikaly-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Seikaly 2005</LINK>). DiMeglio found no differences in fracture incidence with oral versus IV bisphosphonate administration and noted a decreased fracture incidence with time, but only when oral and IV groups were combined (<LINK REF="STD-DiMeglio-2006" TYPE="STUDY">DiMeglio 2006</LINK>). Letocha found decreased upper extremity but not lower extremity fracture rates in the first year of therapy but no further increases were noted when therapy was extended (<LINK REF="STD-Letocha-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Letocha 2005</LINK>). Bishop reported an overall tendency to reduced fracture incidence when compared to the fracture incidence over the prior two years. They noted no statistically significant difference between the dose of oral bisphosphonates (<LINK REF="STD-Bishop-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bishop 2010</LINK>). A larger trial by Bishop reported statistically significant difference in fracture incidence between children treated with risedronate and the placebo control group; 31% versus 49% respectively. However, during the following two years of open-label study, the same groups reported fracture incidence of 53% and 65% respectively (<LINK REF="STD-Bishop-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bishop 2013</LINK>). Chevrel found no difference in vertebral or peripheral fracture rates but was not adequately powered to detect a difference (<LINK REF="STD-Chevrel-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Chevrel 2006</LINK>). A further three trials did not identify a statistically significant difference in fracture incidence, although the Senthilnathan trial did make note of an improvement in infant spinal crush fracture (<LINK REF="STD-Rauch-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Rauch 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Senthilnathan-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Senthilnathan 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ward-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ward 2010</LINK>). It should be noted that none of the 14 included trials reported increased fractures with bisphosphonate treatment. When we further analysed the number of participants with at least one fracture, we found no difference in fractures in those treated with IV neridronate compared to the control population (<LINK REF="STD-Adami-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Adami 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gatti-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gatti 2005</LINK>) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). These trials employed retrospective fracture recall as a method for comparison, leading to potential recall bias. The number of participants randomised versus those lost to follow up was also unclear in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Adami-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Adami 2003</LINK>). Consideration of reported heterogeneous results, in addition to the aforementioned natural tendency toward reduction in fractures with age highlight the importance of continued prospective, placebo-controlled evaluation of bisphosphonates and fracture incidence in children. This is possible given widespread bisphosphonate use.</P>
<P>All 14 trials measured serum and urine markers (or both) of either bone formation or resorption (or both). The trials did not focus on the same biochemical markers, but each applied best practice with respect to sample collection and remained consistent to the marker chosen to represent bone turnover. Twelve trials reported decreases in serum (<LINK REF="STD-Adami-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Adami 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barros-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Barros 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bishop-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bishop 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chevrel-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Chevrel 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DiMeglio-2006" TYPE="STUDY">DiMeglio 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gatti-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gatti 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rauch-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Rauch 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Senthilnathan-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Senthilnathan 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zoledronic-Acid-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Zoledronic Acid 2008</LINK>) or urine type I collagen by products (<LINK REF="STD-Adami-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Adami 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bishop-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bishop 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DiMeglio-2006" TYPE="STUDY">DiMeglio 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seikaly-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Seikaly 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ward-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ward 2010</LINK>) whereas two trials reported no statistical difference in biochemical markers of bone turnover between treatment and control groups or from baseline (<LINK REF="STD-Letocha-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Letocha 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sakkers-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sakkers 2004</LINK>). The clinical significance and utilization of these biochemical markers of bone turnover are not universally utilized, however, the assumption is they act as a proxy for efficacy of therapy. These markers are not specific to process but indicate a change in bone homeostasis and are not reliable indicators of acute change. The varied markers chosen for study in the trials we reviewed prohibited direct comparison, but more systematic study of these markers could assist investigators in assessing response to individual bisphosphonates and their dosing, as well as participant compliance or concordance, or both, with therapy.</P>
<P>Bisphosphonate therapy was not conclusively shown to impact vertical growth. Ten trials included in this review commented on growth. Seikaly reported increased height z scores with oral bisphosphonates (<LINK REF="STD-Seikaly-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Seikaly 2005</LINK>). Growth as assessed by height and length combined z scores compared to normal children was increased in another trial when children receiving oral and IV therapies were combined (<LINK REF="STD-DiMeglio-2006" TYPE="STUDY">DiMeglio 2006</LINK>). Letocha found growth rates were unchanged by bisphosphonate therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Letocha-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Letocha 2005</LINK>). Seated height and vertebral height were also not different in the treatment versus placebo group of another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Sakkers-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sakkers 2004</LINK>). Two trials compared different bisphosphonates to one another and did not show a significant difference in vertical growth rates between the therapies under investigation, they however did not compare data to normalized standards and thus no commentary can be made on their impact on vertical growth (<LINK REF="STD-Barros-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Barros 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zoledronic-Acid-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Zoledronic Acid 2008</LINK>). No difference in z scores were noted in the remaining five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bishop-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bishop 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bishop-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bishop 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rauch-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Rauch 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Senthilnathan-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Senthilnathan 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ward-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ward 2010</LINK>). It is not within the scope of this review to distinguish between bisphosphonate responsiveness in different OI types, however it is interesting to note that milder forms of OI showed more improvements in growth and BMD in at least one trial (<LINK REF="STD-DiMeglio-2006" TYPE="STUDY">DiMeglio 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is important to determine whether bisphosphonate administration translates into functional changes. Bone pain and quality of life were addressed in several trials. Decreased pain scores and decreased analgesic use were reported in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Seikaly-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Seikaly 2005</LINK>). The remaining trials which included pain and other quality of life measures found no difference in self-reported pain scores (<LINK REF="STD-Bishop-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bishop 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bishop-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bishop 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chevrel-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Chevrel 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Letocha-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Letocha 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rauch-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Rauch 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ward-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ward 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zoledronic-Acid-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Zoledronic Acid 2008</LINK>). The exception within these data was of increased pain with bisphosphonates at 36 months only (<LINK REF="STD-Chevrel-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Chevrel 2006</LINK>). When the authors re-evaluated this difference, they found it statistically significant in the intention-to-treat analysis, but not in the per protocol analysis. Seikaly found improved well-being scores and increases in self-care abilities but no change in mobility (<LINK REF="STD-Seikaly-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Seikaly 2005</LINK>). However, Sakkers found no changes in self-care abilities, nor did the authors find changes in strength or mobility when compared to placebo controls (<LINK REF="STD-Sakkers-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sakkers 2004</LINK>). Additionally, no differences in gross motor abilities or other quality of life measures were found in several trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bishop-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bishop 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bishop-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bishop 2013</LINK> ; <LINK REF="STD-Letocha-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Letocha 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rauch-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Rauch 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ward-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ward 2010</LINK>). Chevrel was the only trial to assess hearing and found no change in Rinne testing with bisphosphonate therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Chevrel-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Chevrel 2006</LINK>). Taken together, the data presented here do not support consistent improvements in these quality of life indicators with bisphosphonate administration. Nevertheless, clinicians caring for people affected by OI have the strong anecdotal impression bisphosphonate treatment results in reduction in pain and subsequent increased mobility and functionality. These secondary outcomes were assessed by a few trials in this review, but represent an important need in future research. One may argue fracture rates may not be the only appropriate primary outcome of interest if a population with fragile bones were to have increased mobility as a result of treatment. It is difficult to quantify general well-being, perhaps a more granular analysis needs to be developed looking at participation in daily events with less emphasis on pain.</P>
<P>Trials including IV and oral bisphosphonate use were included in this review. Mean bisphosphonate oral bioavailability (alendronate) in children is comparable to that found in adult trials, with approximately 50% localizing to bone (<LINK REF="STD-Ward-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ward 2005</LINK>). However, individual oral bioavailability of alendronate varies as much as ten-fold and could contribute to variable responsiveness (<LINK REF="STD-Ward-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ward 2005</LINK>). It was noted that there was a large individual variance in bioavaliability of zolendronate in children, but there was no apparent effect of gender, body weight or creatinine clearance in participants with normal renal function (<LINK REF="STD-Zoledronic-Acid-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Zoledronic Acid 2008</LINK>). We did not separately assess different bisphosphonate preparations although we have distinguished between oral and IV therapy. Different preparations and pharmacogenetic variability potentially underlie heterogeneous responses in individual participants. Additionally, although we made no attempt to distinguish between OI type and response to bisphosphonate therapy, it is entirely plausible different OI types will respond to therapy differently as one trial suggests (<LINK REF="STD-DiMeglio-2004" TYPE="STUDY">DiMeglio 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although specific data were not extracted, bisphosphonate therapy administered for one to three years appears to be safe and well-tolerated in the adults and children treated here. Adverse effects of bisphosphonates are few and minor in this population (gastrointestinal complaints - often comparable to placebo in the trials we reviewed, fever, headache, small decreases in lymphocyte counts) and the drugs are generally well-tolerated (<LINK REF="STD-Bishop-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bishop 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DiMeglio-2006" TYPE="STUDY">DiMeglio 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Letocha-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Letocha 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rauch-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Rauch 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ward-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ward 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Senthilnathan-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Senthilnathan 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ward-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ward 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zoledronic-Acid-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Zoledronic Acid 2008</LINK>). Flu-like symptoms described as "acute phase reactions" were common with IV administration of bisphosphonates, particularly with the first infusion (<LINK REF="STD-DiMeglio-2006" TYPE="STUDY">DiMeglio 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Letocha-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Letocha 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zoledronic-Acid-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Zoledronic Acid 2008</LINK>) but rarely contributed to trial withdrawal. Intravenous access was difficult in one trial not included in this review where four of nine children less than three years required central line placement for IV bisphosphonate administration (<LINK REF="STD-DiMeglio-2004" TYPE="STUDY">DiMeglio 2004</LINK>). Intravenous access was otherwise not reported to be problematic in children or adults. Clinical and laboratory evidence of hypocalcemia was reported in the zoledronic acid clinical trial which identified 22% of the participants treated with zolderonic acid and 9% of participants treated with pamidronate to have hypocalcemia (<LINK REF="STD-Zoledronic-Acid-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Zoledronic Acid 2008</LINK>). However, clinical or laboratory evidence of hypocalcemia was not found (<LINK REF="STD-Bishop-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bishop 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seikaly-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Seikaly 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ward-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ward 2005</LINK>) nor was evidence of hepatic or renal dysfunction or changes in nephrocalcinosis as measured by ultrasound in those treated with bisphosphonates (<LINK REF="STD-Barros-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Barros 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sakkers-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sakkers 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seikaly-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Seikaly 2005</LINK>). Emerging data from clinical trials and observational studies do, however, support a concern for bisphosphonate use and atypical subtrochanteric femur fractures (<LINK REF="REF-Erviti-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Erviti 2013</LINK>). The optimal method, dose, initiation and duration of therapy remain unclear. However, IV neridronate has been administered to infants with OI as young as neonates with reported improved growth and lowered fracture incidence (<LINK REF="STD-Antoniazzi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Antoniazzi 2006</LINK>). A more extensive safety review of bisphosphonate use in children with low BMD and fragility fractures in juvenile idiopathic arthritis has been recently published (<LINK REF="REF-Thornton-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thornton 2006</LINK>). A rare, but serious side effect of bisphonates is osteonecrosis of the jaw. This presumably occurs from over-suppression of bone turnover and occurs more commonly in elderly people with cancer taking primarily IV bisphosphonates (<LINK REF="REF-Woo-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woo 2006</LINK>). To our knowledge, osteonecrosis of the jaw has not been reported in children or adults with OI.</P>
<P>We identified a recent abstract outlining an RCT evaluating subcutaneous teriparatide in adults (<A HREF="http://www.ashg.org/2013meeting/abstracts/fulltext/f130121209.htm">www.ashg.org/2013meeting/abstracts/fulltext/f130121209.htm</A>). These data show statistically significant changes in BMD as well as significant changes in markers of bone metabolism. No comment was made of fracture incidence but as this data has not yet been published in a peer-review journal, further analysis and discussion of this data was not undertaken. The use of parathyroid analogues is further supported by another recent publication where individuals who continued to fracture after bisphosphonate therapy were treated with teriparatide and showed a positive response in biomarkers (<LINK REF="REF-Gatti-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gatti 2013</LINK>). To date, the focus of pharmacological treatment for OI has been on bisphosphonates. Byers reviewed pharmacological agents used prior to 1991 (<LINK REF="REF-Byers-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Byers 1992</LINK>).</P>

The primary and secondary outcome measures were reasonably evenly represented within these trials, methodologies varied and direct comparison of data was at times not possible. Meta-analysis of the available data was limited due to the different agents used (oral versus IV bisphosphonates), different outcome measures, different populations (adults versus children), different reporting indices (z score versus t score versus total BMD), and variable inclusion of a placebo or control group.

<P>The results from the included trials provide evidence for statistically significant improvement in BMD in individuals affected with OI when treated with either oral or IV bisphosphonates. It remains to be seen whether this increase in BMD is a surrogate marker for fracture reduction and clinical functional improvement. At this time, comparative data remains inconclusive though several trials reported here individually show improvements in fracture incidence. Additionally, the long-term safety of bisphosphonates in OI, particularly when used in children, and the risk of bisphosphonates to cause atypical femur fractures, impair perioperative or fracture bone healing (or both), as well as increased bone density if unmonitored, have not been sufficiently evaluated. The duration of use once BMD is improved requires thoughtful study. Effects of bisphosphonates on growth, bone deformity, mobility, and pain have been reviewed but absolute benefits remain inconclusive,</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-09-22 15:46:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Despite widespread use, a number of questions concerning bisphosphonate therapy in children and adults with OI remain unanswered. In particular whether increases in BMD convincingly translate into fracture reduction and functional improvement.</P>
<P>Additionally, the following remain unclear.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Are bisphosphonates equally safe and effective in children and adults? What are the long-term effects of osteoclast inhibitors like bisphosphonates on the immature growing skeleton? Will they be licensed for use in children (<A HREF="http://www.fda.gov/cder/foi/esum/2003/20560se1-038BPCA.PDF">www.fda.gov/cder/foi/esum/2003/20560se1-038BPCA.PDF</A>)?</LI>
<LI>Are there differences in the safety or efficacy of IV versus oral bisphosphonates? Are there differences in safety and efficacy of individual bisphosphonates in OI? Does the optimal method, dosage, length of therapy as well as optimal therapeutic window also warrant investigation?</LI>
<LI>Will the efficacy of bisphosphonates in increasing BMD be confirmed in larger studies, and with more heterogeneous participants? Does the efficacy of bisphosphonates differ by OI clinical type or mutation type? Are bisphosphonates useful in OI types which do not increase bone turnover?</LI>
<LI>Do bisphosphonates, when used in people with OI, delay or impair fracture healing, or peri-operative bone healing?</LI>
</UL>
<P>Well-designed, adequately-powered, placebo-controlled RCTs assessing the longitudinal effects of bisphosphonates on BMD, fracture reduction and healing, and changes in quality of life indicators such as function and pain should be studied in both children and adults with OI. These trials should be prospective, longitudinal, double-blinded, using comparable assessments of change including z scores for BMD and vertical growth, as well as validated assessments measuring pain and quality of life outcomes. Quality of life outcomes should be broadened to include other factors important to people with OI, such as hearing and dentition and biochemical markers of bone turnover should be carefully assessed to determine if they are an adequate proxy for dose efficacy and subject concordance with therapy. Spontaneous versus non-spontaneous fractures should be investigated in these trials as well as bone healing after fractures and operative intervention with bisphosphonates.<BR/>
