<P>Methods for treating patients with some missing teeth.</P>
<P>Patients with some missing teeth have several treatment options available to them. They need to know what the treatment options are, how much they cost and how long they can be expected to last. This review compares the options available which includes combinations of fixed and removable dentures, bridges and implants. Although there were 21 trials included in this review, there were so many variations in the types of these interventions that it is not possible to determine which are effective replacements for missing teeth in terms of durability, function, comfort and appearance. The trials also failed to report comparisons between the costs of different treatments or any possible harms.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-01-12 20:06:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 21 March 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2011, Issue 1), MEDLINE via OVID (1950 to March 2011) and EMBASE via OVID (1980 to March 2011). There were no restrictions regarding language or date of publication. We contacted several authors to identify non-published trials.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2011-03-04 12:33:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Worthington">
<P>Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different methods (including the design and materials used) of treating partial edentulism, with clinically relevant outcomes, were included in this review. Trials reporting only surrogate outcomes, such as plaque accumulation or gingival volume, were excluded from this review.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-01-12 20:07:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Worthington">
<P>Two review authors independently carried out the screening of eligible studies, assessment of dimensions of quality of trials, and data extraction. Results were expressed as mean differences for continuous data, risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes, and hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals for time-to-event data.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-01-13 08:53:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Twenty-one trials met the inclusion criteria for this review. Twenty-four per cent of these were assessed as being at high risk of bias and the remainder were at unclear risk of bias. The clinical heterogeneity among the included studies precluded any attempt at meta-analysis. There was insufficient evidence to determine whether one type of removable dental prosthesis (RDP) was better or worse than another. With fixed dental prostheses (FDPs), there was no evidence that high gold alloys are better or worse than other alloys, nor that gold alloys or frameworks are better or worse than titanium. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether zirconia is better or worse that other FDP materials, that ceramic abutments are better or worse than titanium, or that one cement was better or worse than another in retaining FDPs. There is insufficient evidence to determine the relative effectiveness of FDPs and RDPs in patients with shortened dental arch or to determine the relative advantages of implant supported FDPs versus tooth/implant supported FDPs.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2012-01-16 11:41:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Worthington">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-01-16 11:38:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Worthington">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-01-16 11:38:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Worthington">
<P>Management of individuals presenting with partial loss of teeth has been a common task of dentists for decades. The condition can be the result of congenital processes, a partial lack of tooth development (hypodontia), but more commonly is an acquired condition due to microbial-mediated caries, periodontal disease or trauma. Epidemiological measures of tooth loss suggest that while complete tooth loss is on the decline, more people will maintain teeth as they age and partial tooth loss will continue to require management by the dental professional (<LINK REF="REF-Marcus-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marcus 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>The two major oral diseases, dental caries and periodontal disease, are both microbial-mediated processes involving bacteria indigenous to the mouth and impact individuals worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Pihlstrom-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pihlstrom 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Selwitz-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Selwitz 2007</LINK>). While individual patient risk for each disease and individual patient hygiene practices necessary to control this risk may both vary, a bacterial component necessary for each disease is chronically available throughout life.  Tooth loss is a major consequence of each of these diseases and occurs throughout life. The variation of tooth loss geographically in the US strongly suggests a sociodemographic influence (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 1999</LINK>). Patterns for specific tooth loss are associated with tooth risk, and in general, posterior teeth are more prone to tooth loss versus anterior teeth, and maxillary tooth loss is seen earlier than mandibular tooth loss.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Challenge of evidence facing tooth loss management</HEADING>
<P>Management of tooth loss over the past few decades has grown in scope due to the demonstrated predictability of dental implants. Fixed and removable prostheses with and without the use of implants are options available to patients. Evidence to support specific options for managing various patterns of partial tooth loss has been hampered by a lack of accepted standardized outcomes as well as the typical short-term follow-up with clinical trials (<LINK REF="REF-Jokstad-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jokstad 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Unlike acute conditions where treatment reverses the impact of disease to a state of normal tissue integrity and function, tooth replacements are an artificial substitute for a chronic loss and as such are used to manage tooth loss. In this context tooth loss is similar to other chronic conditions/illnesses requiring a long-term management mind set. The manner with which they do so is best captured by outcomes related to both tissue(s) and patient response collected over time for this chronic condition/illnesses requiring long-term management (<LINK REF="REF-Carr-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carr 1998</LINK>). </P>
<P>An ongoing systematic summary of the important outcomes associated with the partially absent dentition is necessary as outcome standardization and trial refinement over time evolves.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-09-20 22:28:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review includes all prostheses used for replacing missing teeth in the partially absent dentition. This includes: 1) conventional fixed and removable prostheses which utilize natural teeth/tissues, 2) implant prostheses that are fixed and removable, and 3) conus or telescopic bridges.</P>
<P>The review does not include etch-retained prostheses with minimal tooth preparation, as this type of prosthesis is described in a separate Cochrane protocol (<LINK REF="REF-Swift-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swift 2001</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-01-12 20:12:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Replacement of missing teeth is characterized as a patient-elected pursuit. Reasons for a specific patient electing care fall within domains related to patient-perceived impacts on socialization and function. Selecting among options for addressing these impacts also includes consideration of comparative costs (direct and indirect), treatment burden associated with each option, and expectations of long-term performance (time-to-event analyses) (<LINK REF="REF-Carr-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carr 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>When faced with making such an elective decision &#8211;especially when options may differ significantly in morbidity and cost- patients should have meaningful outcome information for the various options, and this information should be explained in a manner that clearly delineates important differences between options (<LINK REF="REF-Barratt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barratt 2008</LINK>). This review aims to provide some of the information to address this need for the patient and provider.</P>

<P>One study defined failure as a patient not wearing an RDP <I>a priori</I>, and therefore prosthesis breakage was not considered a failure (<LINK REF="STD-Kapur-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kapur 1994</LINK>).

This included plaque accumulation, gingival inflammation, and gingival volume, common surrogates for risk of tooth loss due to periodontal disease. Many of the <I>included</I> studies measured secondary outcomes which appeared to be surrogates, such as gingival health as measured by plaque index (number of surfaces covered by plaque), gingival index (degree of gingival inflammation), soft tissue volume, plaque composition (types of bacterial species), or periodontal pocket depth.

No statistically significant differences were found for caries rates (data not used as no standard deviations provided) or tooth mobility between the two groups. Groups were comparable at baseline for prognostic factors, and inclusion/exclusion criteria were stated in the trial.

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Different major connectors</HEADING>
<P>A 30-month parallel group randomized controlled trial of 36 patients found an increase in tooth mobility in the sublingual bar as compared with the lingual plate group (<LINK REF="STD-Akaltan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Akaltan 2005</LINK>). Tooth mobility was reported as 16.81 for the lingual bar group and 14.82 for the plate group as measured with a Periotest Instrument with mean difference 1.99 (95% CI 0.62 to 3.36) with lower mean score for the plate group (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). While this difference was statistically significant (P = 0.004) the clinical significance is unclear. All other reported outcomes, such as plaque and gingival indices, were considered surrogate outcomes. Groups were comparable at entry for important prognostic factors. As there was no mention of inclusion/exclusion criteria, method of randomization, assessor blinding, or number of drop-outs, this study was assessed as at unclear risk of bias.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Different minor connectors</HEADING>
<P>In a study testing minor connector impact on distal extension abutment stability, 25 patients were provided three different RDPs (tilting, functional, and sanitary) for 19 weeks each in a cross-over trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hosman-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hosman 1990</LINK>). The outcomes evaluated in this trial included abutment tooth migration, clasp deformation, alveolar bone height, retention, and patient satisfaction. The tilting-type RDP significantly outscored the functional and sanitary designs for patient satisfaction. There was a difference in alveolar bone height, which was not statistically significant (P = 0.07). For all other outcomes, there were no statistically significant differences between the three types of RDP. The tilting type was claimed to rank highest in retention, while causing the least mobility and migration of abutment teeth, yet graphical interpretation appears to show overlapping confidence intervals for these outcomes. As within-patient standard deviations were not given and the author could not be contacted, the data were excluded from analysis and are reported here in narrative form only.</P>

A 2-year parallel group randomized trial compared titanium RDP frameworks with conventional chromium-cobalt (<LINK REF="STD-Au-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Au 2000</LINK>). 18 patients received 23 titanium RDPs while 20 patients received 31 chromium-cobalt RDPs. Fractured frameworks occurred in 47% of titanium as compared with 14% of chromium-cobalt RDPs for a risk ratio of 3.32 (95% CI 1.19 to 9.23). Problems with the acrylic base of the RDP appeared to be similarly higher with titanium RDPs. No information was provided regarding inclusion/exclusion criteria nor comparability of groups at baseline for prognostic factors. Numbers of drop-outs in each group were unclear, but may have approached 30%. As no information was given regarding method of randomization or assessor blinding, this study was considered to be at high risk of bias. Additionally, as there is more than one prosthesis made per patient and outcomes within a patient should have been taken into account in the analysis. As the authors could not be contacted for clarification, these data are in narrative form only. There is insufficient evidence from this single trial at high risk of bias to determine whether titanium frameworks are better or worse than conventional chromium-cobalt frameworks.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Tooth/implant FDPs with rigid versus non-rigid connectors</HEADING>
<P>Forty-two patients were enrolled in a 5-year split-mouth RCT comparing tooth/implant supported FDPs with rigid and non-rigid connectors (<LINK REF="STD-Block-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Block 2002</LINK>). Each participant received two, 3-unit prostheses, one on each side of the mouth. Each prosthesis was connected to an implant at one end and a natural tooth at the other end. For each patient one side was randomly allocated to use rigid connectors and the other had non-rigid connectors. Forty-two participants entered the study, 40 had prostheses fitted and 30 participants are included in the outcome assessments at 5 years. Differences were measured at two points (tooth and implant) for each prosthesis and whether the tooth had undergone endodontic treatment was considered a prognostic indicator for likely failure. The authors reported no significant differences between the two types of connectors with regard to prosthesis survival or crestal bone loss at 5 years. There were 70 non-scheduled maintenance visits to treat problems with rigid connectors, compared to 110 visits to treat problems with the non-rigid connectors, yet it was unclear if these differences were considered significant. Patients reported satisfaction with both treatment types. Intrusion occurred in 44% of FDPs with rigid connectors and 66% with the non-rigid connectors, an average of 0.18 mm and 0.28 mm, respectively. The authors concluded that alternative treatments to the tooth/implant FDP should be considered due to the high rate of natural tooth intrusion and non-scheduled maintenance visits in both groups.</P>

<P>A six-year parallel group trial (<LINK REF="STD-Walter-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Walter 1999</LINK>) studied the effects of FDPs fabricated with titanium frameworks versus high-gold content alloys. A 5-year prosthesis survival rate of 84% (95% CI 0.79 to 0.89) for titanium and 98% (95% CI 0.96 to 1.00) for gold alloy was reported, which was a statistically significant difference (P = 0.005) in the 40% of study participants evaluated. Data on the whether the FDP was unacceptable or not (poor marginal integrity or restoration removal) showed a significant difference in favour of the high-gold content alloys with risk ratio 10.23 (95% CI 1.41 to 74.44) (Additional <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>).

<LINK REF="STD-Bessing-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bessing 1990</LINK> compared metal alloys for use in single crowns and bridges in a split-mouth trial. All patients received a high-gold content control alloy (JS C), and received either a low gold alloy (Midas) or a silver-palladium alloy (Albacast). Many of the outcomes were surrogates, such as metal tarnishing or plaque indices, while other outcomes such as craniomandibular (TMJ) function appeared to be clinically unrelated to FDP alloy type. No statistical tests (odds ratios or risk ratios) were performed on the binary data presented, but the authors reported that all alloys were within the range of acceptable (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>).

Nine patients were in each of the two groups, and none of the 25 reconstructions had failed in a trial assessed at unclear risk of bias.

<P>A new ceramic implant abutment (CerAdapt) has been designed for use in esthetically important areas. A 5-year randomized trial compared this new (test) abutment to a standard titanium abutment in implant FDPs involving 32 patients (<LINK REF="STD-Andersson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Andersson 2003</LINK>). This was both a parallel group and split-mouth trial as patients needing two short-span FDPs received both types of implant abutments. Success rates were listed at 94% (16/17) for the experimental group and 100% (12/12) for control FDPs, yet no statistical analysis was provided for this difference. The control group contained screw-retained crowns, whereas the test group were all cemented. Non-significant differences were reported for alveolar bone loss. This study was assessed as at unclear risk of bias.</P>
<P>Another 3-year randomized trial examined the differences between ceramic and titanium implant abutments on single crowns (<LINK REF="STD-Andersson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Andersson 2001</LINK>). This was also a parallel and split-mouth trial which involved 75 patients and we were unable to use the data. Success rates were reported at 93% (28/30) for the ceramic and 100% (35/35) for the titanium group, although no statistical analysis was provided to support this. There was no measurable alveolar bone loss around either type of implant abutment. This study was assessed as at high risk of bias.</P>
<P>In summary, 11 trials were reviewed which compared different FDP materials. In three trials there was no evidence that high-gold alloys were better or worse than other alloys. Two trials revealed no significant difference between gold alloy or gold frameworks compared to titanium. From three trials there is weak evidence that zirconia performs as well as other materials. A single trial comparing two types of cement found no difference between them and two trials comparing ceramic abutments with titanium also found no differences between these. However, as all these trials were assessed as having at best an unclear risk of bias there is insufficient evidence to determine whether one material is superior to another.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-01-16 11:41:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Worthington">
<P>Management of partial tooth loss is an important aspect of oral health with a growing body of clinical research. Among the available literature addressing management of the partially absent dentition, 21 randomized control trials were included in this systematic review. The findings from the review reveal several challenges to summarizing evidence for this patient population, including few randomized control trials addressing comparisons between prostheses and significant heterogeneity among interventions and outcomes in the published literature for this population.</P>
<P>This review falls short of the goal sought by clinicians desiring comparative data for similar tooth loss patterns managed with different prostheses and measuring all important clinical and patient outcomes. At this time there are relatively few trials for the treatment of partial edentulism and rather than comparing one type of prosthesis versus another, most trials compared different materials, methods of fabrication, or the design of a specific type of prosthesis.</P>
<P>For <U>removable dental prostheses (RDPs)</U> there was insufficient evidence: 1) from three trials each evaluating different aspects of RDP design to determine that one design was better or worse than another, 2) to determine that one type of material for making RDPs was better or worse than another, 3) to determine whether one fabrication technique was better or worse than another for making RDPs.</P>
<P>For <U>fixed dental prostheses (FDPs)</U> there was insufficient evidence: 1) that high gold alloys are better or worse than other alloys in FDPs, 2) that gold alloy or gold frameworks are better or worse than titanium in FDPs, 3) to determine whether zirconia performs as well as other materials used in the manufacture of FDPs, 4) to determine whether one cement was better or worse than another in retaining FDPs, 5) demonstrating a difference between ceramic and titanium abutments for FDPs, and 6) demonstrating a difference between cemented and screw-retained implant crowns.</P>
<P>For a <U>shortened dental arch</U> there is insufficient evidence from two trials of any difference between FDPs and RDPs in the treatment of shortened dental arch with regard to the outcomes of this systematic review.</P>
<P>For <U>implant versus tooth/implant FDPs</U> there is insufficient evidence from one trial that implant supported FDPs are better or worse than tooth/implant FDPs.</P>

<P>In the 21 trials included in this review there is little duplication with regard to interventions, comparisons and outcome measures, which has made pooling of data for treatment estimates impossible. Furthermore split-mouth designs, which can offer distinct advantages, were found to lack appropriate statistical analysis (failed to take account of the paired nature of outcome data). As is common in short-term trials, many of the included studies measured surrogate outcomes making applicability to clinical management difficult.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2011-07-19 03:56:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There was a broad literature search with no restrictions on language, which should have eliminated selection bias from the review process. Additional attempts were made to locate unpublished trials.

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2012-01-12 22:21:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are a number of systematic reviews and meta-analyses in the prosthodontic literature, for example <LINK REF="REF-Heintze-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heintze 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koller-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koller 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scurria-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scurria 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tan 2004</LINK> which evaluate the longevity of different types of fixed or removable dental prostheses. Data come mainly from retrospective cohort studies and focuses primarily on outcomes relevant to the clinician, such as durability of the prosthesis and need for replacement. There are sparse data on comfort and functional aspects of these prostheses from the point of view of the patient. While reviews of retrospective and prospective cohort studies provide useful information, these studies are subject to confounding and biases. We have not identified any other systematic reviews of randomized trials which evaluate fixed or removable prosthodontic devices for the replacement of missing teeth in partially edentulous adults.</P>
<P>This Cochrane systematic review has included only randomized controlled trials, which when they are well designed and conducted minimize bias and confounding. However, the randomized controlled trials included in this review were assessed as being at high risk of bias due to either poor methodology, poor reporting, or both. Furthermore there was a wide range of interventions, comparisons and outcomes in the included trials, and few instances where a second study confirmed the results of an earlier trial.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-01-12 22:22:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>With the common condition of tooth loss, increasing lifespan and retention of more teeth into advanced age, and increasing awareness of the value of oral health, evidence to inform clinical management of tooth loss is needed. At present the majority of clinical reports for this patient population is found: 1) in non-randomized studies, 2) in studies not comparing different prostheses, and 3) in settings which may not be representative of standard practice settings.</P>
<P>Consequently, there is the dual need for well designed and conducted randomized controlled trials to evaluate prosthodontic devices to replace one or more missing teeth in partially edentulous patients using different prostheses, and there is the need to better understand bias impact associated with non-random study inference. Additionally, for this chronic condition of tooth loss, trials should have sufficiently long follow-up periods to enable the collection of data on comfort, function, appearance, and duration of survival of different types of prosthodontic devices over time.</P>
<P>While it is appropriate that research consider the role of implants in management of partial tooth loss, there is a need for comparative research for conventional tooth supported prostheses as well as devices, to determine whether these may have important benefits for some groups of patients.</P>
