<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Bite wounds may become infected due to the transfer of bacteria from the mouth of mammals into the skin. There was a decrease in the risk of developing an infection after a human bite when given antibiotics. Antibiotics also decreased the chance of developing a wound infection after a bite on the hand. Further studies are required to confirm these findings. </P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Bites by mammals are a common problem and they account for up to 1% of all visits to hospital emergency rooms. Dog and cat bites are the most common and people are usually bitten by their own pets or by an animal known to them. School-age children make up almost a half of those bitten. Prevention of tetanus, rabies and wound infection are the priorities for staff in emergency rooms. The use of antibiotics may be useful to reduce the risk of developing a wound infection. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine if the use of prophylactic antibiotics in mammalian bites is effective in preventing bite wound infection.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Relevant RCTs were identified by electronic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register databases in November 2000.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We included randomised controlled trials which studied patients with bites from all mammals. Comparisons were made between antibiotics and placebo or no intervention. The outcome of interest was the number of infections at the site of bite.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers extracted the data independently. All analyses were performed according to the intention-to-treat method. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Eight studies were included. The use of prophylactic antibiotics was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the rate of infection after bites by humans. Prophylactic antibiotics did not appear to reduce the rate of infection after bites by cats or dogs. Wound type, e.g. laceration or puncture, did not appear to influence the effectiveness of the prophylactic antibiotic. Prophylactic antibiotics were associated with a statistically significant reduction in the rate of infection in hand bites (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.86; NNT = 4, 95% CI 2 to 50). </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is evidence from one trial that prophylactic antibiotics reduces the risk of infection after human bites but confirmatory research is required. There is no evidence that the use of prophylactic antibiotics is effective for cat or dog bites. There is evidence that the use of antibiotic prophylactic after bites of the hand reduces infection but confirmatory research is required. </P>

<BACKGROUND>
<P>Human and other mammalian bite wounds are a common problem and they account for up to 1% of all visits to hospital emergency rooms (<LINK REF="REF-Weiss-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weiss 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Goldstein-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldstein 1992</LINK>). American statistics estimate that almost half of all children have been bitten by a dog at some point of their lives (<LINK REF="REF-Weiss-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weiss 1998</LINK>). The direct health care costs associated with the care of these wounds can be estimated to exceed $30 million (<LINK REF="STD-Elenbaas-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Elenbaas 1982</LINK>). </P>
<P>A large percentage of bite wounds are superficial abrasions. Most of these wounds are inflicted by dogs and cats. In more than 70% of cases, people are bitten by their own pets or by an animal known to them. School-age children constitute 30-50% of all those sustaining mammalian bite injuries (<LINK REF="REF-Willey-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Willey 1990</LINK>). </P>
<P>There is a small but definite morbidity and mortality associated with infection in the more serious lacerated and puncture wounds. Human bites have long been considered as having a very high infection rate, and the usual explanation was that the normal human oral flora harbours more pathogens than that of animals. However, some authors have found data that indicate that human bites occurring anywhere else than the hand do not have any higher risk than animal bites, and they consider the high rate of complications as being due to their location and initial delay in medical attention (<LINK REF="REF-Callanham-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Callanham 1988</LINK>). </P>
<P>Prevention of tetanus and rabies where appropriate, together with adequate cleansing of such wounds, are universally accepted measures, whereas the prophylactic use of antibiotics to reduce wound infections is controversial. That controversy can be traced primarily to the paucity of well-designed, prospective studies that examine the efficacy of treatment for bite wounds. The few currently published prospective studies of antibiotic prophylaxis suffer from small numbers of patients and low infection rates, in either the control or the treatment groups and this diminishes the statistical significance of the results. It has been estimated that three hundred and seventy patients in each group would be required to test the efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis with a probability of type II error of 10% (<LINK REF="STD-Jones-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 1985</LINK>). </P>
<P>Review articles have advocated the use of antibiotics in certain cases, such as patients aged over 50 years, those with puncture wounds and hand wounds, and those delaying presentation to medical attention for over 24 hours, while accepting that further information was required (<LINK REF="REF-Snook-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Snook 1982</LINK>). In order to gather a bigger number of cases to try to provide the information required, we need to make a systematic study of randomised trials considering the value of antibiotic prophylaxis in human and other mammalian bites.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine if the use of prophylactic antibiotics in mammalian (including human) bites is effective in preventing bite wound infection.</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials. The randomised controlled trials (RCTs) may be double blind, single-blind or unblinded. The RCTs may be unpublished or published as an article, an abstract or a letter, and no language limitations were applied.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Patients with injuries caused by mammalian or human bites attending hospital or health care provider within 24 hours of injury, without clinical signs of infection.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Use of antibiotics within 24 hours of injury compared to the use of placebo or no intervention in order to prevent bite wound infection.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>Proven bacterial infection: clinical signs (temperature, induration, erythema, swelling, pain, warmth, pus, odour, adenopathy, lymphangitis, cellulitis) plus positive microbiological cultures (for aerobics and anaerobic) at the site of bite.<BR/>Presumptive bacterial infection: clinical signs of infection at the site of bite with negative culture (or culture not obtained).<BR/>Absence of infection: absence of the clinical signs described above.</P>
</CRIT_OUTCOMES>
</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>Relevant RCTs were identified by electronic search through MEDLINE (1966 to 2000), EMBASE (1980 to 2000), LILACS (1988 to 2000) and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register databases. <BR/>The following strategy was used to search the electronic databases:<BR/>1. animal [MESH] OR mammalian [TEXT WORD] OR cat [TEXT WORD] OR dog* [TEXT WORD] OR monkey* [TEXT WORD] OR donkey* [TEXT WORD] OR human [TEXT WORD] OR humans [TEXT WORD]<BR/>2. bites [TEXT WORD] <BR/>3. prophyla* [TEXT WORD]<BR/>4. #1 AND #2<BR/>5. #3 AND #4</P>
<P>The bibliographic references of identified RCTs, textbooks, review articles and meta-analyses were checked in order to find RCTs not identified by electronic search.<BR/>A hand search was undertaken to find RCTs presented in Brazilian Infectious Diseases Meetings (1980-1995).</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>All results are presented using odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) and are combined using a random effects model.</P>
<P>There was no statistically significant difference between the rates of infections depending on whether or not prophylactic antibiotics were used (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.58). In this comparison there was statistically significant heterogeneity (chi-square 12.05, df=7, P= 0.099). Combining the results using a fixed effects model resulted in an apparent benefit for the use of prophylactic antibiotics (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.77). </P>
<P>When the trials were grouped according to the type of aggressor animal, only dog bites were studied in more than one trial. For dog bites, there was no statistically significant reduction of infection rate after the use of prophylactic antibiotics (4% (10/225)) compared to the control group (5.5% (13/238)); (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.85). Heterogeneity was not observed in this sub-category. Excluding studies with losses to follow-up higher than 10% or excluding a quasi-randomised study (<LINK REF="STD-Boenning-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Boenning 1983</LINK>) did not change the results. </P>
<P>Only one study (with 11 patients) analysed cat bites and this reported a higher infection rate in the control group (67% (4/6)) compared with the treatment group who received prophylactic antibiotics (0% (0/5)). </P>
<P>Only one trial analysed human bites and the infection rate in the antibiotic group (0/33) was significantly lower than the infection rate in the control group (47% (7/15))(OR 0.02, 95%CI 0.00 to 0.33). </P>
<P>Wound type did not appear to influence the effect of prophylactic antibiotics on infection rate. Infection of puncture lesions occurred in 7% (1/14) of patients receiving prophylactic antibiotics compared with 31% (5/16) in the control group (OR 0.22, 95%CI 0.05 to 13.67). In lacerations, infection occurred in 3% (2/63) of those that used prophylactic antibiotics compared to 6% (4/66) in the control group (OR 0.80, 95%CI 0.05 to 13.67). Infections in avulsion wounds occurred in 5% (2/41) of patients in the group using prophylactic antibiotics compared to 3% (1/30) in the control group (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.11 to 10.63).</P>
<P>When the trials were grouped according to the site of the bite, it was found that four of them provided information on site (hands, trunk, arms and head/neck). The infection rates for hand bites were significantly reduced by antibiotics (2% in the antibiotic group versus 28% in the control group)(OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.86; NNT = 4, 95% CI 2 to 50), no heterogeneity between studies was detected (chi-square 3.00, df=2, P= 0.22). In wounds of the head/neck, infection occurred in only one patient in the control group, compared with no patients in the experimental group (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.77). In wounds of the trunk, infection was observed in only one patient in the experimental group and no patients in the control group (OR 1.80, 95% CI 0.04 to 79.4). One trial of five people with bites on the arm recorded no infections in either the antibiotic or control group. <BR/>
</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The occurrence of bacterial infection after animal bites depends on several factors, such as species of animal aggressors (humans would be associated with a higher infection risk), type and site of the injuries (wounds located in hands have a higher infection risk), care given to the wound, inherent factors in the individual (greater risk in elderly, those with diabetes mellitus, vascular disease, etc).</P>
<P>The studies included in this systematic review did not demonstrate a reduction in the infection rate after mammalian bites among the individuals that received prophylactic antibiotics when compared to the control group. However, these results should be interpreted with caution because significant heterogeneity was observed in the meta-analysis. Furthermore, there were small numbers of patients in these trials and therefore they cannot rule out a beneficial effect of prophylactic antibiotics. </P>
<P>The impact of prophylactic antibiotic use may be more evident in situations of higher infection risk, therefore it is important to analyse according species of animal aggressor (some of which may have more pathogenic bacteria) and the type and location of the wound. </P>
<P>In terms of species, only dog bites had more than one study. Cat and human bites had only one study included for each comparison. The use of prophylactic antibiotics for dog bites is not associated with a statistically significant reduction in infection. Another systematic review performed by Cummings (<LINK REF="REF-Cummings-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cummings 1994</LINK>) reported a reduction in the infection rate after dog bites. With exception of one RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Brakenbury-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Brakenbury 1980</LINK>), both systematic reviews included the same studies. This difference may be related to the use of different statistical analysis in these two systematic reviews. Because of the statistical heterogeneity between the studies, we used a random effects model. This gives a more conservative estimate of effect size as it also takes into account any differences between studies. The exclusion of the studies with drop-out higher than 10% (a sensitivity analysis) did not change the results. <BR/>There was only one trial with 48 patients that reported on human bites but this reported a significant reduction in the risk of developing an infection when antibiotics were given. </P>
<P>In relation to wound type, puncture wounds have been reported to have a higher infection rate after animal bites, possibly due to the deposition of bacteria deep in the skin. We found no statistically significant difference between the rates of infection with or without prophylactic antibiotics within puncture wounds. Prophylactic antibiotics appear to be effective when the wounds are located in the hands, as the rate of infection reduced from 28% to 2%. Unfortunately only three randomised controlled trials analysing wounds in the hand were identified in this systematic review. </P>
<P>The probability of publication bias appears small. The inspection of funnel plot did not demonstrate apparent asymmetry. We searched unpublished RCTs from Abstracts of Brazilian Infectious Diseases Meetings, but others sources of unpublished RCTs need to be searched.</P>
<P>Another problem in the interpretation of this review is the type of antibiotic used in the included studies. Recently, bacteriologic analysis of infected wounds from dog and cat bites have demonstrated that pasteurella species were the most common followed by streptococci, staphylococci, moraxella, corynebacterium and neisseria species (<LINK REF="REF-Talan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Talan 1999</LINK>). Mixed infections of both aerobic and anaerobic pathogens were more frequent, and anaerobes were rarely found alone. This may mean that inappropriate antibiotics were used in the trials. Probably, beta-lactam antibiotic associated with beta-lactamase would have an important impact when used after mammalian bites than the types of antibiotics investigated (<LINK REF="REF-Talan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Talan 1999</LINK>). </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is insufficient evidence that the use of prophylactic antibiotic is effective for dog bites, because most of the studies included were methodologically deficient and had small sample sizes. There is evidence that the use of antibiotic prophylactic after bites of the hand reduces infection. Weak evidence suggests that antibiotic prophylaxis after bites by humans reduces infection.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>New randomised controlled trials of good quality are necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotics after mammalian bites. Future randomised controlled trials should address the following aspects:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>OBJECTIVES:</LI>
</UL>
<P>1. Evaluate the effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis for mammalian bites to prevent wound infection. <BR/>2. To establish possible predictors of infection risk, such species of animal aggressor, location and severity of wound, age, previous morbidity of victims (diabetes mellitus, immunodeficiency disorders, peripheral vascular diseases).<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>INCLUSION CRITERIA: Adults and children with mammalian-bite wounds who present to an emergency room within 24 hours of injury.</LI>
<LI>EXCLUSION CRITERIA: superficial abrasions, clinical signs of infection, those having other medical problems requiring antibiotic treatment or allergies to antibiotic.</LI>
<LI>TYPES OF INTERVENTION: The choice of antibiotics should be based on the flora of the oral cavity of mammalian aggressors (sensitivity obtained by swabbing the wound).</LI>
<LI>OUTCOME MEASURES: </LI>
</UL>
<P>1. Incidence of infection, analysed and presented according to location and type of wound. Infection criteria described by Talan (<LINK REF="REF-Talan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Talan 1999</LINK>) could be used. Wound should be considered infected if meets one of three major criteria:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>fever</LI>
<LI>abscess </LI>
<LI>lymphangitis. </LI>
</UL>
<P>Alternatively - they could be considered infected if they show four of five minor criteria: <BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>wound associated with erythema that extends more than 3 cm from the edge of the wound</LI>
<LI>tenderness at the wound site</LI>
<LI>swelling at the site</LI>
<LI>purulent drainage</LI>
<LI>a peripheral white-cell count of more than 12,000 per cubic millimeter.</LI>
</UL>
<P>2. Incidence of adverse events</P>
