<P>
<B>What is the issue?</B>
</P>
<P>Vaginal births are often associated with some form of trauma to the genital tract, and tears that affect the anal sphincter or mucosa (third- and fourth-degree tears) can cause serious problems. Perineal trauma can occur spontaneously or result from a surgical incision (episiotomy). Different perineal techniques are being used to slow down the birth of the baby's head, and allow the perineum to stretch slowly to prevent injury. Massage, warm compresses and different perineal management techniques are widely used by midwives and birth attendants. The objective of this updated review was to assess the effect of perineal techniques during the second stage of labour on the incidence of perineal trauma. This is an update of a review that was published in 2011.</P>
<P>
<B>Why is this important? </B>
</P>
<P>Trauma to the perineum can cause pain and other problems for women after the birth. The damage is described as first-, second-, third- and fourth-degree tears &#8211; first-degree tears being the least damage and fourth-degree tears being the most. Third- and fourth-degree tears, affect the anal sphincter or mucosa, thus causing the most problems. Reducing the use of episiotomies will reduce trauma to the perineum. Also, different perineal techniques are being used to slow down the birth of the baby's head. Massage, warm compresses and different perineal management techniques are widely used by midwives and birth attendants. It is important to know if these do indeed reduce trauma and pain for women.</P>
<P>
<B>What evidence did we find?</B>
</P>
<P>We searched for studies in September 2016. Twenty two trials were eligible for inclusion in this updated review but only twenty studies (involving 15,181 women), contributed results to the review. The participants in the studies were women without medical complications who were expecting a vaginal birth. The studies varied in their risk of bias, and the quality of the studies was very low to moderate.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Hands off (or poised) compared to hands on</B>
</I>
</P>
<P>Using 'hands off' the perineum resulted in fewer women having an episiotomy (low-quality evidence), but made no difference to numbers of women with no tears (moderate-quality evidence), first-degree tears (low-quality evidence), second-degree tears (low-quality evidence), or third- or fourth-degree tears (very low-quality evidence). There were considerable unexplained differences in results between the four studies. None of the studies provided data on the number of tears requiring suturing.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Warm compresses versus control (hands off or no warm compress)</B>
</I>
</P>
<P>Fewer women in the warm-compress group experienced third- or fourth-degree tears (moderate-quality evidence). A warm compress did not affect numbers of women with intact perineum (moderate-quality evidence), tears requiring suturing (very low-quality evidence), second-degree tears (very low-quality evidence), or episiotomies (low-quality evidence). It is uncertain whether warm compresses increase or reduce the incidence of first-degree tears (very low-quality evidence).</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Massage versus control (hands off or routine care)</B>
</I>
</P>
<P>There were more women with an intact perineum in the perineal massage group (low-quality evidence), and fewer women with third- or fourth-degree tears (moderate-quality evidence). Massage did not appear to make a difference to women with perineal trauma requiring suturing (very low-quality evidence), first-degree tears (very low-quality evidence), second-degree tears (very low-quality evidence), or episiotomies (very low-quality evidence).</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Ritgen's manoeuvre versus standard care</B>
</I>
</P>
<P>One small study found that women who had Ritgen's manoeuvre had fewer first-degree tears (very low-quality evidence), but more second-degree tears (very low-quality evidence). There was no difference between groups in terms of the number of third- or fourth-degree tears, or episiotomies (both low-quality evidence).</P>
<P>
<B>What does this mean?</B>
</P>
<P>We found that massage and warm compresses may reduce serious perineal trauma (third- and fourth-degree tears). Hands-off techniques may reduce the number of episiotomies but it was not clear that these techniques had a beneficial effect on other perineal trauma. There remains uncertainty about the value of other techniques to reduce damage to the perineum during childbirth.</P>
<P>More research is necessary, to evaluate different perineal techniques and to answer questions about how to minimise perineal trauma. There is insufficient evidence on women's experiences and views (only one included study collected information on this). It is important for future research to ascertain whether these interventions are acceptable to women.</P>

<P>Most vaginal births are associated with trauma to the genital tract. The morbidity associated with perineal trauma can be significant, especially when it comes to third- and fourth-degree tears.

<P>Twenty-two trials were eligible for inclusion (with 20 trials involving 15,181 women providing data). Overall, trials were at moderate to high risk of bias; none had adequate blinding, and most were unclear for both allocation concealment and incomplete outcome data.

<P>Most studies did not report data on our secondary outcomes. We downgraded evidence for risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision for all comparisons.</P>
<P>
<B>Hands off (or poised) compared to hands on</B>
</P>
<P>Hands on or hands off the perineum made no clear difference in incidence of intact perineum (average risk ratio (RR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95 to 1.12, two studies, Tau² 0.00, I² 37%, 6547 women; moderate-quality evidence)<I>, </I>first-degree perineal tears (average RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.77, two studies, 700 women; low-quality evidence), second-degree tears (average RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.28, two studies, 700 women; low-quality evidence), or third- or fourth-degree tears (average RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.21 to 2.26, five studies, Tau² 0.92, I² 72%, 7317 women; very low-quality evidence). Substantial heterogeneity for third- or fourth-degree tears means these data should be interpreted with caution. Episiotomy was more frequent in the hands-on group (average RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.79, Tau² 0.07, I² 74%, four studies, 7247 women; low-quality evidence), but there was considerable heterogeneity between the four included studies.</P>
<P>There were no data for perineal trauma requiring suturing.</P>
<P>
<B>Warm compresses versus control (hands off or no warm compress)</B>
</P>
<P>A warm compress did not have any clear effect on the incidence of intact perineum (average RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.21; 1799 women; four studies; moderate-quality evidence), perineal trauma requiring suturing (average RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.66; 76 women; one study; very low-quality evidence), second-degree tears (average RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.56; 274 women; two studies; very low-quality evidence), or episiotomy (average RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.23; 1799 women; four studies; low-quality evidence). It is uncertain whether warm compress increases or reduces the incidence of first-degree tears (average RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.38 to 3.79; 274 women; two studies; I² 88%; very low-quality evidence).</P>
<P>Fewer third- or fourth-degree perineal tears were reported in the warm-compress group (average RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.79; 1799 women; four studies; moderate-quality evidence<I>)</I>.</P>
<P>
<B>Massage versus control (hands off or routine care)</B>
</P>
<P>The incidence of intact perineum was increased in the perineal-massage group (average RR 1.74, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.73, six studies, 2618 women; I² 83% low-quality evidence) but there was substantial heterogeneity between studies). This group experienced fewer third- or fourth-degree tears (average RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.94, five studies, 2477 women; moderate-quality evidence).</P>
<P>There were no clear differences between groups for perineal trauma requiring suturing (average RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.61, one study, 76 women; very low-quality evidence), first-degree tears (average RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.79 to 3.05, five studies, Tau² 0.47, I² 85%, 537 women; very low-quality evidence), or second-degree tears (average RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.12, five studies, Tau² 0.32, I² 62%, 537 women; very low-quality evidence). Perineal massage may reduce episiotomy although there was considerable uncertainty around the effect estimate (average RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.03, seven studies, Tau² 0.43, I² 92%, 2684 women; very low-quality evidence). Heterogeneity was high for first-degree tear, second-degree tear and for episiotomy - these data should be interpreted with caution.</P>
<P>
<B>Ritgen's manoeuvre versus standard care</B>
</P>
<P>One study (66 women) found that women receiving Ritgen's manoeuvre were less likely to have a first-degree tear (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.69; very low-quality evidence), more likely to have a second-degree tear (RR 3.25, 95% CI 1.73 to 6.09; very low-quality evidence), and neither more nor less likely to have an intact perineum (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.31; very low-quality evidence). One larger study reported that Ritgen's manoeuvre did not have an effect on incidence of third- or fourth-degree tears (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.96,1423 women; low-quality evidence). Episiotomy was not clearly different between groups (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.03, two studies, 1489 women; low-quality evidence).</P>
<P>
<B>Other comparisons</B>
</P>
<P>The delivery of posterior versus anterior shoulder first, use of a perineal protection device, different oils/wax, and cold compresses did not show any effects on perineal outcomes. Only one study contributed to each of these comparisons, so data were insufficient to draw conclusions.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-05-22 09:30:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Moderate-quality evidence suggests that warm compresses, and massage, may reduce third- and fourth-degree tears but the impact of these techniques on other outcomes was unclear or inconsistent. Poor-quality evidence suggests hands-off techniques may reduce episiotomy, but this technique had no clear impact on other outcomes. There were insufficient data to show whether other perineal techniques result in improved outcomes.</P>
<P>Further research could be performed evaluating perineal techniques, warm compresses and massage, and how different types of oil used during massage affect women and their babies. It is important for any future research to collect information on women's views.</P>

<P>Most vaginal births are associated with some form of trauma to the genital tract (<LINK REF="REF-Albers-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Albers 2003</LINK>). Anterior perineal trauma is injury to the labia, anterior vagina, urethra, or clitoris and is usually associated with little morbidity. Posterior perineal trauma is any injury to the posterior vagina wall, perineal muscles or anal sphincter (<LINK REF="REF-Fernando-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fernando 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kettle-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kettle 2008</LINK>). Spontaneous tears are defined as first degree when they involve the perineal skin only; second-degree tears involve the perineal muscles and skin; third-degree tears involve the anal sphincter complex (classified as 3a where less than 50% of the external anal sphincter is torn; 3b where more than 50% of the external anal sphincter is torn; 3c where the internal and external anal sphincter is torn); fourth-degree tears involve the anal sphincter complex and anal epithelium (<LINK REF="REF-Fernando-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fernando 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kettle-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kettle 2008</LINK>). The term obstetric anal sphincter injuries (OASIS) is used for both third- and fourth-degree perineal tears (<LINK REF="REF-Fernando-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fernando 2015</LINK>)<I>. </I>Perineal trauma can occur spontaneously or result from a surgical incision of the perineum, called episiotomy. The incidence of some form of perineal trauma is reported to be 85% (<LINK REF="STD-McCandlish-1998" TYPE="STUDY">McCandlish 1998</LINK>) and the incidence of trauma that affects the anal sphincter is reported to be from 0.5% to 7.0% for all vaginal deliveries (<LINK REF="REF-Sultan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sultan 1999</LINK>) and between 0.5% and 2.5% of spontaneous vaginal deliveries (<LINK REF="REF-Byrd-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Byrd 2005</LINK>). There is considerable variation in the number of reported rates of perineal trauma between countries, partly due to differences in definitions and reporting practices (<LINK REF="REF-Byrd-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Byrd 2005</LINK>), and studies also show that the extent of perineal trauma often is underestimated (<LINK REF="REF-Andrews-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andrews 2006</LINK>; <A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD006672/bibliography.html#CD006672-bbs2-0017">Groom 2002</A>). Studies with restrictive use of episiotomy report rates of perineal trauma that require suturing between 44% and 79% (<LINK REF="STD-Dahlen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Dahlen 2007</LINK>; <A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD006672/bibliography.html#CD006672-bbs2-0039">Soong 2005</A>), and a recent Cochrane Review found no evidence to support the routine use of episiotomy (<LINK REF="REF-Jiang-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jiang 2017</LINK>). Higher rates of perineal injury are consistently noted in first vaginal births and with instrumental birth (<LINK REF="REF-Christianson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Christianson 2003</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Morbidity associated with perineal trauma</HEADING>
<P>Perineal trauma is associated with significant short- and long-term morbidity. Perineal pain is reported to be most severe in the immediate postnatal period (<LINK REF="REF-Macarthur-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macarthur 2004</LINK>). However, discomfort continues for up to two weeks postpartum in about 30% of women and 7% report pain at three months (<A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD006672/bibliography.html#CD006672-bbs2-0030">McCandlish 1998</A>). Women who sustain obstetric anal sphincter injury are shown to report more pain seven weeks after birth than those with lesser degree of perineal trauma (<LINK REF="REF-Andrews-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andrews 2007</LINK>). Women giving birth with an intact perineum, however, report pain less frequently at one, seven and 45 days postpartum (<LINK REF="REF-Macarthur-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macarthur 2004</LINK>). Perineal pain can be intense and often requires pain relief (<LINK REF="REF-Andrews-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andrews 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hedayati-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hedayati 2003</LINK>). Maternal morbidity associated with perineal trauma also includes dyspareunia (<LINK REF="REF-Barrett-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barrett 2000</LINK>) and fecal incontinence (<LINK REF="REF-Reid-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reid 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sultan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sultan 2002</LINK>) and can lead to major physical problems, psychological and social problems, and affect the woman's ability to care for her new baby and cope with the daily tasks of motherhood (<LINK REF="REF-Sleep-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sleep 1991</LINK>). Urinary problems following childbirth have been reported to be more prevalent in association with perineal trauma (<LINK REF="REF-Boyles-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boyles 2009</LINK>). Anal sphincter injury can be occult or wrongly classified as a minor degree of perineal tear (<LINK REF="REF-Andrews-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andrews 2006</LINK>). Women with an intact perineum are more likely to resume intercourse earlier, report less pain with first and subsequent sexual intercourse, report greater satisfaction with sexual experience and report greater sexual sensation and likelihood of orgasm at six months postpartum (<LINK REF="REF-Radestad-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Radestad 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Generally, the degree of morbidity is directly related to the degree of the perineal injury sustained, that is, first- and second-degree perineal trauma causing less severe morbidity than third- and fourth-degree tears (<LINK REF="REF-Radestad-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Radestad 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2007</LINK>). Anal sphincter or mucosal injuries are identified following 3% to 5% of all vaginal births (<LINK REF="REF-Ekeus-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ekeus 2008</LINK>). Around 8% of women experience incontinence of stool and 45% suffer involuntary escape of flatus following anal sphincter injury (<LINK REF="REF-Eason-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eason 2002</LINK>). The type of suture material used (<LINK REF="REF-Kettle-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kettle 2002</LINK>), skills of the operator and technique of suturing influence morbidity experienced by women (<LINK REF="REF-Fernando-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fernando 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sultan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sultan 2002</LINK>). If immediate repair is adequate, the likelihood of better long-term outcomes are improved, both when it comes to symptoms and quality of life (QoL) (<LINK REF="REF-Reid-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reid 2014</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Factors associated with perineal trauma</HEADING>
<P>Numerous factors have been suggested as potential determinants of perineal trauma. Some determinants of perineal trauma appear to be present before pregnancy and may be intrinsic to the pregnant woman (<LINK REF="REF-Klein-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 1997</LINK>). It is uncertain which role demographic factors and nutrition in the years before and during pregnancy play in the occurrence of perineal trauma (<A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD006672/bibliography.html#CD006672-bbs2-0028">Klein 1997</A>). Ethnicity is a factor that may affect perineal trauma and association has been found between Asian ethnicity and severe perineal trauma (<LINK REF="REF-Dahlen-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dahlen 2007b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goldberg-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldberg 2003</LINK>). A familial risk of obstetric anal sphincter injuries has also been suggested (<LINK REF="REF-Baghestan-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baghestan 2013</LINK>
<U>)</U>, maybe with contribution of both maternal and paternal factors.</P>
<P>Nulliparity, maternal age greater than 30 years, a large baby (both weight and head circumference), a prolonged second stage and malposition increase the risk for perineal trauma (<A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD006672/bibliography.html#CD006672-bbs2-0004">Andrews 2006</A>; <LINK REF="REF-Baghestan-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baghestan 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fitzpatrick-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fitzpatrick 2001</LINK>; <A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD006672/bibliography.html#CD006672-bbs2-0029">Mayerhofer 2002</A>; <LINK REF="REF-Soong-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soong 2005</LINK>
<U>)</U>. Restrictive use of episiotomy is associated with less perineal trauma (<LINK REF="REF-Jiang-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jiang 2017</LINK>), as is the use of vacuum extraction for instrumental birth as opposed to forceps (<LINK REF="REF-Fitzpatrick-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fitzpatrick 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Mahony-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Mahony 2010</LINK>). Antenatal digital perineal massage from approximately 35 weeks' gestation reduces the incidence of perineal trauma requiring suturing (<LINK REF="REF-Beckmann-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beckmann 2006</LINK>). Maternal upright position in the second stage of labour, for women without epidural anaesthesia, results in a reduction in assisted deliveries and episiotomy usage, no difference regarding severe perineal trauma and, on the other hand, an increased risk of blood loss greater than 500 mL (<LINK REF="REF-Gupta-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 2012</LINK>). Physical inactivity before pregnancy may represent an independent risk factor for third- and fourth-degree tears (<LINK REF="REF-Voldner-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Voldner 2009</LINK>). Giving birth in alternative birth settings and planned home birth have been shown to be associated with a reduced prevalence of episiotomy (<LINK REF="REF-Hodnett-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodnett 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Radestad-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Radestad 2008</LINK>), as has the midwifery model of care (<LINK REF="REF-Hatem-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hatem 2008</LINK>). Planned home birth has also been shown to be associated with a lower prevalence of sphincter rupture (<LINK REF="REF-Radestad-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Radestad 2008</LINK>) and a low prevalence of perineal trauma has been found among women opting for home birth (<LINK REF="REF-Edqvist-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edqvist 2016</LINK>).</P>
<P>Retrospective studies on water birth report fewer episiotomies, an overall decrease in perineal trauma and no significant difference in third- and fourth-degree tears (<LINK REF="REF-Bodner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bodner 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Otigbah-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Otigbah 2000</LINK>) and an observational study found fewer episiotomies as well as third- and fourth-degree tears in the water-birth group (<LINK REF="REF-Geissbuehler-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geissbuehler 2004</LINK>). However, a Cochrane Review did not find any association between immersion in water during labour/water birth and perineal trauma (<LINK REF="REF-Cluett-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cluett 2009</LINK>). </P>
<P>Trauma to the birth genital tract does not seem affected by active directed pushing versus spontaneous pushing (<LINK REF="REF-Bloom-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bloom 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schaffer-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schaffer 2005</LINK>). A recent Cochrane Review (<LINK REF="REF-Lemos-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lemos 2015</LINK>) concludes that due to insufficient evidence, women's preferences and clinical situations should guide decisions concerning pushing/bearing down methods, regardless of use of epidural analgesia. Retrospective studies on the occurrence of perineal trauma suggest an association between augmentation of labour and trauma (<LINK REF="REF-Jand_x00e9_r-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jandér 2001</LINK>). One observational study found a higher prevalence of anal sphincter injuries when oxytocin was used in the second stage of labour during spontaneous deliveries of normal-sized infants (<LINK REF="REF-Rygh-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rygh 2014</LINK>). An association has also been found between accoucheur type (<LINK REF="REF-Bodner_x002d_Adler-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bodner-Adler 2004</LINK>) and perineal trauma.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-05-16 10:56:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Awareness of morbidity following perineal trauma has led to the search for different interventions to be used during the second stage of labour to reduce perineal trauma. These interventions include the use of perineal massage, warm and cold compresses, and perineal-management techniques (<A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD006672/bibliography.html#CD006672-bbs2-0003">Albers 2005</A>; <LINK REF="STD-Dahlen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Dahlen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Myrfield-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Myrfield 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pirhonen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pirhonen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shirvani-2014a" TYPE="STUDY">Shirvani 2014a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stamp-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Stamp 2001</LINK>). Different massage techniques are performed using different lubricants; different oils, jelly, Vaseline or wax (<LINK REF="STD-Araujo-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Araujo 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harlev-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Harlev 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Geranmayeh-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Geranmayeh 2012</LINK>). Perineal management techniques, termed as guiding or support techniques, are believed to reduce perineal trauma (<A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD006672/bibliography.html#CD006672-bbs2-0031">Myrfield 1997</A>; <A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD006672/bibliography.html#CD006672-bbs2-0034">Pirhonen 1998</A>). A wide variety of techniques are practiced, among them the flexion technique and Ritgen&#8217;s manoeuvre. Each technique claims to reduce perineal trauma by reducing the presenting diameter of the fetal head through the woman's vaginal opening (<LINK REF="REF-Myrfield-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Myrfield 1997</LINK>). The flexion technique involves the maintenance of flexion of the emerging fetal head, by exerting pressure on the emerging occiput in a downwards direction towards the perineum, preventing extension until crowning; and the guarding of the perineum by placing a hand against the perineum to support this structure (<A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD006672/bibliography.html#CD006672-bbs2-0029">Mayerhofer 2002</A>; <A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD006672/bibliography.html#CD006672-bbs2-0031">Myrfield 1997</A>). In Ritgen's manoeuvre the fetal chin is reached for between the anus and coccyx and pulled interiorly, while using the fingers of the other hand on the fetal occiput to control speed of birth and keep flexion of the fetal head (<LINK REF="REF-Cunningham-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cunningham 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-J_x00f6_nsson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Jönsson 2008</LINK>). Ritgen's manoeuvre is called 'modified' (<LINK REF="STD-J_x00f6_nsson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Jönsson 2008</LINK>) when performed during a contraction, rather than between contractions as originally recommended (<LINK REF="REF-Cunningham-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cunningham 2008</LINK>). A recent systematic review, including both randomised and non randomised studies (<LINK REF="REF-Bulchandani-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bulchandani 2015</LINK>) concludes that current evidence regarding perineal techniques are insufficient to drive change of practice.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-05-13 12:02:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Support techniques slow down the birth of the head, allowing the perineum to stretch slowly, thus reducing perineal trauma (<LINK REF="REF-Downe-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Downe 2003</LINK>). This is why birth attendants, together with the use of support techniques, commonly ask women to breathe instead of push as the head is delivered. The birth of the infant's shoulders is usually assisted by downward traction first, to free the anterior shoulder, and subsequently the posterior shoulder is delivered by guiding the baby in an upward curve (<LINK REF="REF-Downe-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Downe 2003</LINK>). An alternative technique to the usual practice of birth of the anterior shoulder first is a primary delivery of the posterior shoulder (<LINK REF="STD-Aabakke-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Aabakke 2016</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-05-13 12:10:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It has been suggested that both the flexion technique and Ritgen's manoeuvre act against the normal mechanism of labour in which the baby naturally angles itself in the most appropriate attitude to pass through the birth canal (<A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD006672/bibliography.html#CD006672-bbs2-0031">Myrfield 1997</A>). This poses the question of which support and other perineal techniques are beneficial for preventing perineal trauma. In this review we update the initial version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Aasheim-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aasheim 2011</LINK>), which was the first published systematic review comparing different perineal support and other techniques used during the second stage of labour for reducing perineal trauma.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach</HEADING>
<P>For this update we assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach as outlined in the <A HREF="http://gdt.guidelinedevelopment.org/central_prod/_design/client/handbook/handbook.html">GRADE handbook</A> in order to assess the quality of the body of evidence relating to the following outcomes for the main comparisons (comparisons 1 to 4). </P>
<UL>
<LI>Intact perineum</LI>
<LI>Perineal trauma requiring suturing</LI>
<LI>First-degree perineal tear</LI>
<LI>Second-degree perineal tear</LI>
<LI>Third-degree or fourth-degree perineal tear</LI>
<LI>Incidence of episiotomy</LI>
</UL>
<P>We used the <A HREF="http://www.guidelinedevelopment.org/">GRADEpro</A> Guideline Development Tool (GRADEpro GDT) to import data from RevMan 5 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>) in order to create <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>; and <LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>. We produced a summary of the intervention effect and a measure of quality for each of the above outcomes using the GRADE approach. The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome. The evidence can be downgraded from 'high quality' by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious) limitations, depending on assessments for risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates or potential publication bias.</P>

<P>In future updates we will include cluster-randomised trials in the analyses along with individually randomised trials.

If we use ICCs from other sources, we will report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identify both cluster-randomised trials and individually-randomised trials, we plan to synthesise the relevant information. We will consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit is considered to be unlikely.</P>

<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the RevMan 5 software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). Because there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effect differed between trials, and substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary where an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary was treated as the average range of possible treatment effects and we discussed the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. When the average treatment effect was not clinically meaningful, we did not combine trials. The results were presented as the average treatment effect (RR) with 95% CI, and the estimates of Tau² and I².</P>

<P>We planned to carry out sensitivity analyses to explore the effect of trial quality assessed by concealment of allocation, high attrition rates, or both, with poor-quality studies being excluded from the analyses in order to assess whether this makes any difference to the overall result. We also planned to carry out sensitivity analysis to examine the effect of the randomisation unit where we include cluster-RCTs along with individually-randomised trials. It was not possible to carry out our planned sensitivity analysis because mostly the included trials were at moderate to high risk of bias, and we did not identify any cluster-RCTs for inclusion in this update.

<P>Our 2011 search identified 17 citations related to 12 trials. They were identified by the Information Specialist and we found no additional trials by the MEDLINE and CINAHL search. We found one additional unpublished study from a reference list (<LINK REF="STD-Musgrove-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Musgrove 1997</LINK>). Of the identified studies, we included data from eight trials involving 11,651 randomised women; two further trials (<LINK REF="STD-Most-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Most 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Musgrove-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Musgrove 1997</LINK>) were otherwise eligible for inclusion but did not contribute any data to the review as either relevant outcomes were not reported or were reported in a way that did not allow us to include them in the review.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Performance bias</HEADING>
<P>Given the nature of the intervention, it was not possible to blind the intervention for the clinician/the midwife performing the technique. It was also impossible to blind women to the allocated group therefore we assessed most studies to be at high risk of performance bias. In <LINK REF="STD-Aabakke-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Aabakke 2016</LINK> the randomisation envelope was opened by the midwife when the women entered the second stage of labour and was destroyed thereafter. The allocation was only shown to the midwife and the assistant, and if necessary the obstetrician, and the participants might have been blinded. Some women may have been disappointed with the allocation group, thus affecting the results. Also, some women may have been convinced that the technique they received was best, thus causing a 'placebo' effect. In <LINK REF="STD-McCandlish-1998" TYPE="STUDY">McCandlish 1998</LINK>, women were not told which group they ended up in, unless the women asked for that information. When a women was informed, it was noted in the data form. About a third of the women in each group were informed of their allocation.</P>
<P>We assessed two studies to be at unclear risk of performance bias. In <LINK REF="STD-Harlev-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Harlev 2013</LINK> both the oils for the intervention were contained in similar bottles differentiated only by a number on the bottle and the midwives and the physicians who delivered the woman were blinded to the oil type. It is possible that this blinding was broken. It was unclear <LINK REF="STD-Galledar-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Galledar 2010</LINK>'s report if blinding was attempted.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Detection bias</HEADING>
<P>The outcome assessors could have been blinded to the perineal technique. In <LINK REF="STD-Dahlen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Dahlen 2007</LINK>, the outcome assessor was blinded and the midwives were asked not to discuss allocation. As this method of blinding could be easily broken, this study was assessed to be at unclear risk of detection bias. In most of the included studies there was some degree of blinding. Five other studies were at unclear risk of detection bias; <LINK REF="STD-Aabakke-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Aabakke 2016</LINK> used a blinded midwife to assess the perineum but other outcomes were recorded by unblinded midwives; <LINK REF="STD-Albers-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Albers 2005</LINK> used the midwife caring for the woman as outcome assessor but 25% of births were attended by an independent observing midwife; another study attempted to blind staff to allocation but is not explicit in whether women were blinded which could have broken blinding of staff (<LINK REF="STD-McCandlish-1998" TYPE="STUDY">McCandlish 1998</LINK>); it was unclear in two studies whether assessors were blinded (<LINK REF="STD-Galledar-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Galledar 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harlev-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Harlev 2013</LINK>).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-05-24 10:33:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This systematic review is an update of a review that was published in 2011 (<LINK REF="REF-Aasheim-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aasheim 2011</LINK>). This review aimed to evaluate the research evidence of how different perineal techniques could contribute in reducing the severity and frequency of perineal trauma.</P>
<P>While 22 trials were eligible for inclusion in this updated review, we were only able to include data from 20 trials involving 15,181 randomised women. These trials took place in 10 different countries, all in hospital settings. All the included trials explored different perineal management techniques. These techniques included: compresses held to the mother&#8217;s perineum or perineal massage inside the woman's vagina versus hands off, warm compresses on the perineum versus not having warm compresses, various hands-on techniques versus hands-off techniques, massage of the perineum versus no massage, the use of different oils versus liquid wax, a modified Ritgen's manoeuvre versus standard practice, the use of a perineal protection device versus perineal support, and birth of the anterior shoulder versus the posterior shoulder first. The studies measured various outcomes, but they all reported on condition of the perineum in one way or another, for example, by presenting the number of women with an intact perineum, the frequency of the need for suturing after birth or the degree and location of perineal tear.</P>
<P>The results of our meta-analyses comparing hands off (or poised) versus hands on suggests that practicing the hands-off technique reduces the use of episiotomy but does not affect rates of intact perineum, perineal trauma requiring suturing, or perineal trauma rates of any degree. Even though the rate of episiotomy was reduced, there was no increase of third- and fourth-degree tears. There was a high degree of heterogeneity in this analysis and as episiotomy is heavily influenced by individual practice, this analysis should be viewed with caution. These results are based on moderate- to very low-quality evidence.</P>
<P>We did observe a reduction in incidence of third- and fourth-degree perineal tears when the perineal technique of holding warm compresses against the perineum was used compared to no application of warm compresses against the perineum, however the effect of warm compresses on other the incidence of perineal trauma and grades of perineal tears is uncertain. Substantial heterogeneity was observed in our analyses for first-degree tears and third-degree tears. Similar rates of episiotomy were observed. These results are based on moderate- to very low-quality evidence.</P>
<P>Perineal massage was associated with a reduced risk of third- and fourth-degree tears. The effect of perineal massage on perineal trauma requiring suturing or first-degree tears or second-degree tears is uncertain (with high levels of heterogeneity observed for both first- and second-degree tears). Perineal massage was also associated with an increase in the number of women with intact perineum but this outcome should be interpreted with caution due to substantial heterogeneity. There was some reduction in the rate of episiotomy but there was considerable uncertainty around the effect estimate, and again, high levels of heterogeneity were evident. These results are based on moderate- to very low-quality evidence.</P>
<P>Women receiving Ritgen's manoeuvre versus standard care were less likely to experience first-degree perineal tears, but more likely to experience second-degree perineal tears. We are uncertain what effect the intervention has on the incidence of intact perineum. There were no clear differences in the risk of third- and fourth-degree perineal tears, intact perineum, and episiotomy. There were no data for the outcome of perineal trauma requiring suturing. Data for these outcomes were based on one small study and the evidence ranged from low to very low quality.</P>
<P>The delivery of posterior versus anterior shoulder first, the use of perineal protection device, the use of different oils/wax and the use of cold compresses did not show any effects on perineal outcomes. Only one study contributed to each of these comparisons, so data were insufficient to draw conclusions.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-05-22 16:18:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The question of how to prevent perineal trauma is an important research topic in midwifery and obstetrics. Despite a large overall sample size, within most individual comparisons sample sizes were small and did not give sufficient good-quality data to allow us to draw reliable conclusions. There is no strong evidence for perineal techniques during the second stage of labour to reduce perineal trauma. Very few secondary outcomes were reported in any of the included studies. Women's views and choice on perineal techniques should be central to which method is implemented, however the included studies did not report women&#8217;s opinion of the method studied, except for the use of warm compresses which was acceptable to both women and midwives (<LINK REF="REF-Dahlen-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dahlen 2009</LINK>). Further research is required to ascertain which technique prevents perineal trauma and is acceptable to women and their caregivers.</P>

<P>There was great variation in methodological quality of the trials (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). Five of the studies contributing data had low risk of problems that could put them at risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Aabakke-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Aabakke 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Albers-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Albers 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dahlen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Dahlen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCandlish-1998" TYPE="STUDY">McCandlish 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stamp-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Stamp 2001</LINK>). We were uncertain about the risk of bias in seven of the studies due to methods of reporting (<LINK REF="STD-Araujo-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Araujo 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harlev-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Harlev 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-J_x00f6_nsson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Jönsson 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lavesson-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Lavesson 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mayerhofer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Mayerhofer 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rezaei-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Rezaei 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Terre_x002d_Rull-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Terre-Rull 2014</LINK>). The rest of the studies had a high risk of bias (Attarha 2009; <LINK REF="STD-De-Costa-2006" TYPE="STUDY">De Costa 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fahami-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Fahami 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Foroughipour-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Foroughipour 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Galledar-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Galledar 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Geranmayeh-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Geranmayeh 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shirvani-2014a" TYPE="STUDY">Shirvani 2014a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sohrabi-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Sohrabi 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>The studies in our meta-analyses have considerable clinical heterogeneity. The perineal techniques used in the included studies varied. The terms 'hands on', 'hands off', 'standard care' and 'perineal support' meant different things across the studies and were not always defined sufficiently. In <LINK REF="STD-McCandlish-1998" TYPE="STUDY">McCandlish 1998</LINK>, 'hands off' not only meant no hand on the perineum and infant's head until the head was born but, also no manual assistance for the birth of the shoulders. While <LINK REF="STD-Mayerhofer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Mayerhofer 2002</LINK> defined 'hands off' as no hands on the perineum or fetal head until the head was born, but made no distinction between 'hands on' and 'hands off' for the assistance of the birth of the shoulders. Most extreme is the 'hands off' in <LINK REF="STD-Albers-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Albers 2005</LINK>, where 'hands off' only meant no hands on the perineum until crowning of the head. Although the standard care or 'hands on' manual support techniques are poorly described in most of the studies, it is clear that all studies aimed at a slow and controlled birth of the head.</P>
<P>The results of our meta-analyses comparing hands on versus hands off suggest that practicing the hands-off technique reduces the use of episiotomy, but we graded the quality of the evidence as low. The quality of the evidence from the meta analyses of warm compresses for a reduction in incidence of third- and fourth-degree perineal tears is moderate. The use of warm compresses probably prevents perineal trauma (third- and fourth-degree tears). The quality of the evidence from the meta analyses of massage for a reduction in incidence of third- and fourth-degree perineal tears is moderate. The use of massage probably prevents perineal trauma (third- and fourth-degree tears) and the practice of massage may also improve the rate of intact perineum (low quality of evidence). It is uncertain whether Ritgen's manoeuvre versus standard care decreased the rate of first-degree perineal tears and also increased the rate of second-degree tears because the quality of the evidence is very low. The delivery of posterior versus anterior shoulder first, the use of perineal protection device, the use of different oils/wax and the use of cold compresses did not show any effects on perineal outcomes.</P>
<P>We used <A HREF="https://gradepro.org/">GRADEpro GDT</A> software to assess the evidence for the four main comparisons. The evidence was, at best, of moderate quality. For hands off (or poised) compared to hands on for reducing perineal trauma, we graded evidence for intact perineum as moderate-quality. We graded evidence for first-degree, and second-degree tears, and episiotomy as being of low-quality, and for third- or fourth-degree tears as very low-quality. We downgraded evidence for risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision of effect estimates. For the comparison warm compresses compared to control (hands off or no warm compress), intact perineum and third- or fourth-degree tears, we graded evidence as moderate-quality, evidence for episiotomy was low-quality, and evidence for first- and second-degree tears was very low-quality. We downgraded evidence for risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision of effect estimates with small sample sizes and few events. For massage compared to control (hands off or care as usual), we graded evidence for third- or fourth-degree tears as moderate-quality<I>,</I> intact perineum as low-quality, and perineal trauma requiring suturing, first-degree tears, second-degree tears, and episiotomy as very low-quality evidence. We downgraded evidence for risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision of effect estimates with small sample sizes and few events. Only two studies contributed data to the comparison Ritgen's manoeuvre compared to standard care. We graded evidence for third- or fourth-degree tears, and episiotomy as low-quality, for intact perineum, first-degree tear, and second-degree tear as very low-quality. Again, we downgraded evidence for risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision of effect estimates with small sample sizes and few events. For some of the comparisons there was only one study; the delivery of posterior versus anterior shoulder (<LINK REF="STD-Aabakke-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Aabakke 2016</LINK>), the perineal device (<LINK REF="STD-Lavesson-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Lavesson 2014</LINK>), the use of oil (<LINK REF="STD-Harlev-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Harlev 2013</LINK>) and the use of cold compresses (<LINK REF="STD-Shirvani-2014a" TYPE="STUDY">Shirvani 2014a</LINK>), and we did not use the GRADE assessment tool for these studies.</P>
<P>It was not possible to blind the intervention for the midwives or birth attendants in the involved trials. It may be difficult to blind the outcome assessor, but it is not impossible and future trials should definitely attempt to do so. Theoretically, midwives' convictions about the advantage or disadvantage of the intervention could influence their evaluation of the perineal outcome.</P>
<P>We were not able to perform all the analyses proposed in the protocol for all the primary and secondary outcomes recorded, as the included studies did not contribute enough data.</P>

<P>We are aware of the possibility of adding bias at any stage of the review process. We tried to minimise this possibility by two review authors independently assessing each trial for eligibility and extracting data from relevant studies. We resolved discrepancies through discussion in the team. Data were entered into RevMan 5 software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>) and checked for accuracy. When information regarding any of the above was unclear, we contacted authors of the original reports to provide further details.</P>
<P>As to the studies in Persian language, and one in Spanish, these studies were read by only one person, but we believe that both consideration of inclusion of the studies and the data extraction are of sufficient quality.</P>

<P>The conclusion in this revised form of the review is the same as in the first version of the review.</P>
<P>Another Cochrane Review found that selective episiotomy resulted in less severe perineal trauma than routine episiotomy (<LINK REF="REF-Jiang-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jiang 2017</LINK>). A non-Cochrane systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Eason-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eason 2000</LINK>) with a broader scope than this review (including antenatal techniques, mode of birth, and birth position) also found that selective use of episiotomy produced less severe trauma to the perineum. This review found that perineal massage in the weeks leading up to labour appeared to reduce perineal trauma but also reported a lack of evidence around perineal techniques restricted to the second stage of labour.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-05-13 17:11:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-05-13 17:09:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There was moderate-quality evidence suggesting that the use of warm compresses, and the use of massage, may reduce the occurrence of third- and fourth-degree perineal tears but evidence on the benefits of these techniques on other outcomes was unclear or inconsistent. There was poor-quality evidence suggesting that hands-off techniques may reduce episiotomy, but these techniques had no clear impact on other important outcomes. There are insufficient data to show whether other perineal techniques result in improved outcomes for labouring women and their babies.</P>
<P>Warm compresses and massage may improve outcomes and do not seem to cause harm, although data on women's views of these techniques was not reported.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-05-13 17:11:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A limitation of this review is that it only considers perineal techniques and not all the factors of the birth process. The question of how to prevent tears is complicated and involves many other factors in addition to the perineal techniques that are evaluated here. It has to do with the birth position, the women&#8217;s tissue and other ways to control the speed of the birth. To our knowledge, none of the studies included in this review have women's experience of the interventions as an outcome. This could be considered in further research. A controlled birth can be achieved in different ways; controlled by the midwife or by the woman, controlled by breathing technique or by perineal support. Further research in this field is necessary.</P>
<P>Further randomised controlled trials could be performed evaluating perineal techniques, warm compresses and massage.</P>
<P>More research is also needed to answer the questions of determinants of perineal trauma. We still do not know enough of the effect of, for example, training, demographic factors or nutrition as determinants. We also lack knowledge of how different types of oil used during massage affect women and their babies. We do not know whether these varied perineal techniques are acceptable to women, and future research should collect information on women's views.</P>

<P>For the first version of this review all three review authors (V Aasheim (VAA), ABV Nilsen (ABVN) and M Lukasse (ML)) worked collaboratively on the development of the protocol and the review. Liv Merete Reinar (LMR) guided the other three authors in the development of the protocol and review.</P>
<P>For this update, VAA co-ordinated the review process. VAA and ABVN revised the text of the review. The background was revised by VAA, ABNV and ML. VAA and ABVN assessed studies for inclusion, ML and LMR extracted data and assessed risk of bias in included studies. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion. LM performed with help from Anna the GRADE assessment and preparation of 'Summary of findings' tables. Overall conclusions were discussed as a group. VAA, ABVN and ML contacted trial authors for additional information.</P>

<P>There are differences between this updated version of the review and the previously published version (<LINK REF="REF-Aasheim-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aasheim 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>For this update, we have made the following changes to the primary and secondary outcomes listed in our methods.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Primary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>We have added 'third- and fourth-degree perineal tears' as a new primary outcome in place of two outcomes (third-degree perineal tear; fourth-degree perineal tear - which are now secondary outcomes). It can be difficult to divide these perineal outcomes and studies often report these outcomes together.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Secondary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Two outcomes, 'third-degree perineal tear' and 'fourth-degree perineal tear' have now moved from primary to secondary outcomes.</P>
<P>Women's satisfaction has been edited to include '(as defined by the trial authors)'.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Methods</HEADING>
<P>We have updated our methods text in line with the latest Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011c</LINK>) and the standard methods text of Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth. This update now includes the use of GRADE to assess the quality of the body of evidence and includes 'Summary of findings' tables (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>).</P>

<P>70 women were included. Low-risk pregnancies received antenatal care in the basic healthcare units. The birth centre has an average of 403 deliveries a month (71% vaginal birth), and nurse-midwives attend 100% of the births.</P>
<P>Inclusion criteria: primiparous expectant mothers aged 15-35, full-term pregnancies and vertex presentation.

<P>Experimental intervention: hands off: during the expulsive period, the nurse-midwife&#8217;s conduct was exclusively expectant, only observing the successive movements of restitution, external rotation, birth of the shoulders and the remainder of the body. During birth, the nurse-midwife had to support the baby's head with 1 hand and the baby's torso with the other hand. If external rotation of the head or birth of the shoulders did not occur spontaneously within 15 seconds of the birth of the head, or if the newborn appeared hypoxic, the professional had to manually rotate the head by grasping it and applying gentle downward tracking. Once the anterior shoulder was delivered, gentle upward traction was used to deliver the posterior shoulder. After the shoulders had been delivered, the newborn's neck was held with 1 hand, while the other hand followed along the infant's back, and the legs or feet were grasped as they were delivered.</P>
<P>Comparison: hands on: when the infant's head was crowning, the nurse-midwife placed the index, middle ring and little fingers of the left hand close together on the infant's occiput, with the palm turned toward the anterior region of the perineum. In this manner, expulsion was controlled, by maintaining the flexion of the head, protecting the anterior region of the perineum and bilaterally supporting the ischio-cavernous and bulbo- cavernous muscles, the urethral introitus, and the labia majora and minora. Simultaneously, the right hand was flattened out and placed on the posterior perineum, with the index finger and the thumb, forming a "U" shape, exerting pressure on the posterior region of the perineum during the crowning process. The nurse-midwife left no area without protection, particularly the region of the fourchette. During the birth of the shoulders and the remainder of the body, the right hand was kept in place, protecting the posterior region of the perineum, while the left hand supported the infant's head, allowing external rotation and the birth of the shoulders spontaneously. If this did not occur, the professional continued with posterior perineal pressure, and with the left hand, pulled gently downward to deliver the anterior shoulder. Once the anterior shoulder was delivered, gentle traction was applied upward to ease birth of the posterior shoulder. After both shoulders had been delivered, the practitioner removed the right hand from the posterior perineum and supported the infant's neck with 1 hand, while supporting the remainder of the body with the other hand.</P>
<P>In both techniques, the women were allowed to push spontaneously during labour, without being directed in bearing down efforts, responding to involuntary contractions of the abdominal muscles.</P>

<P>Experimental intervention: perineal protection device</P>
<P>Instructions: when 5&#8211;6 cm of the head was visible in the introitus during crowning, the device was to be inserted. The device was held so that the tongue and wings were kept apart with a finger. The waved tongue was inserted as indicated above the posterior commissure. The device should have been inserted without resistance. Gel could be used if needed. The vaginal opening at this stage of the birth is oval, and the wings were, therefore, spread apart. Wings were fixed against the perineum with the thumb and index finger of the right hand to support the perineum and speed of crowning was controlled with the left hand and the device pushed back during contraction when it would be squeezed out. If it fell out, it was put back.</P>
<P>As the crowning progresses, the vaginal opening becomes circular. This change results in the movement of the wings together. The posterior commissure is effectively locked between the tongue and the wings, and the device prevents the initiation of tearing when the head is maximally crowned. The device should be kept in place by the assistant during birth of the shoulders. If an episiotomy is required, it can be performed laterally of the device. In the case of an instrumental birth, the device can be used as described earlier. The assistant then holds the device in place to reduce the risk of tears, while the obstetrician performs the instrumental birth by steering the head gently through the introitus. The device is preferably kept in place during the birth of the shoulders.</P>

<P>Experimental intervention: hands on</P>
<P>When crowning was done in perineal control through the 'hands-on' method, the midwife placed the index, ring, and little fingers of her left hand close together on the fetus&#8217;s occiput, with the palm turned toward the anterior region of the perineum. In this manner, expulsion was controlled by maintaining the flexion of the head protecting the anterior region of the perineum, providing support to the ischio-cavernous and bulbo-cavernous muscles, the urethral introitus, and the labia major and minor. Simultaneously, the right hand was flattened, and placed on the posterior perineum, with the index finger, and the thumb forming a 'U' shape, exerting pressure. All regions of the perineum, particularly the fourchette, remained protected. When the shoulders and the rest of the body were coming out, the right hand was kept in place, protecting the posterior region of the perineum and the left hand supported the baby's head so that the outside and head rotation happened spontaneously. Midwife pulled out the baby's shoulder and the rest of its body when this did not happen spontaneously.</P>

<P>Control/comparison intervention: hands off</P>
<P>During the expulsive period of the 'hands-off' method, the midwife&#8217;s conduct was exclusively expectant, she only observed the successive movements of restitution, external rotation, delivery of the shoulders, and the remainder of the body.
