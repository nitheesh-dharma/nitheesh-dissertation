It also involves treatment of the teeth and jaws when they are irregular or bite in an abnormal way, or both. Teeth may not bite together correctly due to any combination of problems in the positioning of the teeth, jaws, lips, tongue or cheeks; these can be affected in some cases by a habit, such as thumb sucking, or by the way in which people breathe (<LINK REF="REF-Shaw-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaw 1991</LINK>). The need for orthodontic treatment can be determined by looking at the effect any particular tooth position has on the life expectancy of the teeth or by the effect that the appearance of the teeth has on how people feel about themselves, or both (<LINK REF="REF-Shaw-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaw 1991</LINK>).</P><CONDITION MODIFIED="2018-01-26 13:23:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Ideally the lower front teeth bite in the middle of the back surface of the upper front teeth. When the lower front teeth bite further behind the upper front teeth than ideal, this is known as a Class II malocclusion. The upper jaw can be too far forward or, more usually, the lower jaw is too far back. The upper front teeth may stick out (Class II division 1 malocclusion) if the lower lip catches behind them or as a result of a habit, such as thumb-sucking (<LINK REF="REF-Shaw-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaw 1980</LINK>). Management of prominent upper front teeth (Class II division 1 malocclusion) in children is the subject of a separate systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Thiruvenkatachari-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thiruvenkatachari 2013</LINK>).</P><P>A Class II division 2 malocclusion is a type of orthodontic problem characterised by retroclined (tilted toward the roof of the mouth) upper front teeth and an increased overbite (vertical overlap of the front teeth), although there is variation in the severity of each of these (<LINK REF="REF-Millett-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Millett 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bilgic-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bilgic 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dimberg-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dimberg 2015</LINK>). Aesthetic impairments and trauma to the palatal or lower labial gingivae are frequently reported by people with this problem. Sometimes the deep overbite is so severe that the front teeth bite into the gums either behind the upper front teeth or in front of the lower front teeth producing damage (traumatic overbite) (<LINK REF="REF-Wragg-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wragg 1990</LINK>). The incidence of Class II division 2 malocclusion is reported to be about 10% within the UK population (<LINK REF="REF-Houston-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Houston 1996</LINK>), but prevalence of 18% has been reported in the Croatian population (<LINK REF="REF-Legovic-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Legovic 1999</LINK>). Recent Swedish and Turkish studies have reported lower prevalence, from 1.8% to 4.7% (<LINK REF="REF-Bilgic-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bilgic 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dimberg-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dimberg 2015</LINK><U>)</U>. This type of malocclusion has a strong genetic link (<LINK REF="REF-Markovic-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Markovic 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mossey-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mossey 1999</LINK>).</P><P>The appearance of the upper front teeth and the deep bite of the upper and lower front teeth are reasons why people with this type of problem seek orthodontic treatment (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 1993</LINK>). Class II division 2 malocclusion is also associated with a greater percentage of upper permanent canines failing to erupt as a result of them following an abnormal pathway towards the palate/roof of the mouth (<LINK REF="REF-Mossey-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mossey 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Al_x002d_Nimri-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al-Nimri 2005</LINK>).</P><P>Correction of the Class II division 2 malocclusion may be carried out using several types of orthodontic (dental brace) treatment, but the evidence regarding management is weak and highly biased (<LINK REF="REF-Millett-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Millett 2012</LINK>). People with severe Class II division 2 malocclusions may require surgery to the jaws in combination with orthodontics.</P></CONDITION><INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-09-21 16:05:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>In growing children, treatment may sometimes be carried out using special upper and lower dental braces (functional appliances) that can be removed from the mouth (<LINK REF="REF-Dyer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dyer 2001</LINK>). They usually work by correcting the position of the upper and lower front teeth and modifying the growth of the upper or lower jaws, or both (growth modification). In many cases this treatment does not involve taking out any permanent teeth but often further treatment is needed with fixed braces to get the best result; such braces are glued to the teeth.</P><P>In other cases, treatment aims to move the molar teeth backwards to provide space for the correction of the front teeth. This may be carried out by applying a force to the teeth and jaws from the back of the head using a head brace (headgear) and transmitting this force to part of a fixed or removable dental brace that is attached to the back teeth (<LINK REF="REF-Litt-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Litt 1984</LINK>). This treatment may or may not involve the removal of permanent teeth.</P><P>Other options do exist and may include fixed brace treatment without extraction of permanent teeth, with neither functional appliances nor headgear (<LINK REF="REF-Selwyn_x002d_Barnett-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Selwyn-Barnett 1996</LINK>).</P><P>As an alternative to headgear, the back teeth can be held back in other ways such as with an arch across the roof of the mouth or in contact with the front of the roof of the mouth which links the two back teeth. Often in these cases, two permanent teeth are taken out from the middle of the upper arch (one on each side) to provide room to correct the position of the upper front teeth (<LINK REF="REF-Paquette-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paquette 1992</LINK>).</P><P>In severe cases, particularly in adults, treatment may require a combination of dental braces and surgery to the jaws to correct the position of the teeth and the bite (<LINK REF="REF-Arvystas-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arvystas 1979</LINK>).

As recommended previously in a review of cohort studies and case series, standardised criteria with regard to the definition of Class II division 2 malocclusion should be specified in any study (<LINK REF="REF-Millett-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Millett 2012</LINK>).
