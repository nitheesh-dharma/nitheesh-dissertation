<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-05-23 17:31:05 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Occupational injury rates among farmers are high. Many prevention programs and laws have been introduced as injury control strategies in this field, but the effectiveness of many of these strategies in reducing injuries is still unknown.</P>
<P>A systematic literature search was conducted to find studies on interventions to reduce occupational injuries in agriculture. Eight studies were found from over 8600 references. The quality of the relevant studies was assessed and their results extracted. Randomised controlled trial data were combined across studies in a meta-analysis. Interrupted time series studies were reanalysed to assess if there was a change in the level or trend of injuries associated with the intervention.</P>
<P>Five randomised controlled trials with 11,565 participants and one interrupted time series study with 14 measurement points used combinations of various educational interventions and financial incentives. Two of these studies concentrated on injury prevention among children or adolescents and the rest dealt with injury prevention among adults. The effect of legislation was evaluated in two interrupted time series studies with on average 32.5 measurement points. One study evaluated regulations to prevent tractor rollover injuries in Sweden and another study evaluated regulation to reduce fatal pesticide poisonings in Sri Lanka.</P>
<P>The methodological quality was rated as less than high for all included studies.</P>
<P>The studies provided no evidence that the educational interventions had an injury reducing effect. However, insurance premium discounts as a financial incentive decreased injuries claims in one study. Specific legislative mandates expanding the use of Rollover Protective Structures (ROPS) on tractors were not associated with a reduction of injuries in one study. Legislation to ban Endosulfan pesticides was associated with a reduction in fatal poisonings in the long term in another study.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2008-07-18 17:53:30 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Agriculture is more hazardous than most other industries. Many strategies have been introduced to reduce injuries in the field, yet the effectiveness of different interventions on occupational injuries still remains unclear.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>This review aims to determine the effectiveness of interventions to prevent occupational injuries among workers in the agricultural industry compared to no interventions or to alternative interventions.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Injuries Group's specialised register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO, OSH-ROM (including NIOSHTIC and HSELINE) databases were searched up to June 2006. Reference lists of selected articles, relevant reviews and additional topic related databases and web sites were also searched. The searches were not restricted by language or publication status.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials, cluster-randomised controlled trials, prospective cohort studies with a concurrent control group, and interrupted time series studies assessing any type of intervention aiming to prevent fatal or non-fatal injuries among workers in agriculture.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers conducted data extraction and study quality assessment independently. Rate ratios of randomised controlled trials were calculated and the effect sizes were combined in a meta-analysis. Interrupted time series studies were reanalysed and each of them studied for having an immediate and a progressive effect.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-07-18 17:53:30 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Five randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 11,565 participants and three interrupted time series studies (ITSs) with 26.3 data points on average met the criteria.</P>
<P>For educational interventions aiming at reducing injury rates among adults the pooled rate ratio after recalculation from effect sizes in three RCTs was 1.02 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.20). For educational interventions aiming at children the pooled rate ratio for injury rates in two RCTs was 1.27 (95% CI 0.51 to 3.16).<BR/>
<BR/>One ITS study that evaluated the effect of an intervention that included financial incentives decreased the injury level immediately after the intervention with an effect size of -2.68 (95% CI -3.80 to -1.56) but did not have a significant effect on the injury trend over time with an effect size of -0.22 (95% CI -0.47 to 0.03).<BR/>
<BR/>One ITS study that evaluated the effect of legislation to ban Endosulfan pesticide on fatal pesticide poisonings increased the level of poisonings immediately after the introduction with an effect size of 2.20 (95% CI 0.97 to 3.43) but led to decrease in the trend of poisonings over time with an effect size of -2.15 (95% CI -2.64 to -1.66).<BR/>
<BR/>One ITS study documented four different regulations aiming to increase the use of rollover protective structures (ROPS) on tractors and their effect on injuries and fatal injuries. The introduction of two different pieces of legislation requiring ROPS on new tractors sold after a certain date was associated with a decrease of fatal injuries over the long term (effect size -0.93 95% CI -1.82 to -0.03). Otherwise the introduction of legislation was associated with an increase of injury rates. Introduction of legislation requiring ROPS on all tractors, old tractors included, was not associated with a decrease but with an increase of injuries and fatal injuries over the long term.<BR/>
</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The selected studies provided no evidence that educational interventions are effective in decreasing injury rates among agricultural workers. Financial incentives could reduce injury rates. Legislation to ban pesticides could be effective. Legislation expanding the use of safety devices (ROPS) on new tractors was associated with a decrease in fatal injuries.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-08-08 18:41:16 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-05-23 17:32:49 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>About half of the world's labour force (1.3 billion workers) work in agriculture. The agricultural population is distributed as follows: Asia (76%), Central America and Caribbean (1.3%), Europe (2.2%), Middle East and North Africa (3.8%), North America (0.2%), Oceania (0.2%), South America (2.0%), and Sub-Saharan Africa (14%) (<LINK REF="REF-WRI-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WRI 2006</LINK>). While the political, economic, climatic, and working conditions vary, agriculture consistently ranks among the most hazardous industries along with mining and construction (<LINK REF="REF-Myers-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Myers 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Agricultural injuries are quite well documented in industrialised countries, but less so in developing countries. An estimated 170,000 farm workers are killed each year and millions more are either seriously injured in workplace accidents or poisoned with pesticides and other agrichemicals. It is likely that under reporting is common and the actual numbers are even higher (<LINK REF="REF-ILO-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">ILO 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Available evidence clearly shows that agriculture is a hazardous industry and effective intervention strategies are needed to prevent injuries. Although a wide range of interventions has been developed, their effectiveness is not well understood. A review of 25 farm safety interventions found little evidence that farm safety programs have been effective (<LINK REF="REF-DeRoo-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeRoo 2000</LINK>). While some studies were able to report at least temporary changes in knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours, none showed sustained decrease in injuries or illnesses. Multifaceted programs appeared most successful. Most reports had methodological weaknesses. Some efforts have been made to document the effectiveness of agricultural safety and health programs, but a systematic review is needed to include the most current studies and to keep this information updated.</P>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-05-23 17:32:45 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Many different intervention approaches have been developed. One way to categorise them is the "Three E's of Safety": Engineering, Education and Enforcement (<LINK REF="REF-Murphy-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murphy 1992</LINK>). Haddon's Matrix provides another useful framework for injury investigation and prevention (<LINK REF="REF-Haddon-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haddon 1980</LINK>). Based on these frameworks we categorised interventions in the following four categories: engineering/technology, education/behaviour change, legislation/enforcement, and multi-faceted interventions using more than one basic approach. Engineering/technology interventions include developing standards for guarding moving machinery parts, improving the design of tools, and replacing hazardous structures with safer ones. Education/behaviour change include voluntary worker training programs (<LINK REF="REF-Abend-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abend 1998</LINK>), farm safety day camps for children (<LINK REF="REF-Buchan-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buchan 1993</LINK>), farm safety fairs (<LINK REF="REF-Reed-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reed 1994</LINK>) and community-oriented programs (<LINK REF="STD-Hawk-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Hawk 1995</LINK>). Legislation/enforcement includes implementing new regulations to require Rollover Protective Structures (ROPS) on tractors (<LINK REF="REF-Reynolds-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reynolds 2000</LINK>). Incentive programs do not fit well under these categories, but we include them in the category of education/behaviour change. Examples include offering financial incentives for installing safety devices (<LINK REF="REF-Stone-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stone 2003</LINK>), government funding for safety improvements (<LINK REF="REF-Lundqvist-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lundqvist 1996</LINK>) and insurance incentives (<LINK REF="STD-Rautiainen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rautiainen 2005</LINK>). Multi-faceted interventions may include combinations of approaches, such as farm inspections with safety courses (<LINK REF="REF-Carstensen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carstensen 1998</LINK>), best management practice programs (<LINK REF="STD-Legault-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Legault 2000</LINK>) and multifaceted programs including health evaluation, workplace hazard evaluation and education (<LINK REF="REF-Donham-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donham 2006</LINK>).</P>

<METHODS MODIFIED="2008-08-08 18:41:16 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-08-08 18:41:16 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<CRIT_STUDIES MODIFIED="2008-08-08 18:41:16 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-randomised controlled trials (cRCTs) irrespective of language of publication.</P>
<P>We expected that the availability of RCTs would be limited due to the infrequency of RCT experiments in the agricultural safety field. Interventions in this field differ from medical clinical interventions in that agricultural interventions are not often implemented at the individual level. For example new equipment or safety engineering controls may be applied at the farm or community level involving multiple workers at the same time. This makes individual randomisation impossible. In principle, this can be overcome by randomisation at the farm or community levels as in a cluster-randomised trial. However, as the level of aggregation increases, the effectiveness of randomisation decreases. For some interventions, randomisation is not feasible. For example, introduction of new regulations that affect an entire jurisdiction are difficult to randomise.</P>
<P>We included the following non-randomised study designs in our review: prospective cohort studies with a concurrent control group (CCT) and interrupted time series (ITS) studies. Prospective cohort studies are feasible to perform, particularly when the intervention is carried out at the group level, while still providing reasonable validity. We have defined prospective cohort studies as ones in which the study protocol was conceived before the data-collection started and data on the outcome were collected concurrently before and after the intervention at the same moments in time for the intervention and the control group. Injury studies are often based on routinely collected administrative data from insurance or governmental sources which can be used for interrupted time series design. In many cases, the data are collected independently of interventions over longer periods of time which provides reasonable validity. If there were at least three data-points before and three data-points after the intervention we included these study designs as interrupted time series (<LINK REF="REF-EPOC-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPOC 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>We based our conclusions only on studies that use one of the study designs described above (RCT, cRCT, CCT, ITS). In the protocol we anticipated that we could also use lower quality intervention studies, including before-after studies without a control group, retrospective cohort studies and case-reference studies. Since we found a reasonable number of studies meeting our primary criteria, and due to the difficulties in comparing results from various studies with different designs we subsequently excluded studies that did not meet RCT, cRTC, CCT or ITS criteria.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>This review focused on studies of agricultural industry workers in establishments primarily engaged in growing crops and animal production. We accepted studies where the population could be classified under the International Standard Industry Classification (ISIC) (<LINK REF="REF-UNSD-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNSD 2006</LINK>) codes A011-A015, which include agricultural workers growing non-perennial crops (such as rice, vegetables, sugar cane), or perennial crops (such as fruits, beverage crops, spices), and animal production (such as cattle, horses, sheep), and mixed farming of crops and animals. If needed, we considered further inclusion criteria by considering the participants work location, work activity or degree of participation in work as described in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. In cases where the intervention was not strictly limited to agricultural workers (such as pesticide regulation at society level), we included studies where the majority of the population would likely meet the inclusion criteria.</P>
<P>Studies were excluded if the (majority of) participants did not work in the agricultural industry according to the exclusion criteria described in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Interventions deliberately applied to decrease the rate or severity of injuries were included. The interventions involved engineering/technology, education/behaviour change (includes incentives), legislation/enforcement, or multifaceted programs. The interventions were administered at the national, regional, organisational, community or individual level.</P>

<CRIT_OUTCOMES_PRIMARY MODIFIED="2008-05-23 17:33:28 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>We included trials which measured both fatal and non-fatal occupational injuries. There is some variation in the definitions for occupational injury. We used the following modified definition used in The Injury Chartbook by the World Health Organization (<LINK REF="REF-Baker-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baker 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peden-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peden 2002</LINK>): Occupational injury is a body lesion at the organic level, resulting from acute exposure to energy in the work environment (mechanical, thermal, electrical, chemical or radiant) in amounts that exceed the threshold of physiological tolerance. In some cases (e.g. drowning, strangulation, freezing), the injury results from an insufficiency of a vital element. We considered all reports of injuries including self-reports. Data sources, such as workers' compensation, have specific definitions, while surveys based on self-report rely on the worker's perception of injury. We included studies where the injury outcome was defined in a way that is reasonably consistent with the WHO definition. Our interpretation of the WHO definition included intentional injuries in the work environment.</P>
<P>We excluded occupational diseases as described by authorities in the jurisdiction where the study was conducted. We also excluded leisure injury and off-farm employment injury. We also excluded studies with only intermediary outcomes such as risk, hazard, adoption of safety changes, awareness, and behaviour.</P>
<P>As an operational definition, we included studies where the primary outcome was "injury", and the definition was in line with the WHO definition. We included subsets of the general injury definition, such as brain injury or agricultural machinery-related injury. We excluded studies where the primary outcome was a musculoskeletal disorder, in which the cause is not due to acute exposure to energy, such as in back pain, cumulative trauma, carpal tunnel syndrome or tendonitis.</P>

<P>The selection of studies was conducted by two authors (ML and RR) independently, applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Any disagreement about the inclusion of studies was followed by a discussion until consensus was reached between the two reviewers. In case of disagreement, a third party (LD) decided. Authors (RR) were excluded from evaluating their own studies (ML and ES evaluated the studies by RR). If the title and abstract provided sufficient information to decide that the criteria for selection were not satisfied, the study was excluded. Full articles of the remaining studies were then examined by the two reviewers in order to decide which studies met the selection criteria. We contacted authors directly if it was not clear whether the study met the selection criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Pekkarinen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pekkarinen 2006</LINK>). The reasons for exclusion were documented. Applicable articles in languages other than English were reviewed by a native speaker (Russian and Norwegian).</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2008-05-23 17:43:19 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>The quality of the included studies was independently assessed by two reviewers (ML and RR). Authors were excluded from assessing their own studies (ML and ES assessed the studies by RR). We used the Downs and Black quality checklist that is capable of assessing both randomised and non-randomised studies (<LINK REF="REF-Downs-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Downs 1998</LINK>). We used the scale on internal validity from the checklist to rank studies based on their quality. Any disagreement about the quality assessment of studies was followed by a discussion until consensus was reached between the two reviewers. Since there was no persistent disagreement, the third author (LD) was not involved in the quality assessment. For ITS studies we were going to use the quality criteria as developed by the EPOC review group (<LINK REF="REF-EPOC-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPOC 2006</LINK>). However, during the review process we found an alternative method for calculating comparable and reliable effect sizes for the ITS studies and therefore used the quality criteria as developed by Ramsay (<LINK REF="REF-Ramsay-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramsay 2003</LINK>) that combines EPOC criteria with the classification of threats to validity identified by Campbell and Stanley (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 1966</LINK>); eight quality criteria questions answered by DONE, NOT CLEAR or NOT DONE.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2008-05-23 17:43:09 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>The reported effect measures were extracted from all included studies. The intervention effect for RCTs and cRCTs was calculated as a rate ratio: rate (number of injuries per 100 person-years) in the intervention group divided by the rate in the control group. Effect sizes were combined across studies using natural logarithms of the rate ratios and applying the generic inverse variance method. The standard error of the effect size was calculated as (1/A+1/C), where A is the number of injuries in the intervention group and C is the number of injuries in the control group. These methods are described in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>). The number of annual working hours varies by country and has decreased over time. One person-year is commonly defined as 2000 hours in USA and 1600 hours in Europe (<LINK REF="REF-Spangenberg-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spangenberg 2002</LINK>). We used 1600 working hours for injury rate calculations for two European studies (<LINK REF="STD-Pekkarinen-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pekkarinen 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rasmussen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rasmussen 2003</LINK>). In the <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2004</LINK> study we calculated the injury rate assuming that each individual contributed one person-year (2000 h) of working time.</P>
<P>In order to obtain comparable and reliable effect size measures from included ITS studies, we extracted data from original papers and reanalysed the data according to recommended methods for ITS designs (<LINK REF="REF-Ramsay-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramsay 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ramsay-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramsay 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vidanapathirana-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vidanapathirana 2005</LINK>). These methods utilise a segmented time series regression analysis to estimate the effect of an intervention while taking into account secular time trends and any autocorrelation between individual observations. First order autoregressive time series model was fitted to the data from each study using a modification of the parameterisation (<LINK REF="REF-Ramsay-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramsay 2001</LINK>). The model was defined as follows:</P>
<P>Y= ß0+ ß1(time)+ ß2 (time-p) I(time &gt; p) + ß3 I(time &gt; p) + E, E~ N(0, s2)</P>
<P>For time = from 1 to T, where p is the time of the start of the intervention, I(time&#8805;p) is a function which takes the value 1 if time is p or later and zero otherwise, and where the errors E are assumed to follow a first order autoregressive process (AR1).</P>
<P>The parameters ß have the following interpretation:<BR/>ß1 is the pre-intervention slope.<BR/>ß2 is the difference between post and pre-intervention slopes.<BR/>ß3 is the change in level at the beginning of the intervention period, meaning that it is the difference between the observed level at the first intervention time point and that predicted by the pre-intervention time trend.</P>
<P>Statistical analyses were performed using Stata 9.2 for Windows (StataCorp LP, College Station, Tx USA).</P>
<P>Observation data over time were extracted from tables of the original studies (<LINK REF="STD-Springfeldt-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Springfeldt 1993a</LINK>) or directly from authors (<LINK REF="STD-Rautiainen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rautiainen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 2003</LINK>). Outcomes of these studies were not re-scaled into injuries per 100 person-years, since the studies had different interventions and outcomes, which could not be combined for comparison.</P>
<P>Reanalysis with autoregressive modelling made it possible to estimate regression coefficients corresponding to two standardised effect sizes for each study: i) change in level and ii) change in slope of the regression lines before and after the intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Ramsay-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramsay 2003</LINK>). The ß parameters in the above regression model were estimated using the Prais-Winstein first order autocorrelation version of generalised least squares (GLS) regression, as implemented in the STATA software package (version 9.2). A change in the level was defined as the difference between the observed level at the first intervention time point and that predicted by the pre-intervention time trend. A change in the slope was defined as the difference between post- and pre-intervention slopes. The change in the level stands for an immediate intervention effect and a change in slope for a sustained effect of the intervention. A negative change in the level or slope represents an intervention effect in terms of a reduction in injuries.</P>
<P>Data were standardised by dividing the outcome and standard error by the pre-intervention standard deviation as recommended by <LINK REF="REF-Ramsay-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramsay 2001</LINK> and put into RevMan as effect sizes and standard errors (using the generic inverse variance method).</P>
<P>The Springfeldt study included four different moments in time in which legislation was introduced: 1959 (<LINK REF="STD-Springfeldt-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Springfeldt 1993a</LINK>), 1965 (<LINK REF="STD-Springfeldt-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Springfeldt 1993b</LINK>), 1970 (<LINK REF="STD-Springfeldt-1993c" TYPE="STUDY">Springfeldt 1993c</LINK>) and 1981(<LINK REF="STD-Springfeldt-1993d" TYPE="STUDY">Springfeldt 1993d</LINK>). We analysed the data in such a way that the respective time series extended from 1957-1964, 1960-1969, 1966-1975, and 1974-1990.</P>

<P>The primary unit of analysis was the agricultural worker. In the case of cRCTs where the clustering effect was not taken into account (<LINK REF="STD-Pekkarinen-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pekkarinen 1994</LINK>) we calculated the 'effective sample size' by dividing the original sample size with the design effect as described in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>). Design effect is 1+(m-1)r, where m is the average cluster size and r is the intracluster correlation coefficient. The calculations of the design effect were based on a fairly large assumed intra-cluster correlation of 0.10. We based this assumption by analogy on studies about implementation research (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Lee-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2004</LINK> had already done tests at the individual and cluster level, and no significant clustering effect was revealed, so design effect calculations were not undertaken for this review.</P>

All studies were published between 1993 and 2006 and the interventions were carried out during 1959-2003.</P>
<P>Two of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Gadomski-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gadomski 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2004</LINK>) looked at injury prevention among children or adolescents. The rest were dealing with injury prevention among adults and one (<LINK REF="STD-Pekkarinen-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pekkarinen 1994</LINK>) had only male reindeer herders as study participants.</P>

<OL>
<LI>Occupational health and safety (OHS) professionals involved in the intervention, e.g. farm safety checks, health checks or safety courses;</LI>

<LI>Written information, e.g. booklets, guides, mailings, written reports, booster interventions;</LI>
<LI>Financial incentives, e.g. travel expenses reimbursed or money paid to a participating farm.</LI>
</OL>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Lee-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2004</LINK>) combined all four above mentioned elements; (1) interactive training, contact with community nurse, (2) national conventions, phone contact, local agribusinesses, (3) instruction guides, "Treasure chest", quarterly mailings, free Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), (4) training travel reimbursement and money for community nurse involvement.</P>
<P>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Rasmussen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rasmussen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rautiainen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rautiainen 2004</LINK>) combined three of the elements. <LINK REF="STD-Rasmussen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rasmussen 2003</LINK> combined (1) farm safety checks, safety course, (2) group discussion, presentation by a seriously injured farmer and (3) written reports of the farm safety checks and material to those not able to participate in the course. <LINK REF="STD-Rautiainen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rautiainen 2004</LINK> used (1) annual health screenings, on-farm safety reviews, informational meetings, (2) other farmers participating in informational meetings and (4) paid money each year to participating farm.</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Gadomski-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gadomski 2006</LINK>) combined two of the elements; (2) farm safety visit by a lay educator and (3) booklets and booster interventions.</P>

<P>One ITS study (<LINK REF="STD-Rautiainen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rautiainen 2005</LINK>) was based solely on incentives (education/behaviour), studying how insurance discounts affect injury claims. Another study (<LINK REF="STD-Roberts-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 2003</LINK>) evaluated pesticide regulations (legislation/enforcement) to determine whether Endosulfan ban decreased fatal poisonings. <LINK REF="STD-Springfeldt-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Springfeldt 1993a</LINK> evaluated the effect of regulations requiring safety devices (technical measures) on tractors. This study included four regulation interventions regarding rollover protection structures (ROPS) in Sweden: interventions in 1959 (<LINK REF="STD-Springfeldt-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Springfeldt 1993a</LINK>) and 1970 (<LINK REF="STD-Springfeldt-1993c" TYPE="STUDY">Springfeldt 1993c</LINK>) were requirements concerning ROPS and safety cabs in new tractors respectively and interventions in 1965 (<LINK REF="STD-Springfeldt-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Springfeldt 1993b</LINK>) and 1983 (<LINK REF="STD-Springfeldt-1993d" TYPE="STUDY">Springfeldt 1993d</LINK>) were requirements concerning ROPS and safety cabs in tractors used for occupational work respectively.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Roberts-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 2003</LINK> addressed pesticide poisonings in a developing country. It was not possible to determine from the paper what proportions of the poisoning deaths were unintentional and work-related. We based our assessment on data that were gathered from a district that is known to be primarily inhabited by farmers. Farmers commonly have access to pesticides and their risk of (potentially work-related) suicide by pesticide ingestion may be greater than the risk in non-agricultural populations. This study was included, since the injury criteria were fulfilled and there were no restrictions in our protocol concerning "work-related suicide".</P>

<P>The two RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Lee-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gadomski-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gadomski 2006</LINK>) aiming to reduce injuries among children/adolescents did not show a significant effect size either. However, they were very heterogeneous (I<SUP>2</SUP> 91.8%) due to the fact that one study had a significant effect in favour of the control group. No potential reasons for this were offered by the authors of the original article. The following result was obtained when we converted the effect size back to rate ratio: 1.27 (95% CI 0.51 to 3.16).<BR/>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-05-23 17:58:52 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>We found no evidence to suggest that educational interventions had an injury-reducing effect. In one study the introduction of insurance discounts reduced the level but not the trend of injuries. In another study a legislative ban of Endosulfan improved the trend of pesticide poisonings but was not associated with a change in poisonings in the short term. In yet another study, legally mandatory technical improvements on tractors showed only one favourable outcome out of a total of 16 outcomes of injury reduction.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2008-08-08 18:41:16 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>We had expected to find three main categories of interventions: technical or engineering interventions, educational or behavioural interventions and legislative or enforcement related interventions. We found interventions in all three categories but most in the educational and legislative domain.</P>
<P>We did not find any interventions in which engineering interventions were evaluated as such. This might be due to the technical nature of the interventions. In such cases it is easily assumed that interventions do work, for example technical measures to reduce noise levels or introducing safety belts in cars. The improvement in the design of machines, environment, and systems has been proposed as being preferable to attempts to change people's safety attitudes or behaviour (<LINK REF="REF-Heidt-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heidt 1984</LINK>). However, it can still be difficult to get these technical measures implemented. Therefore, evaluation of the implementation of such technical interventions is needed.</P>
<P>For educational interventions we found a wide array of implementation strategies involving training by occupational health and safety professionals and peers (farmers and family members) and more or less extensive information packages.<BR/>
<BR/>Legislation was evaluated using an ITS design for two particular issues: technical requirements for tractors, and a ban of the pesticide Endosulfan. Many other safety topics in agriculture such as pesticide distribution and use, worker health and safety training, and safety for agricultural equipment (such as power take-off guards) have been regulated by law (<LINK REF="REF-Cordes-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cordes 1991</LINK>). It would be informative to have evaluations from these measures as well. The ITS design, though not very powerful and liable to biases, seems to best fit these types of questions. In many cases ITSs and administrative data are presented without statistical analyses where the authors conclude only by visual observation whether there is an impact of the intervention. In addition, there is almost always an overall downward trend of injury-rates which makes it difficult to ascribe changes over time to the intervention. Therefore, we think it is necessary to reanalyse ITS studies using a standard approach of calculating changes in level and changes in trend, taking into account the auto-correlation of the data. It also remains difficult to consider the introduction of legislation as an interruption of the time-series at one distinct point in time. Before the introduction, there will be societal debate and pressure to comply with the legal requirements and after the introduction it will depend on the enforcement of implementation. This kind of information is often lacking in ITS studies.</P>
<P>Ninety percent of the farming population lives in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. However, all but one of the studies we found were based on data from industrialised countries (<LINK REF="STD-Roberts-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 2003</LINK>). The evidence on interventions that we found is probably not applicable in developing countries as the setting is so different (in particular the level of mechanisation).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Educational interventions</HEADING>
<P>The educational interventions in the included studies would be expected to show at least some effect as they were comprised of various combinations of different elements and engaged study subjects in different ways. However, the effect sizes were small and not statistically significant. As a result of the meta-analysis the 95% confidence interval around the effect size was rather narrow and this makes a bigger or smaller effect size very unlikely. Only the study that included financial incentives showed an effect on injury rates (<LINK REF="STD-Rautiainen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rautiainen 2005</LINK>). This was, however, based on a weak time-series design and it is possible that farmers underreported injuries due to the financial incentives.</P>
<P>Our negative findings are consistent with other studies on the impact of educational interventions alone on injury outcomes among other populations (<LINK REF="REF-Duperrex-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duperrex 2007</LINK>). Apparently educational interventions are not strong enough to bring about change, unless combined with other behavioural incentives such as financial benefit or legislative requirements. It is also possible that the effectiveness of educational interventions is dependent on contextual factors such as the financial or organisational state of the farm (<LINK REF="REF-Suutarinen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suutarinen 2004</LINK>). Furthermore, educational intervention trials may suffer from biases favouring control due to non-blinded design, leaking of intervention into the control group and better awareness and willingness to report outcomes among intervention subjects.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Pesticides ban</HEADING>
<P>Pesticides constitute a serious health hazard to farmers especially in developing countries. From our review, it becomes clear that measures to decrease these risks have been seldom evaluated. The included time series showed some evidence that banning of a pesticide does not lead to illegal and more dangerous use but that it can have a favourable effect on poisoning fatalities.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Legislation requiring technical measures</HEADING>
<P>The Swedish study on ROPS (<LINK REF="STD-Springfeldt-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Springfeldt 1993a</LINK>) is frequently cited as strong evidence of the effectiveness of ROPS (<LINK REF="REF-Reynolds-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reynolds 2000</LINK>). The effect on the time series of injury rates appears clear as legislation has been implemented in several cases, the percentage of tractors with ROPS has increased and the number of injuries and fatalities has decreased. However the changes in the level and trend of the injury rate and the rate of fatalities following four specific legislative measures were contradictory with some increasing and some decreasing. One explanation could be that there is no interruptive effect of legislation but only a gradual effect. By the end of the study period nearly 100% of tractors had ROPS.</P>
<P>It is interesting to note that the fatalities reduced to near zero quite early, much before the ROPS percentage reached full compliance. The <LINK REF="STD-Springfeldt-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Springfeldt 1993a</LINK> study provides annual proportions of tractors equipped with ROPS. This proportion shows a gradual steady increase, which indicates that the enforcement of the legislation may not have been immediate, but gradual over time.</P>
<P>Another limitation of the study is that there were only two time points before the first ROPS legislation came into force in 1959 making it difficult to evaluate the data. Yet this initial legislation may have been the most important, having resulted in the steady increase in the percentage of tractors with ROPS (simultaneously decreasing injury rates), particularly in the early years of the observation period.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2008-05-23 17:58:32 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>It is important to note that at least some of the included studies used a randomised controlled study design. It is often argued that this is difficult or impossible to apply in occupational health settings but apparently it is less difficult than thought. However, it remains difficult to perform high quality studies as blinding of participants and of providers is virtually impossible in educational interventions. None of the included studies scored more than 70% of the possible score on the quality checklists. However, compared to the quality of evidence included in previous reviews, there is notable improvement in the quality of studies being produced (<LINK REF="REF-DeRoo-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeRoo 2000</LINK>).</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2008-05-23 18:00:18 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>We did a very sensitive search and tracked all possible references from other studies. In addition, we searched topic-related databases and websites for grey literature. We therefore feel confident that we have found all possible studies that met our inclusion criteria.</P>
<P>We succeeded well in excluding language bias from our review as we had all the foreign language abstracts read and interpreted by persons with appropriate language skills.</P>
<P>Since we had a mixture of positive and negative results we assume that publication bias has not influenced the results of this review.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2008-05-23 18:01:23 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Several other reviews have summarised the effectiveness of interventions to prevent childhood farm injuries (<LINK REF="REF-Hartling-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hartling 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reed-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reed 2000</LINK>). One did not draw any conclusions due to the lack of methodological rigor of the included studies (<LINK REF="REF-Reed-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reed 2000</LINK>). The other review concluded that educational programmes increased knowledge but that the effect on injury rates was unknown. Since then two RCTs became available which were both included in our review.</P>
<P>There are also two reviews on general farm safety interventions (<LINK REF="REF-DeRoo-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeRoo 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCurdy-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCurdy 2000</LINK>). Both used less strict inclusion criteria regarding study design and outcome than we did. Both concluded that the available evidence is not of high enough quality to draw general conclusions. Since then several RCTs and ITS studies have become available which are included in this review.</P>
<P>There is one specific review on educational interventions in agricultural safety settings that concludes that there is no evidence available on educational interventions in agriculture (<LINK REF="REF-Murphy-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murphy 1996</LINK>). Our review fills this knowledge gap.</P>
<P>Another review on interventions to reduce pesticide poisoning concluded that exposure had been reduced but that there was a lack of evidence whether concomitant poisonings had decreased (<LINK REF="REF-Keifer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keifer 2000</LINK>). Most studies had evaluated the use of personal protective equipment under laboratory conditions and not under real working conditions. Our review adds one study that evaluated legislation and no studies that evaluated other measures under field conditions.</P>
<P>In general, it can be concluded that this review addresses many of the previously identified gaps in knowledge in this area. This is because the quality and number of studies in the research area have increased considerably in the past ten years.</P>
</AGREEMENT>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>This review did not find evidence supporting the widespread use of educational interventions alone. The widespread use of educational interventions alone can therefore be questioned. However, this is not to indicate that there is not a place for an educational component within a multi-factorial intervention. The use of financial incentives could be effective but should be studied better before more extensive implementation can be recommended. The banning of Endosulfan lowered the rate of fatal pesticide poisonings in one study and should be considered for other countries as well.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>RCTs are possible and feasible both at the individual and the farm level. More of these studies are needed for evaluating behavioural interventions and interventions to enhance the implementation of technical interventions. ITS studies using administrative databases are feasible for studying the effects of interventions, particularly those at the society level (including legislation changes). For better understanding the impact of legislation on time series of injury rates, studies are needed on the development and implementation process of safety legislation.</P>

<P>Preliminary searches were done in PubMed to define useful terms for the search strategy. We expect that the strategy will have adequate sensitivity and specificity. Our approach to come to a comprehensive search strategy was as follows:<BR/>
<BR/>First we devised terms for participants, such as agriculture and farm. The term farm* could not be used since it had a too short body for truncating thus forming hundreds of word variations that PubMed could not detect. That is why most important farm related words were selected to the search strategy: farm, farms, farmer, farmers, farming, "farm worker", "farmworker", "farm workers", "farmworkers". Ranch is a term commonly used for cattle farms. The word was truncated as ranch* to increase sensitivity and include ranch worker. Dairy, greenhouse, orchard and animal confinement were added to make the search more sensitive. These specific sector terms are sometimes used instead of the generic term, agriculture. Agriculture was truncated as agricultur* to include terms such as agricultural enterprise. Also few terms describing the actual work done by the agricultural workers were added to make the search more sensitive, like "crop production" and "livestock". The terms were tagged to enhance specificity and to eliminate articles that include the terms just in author names and addresses or unintended contexts, such as "Remuda Ranch Programs for Anorexia &amp; Bulimia, Inc.".<BR/>
<BR/>Next we devised terms for outcome such as injury. Outcome in the search strategy was defined as an injury and the term is truncated as injur* to make it sensitive. The term trauma is often used in clinical settings instead of injury. The term accident is also used, particularly in Europe, to describe an injury and an event leading to injury. Both terms were included. Accident was truncated as accident*. Both terms safety and accident (also as injury term) were included in the strategy. The MeSH term accident should include safety but the search results did not overlap.<BR/>
<BR/>Specific terms for the intervention were not included, because we would include any intervention for this review.<BR/>
<BR/>For study design we will use two search strategies designed to find RCTs and non-randomised studies respectively. For RCTs we will use the strategy described by Robinson and Dickersin (<LINK REF="REF-Robinson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 2002</LINK>) and for non-randomised studies the strategy described by Verbeek (<LINK REF="REF-Verbeek-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verbeek 2005</LINK>).</P>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>We used search terms that covered the concepts of 'agricultural work', 'injury', 'safety' and 'study design' to identify studies in the electronic databases.
