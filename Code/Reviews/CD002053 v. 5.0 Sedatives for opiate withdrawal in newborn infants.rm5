<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-04-05 21:31:04 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>When a sedative is needed to ameliorate symptoms in newborn infants with opiate withdrawal due to maternal opiate use in pregnancy, phenobarbitone is preferred. Use of opiates (commonly prescribed methadone or illicit heroin) by pregnant women may result in a withdrawal syndrome in their newborn infants. This may result in disruption of the mother-infant relationship, sleeping and feeding difficulties, weight loss and seizures. Treatments for newborn infants used to ameliorate these symptoms and reduce complications include opiates, sedatives (phenobarbitone or diazepam) and supportive treatments (swaddling, settling, massage, relaxation baths, pacifiers or waterbeds). Trials of sedatives have generally been of poor quality. Individual studies have reported that use of phenobarbitone compared to supportive care alone reduces the amount time an infant needs supportive care, is better than diazepam at preventing treatment failure and reduces the severity of withdrawal in infants treated with a opiate. In infants treated with an opiate, the addition of a sedative (phenobarbitone or clonidine) may reduce withdrawal severity, although safety and efficacy need confirming. The long term effects of use of phenobarbitone on an infant's development have not been determined.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) due to opiate withdrawal may result in disruption of the mother-infant relationship, sleep-wake abnormalities, feeding difficulties, weight loss and seizures.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-09-07 16:13:33 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Seven studies enrolling 385 patients were included. There were substantial methodological concerns for most studies including the use of quasi-random allocation methods and sizeable, largely unexplained differences in reported numbers allocated to each group.</P>
<P>One study reported phenobarbitone compared to supportive care alone did not reduce treatment failure or time to regain birthweight, but resulted in a significant reduction in duration of supportive care (MD -162.1 min/day, 95% CI -249.2, -75.1). Comparing phenobarbitone to diazepam, meta-analysis of two studies found phenobarbitone resulted in a significant reduction in treatment failure (typical RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.24, 0.62). Comparing phenobarbitone with chlorpromazine, one study reported no significant difference in treatment failure.</P>
<P>In infants treated with an opiate, one study reported addition of clonidine resulted in no significant difference in treatment failure, seizures or mortality. In infants treated with an opiate, one study reported addition of phenobarbitone significantly reduced the proportion of time infants had a high abstinence severity score, duration of hospitalisation and maximal daily dose of opiate.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-09-07 18:56:59 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Infants with NAS due to opiate withdrawal should receive initial treatment with an opiate. Where a sedative is used, phenobarbitone should be used in preference to diazepam. In infants treated with an opiate, the addition of phenobarbitone or clonidine may reduce withdrawal severity. Further studies are needed to determine the role of sedatives in infants with NAS due to opiate withdrawal and the safety and efficacy of adding phenobarbitone or clonidine in infants treated with an opiate for NAS.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-09-07 19:04:46 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Opiate use in pregnancy and neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) due to opiate withdrawal is currently a significant clinical and social problem. The US 1999 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse (<LINK REF="REF-NHSDA-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHSDA 1999</LINK>) estimated that 39.7% of individuals over 12 years had ever used an illicit drug, with heroin use reported by 1.4%. Current illicit drug use (within last month) was reported by 6.7% (14.8 million people) and heroin by 0.1% (200,000 people). Rates of illicit drug use were almost half during pregnancy, with 3.4% of pregnant women reporting use of an illicit drug in the past month. This represents an estimated 3,000 pregnant women who are current users of heroin in the US. These figures are similar to Australian data (<LINK REF="REF-NDSHS-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">NDSHS 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Between 48% and 94% of infants exposed to opiates in utero develop clinical signs of withdrawal, with signs of withdrawal from methadone more common than from heroin (<LINK REF="STD-Alroomi-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Alroomi 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Doberczak-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Doberczak 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fricker-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fricker 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lam-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lam 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maas-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maas 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Madden-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Madden 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Olofsson-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olofsson 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ostrea-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Ostrea 1976</LINK>). There is some evidence to correlate methadone dose and severity of withdrawal (<LINK REF="STD-Doberczak-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Doberczak 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harper-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Harper 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ostrea-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Ostrea 1976</LINK>). Clinically significant manifestations of withdrawal are uncommon if the methadone dose is below 20 mg/day (<LINK REF="REF-Strauss-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strauss 1976</LINK>). The onset of features of withdrawal from heroin tends to begin within 24 hours and clinical manifestations are usually mild (<LINK REF="STD-Alroomi-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Alroomi 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bell-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bell 1995</LINK>), whereas withdrawal from methadone usually begins between two and seven days after birth (<LINK REF="STD-Doberczak-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Doberczak 1991</LINK>) and may be delayed up to a month (<LINK REF="REF-Kandall-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kandall 1974</LINK>). Clinical features of neonatal opiate abstinence syndrome include neurological excitability, gastrointestinal dysfunction and autonomic signs (<LINK REF="REF-AAP-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 1998</LINK>). There may be poor feeding, sleep-wake abnormalities (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2002</LINK>), vomiting, dehydration, poor weight gain and seizures. In addition, infants of mothers using illicit drugs may be at increased risk of neonatal mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Hulse-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hulse 1998</LINK>), sudden infant death syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Kandall-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kandall 1993</LINK>), and abnormal neurodevelopmental outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-de-Cubas-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Cubas 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ornoy-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ornoy 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Seizures occur in 2% to 11% of infants withdrawing from opiates (<LINK REF="STD-Herzlinger-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Herzlinger 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kandall-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kandall 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Doberczak-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Doberczak 1991</LINK>) and may be more common with methadone than heroin withdrawal (<LINK REF="STD-Herzlinger-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Herzlinger 1977</LINK>). Although there is evidence in animals that withdrawal from opiates and opiate antagonists is eleptogenic (<LINK REF="REF-Olson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olson 1997</LINK>), there is little evidence that this is the case in humans. Case series of infants with neonatal opiate withdrawal in whom seizures have been reported (<LINK REF="STD-Herzlinger-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Herzlinger 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kandall-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kandall 1974</LINK>) have not systematically controlled for maternal use of other drugs throughout pregnancy or reported seizures in infants exposed only to opiates in utero.</P>
<P>The American Academy of Pediatrics (<LINK REF="REF-AAP-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 1998</LINK>) recommends that for infants with confirmed drug exposure the indications for drug therapy should be seizures, poor feeding, diarrhoea and vomiting resulting in excessive weight loss and dehydration, inability to sleep and fever unrelated to infection. An abstinence score such as the Lipsitz tool (<LINK REF="REF-Lipsitz-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipsitz 1975</LINK>), Neonatal Abstinence Scoring System (<LINK REF="STD-Finnegan-1975a" TYPE="STUDY">Finnegan 1975a</LINK>) and Neonatal Withdrawal Inventory (<LINK REF="REF-Zahorodny-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zahorodny 1998</LINK>) may document significant manifestations of withdrawal. Although the validity of these scoring systems is not proven, they may provide more objective criteria for assessing infants and deciding on treatment. When pharmacological treatment is chosen, the AAP recommends that for opiate withdrawal tincture of opium is the preferred drug. For sedative-hypnotic withdrawal, phenobarbitone is the agent of choice.</P>
<P>Sedatives used for opiate withdrawal have included clonidine (an alpha2 presynaptic blocker), chlorpromazine, phenobarbitone and diazepam (<LINK REF="REF-Theis-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Theis 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-AAP-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 1998</LINK>). It may be that, by using a sedative, many infants will avoid further opiate exposure and duration of treatment will be reduced to the period of acute withdrawal.</P>
<P>The questions to be addressed by this review are: 1) what is the evidence, from randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials, that a sedative is better than control in the treatment of clinically significant NAS due to opiate withdrawal (control may be placebo, the usual management of the newborn infant or any form of non-pharmacological treatment designed to settle infant and mother, establish feeding and facilitate mother-infant interaction); and 2) what is the evidence for use of a specific sedative from trials comparing different types of sedatives. The goals of treatment should be to provide comfort to the mother and infant in relieving symptoms, and improve feeding, weight gain, prevent seizures, reduce unnecessary hospitalisation, improve mother-infant interaction and reduce the incidence of infant mortality and abnormal neurodevelopment. This is an update of a previous review (<LINK REF="REF-Osborn-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osborn 2002b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Osborn-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osborn 2005b</LINK>). A separate review (<LINK REF="REF-Osborn-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osborn 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Osborn-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osborn 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Osborn-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osborn 2010</LINK>) examines the evidence for the use of opiates in infants with NAS due to opiate withdrawal.</P>

<P>The methodological quality of each trial was assessed independently by the three authors for the 2002 review. DO assessed methodological quality for the 2010 review update. Particular emphasis was placed on allocation concealment, blinding, completeness of follow up and blinding of outcome assessment. Allocation concealment was ranked: Grade A: adequate; Grade B: uncertain; Grade C: clearly inadequate. Additional information where required was requested from authors of each trial to clarify methodology.</P>
<P>For the update in 2010, the authors assessed the risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). </P>
<P>
<B>(1) Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias)</B>
</P>
<P>For each included study, we described the method used to generate the allocation sequence in sufficient detail to allow an assessment of whether it should produce comparable groups. We assessed the method as:<BR/>&#8226; adequate (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);<BR/>&#8226; inadequate (any non random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);<BR/>&#8226; unclear.</P>
<P>
<B>(2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias)</B>
</P>
<P>For each included study, we described the method used to conceal the allocation sequence in sufficient detail and determine whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, or changed after assignment.<BR/>We assessed the methods as:<BR/>&#8226; adequate (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);<BR/>&#8226; inadequate (open random allocation; unsealed or non opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);<BR/>&#8226; unclear.</P>
<P>
<B>(3) Blinding (checking for possible performance bias)</B>
</P>
<P>For each included study, we described the methods used, if any, to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We judged studies to be at low risk of bias if they were blinded, or if we judged that the lack of blinding could not have affected the results. We assessed blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes.<BR/>We assessed the methods as:<BR/>&#8226; adequate, inadequate or unclear for participants;<BR/>&#8226; adequate, inadequate or unclear for personnel;<BR/>&#8226; adequate, inadequate or unclear for outcome assessors.</P>
<P>
<B>(4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations)</B>
</P>
<P>For each included study and for each outcome or class of outcomes, we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We stated whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes.<BR/>Where sufficient information is reported or can be supplied by the trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses. We assessed methods as:<BR/>&#8226; adequate (less than 20% missing data);<BR/>&#8226; inadequate;<BR/>&#8226; unclear.</P>
<P>
<B>(5) Outcome reporting bias</B>
</P>
<P>For each included study, we described how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found.<BR/>We assessed the methods as:<BR/>&#8226; adequate (where it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s prespecified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);<BR/>&#8226; inadequate (where not all the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);<BR/>&#8226; unclear.</P>
<P>
<B>(6) Other sources of bias</B>
</P>
<P>For each included study, we described any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias (e.g. early termination of trial due to data-dependant process, extreme baseline imbalance, etc).We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias. We assessed other sources of bias as:<BR/>&#8226; yes;<BR/>&#8226; no;<BR/>&#8226; unclear.</P>
<P>
<B>(7) Overall risk of bias</B>
</P>
<P>We made explicit judgements about whether studies are at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). With reference to (1) and (6) above, we assessed the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we consider it is likely to impact on the findings. We explored the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses - see 'Sensitivity analysis&#8217;.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Agthe-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Agthe 2009</LINK> enrolled infants born to mothers with a history of heroin or methadone use with two consecutive modified Finnegan scores &#8805; 9. Infants were treated with oral clonidine 1 &#956;g/kg every four hours (6 &#956;g/kg per day) and diluted tincture of opium (clonidine/DTO), versus opium alone (placebo/DTO). Placebo was normal saline. A standardised protocol for DTO escalation and weaning was used. DTO (0.4 mg/mL morphine equivalent) starting 0.2 mL DTO orally every four hours, incrementally escalated to 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 mL every four hours, then to 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9 mL every three hours until withdrawal symptoms (MFS &lt; 9) were controlled.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-07-13 13:37:13 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review should be considered in light of the review 'Opiate treatment for opiate withdrawal in newborn infants' (<LINK REF="REF-Osborn-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osborn 2010</LINK>). These reviews suggest that infants with NAS born to mothers using only opiates are more likely to have symptom control and less likely to have a second agent commenced if they are treated with an opiate compared to phenobarbitone or diazepam. This supports the AAP recommendation (<LINK REF="REF-AAP-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 1998</LINK>). When a sedative is considered as initial therapy, phenobarbitone in addition to supportive care has not been shown to reduce treatment failure or time to regain birthweight compared to supportive care alone. However, the duration of supportive care each day was significantly reduced. The increased duration of treatment, hospital stay and stay in the special care nursery may reflect admission policies and care practices.</P>
<P>Phenobarbitone resulted in a significant reduction in treatment failure compared to diazepam. The benefits of phenobarbitone compared to diazepam were seen both in infants of mothers using only opiates and infants of mothers using multiple drugs. Data from one study suggests that infants treated with a loading dose of phenobarbitone have a shorter time to symptom control compared to infants treated with only a titration regimen of phenobarbitone. There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of chlorpromazine for NAS due to opiate withdrawal.</P>
<P>In infants treated with an opiate, there is evidence from two studies that additional treatment with a sedative may have benefits. <LINK REF="STD-Agthe-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Agthe 2009</LINK> reported that the addition of clonidine to DTO may reduce treatment failure, although the difference is not statistically significant. The starting dose of opiate, equivalent to morphine 0.48 mg/day (not adjusted to infant weight) is relatively low. Of concern was the occurrence of adverse events in the clonidine group (one infant with a seizure, one an arrhythmia and three with post-discharge death), although none of these events were ascribed to the use of clonidine. Further trials are required to confirm the efficacy and determine safety of clonidine for treatment of NAS.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Coyle-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Coyle 2002</LINK> reported that the severity of withdrawal is reduced from use of phenobarbitone. Infants were weaned from the opiate (DTO) more quickly which allowed earlier hospital discharge and reduced hospital costs. Caution should be exercised in generalising these findings to other clinical settings. The starting dose of opiate, equivalent to morphine 0.12 to 0.16 mg/kg/day, is low. The policy of continuing hospital admission for infants treated with an opiate, but discharging home infants on phenobarbitone is not universal, making the hospitalisation and cost findings of this study applicable only to this setting. Total duration of pharmacological treatment was not measured and long term neurodevelopmental outcomes have not been published, particularly with infants treated with prolonged courses of phenobarbitone. Further trials are required that examine the effect of the addition of phenobarbitone to an opiate incorporating higher opiate dosing regimens, carried out in different clinical care settings including discharge based on psychosocial and infant care criteria rather than drug used for treatment, and incorporating long term follow up.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2010-04-28 14:03:29 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review includes studies that report random or quasi-random allocation of infants with NAS to a sedative or non-opiate control. Given the high rate of polydrug use in mothers of infants with NAS, the infants included in these studies are likely to represent the infants seen in clinical practice. However, few data are presented that differentiate response to treatment of infants of mothers using only opiates separately from those exposed to opiate using mothers with polydrug use. One study reported that treatment failure was reduced in both groups of infants with use of phenobarbitone compared to diazepam. Most studies used a standardised score to determine need for treatment and response to treatment. Few losses to follow up were reported by the individual studies, although this in some cases this could have been by omission. The studies assessing the effectiveness of a sedative (clonidine or phenobarbitone) in infants treated with an opiate used a low starting dose of opiate. This may have resulted in an increased time to control symptoms potentially resulting in an additional benefit from use of a sedative. Further studies of the addition of a sedative (either clonidine or phenobarbitone) are required in infants who are treated with a higher initial dose of opiate. Outcomes for only 385 infants enrolled in trials were reported in this review. This review has insufficient power to detect even moderate effects on infant mortality. This is especially important given the high rate of sudden unexpected death in this population of infants and the sedative and cardiovascular effects of the pharmacological treatments used.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2010-07-13 13:37:40 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Only one study was included in sensitivity analysis of studies of good methodology. This assessed the effect of the addition of clonidine to DTO versus DTO alone for NAS in infants of mothers using opiates and frequently other drugs. However, the study is inadequately powered to detect important benefits or harms from the addition of clonidine. The validity of the results is affected by the methodological quality of the included studies. Four studies used quasi-random methods of patient allocation and two studies which reported random allocation did not report method of randomisation. Several studies had large differences in group allocations. The author of two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Finnegan-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Finnegan 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaltenbach-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Kaltenbach 1986</LINK>) has communicated an interim analysis found a high incidence of adverse reactions in infants allocated diazepam so enrolment was stopped in this group. Only one study reported blinding of treatment and three blinding of measurement. The only study to differentiate infants of mothers on opiates from those born to mothers on an opiate and another drug did not pre-specify this comparison. No study reported quality of mother infant interaction, success of breast feeding, incidence of foster care or neurodevelopmental outcome (according to group of allocation). Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Finnegan-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Finnegan 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaltenbach-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Kaltenbach 1986</LINK>) may have reported overlapping infant groups. The data for the same outcomes of these studies were not combined in meta-analysis. In view of these limitations, the conclusions of this review should be treated with caution.</P>

<P>In view of the findings of the review, "Opiate treatment for opiate withdrawal in newborn infants" (<LINK REF="REF-Osborn-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osborn 2010</LINK>), infants with NAS due to opiate withdrawal should receive initial treatment with an opiate. Where a sedative is used, then phenobarbitone should be used in preference to diazepam. In infants treated with an opiate, the addition of phenobarbitone or clonidine may reduce withdrawal severity. However, the initial dose of opiate was relatively low in both studies. There is insufficient evidence to confirm safety and efficacy of clonidine. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of chlorpromazine in newborn infants with NAS. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-09-23 19:09:43 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further studies are needed to determine the role of sedatives in infants with NAS due to opiate withdrawal. Further, large studies of the addition of phenobarbitone or clonidine in infants treated with an opiate for NAS are needed. Consideration should be given to incorporating higher initial dosing schedules of opiate and studies should report long term outcomes. Current data are insufficient to guide the use of chlorpromazine. Studies should measure effects on infant symptoms and severity of withdrawal, quality of mother-infant interaction, growth and long term development. Trials in infants with NAS should stratify randomisation by drug of exposure of infant. </P>

<P>Clonidine This group of infants undergoing NAS will be treated with neonatal morphine sulphate and Clonidine as an adjunct medication to control the symptoms. Once stable Finnegan scores &lt;8 for 24h, NMS will be weaned by 10% daily till off, then Clonidine will be weaned off in a stepwise manner. Infant will not go home on any medication for NAS. NMS will be dosed as mg/kd/day divided q3h and Clonidine will be dosed as microgm/kg/day divided q6h based upon the initial Finnegan scores.</P>
<P>Phenobarbital Infants in this arm will be treated as current standard practice with NMS and Phenobarbital. NMS will be weaned by 10% daily to completely off during the hospital stay. Infants will be discharged home on Phenobarbital.NMS will be dosed as mg/kg/day divided q3h and Phenobarbital will be dosed as mg/kg/day divided q8h based on the Finnegan scores.</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2010-08-06 01:06:39 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Primary aim is to compare the length of NAS treatment with NMS in the two study groups - NMS/C versus NMS/P.</P>
<P>Secondary aims are to compare the total dosage of NMS, total length of hospital stay for NAS treatment, treatment failures,adverse effect profiles and neurobehavioral assessment scores (NBAS)for the two study groups. We hypothesize that clonidine when compared to phenobarbital as an adjunct therapy, will have shorter length of stay, with fewer treatment failures and side effects.</P>
