<P>
<B>Review question</B>
<BR/>This review assessed the use of yoga as a treatment for control of epilepsy.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
<BR/>Epilepsy is a disorder in which recurrent seizures are caused by abnormal electrical discharges in the brain. Most seizures can be controlled by antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) but sometimes seizures develop which are resistant to those drugs. People may also wish to try non-drug treatments such as yoga. Between 25% and 40% of people with epilepsy treated with AEDs have uncontrolled seizures, experience adverse effects from medication, suffer from stigmatisation and have a higher degree of psychiatric disorders as compared with people with other chronic illnesses. For those who have epilepsy and related problems it is important to develop, evaluate, and implement a complementary treatment model in the everyday treatment of epilepsy.</P>
<P>Yoga, an integral part of Indian culture and heritage, is said to bestow good health &#65293; physical, mental and spiritual &#65293; on the practitioner. There are various types of yoga involving postural exercises (asanas), breath control (pranayama) and meditation. In one study, the practice of Sahaja yoga, a simple form of meditation, reduced seizures and EEG changes in people with epilepsy. The effect of meditation was attributed to a reduction in the level of stress as evidenced by changes in skin resistance and levels of blood lactate and urinary vanillylmandelic acid.</P>
<P>
<B>Results</B>
<BR/>For this update, we did not identify any new studies to add, and thus the conclusions remain unchanged. The review included two unblinded randomised controlled trials (RCTs) recruiting a total of 50 participants (adults) with refractory epilepsy and comparing any type of classical Indian yoga to the control groups receiving no intervention or interventions such as yoga-mimicking exercises or Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. Antiepileptic drugs were continued in all the participants. The outcomes assessed were: percentage of people rendered seizure free; seizure frequency and duration; and quality of life. Results of the overall efficacy analysis show that yoga treatment was better when compared with no intervention or interventions other than yoga, but no reliable conclusions can be drawn regarding the efficacy of yoga as a treatment for uncontrolled epilepsy. The yoga group showed significant improvement in their quality of life according to the Satisfaction With Life Scale. Blinding may reduce the observer bias. Physician blinding may be achieved with the outcomes being assessed by a physician who is not involved in the trial. Participant blinding may not be possible, since it would be easy to distinguish whether the intervention given is yoga or not. It would be ideal if the seizure records are maintained by a blinded observer. Seizure frequency outcomes should preferably be expressed as the proportion of individuals seizure free or proportion with more than 50% reduction in seizure frequency, since mean values of seizure frequency are often skewed and difficult to analyse. Seizure duration may be measured in seconds or minutes (per episode or month). Validated quality-of-life measures (disease specific) may indicate whether there is overall improvement in the quality of life as a result of the intervention, besides seizure control.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusions</B>
<BR/>No reliable conclusions can be drawn at present regarding the efficacy of yoga as a treatment for epilepsy. In addition, quality of the evidence to inform outcomes is limited and of low quality. Yoga can be considered as a complex intervention, similar to other forms of complementary and alternative treatments. Yoga can only be an add-on to AEDs at the present time and cannot be used as the sole method of intervention. Finally, no reliable evidence was found to support the use of yoga and further trials are needed.</P>
<P>The evidence is current to 3 January 2017.</P>

<P>The following study designs were eligible for inclusion: randomised controlled trials (RCT) of treatment of epilepsy with yoga. The studies could be double-, single- or unblinded.

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-06-28 09:50:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed the trials for inclusion and extracted data. The following outcomes were assessed: (a) percentage of people rendered seizure free; (b) seizure frequency and duration; (c) quality of life. Analyses were on an intention-to-treat basis.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-06-28 09:50:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We did not identify any new studies for this update, therefore the results are unchanged.</P>
<P>For the previous version of the review, the authors found two unblinded trials in people with refractory epilepsy. In total these two studies included 50 people (18 treated with yoga and 32 to control interventions). Antiepileptic drugs were continued in all the participants. Baseline phase lasted three months in both studies and treatment phase from five weeks to six months in the two trials. Randomisation was by roll of a die in one study and using a computerised randomisation table in the other one but neither study provided details of concealment of allocation and were rated as unclear risk of bias. Overall, the two studies were rated as low risk of bias (all participants were included in the analysis; all expected and pre-expected outcomes were reported; no other sources of bias).</P>
<P>The overall ORs with 95% CI were as follows: (i) seizure free for six months &#8212; for yoga versus sham yoga the OR was 14.54 (95% CI 0.67 to 316.69) and for yoga versus 'no treatment' group it was 17.31 (95% CI 0.80 to 373.45); for Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) versus yoga the OR was 1.00 (95% Cl 0.16 to 6.42); (ii) reduction in seizure frequency &#8212; the mean difference between yoga versus sham yoga group was &#8722;2.10 (95% CI &#8722;3.15 to &#8722;1.05) and for yoga versus 'no treatment' group it was &#8722;1.10 (95% CI &#8722;1.80 to &#8722;0.40); (iii) more than 50% reduction in seizure frequency &#8212; for yoga versus sham yoga group, OR was 81.00 (95% CI 4.36 to 1504.46) and for the yoga versus 'no treatment' group it was 158.33 (95% CI 5.78 to 4335.63); ACT versus yoga OR was 0.78 (95% Cl 0.04 to 14.75); (iv) more than 50% reduction in seizure duration &#8212; for yoga versus sham yoga group OR was 45.00 (95% CI 2.01 to 1006.75) and for yoga versus 'no treatment' group it was 53.57 (95% CI 2.42 to 1187.26); ACT versus yoga OR was 0.67 (95% Cl 0.10 to 4.35).</P>
<P>In addition in <A HREF="Panjwani 1996">Panjwani 1996</A> the authors reported that the one-way analysis of variance revealed no statistically significant differences between the three groups. A P-Lambda test taking into account the P values between the three groups also indicated that the duration of epilepsy in the three groups was not comparable. No data were available regarding quality of life. In <A HREF="Lundgren 2008">Lundgren 2008</A> the authors reported that there was no significant difference between the yoga and ACT groups in seizure-free rates, 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency or seizure duration at one-year follow-up. The yoga group showed significant improvement in their quality of life according to the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS) (P &lt; 0.05), while the ACT group had significant improvement in the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF) scale (P &lt; 0.01).</P>
<P>Overall, we assessed the quality of evidence as low; no reliable conclusions can be drawn at present regarding the efficacy of yoga as a treatment for epilepsy.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-06-28 09:50:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A study of 50 subjects with epilepsy from two trials reveals a possible beneficial effect in control of seizures. Results of the overall efficacy analysis show that yoga treatment was better when compared with no intervention or interventions other than yoga (postural exercises mimicking yoga). There was no difference between yoga and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. However no reliable conclusions can be drawn regarding the efficacy of yoga as a treatment for uncontrolled epilepsy, in view of methodological deficiencies such as limited number of studies, limited number of participants randomised to yoga, lack of blinding and limited data on quality-of-life outcome. Physician blinding would normally be taken to be the person delivering the intervention, whereas we think the 'physician' would in fact be the outcome assessor (who could be blinded), so that would be a reduction in detection bias rather than performance bias. In addition, evidence to inform outcomes is limited and of low quality. Further high-quality research is needed to fully evaluate the efficacy of yoga for refractory epilepsy.</P>
<P>Since we did not find any new studies, our conclusions remain unchanged.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-10-03 15:14:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review is an update of a previously published review in the <I>Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews</I> (Issue 5, 2015).</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-10-03 14:45:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Epilepsy is a condition characterised by a tendency for recurrent seizures unprovoked by any known proximate insult. Epileptiform discharges involve either a localised area of the brain resulting in a partial seizure; or the entire brain resulting in a generalised seizure. The prevalence of epilepsy is estimated to be five to eight per 1000 population in developed countries, and in adults the most common type is partial epilepsy (<LINK REF="REF-Forsgren-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forsgren 2005</LINK>). The majority of people given a diagnosis of epilepsy have a good prognosis, and their seizures will be controlled by treatment with a single antiepileptic drug (AED), but up to 30% do not have remission despite appropriate therapy with AEDs (<LINK REF="REF-Kwan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kwan 2000</LINK>). These people tend to have frequent, disabling seizures that limit their ability to work and participate in activities. Many of these people also suffer from the chronic effects of long-term, high-dose AED polytherapy. People who have seizures more frequently have psychiatric disorders like anxiety, depression and low quality of life as compared with those with other chronic illness. The stigmatisation problems associated with epilepsy are well documented and can be linked to a number of factors, including under-resourced medical seizures, poor seizure control and inadequate knowledge of epilepsy (<LINK REF="REF-Jacoby-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacoby 2002</LINK>). The development of effective therapies for the treatment of uncontrolled epilepsy is therefore of considerable importance.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-10-03 14:46:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Yoga is a traditional Indian discipline and way of life which gives the practitioner a "healthy body and a sound mind" and is believed to alleviate stress and induce relaxation (<LINK REF="REF-Anand-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anand 1991</LINK>). The word 'yoga' is probably derived from the Sanskrit word 'Yug' which means 'controlling the mind'. The commonly performed yogic practices include breathing exercises (pranayama), postures (asanas), devotional sessions and meditation (dhyana). Many branches of yoga have been described such as Hatha yoga, Karma yoga, Bhakti yoga and Raja yoga. Transcendental Meditation, which is widely practised, employs a single-stage meditation during which the individual sits quietly with eyes closed for 20 minutes twice a day and mentally repeats a specifically chosen Sanskrit word or mantra (<LINK REF="REF-Corby-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corby 1978</LINK>). In Sahaja yoga, the practitioners sit in a relaxed posture with hands in front, palms upwards. They are asked to direct attention to a picture placed in front of them, with a candle lit before it. Gradually when their thoughts recede, they close their eyes and may direct their attention at the 'sahasrara chakra' or top of the head. The individual sits in meditation for about 10 to 15 minutes. It is believed that Sahaja yoga awakens the kundalini (dormant divine energy in our body) and corrects physical, mental and emotional disorders (<LINK REF="STD-Gupta-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 1991</LINK>). Sahaja yoga is a simple technique of meditation which is practised easily by any individual, without the use of instruments. It has been found beneficial for stress reduction in people with epilepsy (<LINK REF="REF-Panjwani-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Panjwani 1995</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-10-03 15:14:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Behavioural methods are currently being tried for seizure reduction since some people with epilepsy do not achieve seizure control despite regular and adequate medication. Research suggesting that behavioural treatments can influence the seizure process is substantial (<LINK REF="REF-Lundgren-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lundgren 2006</LINK>; Ramaratnam 2001).

Yoga has been demonstrated to increase quality of life and decrease psychiatric problems for those who have epilepsy (<LINK REF="STD-Yardi-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Yardi 2001</LINK>). Stress is a well-recognised risk factor for seizures in people with epilepsy (<LINK REF="REF-Temkin-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Temkin 1984</LINK>); and the efficacy of yoga in stress reduction has been documented (<LINK REF="REF-Panjwani-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Panjwani 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schell-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schell 1994</LINK>).

Yoga may have an effect on the probability of seizure occurrence because of the effect it has on brain wave activity and arousal level. Research shows that sudden changes in cortical activity and arousal level affect the probability of seizure occurrence. Other authors suggest that yoga training stimulates the vagus nerve, and stimulation of the vagus nerve has been shown to decrease seizure frequency by 28% to 38% (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2005</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-03-30 10:52:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For this review we summarise evidence from randomised controlled trials where the efficacy of yoga has been investigated for people with uncontrolled epilepsy. The aim was to evaluate the effects of yoga on seizure frequency and on quality of life. Yoga would be an attractive therapeutic option for epilepsy (if proven effective) in view of its non-pharmacological nature, minimal adverse effects and international acceptance.</P>

We discussed and resolved disagreements. We completed a 'Risk of bias' table for each included study in Review Manager 5 (RevMan 5).

<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Panjwani-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Panjwani 1996</LINK> study, 4 out of the 10 participants given Sahaja yoga were seizure free for the duration of the six months' treatment period, compared to none out of 10 in the sham yoga group and none out of 12 in the 'no treatment' control group. This gives odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (Cls) of 14.54 (95% CI 0.67 to 316.69) for the yoga versus sham yoga groups; and 17.31 (95% CI 0.80 to 373.45) for yoga versus 'no treatment' control groups (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Lundgren-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lundgren 2008</LINK> study, comparing Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) versus yoga, 5 of the 10 participants in the ACT group and 4 of the 8 participants in the yoga group were seizure free at the end of the trial (12-month follow-up). This gives ORs with 95% CIs of 1.00 (95% CI 0.16 to 6.42) for yoga versus ACT (see <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Reduction in seizure frequency</HEADING>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Panjwani-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Panjwani 1996</LINK> trial the number of seizures per month in the three different groups are shown in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. Control group III (no treatment) has differing baseline seizure frequency compared to groups I and II which is statistically significant (group I versus group III t = 2.25, P = 0.043). The mean difference (95% CIs in seizure frequency after six months) for group I (Sahaja yoga) versus group II (sham yoga) was &#8722;2.10 (95% CI &#8722;3.15 to &#8722;1.05) and for group I versus group III &#8722;1.10 (95% CI &#8722;1.80 to &#8722;0.40). The reduction in seizure frequency in group I was found to be statistically significant (P &lt; 0.001) compared to the baseline frequency (0 month) (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>).</P>

<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Panjwani-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Panjwani 1996</LINK> study more than 50% reduction in seizure frequency was found in 9 out of the 10 participants practising Sahaja yoga but only in 1 out of the 10 on sham yoga and none of the 12 untreated controls.

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Lundgren-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lundgren 2008</LINK>, comparing ACT versus yoga, found 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency in 9 of 10 participants in the ACT group and 7 of 8 participants in the yoga group.

<P>Since publication of the previous version of this review, we found no new studies that met the selection criteria for this review.</P>
<P>In the previous review, only two studies met the selection criteria. We were not able to combine the results of the two studies, since the comparison arms were different. In these randomised controlled trials the number of individuals treated was small. These methodological flaws make the results very difficult to interpret. In the <LINK REF="STD-Panjwani-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Panjwani 1996</LINK> study the authors reported that the one-way analysis of variance revealed no statistically significant differences between the three groups. However, by a modified t-test the differences were found to be statistically significant between group I and group III, both for seizure duration (t = 2.457, P = 0.023) and seizure frequency (t = 2.247, P = 0.043). A P-Lambda test taking into account the P values between the three groups also indicated that the duration of epilepsy in the three groups was not comparable. No data were available regarding quality of life. In <LINK REF="STD-Lundgren-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lundgren 2008</LINK> the authors reported that there was no significant difference between the yoga and ACT groups in seizure-free rates: 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency or seizure duration at one year follow-up. The yoga group showed significant improvement in their quality of life according to the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS) (P &lt; 0.05), while the Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) group had significant improvement in the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF) scale (P &lt; 0.01).</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-06-28 09:53:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Only two studies look at yoga for epilepsy with 50 participants in total. The participants would be those whose seizures are not controlled with AEDs alone or those who require high doses of AEDs with attendant side effects. Individuals who are not suitable for epilepsy surgery and those who refuse further attempts to find a successful medical therapy may also be candidates for a trial of yoga. Individuals with single seizure or infrequent seizures are unlikely to be suitable candidates since it is difficult to demonstrate a treatment effect in them. The participants should have sufficient time and motivation to continue yoga on a daily basis. They must have sufficient time to commute to the centre for learning yoga, which may be almost daily in the initial stages, and subsequently practise yoga for a minimum of 20 to 30 minutes daily at home. The number of participants enrolled should be sufficient to allow reliable conclusions. There may be a need for a multi-centre study to recruit a sufficient number of participants. In case of a multi-centre study, it would be essential to standardise the interventions. Enrolling individuals from different cultural backgrounds will allow investigation of the effect of cultural bias. It needs to be ascertained whether the participants' inherent belief in yoga or the skills and personality of the yoga instructor contribute to the outcome. Serum levels of AEDs need to be monitored to ensure that the observed results are not due to the variation in serum levels of AEDs. Consent for randomisation to a placebo-controlled study may be difficult, leading to refusal to participate in the study, more so if the controls have to report to the centre at the same time as the intervention group and go back without receiving any treatment. To overcome this, financial incentives may need to be given to the participants. It is possible that the individuals receiving financial incentives may try to please the co-ordinator of the study with favourable results. Alternatively, the controls may be given the intervention after the study period is over (deferred treatment group). It may be difficult to ensure the compliance of the person (whether he or she practises yoga at home regularly).</P>

<P>
<I>
<B>Type of participants and interventions: </B>
</I>The following controversial issues in participant selection and intervention need to be addressed.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Can any modifications be made to AEDs during the period of study? If so, it may be difficult to assess whether the beneficial results are due to the intervention or due to changes in the medical treatment. It may be preferable to include only individuals whose AED regimen has been stable and is unlikely to require modifications during the study period.</LI>
<LI>Which type of seizures or epilepsy to choose for the study? Should people with any type of epilepsy be included or individuals with a specific homogenous syndrome such as juvenile myoclonic epilepsy be chosen? It may be difficult to recruit sufficient numbers of individuals if the study is confined to a specific type of seizure or epilepsy syndrome.</LI>
<LI>Which type of yoga to use? There are many types of yoga. The existing studies have utilised Sahaja yoga, Hatha yoga and Transcendental Meditation. Until more data are available, the choice of the type of yoga used as an intervention is likely to be empirical.</LI>
<LI>What interventions should be given to controls? If no intervention is given to controls, it will be difficult to decide if the benefit is due to the intervention itself or due to the additional attention given to the yoga group (attention bias). Hence it may be necessary to have an attention control group by giving sham yoga or exercises mimicking yoga. Even if the controls are asked to come and sit quietly in one place, the accompanying relaxation may give beneficial results.</LI>
<LI>Should participants be used as their own controls and the seizure frequency before and after intervention be compared? This would be an additional outcome measure, though subject to bias.</LI>
</OL>
<P>A cross-over study will be difficult since individuals may continue with yoga even after completion of the treatment phase.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Methods: </B>
</I>Randomisation is essential to eliminate selection bias. The ideal method would be by telephone with computer-generated random lists. Consecutively numbered, sealed opaque envelopes would be less expensive, although it is possible that they may be prematurely opened and a bias introduced. Blinding may reduce the observer bias. Physician blinding may be achieved with the outcomes being assessed by a physician who is not involved in the trial. Participant blinding may not be possible, since it would be easy to distinguish whether the intervention given is yoga or not. It would be ideal if the seizure records are maintained by a blinded observer. It would require a lot of co-operation from the individual not to disclose the nature of intervention to the observer, who in most cases would be a parent or spouse or a close family member.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Outcome measures: </B>
</I>Reliable maintenance of seizure records will require a close family member, since the individual may not be aware of the episodes. Records of seizure frequency may be inaccurate since seizures occurring during sleep or abortive seizures occurring when the individual is outdoors may not be recorded. Seizure frequency outcomes should preferably be expressed as the proportion of individuals seizure-free or the proportion with more than 50% reduction in seizure frequency, since mean values of seizure frequency are often skewed and difficult to analyse.</P>
<P>Seizure duration may be measured in seconds or minutes (per episode or month). Validity of records of seizure duration maintained by unblinded observers may be questioned. Seizure severity scales may be more sensitive indicators of a treatment effect than seizure frequency data. Validated quality of life measures (disease specific) may indicate whether there is overall improvement in quality of life as a result of the intervention, besides seizure control. Dropouts from the study may cause an attrition bias. The reason for dropout, e.g. whether it is due to lack of efficacy or time constraints or lack of motivation, would be helpful in assessing the true efficacy.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Analysis: </B>
</I>The type of analysis that should be undertaken is controversial. An intention-to-treat analysis includes all participants allocated to an intervention, irrespective of whether they actually followed the intervention or not. This would give a pragmatic estimate of the benefit, if a policy is taken to implement the intervention for treatment of epilepsy rather than the potential benefit in individuals who receive treatment exactly as planned. A per protocol analysis may overestimate the actual efficacy of the intervention. When the reason for dropout from the study is not clear, a worst case and best case scenario can be calculated based on the following assumptions: (a) all those not completing the follow-up are non-responders in the intervention group and responders in the control group (worst case); and (b) individuals not completing the follow-up are responders in the intervention group and non-responders in the control group (best case). Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are estimators for categorical data such as the proportion of individuals seizure-free or 50% responders, while the mean difference and 95% CI may be used for continuous data such as mean seizure frequency.<BR/>

<P>No reliable conclusions can be drawn at present regarding the efficacy of yoga as a treatment for epilepsy. The complexity of the yoga intervention is similar to other forms of complementary and alternative treatments.

<LI>A study with a much larger number of participants is needed to clarify the efficacy or lack of efficacy of yoga in the treatment of epilepsy.

<P>
<U>Primary Outcome Measures</U>: Change in Neurological Disorders Depression Inventory for Epilepsy (NDDI-E) [Time Frame: Change from Week 4 to Week 12]. The NDDI-E is a 6-item questionnaire. Scores for each question range from 1 (never) to 4 (all the time). There is a maximum score of 24. The higher the score the more severe the depression.<BR/>
<U>Secondary Outcome Measures</U>: Change in Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale [Time Frame: Change from Week 4 to Week 12]. The GAD-7 is a 7-item questionnaire. Scores for each question range from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). There is a maximum score of 21. The higher the score the more severe the anxiety. A score over 15 represents severe anxiety. A score under 10 may indicate GAD and would prompt further examination.<BR/>Change in Quality of Life in Epilepsy-Patient-Weighted (QOLIE-31-p) [Time Frame: Change from Baseline to Week 12]. The QOLIE-31-p is a 38-item questionnaire. Scores range from 0 to 100. Higher scores relate to higher distress.<BR/>Frequency of seizures [Time Frame: Week 12]. Count of seizures in study subjects.</P>
