<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Psychological treatments compared with treatment as usual for obsessive compulsive disorder</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic and disabling anxiety disorder characterised by recurrent obsessions, such as persistent thoughts, impulses or mental images, that promote anxiety, together with compulsions, such as repetitive behaviours or mental acts, that are performed in response to the obsessions. Currently the most commonly used therapies for OCD are pharmacological therapies, followed by psychotherapies, particularly cognitive behavioural approaches. We reviewed studies that compared psychological interventions to treatment as usual groups who either received no treatment, or were on a waiting list for treatment or received usual care. We found eight studies, which together suggested that cognitive and/or behavioural treatments were better than treatment as usual conditions at reducing clinical symptoms. Baseline OCD severity and depressive symptom level predicted the degree of response. However, the conclusions were based on a small number of randomised controlled trials with small sample sizes. There were no trials of other forms of psychological treatment such as psychodynamic therapy and client-centred therapy, and a lack of available evidence for the long-term effectiveness of psychological treatments.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic anxiety disorder associated with significant morbidity, social impairment and lower quality of life. Psychological treatments are a frequently used approach for OCD. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To perform a systematic review of randomised trials of psychological treatments for obsessive compulsive disorder in comparison with treatment as usual. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We conducted an electronic search of CCDANCTR-Studies (31/10/2006), and other databases. We searched reference lists, and contacted experts in the field.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Published and unpublished randomised trials of psychological treatments versus treatment as usual for adults with a diagnosis of OCD </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two review authors worked independently throughout the selection of trials and data extraction. Findings were compared and disagreements were discussed with a third review author. Full data extraction, using a standardised data extraction sheet, was performed on all studies included in the review. Results were synthesised using Review Manager software. For dichotomous data, odds ratios were calculated. For continuous data, effect sizes were obtained and the standardised mean difference, with 95% confidence intervals, was calculated. Fixed and random effects models were used to pool the data. Reasons for heterogeneity in studies were explored and sensitivity analyses were performed by excluding trials of lower quality. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Eight studies (11 study comparisons) were identified, all of which compared cognitive and/or behavioural treatments versus treatment as usual control groups. Seven studies (ten comparisons) had usable data for meta-analyses. These studies demonstrated that patients receiving any variant of cognitive behavioural treatment exhibited significantly fewer symptoms post-treatment than those receiving treatment as usual (SMD -1.24, 95% CI -1.61 to -0.87, I test for heterogeneity 33.4%). Different types of cognitive and/or behavioural treatments showed similar differences in effect when compared with treatment as usual. The overall treatment effect appeared to be influenced by differences in baseline severity.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The findings of this review suggest that psychological treatments derived from cognitive behavioural models are an effective treatment for adult patients with obsessive compulsive disorder. Larger high quality randomised controlled trials involving longer follow up periods are needed, to further test cognitive behavioural treatments, and other psychological approaches, in comparison to each other and control conditions. Future trials should examine the predictors of response to each treatment, and also conduct cost-effectiveness evaluations.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Obsessive compulsive disorder is a chronic anxiety disorder, with the onset occurring typically in adolescence or early adulthood (<LINK REF="REF-Stein-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stein 1997</LINK>), and has an incidence slightly higher in women (<LINK REF="REF-Weissman-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weissman 1994</LINK>). It is the fourth most prevalent psychiatric disorder, with a high comorbidity with other anxiety and mood disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Stein-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stein 2002</LINK>). Epidemiological studies have reported life time prevalence rates ranging approximately from 2% to 3% of the general population (<LINK REF="REF-Karno-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karno 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saasson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saasson 1997</LINK>). In the last decade the frequency of diagnosis of obsessive compulsive disorder has increased, and at the same time a relevant number of research studies concerning the disorder have been carried out (<LINK REF="REF-Stoll-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 1992</LINK>). Corresponding to this, there has also been considerable growth in the treatment literature on childhood and adolescent obsessive compulsive disorder, and this is of particular significance as current estimates of the onset of OCD in childhood and adolescence are as high as 80%.</P>
<P>OCD is characterized by recurrent obsessions, such as persistent thoughts, impulses or mental images, that promote anxiety, and uncontrolled compulsions such as repetitive behaviours or mental acts that are performed in response to the obsessions with the intent of reducing anxiety. Obsessions are often related to thoughts about contamination and typical compulsions are cleaning, washing, praying, counting or checking the same things many times in a pathological way (<LINK REF="REF-Hawton-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawton 2003</LINK>). OCD is associated with significant morbidity and substantial impairment, including severely affected quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Stein-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stein 2000</LINK>). Obsessions and compulsions are time consuming, cause marked distress and can significantly interfere with normal daily routine and occupational functioning (<LINK REF="REF-Goodman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodman 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Pharmacological and psychological treatments are the two most frequently used treatments approaches. Pharmacological treatment aims to regulate the serotonin transmission based on the neurobiological model of the etiology of OCD (<LINK REF="REF-Rauch-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rauch 1993</LINK>). Positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging have shown increased glucose metabolism in the orbital frontal cortex, caudate nuclei, and anterior cingulate regions of the brain in obsessive-compulsive patients. Empirical research indicates that psychological treatments such as cognitive behavioural therapy are as effective as antidepressants in causing adaptive regional brain metabolic changes correlated with symptomatic improvement in patients with OCD (<LINK REF="REF-Baxter-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baxter 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Antidepressive medications with potent serotonergic properties such as clomipramine and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) are known to be effective in improving OCD symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Ellingrod-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ellingrod 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Piccinelli-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Piccinelli 1995</LINK>). A separate Cochrane review is examining the effectiveness of SSRIs versus placebo for OCD which is expected to be published in 2007 (<LINK REF="REF-Soomro-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soomro 2006</LINK>). </P>
<P>In general medical and psychiatric settings, antidepressants are commonly the first line of treatment, nevertheless some patients may not be compliant with medications or may not respond to pharmacological treatment. Of those who do respond to antidepressants, some do not experience complete remission of symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Hollander-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hollander 2002</LINK>). Psychoanalytic treatment for obsessive compulsive neurosis, as outlined by Freud, aimed to resolve predominantly subconscious or unconscious conflicts. Traditional psychoanalytic and psychodynamic psychotherapy were for many years the only psychological treatment approach used to treat this problem, but to date there is a dearth of controlled data supporting the use of psychoanalytic treatment in terms of change in the obsessional thoughts or the ritualistic behaviour. </P>
<P>Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) was the first psychological treatment for which an empirical support was obtained. According to the cognitive behavioural model, OCD develops as a result of the occurrence of intrusive thoughts, which are experienced as threatening and which involve an exaggerated sense of personal responsibility (<LINK REF="REF-Foster-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foster 2001</LINK>). Individuals with OCD use maladaptive strategies such as worry and self-punishment to control their unpleasant thoughts (<LINK REF="REF-Abramowitz-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abramowitz 2002</LINK>). They attempt to avoid obsessions by keeping away from situations or objects which trigger them and when, despite avoidance, obsessions occur, they engage in compulsive behaviours which terminate the exposure to the feared thoughts and situations and provide a temporary anxiety relief (<LINK REF="REF-Hawton-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawton 2003</LINK>). Based on this theory, the most widely investigated cognitive-behavioural treatment is exposure and response prevention (<LINK REF="REF-Deacon-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deacon 2004</LINK>). The treatment involves exposing patients to all previously avoided situations and feared stimuli, while encouraging them to block any behaviours which prevent or terminate the exposure. This therapy is collaborative and the treatment plan is negotiated with the patient by agreeing short-, medium-, and long-term targets. Intensive cognitive behaviour therapy models have also been developed and have proved effective in treating pediatric OCD (<LINK REF="REF-Storch-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Storch 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Specific cognitive treatments may also have a role in the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder. Recent cognitive models of OCD propose that obsessional problems derive from the particular way in which the intrusive thoughts are interpreted (<LINK REF="REF-Rachman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rachman 1998</LINK>). When intrusions are interpreted as indicating increased personal responsibility for harm, or more specifically as equivalent to actions, this causes marked distress and the occurrence of neutralising behaviour. The cognitive therapy aims to change important belief domains, such as inflated responsibility for harm, excessive concern about the importance of controlling thoughts, thought-action fusion, overestimation of threat, intolerance of uncertainty, and beliefs about the consequences of anxiety and capacity to cope (<LINK REF="REF-Salkovskis-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salkovskis 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Salkovskis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salkovskis 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steketee-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steketee 1998</LINK>). </P>
<P>In practice, it is difficult to differentiate between cognitive, behavioural and "cognitive-behavioural" treatments, and there is much overlap in terms of their procedures. There has been extensive development in cognitive-behavioural approaches, which integrate the cognitive restructuring approach of cognitive therapy with the behavioural modification techniques of behavioural therapy, in various individual and group formats, and in many different contexts, ranging from home computer-aided self-treatment through to treatment in an intensive care unit (<LINK REF="REF-Bachofen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bachofen 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Falls_x002d_Stewart-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Falls-Stewart 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kirkby-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirkby 2000</LINK>). Significant literature is developing in intensive CBT which appears to be a very promising mode of psychological treatment for obsessive compulsive disorder. An existing Cochrane review of cognitive-behavioural therapy/behaviour therapy in childhood OCD found that when compared to a wait-list or pill placebo, cognitive-behavioural therapy/behaviour therapy is an effective treatment for reducing OCD symptoms and lowering the risk of having OCD after treatment (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Kearney-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Kearney 2006</LINK>). Psychological treatments such as relaxation training or anxiety management are also occasionally used to relieve OCD symptoms, but have not been shown to be effective (<LINK REF="REF-Greist-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greist 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lindsay-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindsay 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>A systematic review adhering to the Cochrane Collaboration guidelines was undertaken to appraise and summarise evidence examining the effectiveness of psychological treatments compared with treatment as usual in an adult population. This review is one in a series of reviews of psychological treatments for OCD.</P>

<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>
<B>1. Electronic searches</B>
<BR/>a) The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety &amp; Neurosis Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR-Studies) was searched on 31/10/2006 using the following terms: <BR/>Diagnosis = Obsess* <BR/>and <BR/>Intervention = *Therapy</P>
<P>The following additional databases were searched to check the completeness of CCDANCTR-Studies: <BR/>1. EMBASE (1980-2006)<BR/>2. MEDLINE (1966-2006)<BR/>3. CINAHL (1982-2006)<BR/>4. PsycINFO (1974-2006)<BR/>5. Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Cochrane Library, 2006, Issue 4)<BR/>The optimal sensitive search strategy of the Cochrane Collaboration was used to isolate randomised controlled trials. The following search terms were used to search MEDLINE and were modified as necessary for other databases: "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder", "Obsessive Behavior" and "Psychotherapy".</P>
<P>b) We searched for ongoing studies at Clinicaltrials.gov and controlled-trials.com.</P>

<B>3. Experts in the field</B>
<BR/>Experts in the field were contacted to identify trials, either published or unpublished.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>4. Reference lists</B>
<BR/>Reference lists of retrieved studies and reviews were searched.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Tables were used to display characteristics of eligible trials. Excluded trials were listed with the reasons for exclusion. Outcomes were also presented graphically.</P>
<P>
<B>Selection of studies</B>
<BR/>Two review authors (IG and HM) separately screened the titles and abstracts of all publications obtained by the search strategy. For articles that were possible RCTs within the scope of this review, the full article was obtained and inspected by each review author to assess their relevance to this review based on the criteria for inclusion. Disagreements were discussed and if there were still doubts, a third review author was consulted.<BR/>

</B>A standardised data extraction sheet was used by the review authors to collect data on methods, participants, intervention, adherence to treatment, outcome measurements and other relevant results of the studies, to provide a detailed descriptive analysis. The data were then entered using Review Manager software. Data were independently extracted by two review authors (IG and HM). Any disagreement was discussed with a third review author. In cases where inadequate information was available from the papers, the trial authors were contacted and asked for the additional information. Where no further usable data were provided, studies were not included and were listed as excluded due to missing data</P>
<P>
<B>Data analysis</B>
<BR/>
<B>
<I>Dichotomous and continuous data<BR/>
</I>
</B>Dichotomous outcomes were pooled using odds ratios. Relative risks were also calculated. For continuous outcomes, two methods were used for pooling data. Where all trials measured an outcome using the same scales and where the mean, standard deviation and sample size in each group were known, mean differences (MD) were calculated. Where some of the trials measured outcomes on different scales and it was not considered appropriate to directly combine data from these measures, the standardised mean difference (SMD) was calculated. Both dichotomous and continuous outcomes were presented with 95% confidence intervals.</P>
<P>Results were pooled using both a random effects and fixed effect analysis. Where the estimate of the between-study variance is zero, the two models will provide the same estimates and confidence intervals. Where statistical heterogeneity was observed, the random effects model was used, as it provides a more conservative estimate of treatment effect.<BR/>

<I>Unit of analysis issues</I>
</B>
<B>
<BR/>
</B>When dealing with studies with more than one active treatment arm and one control group, the n of the control group was split equally across comparisons, and the same mean and SD were used in each comparison (Hardy, personal communication).</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Heterogeneity<BR/>
</I>
</B>Statistical heterogeneity in the results of the trials was assessed both by inspection of graphical presentations and by conducting a formal test for statistical heterogeneity using the chi-square test and the I-squared test. Possible reasons for clinical heterogeneity were:<BR/>1. the type of intervention offered (individual or group modality)<BR/>2. the severity of symptoms at baseline (Y-BOCS &#8804; 24 or &gt;24)<BR/>3. the number of psychological therapy sessions offered (&#8804;14 or &gt;14)<BR/>4. the proportion of participants being on psychotropic medication (&#8804;30% or &gt;30%)<BR/>Clinical heterogeneity was explored by looking at separate subgroups of trials.<BR/>
<B>
<I>
<BR/>Missing data<BR/>
</I>
</B>For dichotomous outcomes, all exclusions/dropouts were identified. If no information was available (either from the report or the authors), it was assumed that dropout was due to treatment failure in accordance with ITT principles. The sensitivity of the results to this assumption was tested. For studies using continuous outcomes in which SDs were not reported, and no information was available from the study authors, an SD was imputed through obtaining the mean SD across studies for treatment and control groups. </P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Sensitivity analysis<BR/>
</I>
</B>A sensitivity analysis was also undertaken to examine how robust the results were to the decision to include all studies regardless of quality. Study quality was investigated by categorising QRS scores into three ranges (15-25, 26-30, 31-35).<BR/>The impact of including studies of lower quality on the results of the review was examined. <BR/>A post-hoc sensitivity analysis was carried out, in which study comparisons where standard deviations had been imputed were removed.<B>

<I>Publication bias</I>
</B>
<BR/>Where sufficient numbers of trials allowed a meaningful presentation, funnel plots were constructed to investigate publication bias, using Review Manager software to organise and analyse the results.</P>

<P>The 'Characteristics of included studies' table provides details of the included trials in terms of the populations studied, the treatments examined, the outcome measures used, the randomisation procedure, allocation concealment, blinding procedures applied, approaches to statistical analysis, patient follow-up and whether antidepressant medication was used. Key study characteristics are briefly summarised below.</P>
<P>
<B>Sample size and sample source</B>
<BR/>The studies identified were small, all with less than 25 participants per treatment group and two studies with less than ten subjects per group. All participants were recruited through media (advertisements in local newspapers) or referral from other services (e.g. general practice).</P>
<P>
<B>Participants</B>
<BR/>Participants in each included study had been diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder according to DSM III-R (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1987</LINK>) or DSM-IV (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK>) criteria. Four study comparisons required a duration of symptoms of at least one year (<LINK REF="STD-McLean-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">McLean 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McLean-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">McLean 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Balkom-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Van Balkom 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Balkom-1998b" TYPE="STUDY">Van Balkom 1998b</LINK>) and one study required a duration of washing rituals of approximately one hour daily (<LINK REF="STD-Jones-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 1998</LINK>). </P>
<P>Three studies held the presence of other Axis I or Axis II severe disorders as of primary importance and needing treatment as exclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Cordioli-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cordioli 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Freeston-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Freeston 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-1997" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 1997</LINK>). Two studies that excluded subjects with other Axis I primary disorders reported all comorbid disorders identified in the sample with the percentage of subjects for each disorder (<LINK REF="STD-Vogel-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Vogel 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vogel-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Vogel 2004b</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Interventions</B>
<BR/>All included studies examined either cognitive behaviour therapy, cognitive therapy or behaviour therapy, and in each study waiting list was used as the treatment as usual arm. No studies comparing other psychological interventions with treatment as usual were identified.</P>
<P>In all but one trial (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-1997" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 1997</LINK>), some participants in the waiting list condition and in the psychological treatment group were concurrently receiving pharmacological treatment.</P>
<P>In all trials the duration of treatment was between 6 and 20 weeks. Most trials included a period of follow-up of at least 3 months but reporting of this data was often incomplete. Only <LINK REF="STD-Jones-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 1998</LINK> reported the follow-up data related to the waiting list control group</P>
<P>
<B>Outcomes</B>
<BR/>All trials used more than one outcome measure. The Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) was used in all studies, except for one study that used only the Maudsley Obsessive Compulsive Scale (MOCI) (<LINK REF="STD-Jones-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 1998</LINK>). Other instruments used were the National Institute of Mental Health Obsessive Compulsive Scale (NIMH-OCS), the Leyton Obsessive Inventory (LOI), the Padua Inventory (PI) and the Padua Inventory Revised (PI-R).</P>
<P>Depressive symptoms were measured in all trials by using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), except for one study that used the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD).<BR/>Anxiety symptoms were measured in six studies, by using respectively the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAMA), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and the Anxiety Discomfort Scale (ADS).</P>
<P>Quality of life was assessed in only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Cordioli-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cordioli 2003</LINK>) by using the World Health Organisation Quality of Life Assessment (WHOQOL-BREF).</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>Two studies (three study comparisons) were graded as "A" (<LINK REF="STD-Cordioli-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cordioli 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vogel-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Vogel 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vogel-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Vogel 2004b</LINK>) according to the methodological quality assessment criteria for allocation concealment, and the remaining six study comparisons were graded as "B".</P>
<P>From a possible maximum total score of 46 on the Quality Rating Scale (QRS) (<LINK REF="REF-Moncrieff-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moncrieff 2001</LINK>), the mean overall quality score attained by the included studies was 26.6 (range 19-35). </P>

<P>Most studies mentioned that the professionals involved had the necessary training and experience to conduct the psychological interventions. Only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-1997" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 1997</LINK>) did not report on the therapists' qualifications. </P>
<P>All but two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Fritzler-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Fritzler 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-1997" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 1997</LINK>) gave sufficient information with regard to the comparability of groups after randomisation in terms of socio-demographic and clinical characteristics.</P>

<P>All the studies used validated outcome instruments.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>A total of ten study comparisons (seven studies) reported sufficient data to be included in the meta-analysis. One additional study comparison (<LINK REF="STD-Fritzler-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Fritzler 1997</LINK>) presented combined data from both the treatment arm and the delayed treatment arm, and did not report the number of subjects in each group or the endpoint analysis of the comparisons. With the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Jones-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 1998</LINK>, all trials conducted post-treatment assessments only.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The primary purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to conduct a comprehensive and rigorous evaluation of the evidence available regarding the effectiveness of psychological treatments versus treatment as usual in patients with obsessive compulsive disorder. Seven trials (ten comparisons) of three different variants of psychological interventions (cognitive behaviour therapy, behaviour therapy and cognitive therapy) were included in the analysis, and statistical heterogeneity was not significant in mean differences data. The results obtained by pooling continuous data suggested that patients attending for psychological treatments, based on a CT, BT or CBT approach, exhibited significantly fewer obsessive compulsive symptoms post-treatment than those receiving treatment as usual. The adoption in the statistical analysis of the random effects model, that is, the more conservative statistical approach, maintained the significance of the results. This finding is consistent with previous research studies in the literature. </P>
<P>The efficacy of psychological treatments in reducing the severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms was also supported by this review. Regarding the dropout rate, it was observed that those in the waiting list groups had a lower dropout rate than those in the experimental groups, but the differences were not significant. A possible explanation might be that people on waiting list are motivated to wait in order to pursue active treatment. </P>
<P>A subgroup analysis suggested that the overall effect of treatment was influenced by differences in baseline severity: trials involving patients with more severe symptomatology demonstrated a less marked difference in favour of psychological treatment. </P>
<P>A subgroup analysis according to the number of sessions offered (&#8804;14 or &gt;14) did not show a significant difference in terms of effect of treatment. Only a slightly greater difference in favour of psychological treatments was observed in those trials involving fewer sessions compared with those with more sessions. This finding, different from any expectation and deriving from too few studies to be regarded as reliable, might be due to the type of model followed in those trials with longest duration (exposure not supervised by the therapist and cognitive treatment according to Beck in <LINK REF="STD-Van-Balkom-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Van Balkom 1998a</LINK>) or to the absence of concomitant drug treatment in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-1997" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 1997</LINK>). </P>
<P>When the influence of the percentage of participants assuming concomitant drug treatment was examined, it was not observed to be significant, but trials involving a greater number of subjects taking medications (&gt; 30%) showed a slightly greater difference in favour of psychological treatments than the others. Nevertheless, considering the limited number of studies and the small difference found, it is difficult to draw any conclusions regarding the issue of the independent efficacy of psychological treatments, whether the patients are on medication or not.</P>
<P>No differences between individual and group therapy in terms of improvement in symptomatology compared to control groups were demonstrated in the review, even if the therapist might be expected to be more aware of the patient's dysfunctional beliefs in an individual setting rather than in a group one. Interestingly, the number of dropouts was significantly greater in trials involving individual therapy compared with those involving group therapy. A possible explanation, as argued by some authors (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Noppen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Noppen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yalom-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yalom 1975</LINK>), might be that group therapy, with its characteristics such as universality, encouragement, reciprocal support, imitation and interpersonal learning would result in an increased motivation and reduced discontinuation of treatment. Hence, another advantage offered by group therapy seems to be in terms of cost/efficacy since it provides treatment in a shorter period and for a greater number of patients.</P>
<P>Trial QRS scores did not appear to influence significantly the overall effect of treatment, as higher quality studies showed only slightly larger effects than those of lower quality. </P>
<P>By analysing three variants of treatments (cognitive behaviour therapy, behaviour therapy and cognitive therapy) separately, significant statistical heterogeneity was only observed between the trials on behavioural treatments. When the efficacy in improving obsessive compulsive symptoms was examined, the cognitive treatment demonstrated a less marked effect, compared to the other two types of interventions. The effect did not reach significance when the random effect model was adopted. Nevertheless, since there were only two cognitive therapy studies, it is not possible to draw any definitive conclusions regarding a reduced efficacy of cognitive treatment compared with behavioural and cognitive behavioural treatment. <LINK REF="STD-Jones-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 1998</LINK>, reporting a significant improvement compared to the control group, used a cognitive model conceived by the author and without precedents in the literature, consisting in the combination of different techniques, such as cognitive restructuring according to Ellis, filmed interviews, contamination experiments not involving patients, strategies of attention focusing. <LINK REF="STD-Van-Balkom-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Van Balkom 1998a</LINK>, reporting the lowest effect size in favour of psychotherapy, adopted Beck cognitive models and did not follow recent Salkovskis cognitive models (considered promising in terms of efficacy, and adopted in three of the five studies in which cognitive therapy was combined with behavioural techniques). </P>
<P>With regard to the level of depressive and anxiety symptoms, the results obtained showed that none of the different variants of treatments considered separately caused an improvement that reached significance. Considering the studies individually, the only intervention that showed a slightly significant improvement compared to the control condition was the one consisting of only behavioural techniques combined with relaxation therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Vogel-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Vogel 2004b</LINK>). This finding does not seem to confirm the hypothesis that cognitive therapy alone or associated with a behavioural intervention, by using direct strategies of cognitive challenging shown to be effective in the treatment of depressive disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Beck-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beck 1979</LINK>), would have more influence on depressive comorbid symptoms than a behavioural intervention. Alternatively, this finding suggests that by reducing obsessive compulsive symptoms, behavioural interventions may indirectly contribute to improve anxious-depressive symptoms secondary to the obsessive compulsive disorder. Nevertheless, in order to confirm this, we would need more studies of larger size, given the fact that <LINK REF="STD-Vogel-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Vogel 2004b</LINK> is a very small study comparison. </P>
<P>As to the number of dropouts, no significant differences were identified when analysing the three variants of treatment (CT, BT and CBT) separately, but cognitive therapy seemed to have a slightly higher rate of dropout compared to the other two psychological treatments. This finding does not seem to confirm the argument sustained by some authors and shown by results of previous studies (<LINK REF="REF-Salkovskis-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salkovskis 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steketee-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steketee 1993</LINK>) regarding the usefulness of cognitive therapy in improving the acceptability of treatment and the compliance compared to the behavioural intervention. However given the limited number of studies, it is important to interpret these findings with caution.</P>
<P>All trials in this review reported their assignment procedure as being randomised, nevertheless only five study comparisons (<LINK REF="STD-Cordioli-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cordioli 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McLean-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">McLean 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McLean-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">McLean 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vogel-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Vogel 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vogel-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Vogel 2004b</LINK>) described the randomisation procedure, only three study comparisons (<LINK REF="STD-Cordioli-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cordioli 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vogel-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Vogel 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vogel-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Vogel 2004b</LINK>) reported on allocation concealment and only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Cordioli-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cordioli 2003</LINK>) reported that the patients were rated by independent assessors blinded for patient group allocation. This suggests the possibility of biases being introduced during the allocation procedure in most of the trials. Furthermore, even if most of the trials reported the use of manuals to standardise psychotherapy interventions and monitored the psychological intervention through weekly supervision discussions with the therapists and recorded sessions, there were some trials (<LINK REF="STD-Cordioli-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cordioli 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jones-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-1997" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 1997</LINK>) that did not monitor adherence to the psychotherapy interventions under evaluation. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that the therapists in those trials consistently applied the models as directed, and observable outcomes cannot be attributed with complete certainty to the effects of the models themselves. The primary purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to conduct a comprehensive and rigorous evaluation of the evidence available regarding the effectiveness of psychological treatments versus treatment as usual in patients with obsessive compulsive disorder.</P>
<P>In most of the studies the authors had developed or were closely associated with the therapy under assessment, and this may resulted in potential for investigator bias. The concomitant use of medication in almost all trials limits confidence in the review findings, since it leaves some uncertainty about its role in influencing the overall treatment effect. All trials used a waiting list arm as a control group, and it is possible that this could have influenced the effect size by discouraging symptomatic improvement during the course of the trial in the patients allocated to waiting lists.</P>
<P>Sample sizes contained in all trials were very small, with the majority of the trials having less than 25 participants in each treatment arm and two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Fritzler-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Fritzler 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-1997" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 1997</LINK>) having less than ten subjects for arm of treatment; and no studies except <LINK REF="STD-Vogel-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Vogel 2004a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Vogel-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Vogel 2004b</LINK> mentioned the execution of a power calculation. Because of the small number and size of trials with considerable potential for bias, conclusions are necessarily cautious and limited. The majority of trials used the Y-BOCS to measure the severity of obsessive compulsive symptoms and the BDI to measure the depressive symptoms; broader measurements such as quality of life scales, including social, physical, psychological functioning, were reported only in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Cordioli-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cordioli 2003</LINK>), despite their potential for detecting change in patients with obsessive compulsive disorder who present disabilities in many areas of functioning </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<UL>
<LI>The findings of this review suggest that psychological treatments derived from cognitive/behavioural models are of benefit in the treatment of people with obsessive compulsive disorder. </LI>
<LI>The efficacy of psychological treatments might be influenced by baseline severity and the concomitant presence of depression.</LI>
<LI>Given that the presentation of obsessive compulsive disorder varies widely in terms of levels of severity, chronicity, comorbidity, presence of overt rituals, it is likely that psychological treatments are more appropriate for some patients than for others.</LI>
</UL>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<UL>
<LI>There is a need for further trials to compare the effectiveness of cognitive and/or behavioural treatments and other approaches such as psychodynamic therapy and client-centred therapy, either in individual or in group formats.</LI>
<LI>It is important that trials establish the actual degree of improvement that might be expected in patients with different levels of severity and clinical presentation.</LI>
<LI>Future research should demonstrate whether psychological treatments are appropriate in all cases and how their effect varies by modifying features such as the duration, the frequency of sessions, the role of the therapist, the setting, the theoretical model.</LI>
<LI>In order to be of any assistance in informing policy and practice, future trials should be adequately powered, involve longer follow-up periods, include cost-efficacy evaluations, properly monitor adherence to therapeutic techniques, and where naturalistic concomitant treatments are allowed, record and allow for these in the interpretation of the results.</LI>
<LI>Furthermore, it is extremely important to incorporate outcomes that measure the broader impact of psychological treatments, such as quality of life.</LI>
