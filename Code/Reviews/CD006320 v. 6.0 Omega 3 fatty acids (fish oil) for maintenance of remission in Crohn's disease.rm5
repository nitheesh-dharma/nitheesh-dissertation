<TITLE>Omega 3 fatty acids (fish oil) for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-02-27 11:00:02 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Fish oil contains omega 3 fatty acids that may be beneficial in reducing inflammation, such as seen in the bowel of Crohn's disease patients. Randomized placebo-controlled studies that evaluated the effect of daily intake of capsules containing omega-3 fatty acids to maintain remission in Crohn's disease were reviewed. Six studies including 1039 patients were included in the review. A pooled analysis of six studies suggests a marginal benefit for omega 3 fatty acids over placebo (i.e. fake medicine) in preventing relapse of disease at one year. However, these results need to be interpreted with caution due to differences across the studies in terms of induction of remission regimens (e.g. surgical remission versus drug therapy) patients (e.g. adult versus pediatric patients) and medication regimens (e.g. some studies used different placebos), the possibility of publication bias (i.e. only studies with positive results are published) and low methodological quality in four studies in the pooled analysis. When the two largest and highest quality studies were pooled the results showed no benefit to omega-3 treatment over placebo. There were no serious side effects in any of the studies. Common side effects included unpleasant taste, bad breath, heartburn, nausea and diarrhea. Evidence from two large high quality studies suggests that omega 3 fatty acids are probably ineffective for maintenance of remission in CD. Omega 3 fatty acids appear to be safe although they may cause diarrhea and upper gastrointestinal tract symptoms.<BR/>

<P>Randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCT) of n-3 for maintenance of remission in CD were included. Studies must have enrolled patients of any age group, who were in remission at the time of recruitment, and were followed for at least six months.

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-02-27 10:59:30 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>The primary outcome was the relapse rate and secondary outcomes included change in disease activity scores, time to first relapse and adverse events. Two independent investigators reviewed studies for eligibility, extracted the data and assessed study quality using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The overall quality of the evidence supporting the primary and selected secondary outcomes was reassessed for the current update using the GRADE system. We used the RevMan software for analyses. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and the hazard ratio and 95% CI for time-to-event outcomes. Random-effects or fixed-effect models were used according to degree of heterogeneity and sensitivity analyses were performed in an attempt to explore possible sources of heterogeneity.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-02-27 11:17:30 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Six studies with a total of 1039 patients were eligible for inclusion. The two largest studies were rated as low risk of bias for all assessed items. Four studies were rated as unclear risk of bias for randomization and allocation concealment. Two studies were rated as high risk of bias for incomplete outcome data and selective reporting. There was a marginal significant benefit of n-3 therapy for maintenance of remission. Thirty-nine per cent of patients in the n-3 group relapsed at 12 months compared to 47% of placebo patients (6 studies, 1039 patients; RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.98). A GRADE analysis rated the overall quality of the evidence for the primary outcome (i.e. relapse) as very low due to unexplained heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 58%), publication bias, and a high or unknown risk of bias in four studies in the pooled analysis. When two large studies at low risk of bias were considered the benefit was no longer statistically significant. Thirty-seven per cent of patients in the n-3 group relapsed at 12 months compared to 42% of placebo patients (2 studies, 738 patients; RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.05). No significant heterogeneity was identified for this pooled analysis ( I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was moderate due to sparse data (294 events). No serious adverse events were recorded in any of the studies but in a pooled analyses there was a significantly higher rate of diarrhea (4 studies, 862 patients; RR 1.36 95% CI 1.01 to 1.84) and upper gastrointestinal tract symptoms (5 studies, 999 patients; RR 1.65, 95% CI 1.25 to 2.18) in the n-3 treatment group.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-02-27 11:00:12 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>
<B>Crohn's disease</B>
<BR/>Crohn's disease (CD) is characterized by chronic intestinal inflammation causing a varying spectrum of clinical symptoms. Some patients have chronically active disease, while others have a pattern of clear exacerbations and remissions. It is currently hypothesized that chronic inflammation develops in genetically susceptible hosts in response to as yet unidentified environmental triggers, likely microbial in origin. No maintenance medication has been shown to be completely effective in preventing relapse, and thus prolonging remission intervals while minimizing adverse reactions has been the aim of treatment. Adherence to a low residue diet may reduce symptoms in patients with intestinal stenosis and administration of formulated food as the sole source of nutrition is efficacious in alleviating mucosal inflammation (<LINK REF="REF-Zachos-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zachos 2007</LINK>). Otherwise, no dietary restrictions or interventions have been convincingly shown to treat active CD or to prevent clinical exacerbation.</P>
<P>
<B>Omega-3 poly-unsaturated fatty acids (n-3)</B>
<BR/>Randomized controlled trials have suggested a positive effect of n-3 in various disease states, including cardiovascular, inflammatory, immunological, psychological, and neurological disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Akabas-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akabas 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Belluzzi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belluzzi 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ergas-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ergas 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hooper-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hooper 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ruxton-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruxton 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simopoulos-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simopoulos 2002</LINK>). The beneficial effects of n-3 are thought to be secondary to anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic, antiarrhythmic, hypolipidemic and vasodilatory properties. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3) are incorporated into the wall of inflammatory cells and decrease the concentration of arachidonic acid (C20:4, n-6). Arachidonic acid is the key substrate of cyclooxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase enzymes which produce proinflammatory cytokines (<LINK REF="REF-Hillier-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hillier 1991</LINK>). In this way, n-3 fatty acids reduce the production of leukotriene B4, thromboxane A2, prostaglandin E2, interleukin-1, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor, and scavenge free radicals (<LINK REF="REF-Endres-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Endres 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fisher-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fisher 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kim-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lee-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simopoulos-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simopoulos 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although n-3 can be obtained from various vegetables, the major source of n-3 is fish oil. The marine sources of n-3 include eicosapentanoic acid (EPA or 20:5), docosahexanoic acid (DHA, 22:6) and docosapentanoic acid (DPA, 22:5), which are the longer chain n-3 forms. Alpha linolenic acid (ALA, 18:3) is the shorter chain n-3 obtained from nuts and vegetable oils. Although an endogenous process exists whereby ALA can be partially converted to the effective longer chain n-3, there is debate about the effectiveness of this conversion (<LINK REF="REF-Arterburn-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arterburn 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ruxton-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruxton 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>n-3 and Crohn's disease</B>
<BR/>Studies on animal models and tissues of IBD patients have demonstrated the strong anti-inflammatory properties of n-3 (<LINK REF="REF-Nakazawa-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nakazawa 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vilaseca-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vilaseca 1990</LINK>). It has been proposed that a diet rich in fish oil protected the Japanese from IBD and now the rate of IBD is increasing due to dietary shift from n-3 to n-6 (<LINK REF="REF-Nakazawa-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nakazawa 2000</LINK>). Reports of n-3 use for maintaining remission in CD have been conflicting (<LINK REF="REF-MacLean-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacLean 2005</LINK>). Although n-3 has an excellent safety profile, when administered as raw fish oil it was shown to have troublesome adverse effects that reduced compliance. These adverse effects include unpleasant taste, halitosis, heartburn, nausea and diarrhea (<LINK REF="REF-Kim-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lorenz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Lorenz 1989</LINK>). Investigators have suggested the use of enteric coated capsules to improve compliance and absorption (<LINK REF="REF-Belluzzi-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belluzzi 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Importance of this review</B>
<BR/>Narrative reviews of fish oil in CD have reported conflicting conclusions, based on the same published studies (<LINK REF="REF-Belluzzi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belluzzi 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Endres-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Endres 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kim-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nakazawa-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nakazawa 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simopoulos-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simopoulos 2002</LINK>). Our previous systematic review published in 2009 concluded that omega-3 fatty acids are probably ineffective for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Turner-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 2009</LINK>). In light of continued public interest in finding natural alternatives or adjuncts to current immunosuppressive therapies and the four years that have elapsed since the last literature search, we aimed to update our previous review.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The primary objective of this study was to systematically review the effectiveness of fish oil or n-3 for maintaining remission in CD. A secondary objective was to evaluate the adverse events associated with fish oil or n-3 for maintaining remission in CD.</P>

<P>Crohn's disease patients (diagnosed using established criteria) who were in remission at the time of recruitment were included. We did not apply any age restrictions (both pediatric and adult patients were included). The following validated clinical indices could have been used to assess disease activity and remission: the Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) (<LINK REF="REF-Best-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Best 1976</LINK>), the pediatric Crohn's disease activity index (PCDAI) (<LINK REF="REF-Hyams-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hyams 1991</LINK>), the weighted pediatric Crohn's disease activity index (wPCDAI) and the other short versions (<LINK REF="REF-Turner-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 2012</LINK>), and the Harvey-Bradshaw index (<LINK REF="REF-Harvey-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harvey 1980</LINK>).

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2014-02-27 11:00:21 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Trials were included if fish oil or n-3 supplementation was given in any form (capsule, enteric coated or liquid) but with a defined dose. Co-interventions were allowed only if they were balanced between the study groups. Studies in which the intervention group received diet enriched with fish products were excluded as the dose was not clear in these studies and other confounding variables could exist.</P>

<P>
<B>Primary outcome</B>
<BR/>The primary outcome was the relapse rate during the observation time. Definitions of relapse were guided by the validated indices specified above.</P>
<P>
<B>Secondary outcome</B>
<BR/>The secondary outcomes were change in disease activity scores, time to first relapse and adverse events (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, halitosis, heartburn, alterations in low density lipoproteins, alterations in glucose level, increase in bleeding time and abdominal pain). Withdrawal rate of participants among the intervention and control groups was also recorded. Other outcomes were recorded, if available: admission rate, use of steroids, disease activity at the end of follow-up period and quality of life. However, most of these data were not available. Studies reporting only surrogate outcomes (e.g. serum or tissue levels of cytokines or inflammatory markers) were excluded.</P>

<B>Search methods for identification of studies </B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Electronic databases</B>
</P>
<P>An on-line database literature search from inception to November 2013 was performed for human studies, without language restrictions, using the following databases: MEDLINE (NLM, National Library of Medicine, Bethesda), EMBASE (Elsevier, NY) and HealthSTAR on OVID, as well as PubMed (NLM), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and ACP journal club. On-going trials were identified from the registry link: <A HREF="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">www.clinicaltrials.gov</A>. The search strategies used for each database are documented in <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>. All abstracts found by the above search strategy underwent individual screening for eligibility by DT.</P>
<P>
<B>Other sources</B>
<BR/>Additional citations were identified by manually searching the references of articles retrieved from the computerized databases and relevant review articles. Unpublished studies were sought by contacting experts in the field, but none were identified.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-02-27 11:01:51 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>
<B>Selection of studies</B>
<BR/>Abstracts of all articles meeting the above search strategy were screened for eligibility. Full text studies were retrieved if they were potentially eligible for inclusion. The retrieved full text articles were then independently reviewed by DT and AMG for eligibility. Disagreements were to be resolved by consensus between the remaining investigators.</P>
<P>
<B>Data extraction and management</B>
<BR/>Two investigators (DT, AMG) independently completed a data extraction form for all eligible studies. The following data were retrieved:</P>
<P>1. General information: title, journal, year, published or unpublished.<BR/>2. Study information: design, ways used to ensure adequacy of randomization, concealment of allocation and blinding, power calculation (a priori and post hoc).<BR/>3. Intervention: form and dose of n-3, type of comparison group, special diet used.<BR/>4. Eligibility: inclusion and exclusion criteria, total number screened and randomized.<BR/>5. Baseline characteristics (in each group): age, sex, race, disease severity (and how evaluated), concurrent medications used.<BR/>6. Follow-up: length of follow-up, assessment of compliance, withdrawals and loss to follow-up.<BR/>7. Outcome: time to first relapse, disease activity at each evaluation time (and how was assessed) number of relapses during the follow-up period, adverse events, use of steroid, number of hospital admissions and weight.</P>
<P>
<B>Assessment of methodological quality of included studies</B>
<BR/>
</P>
<P>Two authors (RL and OL) independently assessed the quality of included studies using the Cochrane risk of bias tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Factors assessed included:</P>
<UL>
<LI>random sequence generation;</LI>
<LI>allocation concealment;</LI>
<LI>blinding;</LI>
<LI>incomplete outcome data;</LI>
<LI>selective outcome reporting; and </LI>
<LI>other potential sources of bias.</LI>
</UL>
<P>We rated each of these factors as &#8216;low risk&#8217;, &#8216;high risk&#8217; or &#8216;unclear risk&#8217;. Disagreements were resolved by consensus.</P>
<P>We used the GRADE approach to assess the overall quality of evidence for the primary outcome and selected secondary outcomes of interest. Outcomes from pooling of randomized trials start as high quality evidence, but may be downgraded due to: (1) risk of bias, (2) indirectness of evidence, (3) inconsistency (unexplained heterogeneity), (4) imprecision (sparse data), and (5) reporting bias (publication bias). The overall quality of evidence for each outcome was determined after considering each of these elements, and categorized as high quality (i.e. further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect); moderate<I> </I>quality<I> </I>(i.e. further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate); low quality (i.e. further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate); or very low quality (i.e. we are very uncertain about the estimate) (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Missing data</B>
<BR/>Primary authors were contacted for missing data, but none replied. A sensitivity analysis was planned in this case.</P>
<P>
<B>Statistical analysis</B>
<BR/>Categorical data (as relapsed or not during the follow-up period) for each study were transformed into two by two tables.</P>
<P>
<B>Measures of treatment effect</B>
<BR/>We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for dichotomous outcomes. For the primary analysis the actual relapse rate was used rather than the estimated rate (controlling for censored data), since most studies did not report the estimated relapse rate. The number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) and the absolute risk reduction (risk difference) and corresponding 95% CI were also calculated where appropriate. For time-to-event data we calculated the hazard ratio (HR) and corresponding 95% CI. No continuous variables (i.e. number of relapses) were reported in the studies.</P>
<P>
<B>Meta-analysis</B>
<BR/>Random-effects or fixed-effect models were used to pool studies depending on clinical and statistical heterogeneity. Weighting was assigned according to the Mantel-Haenszel method. For time-to-event analyses, the generic inverse variance function was used, inputting the lnHR (hazard ratio) with its lnSE (standard error) derived from the reported 95% CI of the HR.

<B>Assessment of Heterogeneity</B>
<I>
<BR/>
</I>First, studies were independently reviewed for any clinical and methodological heterogeneity and possible reasons for heterogeneity were sought. The decision of whether to pool studies was aided by calculating the I<SUP>2</SUP> measure, interpreted as 25% (low heterogeneity), 50% (moderate) and 75% (high) (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). Next, the Cochran Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test for homogeneity (Q test) was calculated, and since the test has low sensitivity to detect heterogeneity, P &lt; 0.1 was considered to be statistically significant.</P>
<P>
<B>Subgroup analysis</B>
<I> </I>
<BR/>A priori subgroup analyses were planned, governed by the number of identified studies: different dosing of eicosapentoic acid (EPA), follow-up duration (&lt; 9 months and &gt; 9 months), pediatric versus adult population (<U>&lt;</U> 18 years of age and &gt; 18 years), different formulation of the fish oil (raw, encapsulated, or enteric coated).</P>
<P>
<B>Sensitivity analysis</B>
<BR/>In order to assess the robustness of the eligibility criteria, planned sensitivity analyses included excluding poor quality studies, small studies (&lt; 50 patients) and studies published in abstract form. A funnel plot was constructed to assess the possibility of publication bias.</P>

<I>Results of the search</I>
<BR/>The initial search yielded 142 non-duplicated articles (See <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). Based on abstract review, all potentially controlled trials and review articles for reference search were retrieved. Nineteen full text articles were assessed for eligibility. Two studies were excluded because they were not randomized controlled trials (<LINK REF="STD-Mate-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Mate 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tsujikawa-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Tsujikawa 2000</LINK>). Eight studies were excluded because they enrolled only active patients (i.e. focusing on whether n-3 can induce remission (<LINK REF="STD-Bamba-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bamba 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eivindson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Eivindson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nielsen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nielsen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sakurai-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sakurai 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seidman-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Seidman 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Socha-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Socha 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trebble-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Trebble 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trebble-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Trebble 2005</LINK>). One study was excluded because it enrolled patients with active and inactive Crohn's disease (<LINK REF="STD-Lorenz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Lorenz 1989</LINK>). Two studies were excluded because n-3 treatment was for less than six months (<LINK REF="STD-Bjorkkjaer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bjorkkjaer 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Geerling-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Geerling 2000</LINK>). Six studies with a total of 1039 patients were included in this review (table of included studies). Two independent trials (EPIC-1 and EPIC-2) were reported in the same manuscript (<LINK REF="STD-Feagan-2008a" TYPE="STUDY">Feagan 2008a</LINK>) and were included in the last update (<LINK REF="REF-Turner-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 2009</LINK>). No new studies were published since 2008, and thus no additional studies were included in the current review update. Agreement among reviewers regarding the eligibility of the included studies was 100%.</P>

<LI>
<B>Interventions</B>: Gelatin n-3 capsules (3.3 g/day of EPA and 1.8 g/day of DHA, as ethyl Esther) versus identical placebo of corn oil. A second intervention group was treated with a low carbohydrate diet but was ignored for the purpose of this review.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Outcome</B>: Primary outcome was the relapse free time period after randomization as defined by CDAI &gt; 200 and a change from baseline CDAI by at least 60 points, plus an increase of C-reactive protein serum level two standard deviations above normal mean. Relapse rate and adverse events were also monitored.</LI>

<LI>This study was published in abstract form only. Additional information was supplied by the author by personal communication. </LI>
<LI>
<B>Design</B>: A double blind, placebo-controlled trial of one year duration.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Sample size:</B> A total of 50 adults (mean age 39 ± 13.8 years in the n-3 group, and 35.2 ± 7.9 in the control group, 58% male), 26 in the n-3 arm and 24 in the control arm.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Setting</B>: Outpatients at a single IBD center in Italy.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Participants</B>: Crohn's disease patients in remission (CDAI &lt; 150) one month following ileal resection. No co-interventions were administered and no specific diet was prescribed; participants were asked to continue their previous dietary habits.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Interventions</B>: The n-3 group received the same regimen as <LINK REF="STD-Belluzzi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Belluzzi 1996</LINK> (enteric coated fish oil capsules with 60 minutes delay time release composed of 1.8 g/day of EPA and 0.9 g/day of DHA, as free fatty acids). Placebo capsules were Miglyol 812, as in <LINK REF="STD-Belluzzi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Belluzzi 1996</LINK>. </LI>
<LI>
<B>Outcome</B>: Relapse rates during a one year follow-up were recorded. Relapse was measured both clinically (CDAI &gt; 150 with an increase of &gt; 50 points from baseline) and by endoscopic or radiological appearance. For the meta-analysis, only clinical relapse rates were included, similar to the other three included trials.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
<B>Design:</B> A double blind, placebo-controlled trial of 52 weeks duration.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Sample size</B>: A total of 383 adults randomized, but only 363 were eligible for the modified intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, for which data were included only from patients who received at least 1 dose of the study drug and who provided any post randomization data (mean age 40.5 ± 15.2 years in the n-3 group and 38.2 ± 13.1 in the control group, 45% male), 183 in the n-3 group and 180 in the comparison group. Nine of the excluded patients were enrolled by a single site that violated the protocol in various cases.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Setting</B>: Fifty-one IBD sites in Canada, Europe, Israel, and United States between January 2003 and February 2007. Patients were evaluated one week before randomization, at the time of randomization and at 4, 16, 30, 44, and 52 weeks thereafter.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Participants</B>: At baseline, eligible participants were in remission (CDAI &lt; 150) for at least three months and had at least one exacerbation within the previous year. Exclusion criteria included allergy or intolerance to n-3 or fish products; treatment with 5-aminosalicylates, immunosuppressives, tumor necrosis factor-&#945; antagonists, or investigational drugs; existence of ostomy or short bowel syndrome; bowel resection or obstruction in the preceding 3 months; malignancy (with the exception of resected basal or squamous cell skin cancer or carcinoma of the cervix in situ); substance abuse; and severe medical diseases other than CD.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Interventions: </B>Two time released 1 g gelatin capsules of n-3 twice daily (Epanova; Tillotts Pharma AG, Ziefen, Switzerland) consisted of approximately 2.2 g/day of EPA and 0.8 g/day of DHA as free fatty acids versus identical placebo of four 1 g of medium-chain triglyceride oil. To enhance tolerability, patients began with an initial dose of 1 g/day of the study drug for the first 7 days, increased to 2 g/day for 7 days and then further increased to the final dose. No new medications were allowed after randomization.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Outcome:</B> Primary outcome was time to relapse, defined by either an increase of the CDAI score to 150 points or greater and an increase of more than 70 points from the score calculated at the randomization visit, or the initiation of prohibited medical therapy or surgery for symptomatic active CD. Secondary outcomes were the change in mean scores on the CDAI and SF-36, the change in the mean serum triglyceride concentration, and the occurrence of adverse events.</LI>

<P>None of the eligible articles were excluded based on poor quality. The results of the risk of bias analysis are summarized in <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Lorenz_x002d_Meyer-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lorenz-Meyer 1996</LINK> did not describe methods used for randomization or allocation concealment and was rated as unclear for these items. Follow-up was adequate; however, the study had a drop-out rate of 8/70 (11%) in the intervention arm and 7/65 (11%) in the control arm. Another 7 and 8 patients, respectively, violated the protocol but the results represent an ITT analysis. <LINK REF="STD-Belluzzi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Belluzzi 1996</LINK> was a well designed study, but the report is lacking description on the methods used for randomization and allocation concealment. Blinding and follow-up were well described. The drop-out rate was 9%: 3% lost to follow-up and 6% withdrew because of diarrhea. These patients were not included in the relapse rate calculation and, thus, we performed sensitivity analysis to account for this potential bias. <LINK REF="STD-Belluzzi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Belluzzi 1997</LINK> was published as an abstract, with additional details supplied directly by the author. The drop-out rate was high (16%), and only 16/26 in the n-3 arm and 15/24 in the control arm were assessed for the primary outcome (endoscopic recurrence). Patients with clinical relapse were excluded from the analysis and this could be a source of attrition bias. <LINK REF="STD-Romano-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Romano 2005</LINK> was a small but well designed study. The report lacked a description of the methods used for randomization and allocation concealment. A concern was raised from the unexpectedly high rate of relapse among the control group.

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Feagan-2008a" TYPE="STUDY">Feagan 2008a</LINK> reports the results of the EPIC-1 and EPIC-2 studies. In these well designed, performed and reported studies, eligible patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio using a central randomization number generator stratified by the induction therapy received prior to randomization or the duration of remission. Neither the investigators nor the patients were aware of the treatment assignment. Adherence to the study drug as assigned was evaluated at each clinic visit by interviewing the patient and by capsule counts. Lost to follow-up (not including patients that terminated the study early due to clinical relapse) was high but still in the acceptable range: 15.1% in EPIC-1 and 12.8% in EPIC-2. One critique of these studies is that the sample size calculation was performed for relapse rate while the primary outcome was based on survival analysis.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2014-06-25 08:33:24 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>
<B>Relapse rate</B>
<BR/>All included studies reported the relapse rate at 1 year. <LINK REF="STD-Belluzzi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Belluzzi 1996</LINK> found that significantly less patients from the intervention group relapsed (n = 11, 28%) compared to placebo (n = 27, 69%; P &lt; 0.001) and concluded that enteric coated, timed release n-3 is highly effective in maintaining remission in Crohn's disease. This was not an ITT analysis as the outcome of patients who dropped out due to relocation (n = 2, 3%) or adverse events (n = 5, 6%) was not recorded. However, extrapolating from the survival curve, the estimated 1-year relapse rate was 39% in the intervention arm and 75% in the placebo arm. <LINK REF="STD-Lorenz_x002d_Meyer-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lorenz-Meyer 1996</LINK> found no difference in the relapse rate of the intervention group (n = 40, 57%) compared to placebo (n = 36, 55%; P = 0.84). Extrapolating from the survival curve, the estimated one year relapse rate was 69% in both groups. The authors concluded that gelatin capsules of ethyl ester fish oil capsules are not effective for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease. <LINK REF="STD-Belluzzi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Belluzzi 1997</LINK> found no benefit for n-3 therapy for maintenance of remission after ileal resection. During the one year follow-up, less patients from the intervention group experienced clinical relapse (n = 2, 8% versus n = 5, 21%; P = 0.24) or histological relapse compared to placebo (n = 9, 34% versus n = 15, 62%; P = 0.09). The authors concluded that enteric coated, timed release fish oil seems to be effective for maintenance of remission after ileal resection in Crohn's disease. A very high relapse rate was found in the placebo group of the <LINK REF="STD-Romano-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Romano 2005</LINK> study (n = 19/20, 95% in the placebo group compared with n = 11/18, 61% in the intervention group; P &lt; 0.001). <LINK REF="STD-Romano-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Romano 2005</LINK> concluded that enteric coated n-3 in addition to 5-ASA are effective for maintenance of remission in pediatric Crohn's disease. In this study compliance was optimal, no patients were lost to follow-up and all patients were analyzed.</P>
<P>In both EPIC-1 and EPIC-2 trials (<LINK REF="STD-Feagan-2008a" TYPE="STUDY">Feagan 2008a</LINK>), the largest of all existing studies, no significant difference in the relapse rate was found between the patients treated with n-3 or placebo. In EPIC-1, 54/183 (29.5%) treated with n-3 relapsed compared to 62/180 (34.4%) in the placebo group (P = 0.31). To control for 55 patients who discontinued the intervention prematurely but did not experience a relapse (26 in the n-3 group and 29 in the placebo group) a survival analysis was used, estimating the 1-year relapse rate of the n-3 group to be 31.6%, compared with 35.7% of the placebo group (P = 0.30). In EPIC-2, the relapse rate was 84/187 (44.9%) and 94/188 (50%) in the n-3 and placebo groups, respectively (P=0.38). The 1-year relapse rate controlled for 48 patients who discontinued the intervention prematurely but did not experience a relapse (30 in the n-3 group and 18 in the placebo group) was estimated at 47.8% and 48.8% in the n-3 and placebo groups, respectively (P = 0.48).</P>
<P>Since all studies shared the primary outcome (relapse rate over 1 year in quiescent CD patients) the data were pooled in a meta-analysis (See <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). In the case of <LINK REF="STD-Belluzzi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Belluzzi 1997</LINK>, clinical relapse was included (in contrast with endoscopic or radiographic relapse) to make it comparable with the other studies. The pooled risk ratio was statistically significant in favor of omega-3 fatty acids. Thirty-nine per cent of patients in the n-3 group relapsed at 12 months compared to 47% of placebo patients (6 studies, 1039 patients; RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.98). A GRADE analyses rated the overall quality of the evidence for the primary outcome (i.e. relapse) as very low due to unexplained heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 58%), potential publication bias, and a high or unknown risk of bias in four studies in the pooled analysis. Although each study is somewhat different (i.e. one pediatric, one looked at post resection maintenance, one published in an abstract form, and some used a different placebo), the study by <LINK REF="STD-Lorenz_x002d_Meyer-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lorenz-Meyer 1996</LINK> differed the most having used a different formulation and dose of n-3. Thus, a subgroup analysis of the five studies that used enteric coated capsules was performed (See <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). There was a reduction in the risk of relapse with the use of enteric coated n-3 compared with placebo with statistically significant heterogeneity (P = 0.05, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 58%). The pooled effect was statistically significant (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.93). This analysis was repeated after considering all drop-out patients in the intervention arm of <LINK REF="STD-Belluzzi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Belluzzi 1996</LINK> as failures and all drop-outs in the control arm as successes (See <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>), but this did not alter the results (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.93). As shown in <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>, the absolute risk reduction was 17% (95% CI 4% to 30%), and the calculated NNTB to prevent one relapse over a one year period was 5 (95% CI 3 to 25).</P>
<P>A sensitivity analysis excluding the abstract publication (See <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>) did not change the results (RR 0.72; 95% CI 0.54 to 0.96). When the pediatric study by <LINK REF="STD-Romano-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Romano 2005</LINK> was excluded (See <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>) the risk ratio was no longer statistically significant (RR 0.71; 95% CI 0.50 to 1.01). When including the <I>estimated</I> one year relapse rate (<LINK REF="STD-Belluzzi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Belluzzi 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feagan-2008a" TYPE="STUDY">Feagan 2008a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lorenz_x002d_Meyer-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lorenz-Meyer 1996</LINK>), rather than the actual relapse rate, the pooled risk ratio was no longer statistically significant (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>; RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.02; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 56%). When combining only the two largest and most rigorously performed studies, EPIC-1 and EPIC-2, the risk ratio was not statistically significant (See <LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>). Thirty-seven per cent of patients in the n-3 group relapsed at 12 months compared to 42% of placebo patients (2 studies, 738 patients; RR 0.88, 95%CI 0.74 to 1.05). No heterogeneity was detected for this comparison (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was moderate due to sparse data (294 events).</P>
<P>The small number of included studies limited the ability to construct a valid funnel plot. Nonetheless, the funnel plot (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>) suggests the possibility of publication bias, with the representation of three positive but no negative low weighted studies.<BR/>
<I>
<BR/>
</I>
<B>Time to first relapse</B>
<BR/>Five studies reported on time to first relapse. <LINK REF="STD-Romano-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Romano 2005</LINK> reported the median time to first relapse which was eight months in the intervention group compared to one month in the placebo group. No survival analysis or formal comparisons were presented. <LINK REF="STD-Belluzzi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Belluzzi 1996</LINK> presented a survival curve; the median relapse free time was four months in the placebo group compared to greater than one year in the fish oil group (log rank test 0.006). At the end of the follow-up period, 23 of the 39 patients in the intervention arm (59%) and 10 of the 39 patients in the placebo group (26%) were still in remission (P = 0.003). In EPIC-1, EPIC-2 (<LINK REF="STD-Feagan-2008a" TYPE="STUDY">Feagan 2008a</LINK>) and <LINK REF="STD-Lorenz_x002d_Meyer-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lorenz-Meyer 1996</LINK> a survival analysis was the primary aim. In <LINK REF="STD-Lorenz_x002d_Meyer-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lorenz-Meyer 1996</LINK>, extrapolating from the Kaplan Meier curve, the median relapse free periods of the placebo and the intervention arms were 133 and 159 days, respectively. This difference was not significant in both the ITT and per protocol analyses. Similarly, the proportion of relapse free patients after one year of follow-up was 31% in both groups.</P>
<P>Only EPIC-1 and EPIC-2 reported the Hazard Ratio (HR) with 95% CI (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.18 for EPIC-1, and HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.21 for EPIC-2). The pooled log HR did not show any superiority for n-3 treatment relative to placebo (<LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>; HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.09). No heterogeneity was detected for this comparison (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%).<BR/>

<B>Disease activity at the end of the year</B>
<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Belluzzi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Belluzzi 1996</LINK> reported on change of disease activity at the end of the follow-up period. The reduction in three inflammatory markers (erythrocytes sedimentation rate, serum alpha 2 globulins and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein) was significantly larger in the fish oil group compared to placebo.

<B>Biological effect of n-3</B>
<BR/>Five studies reported the biological effect of treatment. Two studies evaluated the incorporation of n-3 into red blood cells (RBC) membranes and three studies evaluated the change in serum triglycerides. <LINK REF="STD-Belluzzi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Belluzzi 1996</LINK> presented data on patients who remained in remission at the end of the follow-up period. Omega 3 fatty acids replaced 50% of the RBC arachidonic acid in the intervention arm and remained unchanged in the placebo arm. <LINK REF="STD-Romano-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Romano 2005</LINK> showed that all subjects in the intervention arm had a statistically significant increase in the RBC concentration of EPA and DHA, and a decrease in arachidonic acid. <LINK REF="STD-Lorenz_x002d_Meyer-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lorenz-Meyer 1996</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Feagan-2008a" TYPE="STUDY">Feagan 2008a</LINK> (EPIC-1 and EPIC-2) reported a significant decrease in serum triglycerides among n-3 treated patients compared to placebo.<BR/>

<B>Quality of life</B>
<BR/>No significant difference in SF-36 scores was found between the study groups in the EPIC-1 and EPIC-2 studies (<LINK REF="STD-Feagan-2008a" TYPE="STUDY">Feagan 2008a</LINK>). These data were not shown.</P>
<P>
<B>Adverse events</B>
<BR/>Overall, no serious adverse events were reported in any of the trials. <LINK REF="STD-Belluzzi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Belluzzi 1997</LINK> did not report on adverse events, but reported by personal communication that no serious adverse events occurred in either arm. Adverse events that were different between the treatment arms in at least one of the remaining five studies are summarized in Additional <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Romano-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Romano 2005</LINK> reported that there were no adverse events in either group, but no explicit list of items are presented. <LINK REF="STD-Belluzzi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Belluzzi 1996</LINK> reported that 4/39 patients in the intervention arm withdrew due to adverse events compared to 1/39 patients in the placebo arm (due to diarrhea). Discontinuation rates secondary to adverse events in EPIC-1 and EPIC-2 (<LINK REF="STD-Feagan-2008a" TYPE="STUDY">Feagan 2008a</LINK>) were 9/183 versus 7/180 and 9/187 versus 5/188 in the n-3 and the placebo groups, respectively. In EPIC-1, 79.2% of patients who received n-3 had adhered to the study drug, compared with 75.6% of those who received placebo (P=0.40). The corresponding adherence rates for EPIC-2 were 75.4% and 81.4%, respectively (P=0.16).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Lorenz_x002d_Meyer-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lorenz-Meyer 1996</LINK> was excluded from the meta-analysis of adverse events because the pathophysiology of the adverse events in that study was very different than the others (upper gastrointestinal symptoms with regular gelatin capsules compared to more lower gastrointestinal symptoms with the timed release capsules used in all the other studies). In the pooled analyses, there was significantly more diarrhea and upper gastrointestinal symptoms with n-3 treatment compared to placebo. Nineteen per cent of n-3 patients had diarrhea compared to 14% of placebo patients (<LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>, 4 studies, 862 patients; RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.84).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2014-02-27 11:05:42 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Despite the fact that the EPIC studies did not show a clinical benefit to n-3, the pooled effect of the six included studies was marginally significant (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.98). However, this presumed benefit is probably misleading for several reasons:</P>
<P>1) There was a large degree of heterogeneity in the pooled analysis that could not be explained on the basis of different methodology of the studies;<BR/>2) The statistically significant benefit did not hold when including the estimated, rather than the actual,one year relapse rate (calculated using survival estimates to account for censored data), nor did it hold when the small pediatric study (<LINK REF="STD-Romano-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Romano 2005</LINK>) was excluded; and<BR/>3) A funnel plot suggested publication bias, wherein small negative trials were under-represented.</P>
<P>Taken together, it is likely that the rigorously performed EPIC studies produced more precise estimates of the true treatment effect than the pooled analysis. It is important to emphasize that the sample size of each EPIC study was approximately double the sample size of all other included studies combined.</P>
<P>This conclusion is disappointing in view of indirect evidence that supports the effectiveness of n-3 in modulating inflammation of IBD. Orally administered n-3 is readily incorporated in IBD affected bowel mucosa (<LINK REF="REF-Hillier-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hillier 1991</LINK>), thereby reducing the production of local proinflammatory cytokines (<LINK REF="REF-Hillier-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hillier 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meister-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meister 2005</LINK>). Fish oil also alters signaling pathways and has a direct effect on the expression of many genes (<LINK REF="REF-Bassaganya_x002d_Riera-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bassaganya-Riera 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Deckelbaum-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deckelbaum 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roy-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roy 2007</LINK>). Fish oil proved to be protective in animal models with experimental IBD (<LINK REF="REF-Nieto-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nieto 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Socha-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Socha 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vilaseca-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vilaseca 1990</LINK>). In a recent study, n-3 did not protect pigs from dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) induced IBD, but accelerated clinical remission (<LINK REF="REF-Bassaganya_x002d_Riera-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bassaganya-Riera 2006</LINK>). Finally, some reports indicated depleted serum n-3 in IBD patients (<LINK REF="REF-Kuroki-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuroki 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Siguel-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siguel 1996</LINK>), but this was not replicated by others (<LINK REF="REF-Figler-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Figler 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Socha-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Socha 2005</LINK>). An initial uncontrolled human study of fish oil supplementation, showed promising results for maintenance of remission in CD (<LINK REF="STD-Mate-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Mate 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is difficult to explain the limited or absent clinical benefit of n-3 in Crohn's disease in view of the strong biologic rationale and the extensive supportive evidence from tissue samples and animal models. One explanation may lie in the delivery system of the drug. However, the n-3 fatty acids were being consumed and absorbed in all studies, as reflected by decreased serum triglycerides and altered fatty acid composition of RBC. The dose might have been inadequate or the formulation not optimal. In a scientific study aimed to find the optimal chemical formulation in IBD, n-3 as enteric coated fatty acids with 60 minutes timed release had the highest serum and RBC incorporation rate and the lowest rate of adverse events, in comparison to different timed release and triglyceride compounds (<LINK REF="REF-Belluzzi-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belluzzi 1994</LINK>). The chemical formulation, thus, also seems to be important. It had been shown that the intestinal absorption of n-3 is higher with free fatty acids (e.g. Epanova<SUP>TM</SUP>) compared with triacylglycerol (e.g. Max-EPA) or ester formulations (<LINK REF="REF-el-Boustani-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">el Boustani 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lawson-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawson 1988</LINK>), probably due to enhanced absorption. Accordingly, the smaller effect size found in <LINK REF="STD-Romano-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Romano 2005</LINK> could be attributed to the ethyl ester formulation that was used compared to the free fatty acids used in the other studies. In contrast, the EPIC studies failed to show benefit with Epanova<SUP>TM</SUP> tablets that contain timed release free fatty acids (albeit in a soft gelatin capsules; the authors claim that its bioavailability is similar to the hard capsules used by <LINK REF="STD-Belluzzi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Belluzzi 1996</LINK>). Notwithstanding the abovementioned data, it does appear that the biological effect of n-3 is more complex than once believed, and likely includes both anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory actions (<LINK REF="REF-Hokari-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hokari 2013</LINK>). This is also supported by a few animal studies that actually demonstrated a worsening of experimental colitis in mice receiving n-3 supplementation (<LINK REF="REF-Matsunaga-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matsunaga 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Woodworth-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woodworth 2010</LINK>). It has also been suggested that the administration of n-3 to established patients, as in the human interventional studies reviewed here, is fundamentally different from the animal studies in which n-3 was generally administered before the onset of disease (<LINK REF="REF-Marion_x002d_Letellier-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marion-Letellier 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Fish oil is considered very safe, but in the pooled analyses troublesome adverse events such as diarrhea and upper gastrointestinal symptoms were more frequent than in controls. Findings that n-3 may alter LDL level, bleeding time and glucose level have not been consistently reproduced (<LINK REF="REF-Oh-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oh 2005</LINK>), and did not come up in any of the included studies. The non-serious but bothersome adverse events include unpleasant taste, halitosis, heartburn, nausea and diarrhea (<LINK REF="REF-Kim-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lorenz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Lorenz 1989</LINK>). It has been shown, that unlike raw fish, various over-the-counter n-3 preparations have at the most negligible amounts of mercury and organochlorines (<LINK REF="REF-Melanson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Melanson 2005</LINK>). Another concern relates to infants whose growth rate may be altered with high intake ratios of EPA to DHA (<LINK REF="REF-Akabas-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akabas 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>A limitation of this review is the clinical heterogeneity among the included studies. The studies used different preparations of omega-3 fatty acids, with different compositions and different delivery systems. The placebo also varied among the trials, and it is possible that these placebos were not inert, with potentially either positive or negative effects. One of the studies was in the post-operative setting and another examined only pediatric patients. On the other hand, the studies were very similar in other aspects: all included only CD patients in remission, and used a similar end point of relapse rate over an identical follow-up period of one year. The use of any drug during a quiescent period is a tradeoff between the efficacy for maintaining remission and the associated adverse events. The current effective maintenance therapies for Crohn's disease, immunomodulators and infliximab, possess potentially concerning adverse reactions. Besides serious short term adverse events (e.g. infections, infusion reactions, pancreatitis, hepatitis and severe cytopenia), it has been shown that 6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine (<LINK REF="REF-Kandiel-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kandiel 2005</LINK>), and recently also infliximab (<LINK REF="REF-Thayu-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thayu 2005</LINK>), may increase the risk of developing lymphoma. The search for an effective yet safe drug to maintain remission in Crohn's disease continues.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-10-20 10:36:41 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Further adequate sample-sized clinical trials are needed utilizing effective delivery methods of omega 3 fatty acids. Future studies should use different formulations of n-3 in the intervention arm, inert placebo oil, and include long-term outcome data. However, before more large scale RCTs evaluating omega 3 products are conducted further basic research regarding the putative mechanism of action and the role of local drug delivery is needed.<BR/>
