<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-08-10 17:21:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Bronchiectasis is a condition characterised by chronic pathological dilation of one or more bronchi. The condition, in the main, affects medium-large bronchi, either in a focal or diffuse pattern. Bronchiectasis may be caused by a wide variety of disease processes, which include congenital disorders, mechanical obstruction of the bronchi, respiratory infections, immunodeficiencies, and idiopathic (unknown) causes. Many of these conditions lead to impaired tracheobronchial clearance, resulting in recurrent lower respiratory tract infection and inflammation, leading to a cycle of infection, scarring and bronchial damage.</P>
<P>Symptoms of bronchiectasis include chronic productive cough, wheeze, and dyspnoea. Infective exacerbations of bronchiectasis are associated with worsening of these symptoms, possible development of respiratory failure, and features suggestive of systemic infection. The natural history of the condition is usually a slow but progressive deterioration in lung function over time, although some people may remain clinically stable for many years.</P>
<P>Medical treatment includes physiotherapy, antibiotics, bronchodilators and occasionally mucolytic drugs. Surgery is rarely performed and is reserved for localised disease. Airflow obstruction is common in this disease, so bronchodilators are widely used. In this review, we aimed to critically appraise evidence for the use of long-acting beta2-agonists in bronchiectasis.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2010-08-10 17:21:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>To determine whether long-acting beta2-agonists:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Are of symptomatic benefit in patients with bronchiectasis</LI>
<LI>Improve lung function in patients with bronchiectasis</LI>
<LI>Alter the long-term prognosis in patients with bronchiectasis</LI>

<SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2010-08-10 17:22:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials which is derived from systematic searches of bibliographic databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL, and handsearching of respiratory journals and meeting abstracts. The following search terms were used on all records coded as 'bronchiectasis':</P>
<P>(beta* and agonist*) or ventolin or salmeterol or serevent or formoterol or foradil or bambuterol</P>
<P>There were no restrictions used with respect to the language of publication. The most recent search was conducted in August 2010.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-08-07 16:28:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>The abstracts of papers identified from the search were read by the trials search co-ordinator of the Airways Group (Karen Blackhall) and by one reviewer (AS). All trials that appeared to satisfy the criteria for inclusion were identified for full review. It was our intention that two reviewers should independently select trials for inclusion in the review and also independently assess the methodological quality of the included trials with particular emphasis on allocation concealment, which will be ranked using the Cochrane approach. We planned to only include trials graded A or B in this review. Two sub-group analysis were planned:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Children versus adults</LI>
<LI>Severity (using FEV1 or exacerbation frequency criteria)</LI>
</OL>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2010-08-10 17:23:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Despite an exhaustive search of the literature, two studies were identified but both were excluded (see <LINK TAG="EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Excluded studies</LINK>). We were unable to identify any randomised controlled trials examining the efficacy or effectiveness of beta2-agonists in the management of bronchiectasis. An update search conducted in August 2008 did not identify any new studies.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-08-10 17:23:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Long acting bronchodilators have an established role in the management of airflow obstruction in asthma where they allow a reduction of inhaled steroid dose and reduce the frequency of exacerbations. By extension, they are also commonly used in the management of bronchiectasis where airflow obstruction is present, although there appears to be no high-quality evidence to support their use in this condition. Long-acting beta2-agonist treatment may have a role in the management of patients with co-existent asthma and bronchiectasis or where the bronchiectasis has caused or coexists with COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) but there is at present no clinical trial data to support this strategy beyond the evidence that exists independently for asthma and COPD.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>In the absence of identifying any experimental evidence, we are unable to either support or refute the continued use of bronchodilators for people with bronchiectasis. It is important that the conclusion of no evidence of effect is not confused with the conclusion that there is evidence of no effect.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There is a need for pragmatic randomised controlled trials to establish the role, if any, for bronchodilators in the management of bronchiectasis.</P>
