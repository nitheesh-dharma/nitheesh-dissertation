<P>This review is an update of a previously published review and is now currently up to date as from 18/07/2013.</P>
<P>Epilepsy is a disorder where recurrent seizures are caused by abnormal electrical discharges from the brain. Evidence from randomised controlled trials are often used to examine how effective and safe antiepileptic drugs are in people who experience such seizures. In this review 11 studies were included and data from a total of 2125 people with partial seizures are presented. Data from 6 of the studies were combined together in the analysis. All the participants including adults and children were previously taking at least one antiepileptic drug and all were continuing to experience seizures. Either gabapentin or a placebo drug was then added to the drug regime. The results showed that gabapentin effectively reduced seizures when used as an additional treatment. Compared to a placebo gabapentin was almost twice as likely to reduce seizures by 50% or more. The most common adverse effects associated with gabapentin are ataxia (poor co-ordination and unsteady gait), dizziness, fatigue, and drowsiness. Overall the quality of evidence is moderate as several details regarding study methods were unclear in the reports. Research is needed into the effects of the long-term use of gabapentin.</P>

<P>The majority of people with epilepsy have a good prognosis and their seizures are well controlled by a single antiepileptic drug, but up to 30% develop drug-resistant epilepsy, especially those with partial seizures. In this review we summarise the current evidence regarding the antiepileptic drug gabapentin, when used as an add-on treatment for drug-resistant partial epilepsy.</P>

<P>This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in <I>The</I> <I>Cochrane Library</I> 2009, Issue 4. We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group's Specialised Register (14 May 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2013, Issue 4, <I>The Cochrane Library</I>) (April 2013) and MEDLINE (1946 to 14 May 2013).

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-07-14 20:00:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, add-on trials of gabapentin in people with drug-resistant partial epilepsy. Trials using an active drug control group or which compared doses of gabapentin were also included in the review.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-07-14 20:01:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted the relevant data. We assessed the following outcomes: (a) seizure frequency and seizure freedom; (b) treatment withdrawal (any reason); (c) adverse effects. Primary analyses were intention-to-treat. We also undertook sensitivity best and worst-case analyses. We estimated summary risk ratios for each outcome and evaluated dose-response in regression models.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-07-18 13:02:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Eleven trials were included representing 2125 randomised participants. We combined data from six trials in meta-analyses of 1206 randomised participants. The overall risk ratio (RR) for 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency compared to placebo was 1.89 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.40 to 2.55). Dose regression analysis (for trials in adults) shows increasing efficacy with increasing dose, with 25.3% (19.3 to 32.3) of people responding to 1800 mg of gabapentin compared to 9.7% on placebo, a 15.5% increase in response rate (8.5 to 22.5). The RR for treatment withdrawal compared to placebo was 1.05 (95% CI 0.74 to 1.49). Adverse effects were significantly associated with gabapentin compared to placebo. Risk ratios were as follows: ataxia 2.01 (99% CI 0.98 to 4.11), dizziness 2.43 (99% CI 1.44 to 4.12), fatigue 1.95 (99% CI 0.99 to 3.82) and somnolence 1.93 (99% CI 1.22 to 3.06). No significant differences were found for the adverse effects of headache (RR 0.79, 99% CI 0.46 to 1.35) or nausea (RR 0.95, 99% CI 0.52 to 1.73). Overall the studies together are rated as low/unclear risk of bias due to information on each risk of bias domain not being available.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-07-14 20:01:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Gabapentin has efficacy as an add-on treatment in people with drug-resistant partial epilepsy. However, the trials reviewed were of relatively short duration and provide no evidence for the long-term efficacy of gabapentin beyond a three-month period. The results cannot be extrapolated to monotherapy or to people with other epilepsy types.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-07-14 20:06:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review is an update of a previously published review in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (<I>The Cochrane Library </I>2009,<I> </I>Issue 4) on 'Gabapentin add-on for drug-resistant partial epilepsy'. The purpose of this update is to summarise current understanding of the role of gabapentin as an add-on treatment in partial epilepsy resistant to at least one other antiepileptic drug (AED). Evidence has been taken from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) using placebo, other AED or varying doses of gabapentin to compare its efficacy in seizure control and tolerability. There is no internationally accepted definition of drug resistance, so for the purpose of this review we considered people drug-resistant if they have partial-onset seizures (simple partial and/or complex partial and/or secondary generalised tonic-clonic seizures) and have failed to respond to at least one monotherapy AED. In addition to work published previously, we report best and worse-case sensitivity analyses for the main efficacy outcome (50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency) and give estimates of the number needed to treat (NNT) for individual doses using robust methods.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-07-14 20:06:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder characterised by recurrent seizures. The majority of people given a diagnosis of epilepsy have a good prognosis and their seizures will be controlled by treatment with a single AED (<LINK REF="REF-Reynolds-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reynolds 1981</LINK>), however up to 30% will continue to have seizures despite treatment with adequate doses of AEDs, often requiring treatment with a combination (<LINK REF="REF-Cockerell-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cockerell 1995</LINK>). These individuals represent a significant therapeutic problem when one realises that up to two to three per cent of the population will suffer from epilepsy at some time in their lives (<LINK REF="REF-Hauser-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hauser 1993</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-07-14 20:06:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>With the development of new AEDs clinicians are faced with an increasing number of drugs to choose from in the treatment of refractory individuals. Initially, new AEDs are tested in people with refractory partial-onset epilepsy as add-on treatment, in randomised, placebo-controlled trials.This review is one in a series (also published elsewhere (<LINK REF="REF-Marson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marson 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marson 1997</LINK>)) in which the efficacy and tolerability of six new AEDs (gabapentin, lamotrigine, tiagabine, topiramate, vigabatrin and zonisamide) are investigated in people with drug-resistant partial epilepsy. Current first-line treatment for partial epilepsy includes: lamotrigine, sodium valproate, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine and levetiracetam. When first-line medications fail to achieve seizure freedom, add-on therapy is required.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-07-14 20:06:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The mechanism of action of gabapentin is uncertain (<LINK REF="REF-McClean-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">McClean 1995</LINK>). It was licensed for add-on use in the UK in 1993. Gabapentin is a structural analogue of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). It does, however, cross the blood brain barrier and its activities are believed not to be GABA-related. Gabapentin has a high volume of distribution, is not significantly protein-bound or metabolised, and does not induce or inhibit hepatic enzymes; thus it has minimal to no known interactions with other AEDs.</P>

<P>The preferred estimate was the Mantel-Haenszel risk ratio (RR). For the outcomes 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency and treatment withdrawal, we used 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

<P>We examined dose-response relationships using logistic regression (for the five adult trials) and calculated probabilities for the following for differing doses: (i) the percentage of participants having a 50% response; (ii) the difference in the percentage of participants responding to each dose compared to placebo. A binary variable was defined with value 0 if the response was less than 50% and value 1 otherwise. We examined dose-response relationships using logistic regression, in the framework of generalised linear models, using the package GLIM, with this binary variable as the outcome variable (<LINK REF="REF-McCullagh-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCullagh 1989</LINK>). Trial effects were not included in the regression models as it was generally not possible to do so as some doses are confounded with trials. As none of the tests for heterogeneity reached a significance level of less than 30%, it seemed reasonable to proceed without trial effects.</P>

<P>There were seven trials which compared gabapentin to a placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Anhut-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Anhut 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Appleton-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Appleton 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leach-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Leach 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sivenius--1991" TYPE="STUDY">Sivenius 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-UK-Gabapentin-1990" TYPE="STUDY">UK Gabapentin 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-US-Gabapentin-1993" TYPE="STUDY">US Gabapentin 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yamauchi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Yamauchi 2006</LINK>), two trials which examined two different doses of gabapentin (<LINK REF="STD-Fisher-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Fisher 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tomovic-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tomovic 1999</LINK>), one trial which compared gabapentin to vigabatrin (<LINK REF="STD-Lindberger-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lindberger 2000</LINK>) and one trial which compared gabapentin to lamotrigine (<LINK REF="STD-Sethi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sethi 2002</LINK>). All patients had drug-resistant partial epilepsy and were taking at least one monotherapy AED. Pre-existing AED regimes remained unchanged throughout the study period. All outcome measures included seizure reduction and adverse events.</P>
<P>One parallel trial (<LINK REF="STD-Anhut-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Anhut 1994</LINK>) had a 12-week pre-randomisation baseline period and a 12-week treatment period of gabapentin 900 mg/day (n = 111) or gabapentin 1200 mg/day (n = 52) or placebo (109). Study medication was administered three times daily (TDS). Included patients had a minimum of six partial seizures within the baseline period and were aged 12 years or over. Women of childbearing potential on adequate contraception and patients with additional seizure types were also included in this study.</P>
<P>The baseline period in one parallel trial (<LINK REF="STD-Appleton-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Appleton 1999</LINK>) was six weeks in duration and had a treatment period of 12 weeks. Gabapentin (600 to 1200 mg/day) was administered TDS and this was dependent on the weight of the patient. One hundred and twenty-eight patients were randomised to the placebo group and 119 were randomised to gabapentin. Patients were children who were aged less than 12 years old and had a minimum of four seizures during the baseline period.</P>
<P>One cross-over trial (<LINK REF="STD-Leach-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Leach 1997</LINK>) was another placebo-controlled study which did not have a pre-randomised baseline period, however all patients reported at least four seizures per month for the previous three months. There were four treatment arms (gabapentin 1200 mg/day, 1800 mg/day, 2400 mg/day and placebo each administered on a TDS basis). All patients received all doses/placebo in a cross-over design with a four-week washout period between each treatment arm. Twenty-seven patients were recruited and 23 were analysed. In view of the lack of a pre-randomised baseline period it has not been included in the meta-analysis.</P>
<P>A parallel trial (<LINK REF="STD-Sivenius--1991" TYPE="STUDY">Sivenius 1991</LINK>) had a baseline period of three months in duration in which adults with partial epilepsy experienced four or more seizures a month. Patients were randomised to either 900 mg of gabapentin (n = 16), 1200 mg of gabapentin (n = 9) or placebo (n = 18). Treatment medication was administered TDS and lasted 12 weeks.</P>
<P>One further parallel trial (<LINK REF="STD-UK-Gabapentin-1990" TYPE="STUDY">UK Gabapentin 1990</LINK>) had a three-month baseline period where included patients had at least one partial seizure per week. This study had a two-week initiation phase of 600 mg/day of gabapentin or placebo administered TDS, after which patients began a 12-week treatment period of 1200 mg/day taken TDS. Sixty-six adults were randomised to placebo and 61 to gabapentin 1200 mg/day.</P>
<P>Another parallel trial (<LINK REF="STD-US-Gabapentin-1993" TYPE="STUDY">US Gabapentin 1993</LINK>) recruited 306 adults, randomising 53 patients to gabapentin 600 mg/day, 101 patients to 1200 mg/day, 54 patients to 1800 mg/day and 98 to placebo. Treatment medication was administered TDS for 12 weeks. The study implemented an initiation period of two to three days of either 300 mg or 600 mg/day up to the required dose. The baseline period was three months and included patients who had a minimum of four partial seizures per month.</P>
<P>The last trial examining gabapentin versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Yamauchi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Yamauchi 2006</LINK>) had a baseline period of 12 weeks and included patients who had a minimum of eight partial seizures during baseline. Adults were randomised into one of three treatment arms: gabapentin 1200 mg/day (n = 86), 1800 mg/day (n = 41) and placebo (n = 82). Treatment medication was taken TDS over 12 weeks.</P>
<P>Two randomised controlled trials were gabapentin dose trials which had no placebo group (<LINK REF="STD-Fisher-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Fisher 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tomovic-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tomovic 1999</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Fisher-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Fisher 2001</LINK> compared slow initiation (300 mg on day one, 600 mg on day two and then 900 mg per day for five days) and rapid initiation of gabapentin (placebo for the first two days followed by 900 mg/day for five days). Three hundred and sixty were randomised to the slow initiation group and 360 were randomised to the rapid initiation dose. There was no baseline period; patients were required to have been taking at least one AED for one month prior to the study and were considered to have inadequate seizure control as defined by the authors. Patients were aged 12 years or older. The trial period was seven days. <LINK REF="STD-Tomovic-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tomovic 1999</LINK> compared 900 mg/day of gabapentin versus 1200 mg/day of gabapentin administered TDS over 12 weeks. Nine patients were randomised to each dose group. There was no formal baseline period; included patients were considered to have unsatisfactorily controlled seizures while taking at least one first-line AED for three months prior to the study, as defined by the authors.</P>
<P>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lindberger-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lindberger 2000</LINK>) compared gabapentin to lamotrigine; it had an eight-week baseline period. All participants had tried no more than two AED monotherapy regimens and were on one AED at the time of study (this had to exclude phenytoin). A minimum seizure frequency of four seizures during an eight-week baseline period and two or more seizures during the last month was required. One hundred and two patients (aged 12 to 75) were randomised to receive either gabapentin or vigabatrin add-on treatment. A flexible dosing regime was established over the subsequent 24 weeks: gabapentin variable dose 1800 mg/day minimum, then 2400 mg and then a maximum of 3600 mg/day, increased every eight weeks as tolerated. The vigabatrin initial dose was 1000 mg, then 2000 mg, then 4000 mg, increased in the same manner (as tolerated by adverse effects) and increased if complete seizure freedom had not be attained. The total trial period was 24 weeks, however, outcome measures were taken at eight weeks (awaiting clarification from author).</P>
<P>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Sethi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sethi 2002</LINK>) compared gabapentin to lamotrigine treatment of patients refractory to the maximum tolerated dose of carbamazepine monotherapy, with a seizure duration of two years or less. Twenty-seven patients were randomised to the gabapentin group and 25 to lamotrigine and were aged 10 to 60. Baseline seizure frequency was at least four seizures despite treatment (unclear over what time frame). The baseline period was time of enrolment. The trial period was 12 weeks. Gabapentin was administered at a dose of 300 mg on day one, 300 mg twice daily (BD) on day two and thereafter an increment of 300 mg was made daily until seizures were controlled or toxic effects appeared. Lamotrigine was started at 50 mg per day for two weeks, then 50 mg BD for two weeks, then increased by 50 to 100 mg every two weeks until seizures were controlled or there were toxic effects.</P>

<P>Given that all participants had drug-resistant partial epilepsy, it seemed reasonable to combine results from the paediatric and adult studies, for an overall estimate (irrespective of dose). Data from the paediatric study could not be included in dose regression models, as individuals were not randomised to a specific daily dose. Data for this outcome were provided by six trials (<LINK REF="STD-Anhut-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Anhut 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Appleton-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Appleton 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sivenius--1991" TYPE="STUDY">Sivenius 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-UK-Gabapentin-1990" TYPE="STUDY">UK Gabapentin 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-US-Gabapentin-1993" TYPE="STUDY">US Gabapentin 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yamauchi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Yamauchi 2006</LINK>).

<P>A Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test of heterogeneity suggests no significant statistical heterogeneity (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 4.13, df = 4, P = 0.53, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%). The overall RR for withdrawal for any reason is 1.05 (95% CI 0.74 to 1.49), hence there is insufficient evidence to conclude that individuals are more likely to withdraw from gabapentin than placebo, but there could be a substantial withdrawal rate.</P>

Our understanding is that the outcomes for the two treatment arms were combined, thus a comparison between the two treatment groups cannot be made. Another study (<LINK REF="STD-Fisher-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Fisher 2001</LINK>) only measured adverse events at day two and day seven of a slow initiation regime and a rapid initiation regime, therefore this will be presented narratively narrative below.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-07-14 20:06:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All trials included in this review were sponsored by Parke Davis, apart from <LINK REF="STD-Sethi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sethi 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Tomovic-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tomovic 1999</LINK>. Five out of the 11 studies used adequate methods of concealment of randomisation. All trials were double-blind, however often little information was reported as to how personnel/outcome assessors were blinded. For the studies included in the meta-analysis, apart from <LINK REF="STD-Yamauchi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Yamauchi 2006</LINK>, published reports referred to their analyses as being intention-to-treat, with a total of 99 (of the 1206 participants recruited) excluded from analyses. Reported analyses would perhaps be better called 'exploratory', as participants who (a) had treatment withdrawn during the treatment period; and (b) did not meet the original trial inclusion criteria, were excluded from the reported analyses, despite completing the treatment period with adequate seizure data. Additional data, supplied by Parke Davis, reveal that a total of 38 did not complete the treatment phase and nine had inadequate seizure data recorded, hence the percentage reduction in seizure frequency could not be calculated for 47 of these participants. The <LINK REF="STD-Yamauchi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Yamauchi 2006</LINK> study does state that 19 participants were not included in the study and provides reasons. Similarly, there was a high risk of attrition bias in the remaining studies which we discussed in narrative form (<LINK REF="STD-Fisher-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Fisher 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leach-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Leach 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tomovic-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tomovic 1999</LINK>), apart from the <LINK REF="STD-Lindberger-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lindberger 2000</LINK> study for which analysis was completely intention-to-treat. The <LINK REF="STD-Sethi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sethi 2002</LINK> study did not give any information related to drop-outs and therefore the risk is uncertain. Selective outcome reporting bias was unclear in <LINK REF="STD-Leach-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Leach 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lindberger-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lindberger 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sethi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sethi 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Tomovic-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tomovic 1999</LINK> as they mention 'seizure activity recorded' without details of the methodology. There are also discrepancies between study designs which may be reflected in the variability of the results. These potential biases have been outlined in each of the outcome measures below.</P>
<P>The results of the overall efficacy analysis show that gabapentin reduces seizure frequency when used as an add-on antiepileptic drug (AED) in people with drug-resistant partial epilepsy. The dose-response regression analysis shows increasing efficacy with increasing dose. There is considerable discrepancy between the results of the intention-to-treat and best and worst-case analyses, hence the intention-to-treat analyses need to be interpreted with some caution (<I>see</I> <LINK TAG="IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH" TYPE="SECTION">Implications for research</LINK>). Results suggest that the therapeutic effect of 600 mg per day, although statistically significant, is small and 900 mg would seem a better initial dose. In addition, there is no plateauing of therapeutic effects at the doses tested and it may well be that optimal doses of gabapentin have not been tested. This is also reflected to a much greater extent by the studies described in narrative form. The <LINK REF="STD-Tomovic-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tomovic 1999</LINK> study reported 72.2% of the 18 patients evaluated as having a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency outcome (compared to 16% to 22% taken from meta-analysis studies) even though the demographics and treatment doses were comparable. Similarly, the head-to-head trials reported a 54% and 77% response rate (<LINK REF="STD-Lindberger-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lindberger 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sethi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sethi 2002</LINK> respectively). This could potentially be due to two key differences in methodology: the definition of 'drug-resistant' partial epilepsy and to the dosing regimes. <LINK REF="STD-Lindberger-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lindberger 2000</LINK> defined drug resistance as failure to respond to no more than two AED monotherapy regimes and gabapentin was always added to monotherapy. <LINK REF="STD-Sethi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sethi 2002</LINK> only recruited patients refractory to carbamazepine monotherapy and 88% of participants in the <LINK REF="STD-Tomovic-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tomovic 1999</LINK> study were on one other AED only. As the remaining studies used patients with refractory partial seizures who were established on one or two AEDs and stable doses (apart from <LINK REF="STD-Appleton-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Appleton 1999</LINK> who allowed three AEDs), the former patient populations are likely to have a less refractory epilepsy. In addition, <LINK REF="STD-Lindberger-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lindberger 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sethi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sethi 2002</LINK> used a flexible dosing regime, allowing doses of gabapentin to be increased as tolerated. This high flexibility made dose adjustments possible in response to a lack of seizure control, with doses of 3600 mg gabapentin per day allowed. This may be reflective of the increased efficacy of gabapentin at higher doses yet this flexible dosing method does result in complexity when interpreting the results as the final doses achieved to maintain seizure control have not been specified. At the other end of the spectrum in the <LINK REF="STD-Leach-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Leach 1997</LINK> study, despite allowing doses of 2400 mg, only two out of 23 (8.7%) patients achieved 50% or greater partial seizure control; this may be reflective of the small sample size and the cross-over design. All patients received all doses (1200 mg, 1800 mg and 2400 mg) with a washout period of four weeks between doses; this dosing pattern may have influenced the efficacy of gabapentin, which may have resulted in period and carry-over effects.</P>
<P>The studies reviewed were all of short duration and no conclusions can be drawn regarding the long-term efficacy of gabapentin. Only one trial recruited children only (<LINK REF="STD-Appleton-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Appleton 1999</LINK>) and the estimate for seizure reduction was low in that study. Caution is required when extrapolating the results of this trial to adults.</P>
<P>Results for the outcome 'withdrawal of allocated treatment' suggest that gabapentin is well tolerated, as no significant difference was found between gabapentin and placebo. However, the efficacy results suggest that optimal doses of gabapentin may not have been tested and it may well be that higher doses of gabapentin are less well tolerated.</P>
<P>With respect to adverse effects, dizziness, fatigue and somnolence were significantly more likely to occur in the gabapentin-treated group. There were insufficient data available for this review to delineate the precise adverse effect profile of this drug.</P>
<P>The results of this review indicate that gabapentin is an effective add-on treatment. Only two head-to-head trials were found (<LINK REF="STD-Lindberger-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lindberger 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sethi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sethi 2002</LINK>) with both studies not indicating a significant difference between gabapentin and the alternative AED (vigabatrin and lamotrigine). As clinicians are faced with an ever increasing number of antiepileptic drugs to choose from, more head-to-head trials are required to provide the evidence that is needed to enable clinicians to make an evidence-based choice between AEDs.</P>
<P>It still remains difficult to predict the differences between a rapid and slow initiation of gabapentin, as the <LINK REF="STD-Fisher-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Fisher 2001</LINK> study only observed the effects of rapid initiation on the first day of starting the maximum dose and four days later. However, they did contact patients for the subsequent two weeks to report any serious outcomes. These have not been documented in the report, therefore it is difficult to extrapolate data beyond this period.</P>
<P>In terms of seizure subtypes, <LINK REF="STD-Sethi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sethi 2002</LINK> reported gabapentin's more pronounced effects on simple partial seizures and secondary generalised as opposed to complex partial seizures. This is contrary to the <LINK REF="STD-US-Gabapentin-1993" TYPE="STUDY">US Gabapentin 1993</LINK> study, which observed gabapentin to be more efficacious in complex partial seizures.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Kwan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kwan 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Shapiro-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Shapiro 2000</LINK> papers have been placed in the awaiting classification section as only abstracts are obtainable, therefore it is not possible to critique the study design (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_AWAITING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of studies awaiting classification</LINK>).</P>
<P>This review focuses on the use of gabapentin in drug-resistant partial epilepsy and the results cannot be generalised to add-on treatment in people with generalised epilepsy. Likewise, no inference can be made about the efficacy and tolerability of gabapentin when used as monotherapy.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-07-18 09:51:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In people with drug-resistant partial epilepsy, gabapentin has efficacy as an add-on treatment. Our results suggest that a dose of 1800 mg per day will reduce seizure frequency by at least 50% in 25.3% of people (95% confidence interval 19.3 to 32.3). Although our results suggest that 600 mg has a statistically significant effect on seizure frequency, that effect is small and 900 mg per day would seem a more reasonable initial dose. Regression analyses show no plateauing of therapeutic effect and it is likely that optimal doses need to be tested in a more standardised manner and final doses provided so that such results can be included in meta-analyses in the future. Doses of up to 2400 mg per day are currently recommended in the <LINK REF="REF-British-National-Formulary" TYPE="REFERENCE">British National Formulary</LINK>.</P>
<P>Dizziness, fatigue and somnolence were significant adverse effects although gabapentin is generally well tolerated.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">(1) The conduct of future 'add-on' trials</HEADING>
<P>The striking differences between the intention-to-treat, worst and best-case analyses for 50% responder rates has important implications for the conduct of further 'add-on' studies. For the intention-to-treat analysis in this review, all participants lost to follow-up or excluded from analyses due to inadequate seizure recording are assumed to be 'non-responders'. The best-case and worst-case analyses, although representing the extreme, test the effect of making that assumption. When large discrepancies are found, as in this case, the accuracy of individual trials and hence this review is challenged.</P>
<P>The main problem here is that participants having trial treatment withdrawn are no longer followed up. This provides a data set which allows an explanatory 'on treatment analysis', but precludes a robust intention-to-treat analysis. To minimise this problem, every attempt must be made to follow individuals up, even if trial treatment has been withdrawn. This provides the maximum data set from which analyses other than intention-to-treat may be undertaken.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">(2) Further evaluation of gabapentin as an antiepileptic drug</HEADING>
<P>To further evaluate the place of gabapentin in the armamentarium of available antiepileptic drugs, further studies are required which address the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the efficacy and tolerability of add-on doses higher than 1800 mg per day in people with drug-resistant partial epilepsy, in clearly specified doses and a clarification as to maximum doses achieved when flexible regimes are employed;</LI>
<LI>the long-term efficacy and tolerability of add-on gabapentin beyond three months;</LI>
<LI>how gabapentin compares with other add-on treatments in drug-resistant partial epilepsy;</LI>
<LI>the role of gabapentin in childhood epilepsies; and</LI>
<LI>how gabapentin compares with other standard antiepileptic drugs, such as sodium valproate, as monotherapy in generalised epilepsy.</LI>
