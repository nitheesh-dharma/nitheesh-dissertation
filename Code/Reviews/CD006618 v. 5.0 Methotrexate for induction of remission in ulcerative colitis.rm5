<TITLE>Methotrexate for treatment of chronic active ulcerative colitis</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-10-03 09:50:18 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>
<B>What is ulcerative colitis?</B>
</P>
<P>Ulcerative colitis is a long-term (chronic) inflammatory bowel disease characterized by pains (abdominal cramping), a need to rush to the toilet to pass feces (fecal urgency) and bloody diarrhea. </P>
<P>
<B>What is methotrexate?</B>
</P>
<P>Methotrexate is a medicine that reduces the body's natural immune responses and may reduce the inflammation associated with ulcerative colitis. When people with ulcerative colitis are experiencing the symptoms of the disease it is said to be &#8216;active&#8217;; periods when the symptoms stop are called &#8216;remission&#8217;.</P>
<P>
<B>What did the researchers investigate?</B>
</P>
<P>The researchers investigated whether methotrexate produces remission in people with active ulcerative colitis, and whether it causes any harms (side effects). The researchers searched the medical literature extensively up to June 26, 2014.</P>
<P>
<B>What did the researchers find?</B>
</P>
<P>The researchers identified two studies that included a total of 101 participants. One was a high quality study (67 participants) that compared oral methotrexate (12.5 mg/week) to a placebo (a sugar pill or fake medicine). The other study (34 participants) compared oral methotrexate (15 mg/week) against 6-mercaptopurine (an immunosuppressive drug at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg/day) and against 5-aminosalicylic acid (an anti-inflammatory drug at a dose of 3 g/day). </P>
<P>In the high quality study, there was no difference between the methotrexate and placebo treatment groups for the number of people who achieved remission and were able to stop taking steroids. This suggests that, when used at this low dose (12.5 mg/week), methotrexate does not produce remission from ulcerative colitis. However, this result is uncertain because of the small number of people who were assessed. </P>
<P>The other, smaller study showed no differences between methotrexate and the other treatments in the proportion of participants who experienced remission and were able to stop taking steroids. This result is also uncertain due to poor study design and the low number of participants.</P>
<P>The side effects reported in the two studies included leucopenia (a decrease in the number of white blood cells), migraine, rash, nausea and dyspepsia (indigestion), mild alopecia (hair loss), mild increase in levels of an enzyme found in the liver (aspartate aminotransferase), a collection of pus in the abdominal tissue (peritoneal abscess), abnormally low levels of the protein albumin in the blood (hypoalbuminemia), and pneumonia. </P>
<P>At present, the results from medical trials do not support the use of low dose oral methotrexate (12.5 mg to 15 mg/week) for the production of remission in active ulcerative colitis. It is not known whether a higher dose of oral methotrexate, or giving methotrexate by a different route (e.g. by injection), would increase the likelihood of remission. </P>
<P>In future, researchers should consider organising a study with a larger number of participants who receive a higher dose of oral methotrexate. Currently, there are two large studies being run that compare a higher dose of methotrexate &#8211; given by injection &#8211; with placebo in people with active ulcerative colitis (the METEOR and MERIT-UC studies). The results of these studies may resolve the uncertainty surrounding the use of methotrexate for the treatment of active ulcerative colitis.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-08-26 14:12:05 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease. Corticosteroids and 5-aminosalicylates are the most commonly used therapies. However, many patients require immunosuppressive therapy for steroid-refractory and steroid-dependent disease. Methotrexate is a medication that is effective for treating a variety of inflammatory diseases, including Crohn's disease. This review was performed to determine the effectiveness of methotrexate treatment in UC patients. This review is an update of a previously published Cochrane review. </P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-08-26 14:12:03 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>To assess the efficacy and safety of methotrexate for induction of remission in patients with UC.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-08-26 14:12:16 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL and the Cochrane IBD/FBD group specialized trials register were searched from from inception to June 26, 2014. Study references and review papers were also searched for additional trials. Abstracts from major gastroenterological meetings were searched to identify research published in abstract form only.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomized controlled trials comparing methotrexate with placebo or an active comparator in patients with active ulcerative colitis were considered for inclusion. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-08-26 14:11:58 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Two authors independently reviewed studies for eligibility, extracted data and assessed study quality using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients who achieved clinical remission and withdrawal from steroids as defined by the studies and expressed as a percentage of the total number of patients randomized (intention-to-treat analysis). We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for dichotomous outcomes. The overall quality of the evidence supporting the primary outcome was assessed using the GRADE criteria. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-08-26 14:11:56 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Two studies (n = 101 patients) were included in the review. One study (n = 67) compared oral methotrexate 12.5 mg/week) to placebo. The other study (n = 34) compared oral methotrexate (15 mg/week) to 6-mercaptopurine (1.5 mg/kg/day) and 5-aminosalicylic acid (3 g/day). The placebo-controlled study was judged to be at low risk of bias. The other study was judged to be at high risk of bias due to an open-label design. There was no statistically significant difference in clinical remission rates between methotrexate and placebo patients. Forty-seven per cent (14/30) of methotrexate patients achieved clinical remission and complete withdrawal from steroids during the study period compared to 49% (18/37) of placebo patients (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.59. A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was low due to very sparse data (32 events). There were no statistically significant differences in the proportion of patients who achieved clinical remission and withdrawal from steroids in the study comparing oral methotrexate to 6-mercaptopurine and 5-aminosalicylic acid. At 30 weeks, 58% (7/12) of methotrexate patients achieved clinical remission and withdrawal from steroids compared to 79% (11/14) of 6-mercaptopurine patients (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.29) and 25% of 5-aminosalicylic acid patients (RR 2.33, 95% CI 0.64 to 8.49). GRADE analyses indicated that the overall quality of the evidence was very low due to very sparse data (18 and 9 events respectively) and and high risk of bias. In the placebo-controlled trial two patients (7%) were withdrawn from the methotrexate group due to adverse events (leucopenia, migraine) compared to one patient (3%) who had a rash in the placebo group (RR 2.47, 95% CI 0.23 to 25.91). Adverse events experienced by methotrexate patients in the active comparator study included nausea and dyspepsia, mild alopecia, mild increase in aspartate aminotransferase levels, peritoneal abscess, hypoalbuminemia, severe rash and atypical pneumonia. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-08-26 14:09:25 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Although methotrexate was well-tolerated, the studies showed no benefit for methotrexate over placebo or active comparators. The results for efficacy outcomes between methotrexate and placebo, methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate and 5-aminosalicylic acid were uncertain. Whether a higher dose or parenteral administration would be effective for induction therapy is unknown. At present there is no evidence supporting the use of methotrexate for induction of remission in active ulcerative colitis. A trial in which larger numbers of patients receive a higher dose of oral methotrexate should be considered. Currently there are two large ongoing placebo-controlled trials (METEOR and MERIT-UC) assessing the efficacy and safety of intramuscular or subcutaneous methotrexate in patients with active UC which may help resolve the evidence supporting the use of methotrexate as therapy for active of ulcerative colitis.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-08-26 14:14:07 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease characterized by abdominal cramping, fecal urgency and bloody diarrhea. The most commonly used therapies for patients with ulcerative colitis are 5-aminosalicylates and corticosteroids. However, many patients require immunosuppressive agents when their disease becomes steroid-refractory or dependent. Azathioprine, while modestly effective at maintaining remission in patients with quiescent ulcerative colitis (<LINK REF="REF-Hawthorne-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawthorne 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jewell-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jewell 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Timmer-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Timmer 2012</LINK>), has shown mixed results when studied for remission induction in active disease (<LINK REF="REF-Ardizzone-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ardizzone 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jewell-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jewell 1974</LINK>). Cyclosporine may be effective in treating patients with severe disease, but with potentially significant toxicity (<LINK REF="REF-Shibolet-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shibolet 2005</LINK>). More recently, infliximab has been proven to be beneficial for inducing and maintaining remission in patients who have failed other therapies (<LINK REF="REF-Lawson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawson 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rutgeerts-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutgeerts 2005</LINK>). However, despite these treatment advances, a proportion of ulcerative colitis patients still require colectomy for refractory disease (<LINK REF="REF-Bach-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bach 2006</LINK>), and the identification of other effective therapies is an important area of research.</P>
<P>Methotrexate, a dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor, has been shown to be effective for both induction and maintenance of remission in patients with Crohn's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Feagan-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feagan 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Feagan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feagan 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Patel-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 2014</LINK>). Although ulcerative colitis shares some clinical and pathological features with Crohn's disease, and some treatments are similar, therapies effective for one type of inflammatory bowel disease are not necessarily effective for the other, and data regarding efficacy of interventions cannot be extrapolated from studies of one disease to the other. This systematic review is an update of a previously published Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Chande-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chande 2007</LINK>).</P>

<SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2014-08-26 14:15:08 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>See: Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Functional Bowel Disorders Group search strategy.</P>
<P>MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Cochrane IBD/FBD group specialized trials register were searched from inception to June 26, 2014 to identify relevant publications. The search strategies are reported in <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>. Review papers on ulcerative colitis, and references from identified papers were also searched in an effort to identify additional studies. Abstracts from major gastroenterological meetings were searched to identify research published in abstract form only.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-08-26 14:15:25 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Study selection<BR/>Two authors (YW and JKM) independently reviewed the studies identified by the literature search to determine eligibility for inclusion based on the criteria identified above. Studies published in abstract form only were to be included only if the authors could be contacted for further information.</P>
<P>Data collection<BR/>A data extraction form was developed and used to extract data from included studies. Two authors (YW, JKM) independently extracted data. Any disagreements were resolved by consensus.</P>
<P>Statistical analysis<BR/>Data were analyzed using Review Manager (RevMan 5.3.3). Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis, and treated dichotomously. In the future if any cross-over studies are identified, only data from the first arm will be included. The primary endpoint was induction of remission, as defined by the studies. Data were to be combined for analysis if they assessed the same treatments (methotrexate versus placebo or other therapy). If a comparison was only assessed in a single trial, the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated and P-values were derived using the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test. If the comparison is assessed in more than one trial, summary test statistics were to be derived using the pooled RR and corresponding 95% CI. The presence of heterogeneity among studies was to be assessed using the Chi<SUP>2 </SUP>test (a P value of 0.10 was to be regarded as statistically significant). If statistically significant heterogeneity was identified the RR and 95% CI were to be calculated using a random-effects model.</P>
<P>Quality assessment<BR/>The methodological quality of the included studies was evaluated using the Cochrane risk of bias tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). This tool involves rating trials as high, low or unclear risk for each of the following criteria:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Randomization sequence generation;</LI>
<LI>Allocation concealment;</LI>
<LI>Blinding;</LI>
<LI>Missing data and attrition;</LI>
<LI>Outcome reporting; and</LI>
<LI>Other sources of bias.</LI>
</OL>
<P>The overall quality of the evidence was evaluated using the GRADE approach (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2011</LINK>). Outcome data are rated as being of high, moderate, low or very low quality evidence. Data from randomized controlled trials begin as high quality but can be downgraded based on the following criteria:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Risk of bias in the included trials;</LI>
<LI>Indirect evidence;</LI>
<LI>Inconsistent findings (including unexplained heterogeneity);</LI>
<LI>Imprecision (i.e. sparse data or wide confidence interval or both); and</LI>
<LI>Reporting bias.</LI>
</OL>
<P>The different quality ratings are interpreted as the likelihood that future research would affect the estimate of effect. An estimate of effect based on high quality evidence is unlikely to change with further research. If the overall evidence is of moderate quality further research may have an impact on our confidence in the estimate and may change the estimate. Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate when the evidence is rated as low quality. Very low quality research means that we are very uncertain about the finding (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2011</LINK>).</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2014-08-26 14:15:34 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>A literature search conducted on June 26, 2014 identified 2776 records. After duplicates were removed, a total of 2481 records remained for review of titles and abstracts. Two authors (YW and JKM) independently reviewed the titles and abstracts of these trials and 30 records were selected for full text review (see <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>).

<LINK REF="STD-Oren-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 1996</LINK>
<BR/>This trial included 67 patients (35 male, 32 female) with chronic active steroid-dependent ulcerative colitis (defined by typical clinical, radiographic, endoscopic, and pathological criteria). Disease chronicity was defined by the requirement of steroid therapy (minimum 7.5 mg/day) for 4 months of the preceding 12 months. Current use of mesalamine or steroids was permitted. Steroid therapy was to be tapered and discontinued within 2 to 3 months of study entry, but could be restarted or the dose increased as clinically indicated. No immunosuppressive agents could be used in the three months prior to entry . Active disease was defined by a Mayo clinic score of <U>&gt;</U> 7 at study entry. The patients were randomized to oral methotrexate 12.5 mg/week (n = 30) or identical placebo (n = 37) for 9 months. The patients were seen at regular intervals during the nine months. At each visit, the Mayo clinic score was calculated, and a sigmoidoscopy was also performed every three months. The primary outcomes were the proportion of patients who achieved their first remission as well as the maintenance of remission in those patients. The definition of remission was a Mayo clinic score of <U>&lt;</U> 3 (or <U>&lt;</U> 2 without sigmoidoscopy results), and complete withdrawal from steroid therapy.</P>

<BR/>This study enrolled 34 patients with ulcerative colitis (and 38 patients with Crohn's disease). All patients had steroid-dependent disease (Mayo clinic score of <U>&gt;</U> 7 despite prednisone <U>&gt;</U> 20 mg/day), but all other therapies were stopped at least 6 months before study entry. The patients were randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to 6-mercaptopurine 1.5 mg/kg/day (n = 14), methotrexate 15 mg weekly (n = 12), or 5-aminosalicylic acid 3 g/day (n = 8) for 30 weeks. There was no placebo comparator. All medications were given orally, and prednisone was tapered by 8 mg/week if clinically appropriate. If remission was achieved the methotrexate dose was reduced to 10 mg/week and the 6-mercaptopurine dose to 1 mg/kg/day. Patients in the 5-aminosalicylic acid group who achieved remission continued to receive the same dose (3 g/day) as maintenance therapy. Follow-up occurred regularly over the study period, and the Mayo clinic score was calculated at weeks 12 and 30. Patients in remission and off steroids at the end of 30 weeks then entered a 76 week maintenance phase. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients in remission at 30 weeks, defined by a Mayo clinic score of <U>&lt;</U> 3 and withdrawal from steroid therapy.</P>

<B>Methotrexate versus placebo</B>
<BR/>One study (N = 67) compared methotrexate to placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Oren-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 1996</LINK>). There was no statistically significant difference in clinical remission rates between methotrexate and placebo patients. Forty-seven per cent (14/30) of methotrexate patients achieved clinical remission and complete withdrawal from steroids during the study period compared to 49% (18/37) of placebo patients (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.59; See <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was low due to very sparse data (32 events; See <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). The mean time to remission was 4.1 months in the methotrexate group compared to 3.4 months in the placebo group. There was no statistically significant difference in withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 2.47, 95% CI 0.23 to 25.91). Two patients (7%) were withdrawn from the methotrexate group due to adverse events (leucopenia, migraine) compared to one patient (3%) from the placebo group (rash). The <LINK REF="STD-Oren-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 1996</LINK> study did not report on any of the other secondary outcomes including endoscopic remission, clinical, histological or endoscopic improvement or improvements in quality of life. </P>

Twenty-five per cent (2/8) of 5-aminosalicylic acid patients achieved remission and withdrawal of steroids after completing 30 weeks of induction treatment compared to 58% (7/12) of methotrexate patients (RR 2.33, 95% CI 0.64 to 8.49; See <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>).

Adverse events experienced by methotrexate patients included nausea and dyspepsia, mild alopecia, mild increase in aspartate aminotransferase levels, peritoneal abscess, hypoalbuminemia, severe rash and atypical pneumonia.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2014-08-26 14:18:39 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>The treatment of patients with ulcerative colitis often involves 5-aminosalicylic acid and corticosteroids. However, some patients require immunosuppressive therapy when their disease becomes dependent on or refractory to steroid therapy. Unfortunately, there are a limited number of therapeutic options for these patients. Azathioprine has traditionally been the next choice of therapy for these patients, and although it may be effective for maintenance of remission (<LINK REF="REF-Timmer-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Timmer 2012</LINK>), it does not appear to provide any benefit for induction of remission in these patients (<LINK REF="REF-Hawthorne-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawthorne 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jewell-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jewell 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ardizzone-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ardizzone 2006</LINK>). Infliximab has recently been shown to be effective for induction of remission in patients with active ulcerative colitis who have failed steroid therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Lawson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawson 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rutgeerts-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutgeerts 2005</LINK>). Cyclosporine may be effective for treating some patients with severe disease (<LINK REF="REF-Shibolet-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shibolet 2005</LINK>). Failing these medications, surgery is usually considered the next therapeutic option for these patients.</P>
<P>Methotrexate has been shown to be effective for both induction of remission (at a dose of 25 mg intramuscular weekly) and maintenance of remission (15 mg intramuscular weekly) in patients with Crohn's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Feagan-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feagan 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Feagan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feagan 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Patel-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 2014</LINK>). There has only been one well-designed, placebo-controlled, randomized trial assessing methotrexate for induction of remission in ulcerative colitis.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Oren-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 1996</LINK> was designed to assess the utility of methotrexate for induction of remission in patients with active steroid-dependent ulcerative colitis. In this study, no benefit for methotrexate over placebo was found. The dose of methotrexate used (12.5 mg orally weekly) was lower than the dose used in the trial assessing methotrexate for induction of remission in Crohn's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Feagan-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feagan 1995</LINK>), and was administered orally rather than parenterally. The low dose oral regimen utilized by <LINK REF="STD-Oren-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 1996</LINK> is effective in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (<LINK REF="REF-Lopez_x002d_Olivo-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lopez-Olivo 2014</LINK>). Since methotrexate is absorbed in the small bowel, oral administration should be appropriate in ulcerative colitis. A parenteral route is preferred in Crohn's disease, where drug absorption may be affected by disease activity. However, whether or not a higher dose or parenteral administration of methotrexate in ulcerative colitis patients would be more effective is unknown.</P>
<P>One other small (N =34), poor quality randomized trial assessing methotrexate, 6-mercaptopurine and 5-aminosalicylic acid in ulcerative colitis has been published (<LINK REF="STD-Mat_x00e9__x002d_Jim_x00e9_nez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Maté-Jiménez 2000</LINK>). No statistically significant differences in clinical remission rates were found. The results for efficacy outcomes between methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate and 5-aminosalicylic acid were uncertain as GRADE analyses rated the overall quality of evidence from this study as very low. Thus no firm conclusions can be drawn from this study.</P>

<P>Although methotrexate was well-tolerated, the studies showed no benefit for methotrexate over placebo or active comparators. The results for efficacy outcomes between methotrexate and placebo, methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate and 5-aminosalicylic acid were uncertain. Whether a higher dose or parenteral administration would be effective is unknown. At present there is no evidence supporting the use of methotrexate for induction of remission in active ulcerative colitis.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-08-26 14:18:49 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>There are a limited number of therapeutic options for treating patients with ulcerative colitis. Methotrexate has been shown to be effective in both remission induction and maintenance in Crohn's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Feagan-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feagan 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Feagan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feagan 2000</LINK>;<LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Patel-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 2014</LINK>). The randomized, controlled trials of methotrexate in ulcerative colitis used a lower dose and different route of administration than that used in Crohn's disease patients, and no significant benefits were found. Another study with similar dosing to that used in Crohn's patients is warranted, and should definitively determine whether or not methotrexate is effective for remission induction in ulcerative colitis. Such a trial could be coupled with a study to determine whether the drug is effective for maintenance of remission. MERIT-UC and METEOR are two large, ongoing multi-center, placebo-controlled clinical trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of methotrexate for induction and maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00498589" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00498589</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NCT01393405" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01393405</LINK>).</P>
