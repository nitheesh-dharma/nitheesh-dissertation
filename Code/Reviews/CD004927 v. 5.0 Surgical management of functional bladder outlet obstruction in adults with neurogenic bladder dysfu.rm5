<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-05-09 11:00:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Damage to the nervous system can lead to a lack of co-ordination (dyssynergia) between the bladder (detrusor) and the muscle at the exit of the bladder that allows people to control their bladder emptying (external urethral sphincter muscle). This urologic condition is called detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia (DSD) and is most frequently seen in people with spinal cord injury and multiple sclerosis. Insufficient relaxation of the sphincter during a voiding contraction prevents effective bladder emptying and can lead to high pressures in the bladder. People with increased bladder pressures are at an increased risk for bladder and kidney infections, which may lead to kidney damage and even failure.</P>
<P>Treatment is aimed at lowering these pressures by promoting proper bladder emptying. This can be achieved by inserting a thin tube (catheter) in the urethra (i.e. the tube connected to the bladder through which urine is released from the body) to empty the bladder on a regular basis (intermittent catheterisation), use of drugs, or surgery. The first step in treatment is usually not surgery, but surgical options should be considered if this is not possible or feasible. Different types of surgical treatment exist, but the optimal surgical treatment for this condition in adults is as yet unknown. This question is the subject of this review.</P>
<P>We found five trials, which included a total of 199 people (with an average age of 40 years) with a variety of causes of DSD. One trial showed that a surgical procedure in which an incision is made in the sphincter (sphincterotomy) is better in lowering bladder pressure than placing a permanent thin tube into the urethra (urethral stent), but only after two years.</P>
<P>Botulinum A toxin (BTX-A) is a toxin that targets the nervous system locally and interferes with the communications between nerves and muscles. Four trials used botulinum A toxin injections to weaken or paralyse the sphincter. These four trials independently showed that in some outcomes, BTX-A was more effective than placebo, lidocaine, or a treatment combined with drugs.</P>
<P>Compared to placebo, BTX-A was more effective in lowering pre-voiding and maximum bladder pressure after 30 days.</P>
<P>Comparing BTX-A to lidocaine injections, bladder emptying improved seven and 30 days after botulinum A toxin injection, however, not after one day. Botulinum A toxin injection without the addition of drugs (baclofen) was possibly more effective in increasing the ability of the bladder to stretch than botulinum A toxin injection combined with drugs. However, the quality of the trial reporting this was poor. The botulinum A toxin injection is effective for two to three months and therefore requires frequent reinjection, while the effects of sphincter incision seem to last for at least two years.</P>
<P>Two trials reported blood in the urine after injection as an undesired harmful effects (adverse effects) due to the injection of an agent. Also, muscle weakness was reported, which may relate to the BTX-A dose injected.</P>
<P>Overall, results from small studies with a high risk of bias have identified evidence of limited quality that BTX-A injection improves some outcomes relating to the dynamics of the bladder and urethra in storing and releasing urine 30 days after injection. However, this review showed that there was not enough evidence to identify the most effective surgical treatment for DSD.</P>

<P>The most common type of functional bladder outlet obstruction in patients with neurogenic bladder is detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia (DSD). The lack of co-ordination between the bladder and the external urethral sphincter muscle (EUS) in DSD can result in poor bladder emptying and high bladder pressures, which may eventually lead to progressive renal damage.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-05-22 21:15:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Utomo">
<P>We included five trials (total of 199 participants, average age of 40 years). The neurological diseases causing DSD were traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI), multiple sclerosis (MS), or congenital malformations.</P>
<P>One trial compared placement of sphincteric stent prosthesis with sphincterotomy. For urodynamic measurements, results for postvoid residual urine volume (PVR) and cystometric bladder capacity were inconclusive and consistent with benefit of either sphincteric stent prosthesis or sphincterotomy at three, six, 12, and 24 months. Results for maximum detrusor pressure (P<SUB>det.max</SUB>) were also inconclusive at three, six, and 12 months; however, after two years, the P<SUB>det.max</SUB> after sphincterotomy was lower than after stent placement (mean difference (MD) -30 cmH<SUB>2</SUB>O, 95% confidence interval (CI) 8.99 to 51.01).</P>
<P>Four trials considered botulinum A toxin (BTX-A) injection in the EUS, either alone or in combination with other treatments. The comparators included oral baclofen, oral alpha blocker, lidocaine, and placebo. The BTX-A trials all differed in protocols, and therefore we did not undertake meta-analysis. A single 100 units transperineal BTX-A injection (Botox®) in patients with MS resulted in higher voided urine volumes (MD 69 mL, 95% CI 11.87 to 126.13), lower pre-micturition detrusor pressure (MD -10 cmH<SUB>2</SUB>O, 95% CI -17.62 to -2.38), and lower P<SUB>det.max</SUB> (MD -14 cmH<SUB>2</SUB>O, 95% CI -25.32 to -2.68) after 30 days, compared to placebo injection. Results for PVR using catheterisation, basal detrusor pressure, maximal bladder capacity, maximal urinary flow, bladder compliance at functional bladder capacity, maximal urethral pressure, and closure urethral pressure at 30 days were inconclusive and consistent with benefit of either BTX-A injection or placebo injections. In participants with SCI, treatment with 200 units of Chinese manufactured BTX-A injected at eight different sites resulted in better bladder compliance (MD 7.5 mL/cmH<SUB>2</SUB>O, 95% CI -10.74 to -4.26) than participants who received the same injections with the addition of oral baclofen. Results for maximum uroflow rate, maximal cystometric capacity, and volume per voiding were inconclusive and consistent with benefit of either BTX-A injection or BTX-A injection with the addition of oral baclofen. However, the poor quality of reporting in this trial caused us to question the relevance of bladder compliance as an adequate outcome measure.</P>
<P>In participants with DSD due to traumatic SCI, MS, or congenital malformation, the results for PVRs after one day were inconclusive and consistent with benefit of either a single 100 units transperineal BTX-A (Botox®) injection or lidocaine injection. However, after seven and 30 days of BTX-A injection, PVRs were lower (MD -163 and -158 mL, 95% CI -308.65 to -17.35 and 95% CI -277.57 to -39.03, respectively) compared to participants who received lidocaine injections. Results at one month for P<SUB>det.max</SUB> on voiding, EUS activity in electromyography, and maximal urethral pressure were inconclusive and consistent with benefit of either BTX-A or lidocaine injections.</P>
<P>Finally, one small trial consisting of five men with SCI compared weekly BTX-A injections with normal saline as placebo. The placebo had no effect on DSD in the two participants allocated to the placebo treatment. Their urodynamic parameters were unchanged from baseline values until subsequent injections with BTX-A once a week for three weeks. These subsequent injections resulted in similar responses to those of the three participants who were allocated to the BTX-A treatment. Unfortunately, the report presented no data on placebo treatment.</P>
<P>Only the trial that compared sphincterotomy with stent placement reported outcome measures renal function and urologic complications related to DSD. Results for renal function at 12 and 24 months, and urologic complications related to DSD at three, six, 12, and 24 months were inconclusive and consistent with benefit of either sphincteric stent prosthesis or sphincterotomy.</P>
<P>Adverse effects reported were haematuria due to the cystoscopic injection and muscle weakness, of which the latter may be related to the BTX-A dose used.</P>
<P>All trials had some methodological shortcomings, so insufficient information was available to permit judgement of risk of bias. At least half of the trials had an unclear risk of selection bias and reporting bias. One trial had a high risk of attrition bias, and another trial had a high risk of reporting bias.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-05-09 10:59:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Results from small studies with a high risk of bias have identified evidence of limited quality that intraurethral BTX-A injections improve some urodynamic measures after 30 days in the treatment of functional bladder outlet obstruction in adults with neurogenic bladder dysfunction. The necessity of reinjection of BTX-A is a significant drawback; a sphincterotomy might therefore be a more effective treatment option for lowering bladder pressure in the long-term.</P>
<P>However, because of the limited availability of eligible trials, this review was unable to provide robust evidence in favour of any of the surgical treatment options. More RCTs are needed, measuring improvement on quality of life, and on other types of surgical treatment options for DSD since these are lacking. Future RCTs assessing the effectiveness of BTX-A injections also need to address the uncertainty about the optimal dose and mode of injection for this specific type of urological condition.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-05-23 09:08:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Utomo">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-05-23 09:08:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Utomo">
<P>The central nervous system controls urination. Normal urination requires a synergic action between the detrusor muscle (smooth muscle) and the external urethral sphincter (striated muscle). To expel urine from the bladder, the external urethral sphincter relaxes, which is followed by a detrusor contraction. The pontine micturition centre controls this synergy between the detrusor muscle and the external urethral sphincter (<LINK REF="REF-Blok-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blok 2002</LINK>). Disruption of the pathways between the pontine micturition centre and the caudal part of the spinal cord often results in detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia (DSD). In this condition, a detrusor contraction occurs concurrently with an inappropriate contraction of the urethral striated muscle, the periurethral striated muscle, or both, thus, blocking the bladder outlet (<LINK REF="REF-Abrams-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abrams 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The most common form of bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) in people with neurogenic bladder is DSD. Detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia typically occurs in people with traumatic supra-sacral spinal lesions (spinal cord injury). Other common causes of DSD are multiple sclerosis (MS), acute transverse myelitis, and myelomeningocele (<LINK REF="REF-Araki-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Araki 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ganesan-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ganesan 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kalita-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kalita 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ukkonen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukkonen 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Gool-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Gool 2001</LINK>). Detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia can result in poor bladder emptying and high bladder pressures, which in turn can cause recurrent urinary tract infections, high intravesical pressures, vesico-ureteral reflux, and hydronephrosis. If untreated, progressive renal damage may occur (<LINK REF="REF-Weld-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weld 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Several authors have attempted to classify DSD. For instance, <LINK REF="REF-Blaivas-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blaivas 1981</LINK> defined three types of DSD depending on electromyography (EMG) findings. Type three was the predominant type, characterised by a sustained sphincter contraction that coincided with the detrusor contraction. Another classification was proposed by <LINK REF="REF-Yalla-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yalla 1977</LINK> who described three DSD types based on clinical and urodynamic observations. There is a significant overlap between these two classification schemes, and their clinical relevance has been questioned. A simpler way of describing the results of EMG trials is to describe the frequency of external urethral sphincter contraction during detrusor contraction as either intermittent or continuous (<LINK REF="REF-Weld-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weld 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>The symptoms associated with DSD represent a functional disability that may result in considerable impairment of a person's quality of life (QoL). Neurogenic bladder problems were associated with lower QoL scores in people with traumatic spinal cord injury (<LINK REF="REF-Westgren-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Westgren 1998</LINK>). Therefore, QoL is a very important consideration in the management of people with neurogenic bladder dysfunction. Moreover, a relationship between bladder management methods and QoL in people with spinal cord injury was found: Those who were able to void normally had the best QoL in both physical and mental component scores (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Management of DSD is aimed at reducing intravesical pressure and promoting bladder emptying. First-line conservative treatment includes an optimised combination of antimuscarinic agents (anticholinergic drugs) and clean intermittent self-catheterisation. The effect on the bladder pressure should be strictly monitored urodynamically after initiation of antimuscarinic treatment (<LINK REF="REF-St_x00f6_hrer-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stöhrer 2009</LINK>). However, more invasive treatment is necessary in people in whom bladder pressure is pathologically elevated with antimuscarinics, who cannot tolerate antimuscarinic agents, or who are unable to perform clean intermittent self-catheterisation (e.g. people with quadriplegia).<BR/>
</P>
<P>The optimal surgical management of BOO secondary to DSD remains unknown and is the focus of this review. Other causes of BOO, such as benign prostatic enlargement and urethral stricture, are outwith the scope of the review (<LINK REF="REF-Hoffman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoffman 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hoffman-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoffman 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wong-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wong 2012</LINK>). Furthermore, we have not addressed the treatment of high bladder pressure in patient swith only detrusor overactivity and not DSD.Upper urinary tract diversion is usually reserved as a last resort (<LINK REF="REF-Nabi-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nabi 2009</LINK>) and was not considered as a part of this review, but we did include suprapubic catheterisation.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">
<I>1. Sphincterotomy</I>
</HEADING>
<P>External sphincterotomy is a transurethral treatment of the sphincteric hypertonicity, which is present in DSD by disrupting, either partially or totally, the continuity of the external urethral sphincter. It is performed either with the use of electrocautery (<LINK REF="REF-Perkash-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perkash 1976</LINK>) or a contact laser (<LINK REF="REF-Perkash-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perkash 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rivas-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rivas 1995</LINK>). The goal is to reduce the intravesical voiding pressure and to lower detrusor leak-point pressure. Sphincterotomy should prevent urologic complications, such as urosepsis and deterioration of renal function; reduce vesico-ureteral reflux; and eliminate the need for chronic indwelling catheterisation. A degree of continence may be maintained if bladder neck function can be preserved. Sphincterotomy can provide an extended period of satisfactory bladder emptying (<LINK REF="REF-Pan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pan 2009</LINK>). However, ongoing revision may be required and a number of complications have been described, principally postoperative haemorrhage, erectile dysfunction (complete or partial loss of tumescence), urine extravasation, urethral stricture, and fistula formation (<LINK REF="REF-Pan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pan 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reynard-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reynard 2003</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Implantable urethral stents</HEADING>
<P>Urethral stents mechanically keep open the external urethral sphincter and thereby lower the detrusor leak-point pressure. The stents are either permanent or temporary.</P>
<P>The permanent UroLume® prosthesis (also known as Wallstent in Europe, AMS Medinvent SA, Lausanne, Switzerland) was initially developed as a self-expanding prosthesis used to maintain the patency of stenotic arteries after balloon angioplasty. <LINK REF="REF-Milroy-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Milroy 1988</LINK> first described the use of this stent in the treatment of recurrent urethral strictures. The stent is made of a stainless steel super alloy, which is corrosion-resistant and non-magnetic. This alloy is woven into a braided, pliable, self-expanding cylindrical mesh. After insertion, the mesh exerts a strong, continuous, outward force against the wall of the urethra (lumen) and maintains a patent diameter of up to 42 F. The mesh becomes epithelialised by urothelium and is considered to be permanent. <LINK REF="REF-Shaw-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaw 1990</LINK> were the first to use this urethral stent as a successful alternative to external sphincterotomy in the treatment of DSD. Since then, studies have confirmed its long-term clinical benefit and safety, by showing improvements in maximum detrusor pressure and postvoid residual urine volume, alongside unchanged bladder capacity and reduced hydronephrosis (<LINK REF="REF-Abdul_x002d_Rahman-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abdul-Rahman 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chancellor-1999b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chancellor 1999b</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Soni-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soni 1994</LINK> first described the use of the Memokath® temporary stent (Engineers &amp; Doctors A/S, Hornbaek, Denmark) to treat DSD. The stent is composed of a nickel-titanium alloy with 'shape memory'. The stent will return to a preformed shape after deformation when heated to 45 ºC or above. When cooled (10 ºC or below), the stent becomes soft and easy to remove. Because of its closed, tight, spiral structure, urothelial ingrowth is prevented, and this allows the stent to be easily removed if required. It has shown short-term success in patients with DSD in terms of decreasing the detrusor pressure and postvoid residual urine volume (<LINK REF="REF-Hamid-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamid 2003</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">3. Urethral balloon dilatation</HEADING>
<P>Balloon dilatation of the external urethral sphincter was first introduced as a treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia. <LINK REF="REF-Chancellor-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chancellor 1992</LINK> reported on their technique and early experience with balloon dilatation of the external urethral sphincter in seven spinal cord-injured men with DSD. Balloon dilatation of the external urethral sphincter uses placement of the Optilume Prostate Dilator® (American Medical Systems Inc, Minnesota, USA) under fluoroscopic guidance. The balloon is inflated to a diameter of 90 F under a pressure of three to four atmospheres for 10 minutes. Balloon dilatation was effective in significantly reducing postvoid residual urine volume (<LINK REF="REF-Chancellor-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chancellor 1993</LINK>). Balloon dilatation and UroLume® stenting both proved to be as effective as external sphincterotomy in the treatment of DSD (<LINK REF="REF-Chancellor-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chancellor 1994</LINK>). In contrast, <LINK REF="REF-McFarlane-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">McFarlane 1997</LINK> reported a lower success rate than both sphincterotomy and sphincter stenting and did not recommend balloon dilatation for the treatment of DSD.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">4. Intraurethral botulinum A toxin (BTX-A) injection</HEADING>
<P>Botulinum A toxin (BTX-A) is a protein neurotoxin produced by a bacterium of the <I>Clostridium</I> genus. It is an inhibitor of acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction. BTX-A is injected directly into the target muscle, and the clinical effect is to induce relaxation of the injected striated muscle. The clinical effects begin within two to three days and are reversible as terminal nerve resprouting occurs within three to six months. BTX-A has previously been used successfully in the management of muscular disorders, including strabismus, focal dystonia, skeletal muscle spasms, and spasticity. Application of BTX-A in the lower urinary tract has produced promising results in treating lower urinary tract dysfunction (<LINK REF="REF-Sahai-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sahai 2005</LINK>). Its use for the treatment of DSD was first reported by <LINK REF="REF-Dykstra-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dykstra 1988</LINK>. BTX-A was injected once a week for three weeks into the external urethral sphincter of 11 spinal cord-injured men with DSD.</P>
<P>Currently, two preparations of BTX-A are commercially available: onabotulinumtoxinA or Botox® (Allergan Inc., Irvine, California, USA) and abobotulinumtoxinA or Dysport® (Ipsen Ltd, Slough, UK). BTX-A treatment has the advantage of being minimally invasive, can be injected on an outpatient basis, and has a good safety profile. However, it provides only temporary relief of symptoms, because the BTX-A-treated nerve terminals do not degenerate and axonal resprouting and formation of new neuromuscular junctions occurs (<LINK REF="REF-Angaut_x002d_Petit-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Angaut-Petit 1990</LINK>). As a result of this regeneration, repeat BTX-A sphincter injections are necessary. The duration of effect of a single treatment is two to three months, whereas repeat treatments appear to have cumulative efficacy lasting nine to 13 months (<LINK REF="REF-Schurch-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schurch 1996</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">5. Intrathecal baclofen</HEADING>
<P>Baclofen is a well-recognised option for the treatment of skeletal muscle spasticity (<LINK REF="REF-Simon-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simon 2010</LINK>). It acts by activating gamma-aminobutyric acid-B receptors, by normalising and decreasing interneuron and motor neuron activity in the spinal cord. Although baclofen has been used for over two decades as an oral preparation, its difficulty in passing through the blood-brain barrier limited its usefulness for the treatment of DSD. Intrathecal baclofen delivery systems were developed to circumvent this problem: Patients receive a continuous intradural administration of baclofen via an implanted pump. Thus, it can be delivered directly into the spinal fluid to allow higher concentrations in the spinal cord. The rationale behind this modality is to minimise the systemic baclofen side-effects from higher oral doses (weakness, dizziness, drowsiness, rash, and hallucinations), while enhancing its therapeutic benefit. After intrathecal application of baclofen, urethral pressure shows urethral relaxation during isovolumetric bladder contractions in spinal cord-injured rats (<LINK REF="REF-Miyazato-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miyazato 2008</LINK>). It has been proposed that baclofen activates inhibitory interneurons that, in turn, inhibit directly external urethral sphincter motoneurons in the nucleus of Onuf (<LINK REF="REF-Blok-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blok 1997</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Steers-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Steers 1992</LINK> showed a 40% decrease of DSD in people with severe spasticity due to spinal cord pathology after intrathecal baclofen.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">6. Pudendal nerve block</HEADING>
<P>The pudendal nerve contains the motor axons to the external urethral sphincter as well as other nerve fibres innervating the external anal sphincter and other pelvic floor muscles. By blocking the pudendal nerve, action potential propagation in the nerve is blocked and thus reduces or blocks unwanted external urethral sphincter activity.</P>
<P>Pudendal nerve block using phenol solution has been widely used as a neurolytic agent for the relief of spasticity. Pudendal neurolysis can be done in a relatively non-invasive way and can be easily performed on an outpatient basis. Treatment of DSD with this technique was first described in 1979 (<LINK REF="REF-Satoh-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Satoh 1979</LINK>). Other clinical studies showed that pudendal nerve block performed by phenol solution was safe, easy to perform, and effective as a treatment for DSD in selected people with spinal cord injury (<LINK REF="REF-Ko-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ko 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tsai-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tsai 2002</LINK>). However, a number of authors have reported that the duration of the effect of the nerve block was unpredictable.</P>
<P>A relatively recent approach involves the use of high-frequency stimulation to block the pudendal nerve. Several animal studies have demonstrated high-frequency stimulation as a potential method for suppressing DSD and improving effective voiding (<LINK REF="REF-Boger-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boger 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gaunt-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gaunt 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tai-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tai 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tai-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tai 2005</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">7. Suprapubic catheterisation</HEADING>
<P>In a small subset of people with DSD, insertion of an indwelling transurethral or suprapubic catheter is necessary. Insertion of a suprapubic catheter is a simple form of urinary diversion, which involves inserting a catheter directly into the bladder through the abdominal wall. The handling and long-term risks of a suprapubic catheter are often the subject of debate (<LINK REF="REF-Feifer-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feifer 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Compared to clean intermittent self-catheterisation, the use of an indwelling catheter (either suprapubic or transurethral) significantly increases the risk of bladder and renal stones, complicated urinary tract infections, urethral fistulas, renal failure, strictures, and erosions (<LINK REF="REF-Feifer-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feifer 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ord-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ord 2003</LINK>). A controversial issue is the association of long-term use of an indwelling catheter and squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder (<LINK REF="REF-Kalisvaart-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kalisvaart 2010</LINK>). There are several advantages of a suprapubic catheter compared to a transurethral catheter: reduced risk of urethral trauma, destruction, or both; less risk of prostatitis or epididymitis; and less urethral pain. However, it requires a minimal 'surgical' intervention to insert the suprapubic catheter, with potential to injure structures adjacent to the bladder, especially the bowel. The preferred insertion technique appears to be quite variable, and there is no evidence of any one best way to insert the suprapubic catheter (<LINK REF="REF-Wyndaele-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wyndaele 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>An epidemiological follow-up study found that suprapubic catheters were more frequently used at follow up compared to an initially placed transurethral catheter (<LINK REF="REF-Hansen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hansen 2004</LINK>). This could be due to a shift from the indwelling transurethral catheter towards the suprapubic catheter because of complications related to these, but it is also more convenient as it permits sexual function (<LINK REF="REF-Cameron-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cameron 2010</LINK>).</P>

<P>The wide variety of surgical treatments available for curing or improving BOO in adults with neurogenic bladder dysfunction indicates a lack of consensus for what is optimal treatment. Provided that sufficient numbers of trials of adequate quality have been conducted, the most reliable evidence is likely to come from the consideration of randomised controlled trials, and this will be the basis for this review.

<P>The extremely small trial from <LINK REF="STD-Dykstra-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Dykstra 1990</LINK> in five men with spinal cord injury compared sphincter injections with either a dose of BTX-A (n = 3) or normal saline as placebo (n = 2), applied once a week for a total of three weeks. The initial dose of BTX-A was 140 U on a botulinum A toxin, with subsequent injections of 240 U. In the three participants allocated to the BTX-A treatment, an average decrease of 25 cmH<SUB>2</SUB>O was seen in the maximal urethral pressure, an average decrease of 125 mL was seen in their postvoid residual urine volume, and an average decrease of 30 cmH<SUB>2</SUB>O was found in the maximum bladder pressure during voiding. After completion of the study, participants who had received placebo were offered the opportunity to undergo the same injections with BTX-A. The report mentions that in participants who received placebo injections, all outcomes were unchanged from baseline values until the subsequent injection with BTX-A once per week for three weeks. This resulted in similar responses to those of the other three participants who initially received BTX-A. The effects of the BTX-A injection lasted an average of 60 days in all five participants. All participants continued to use condom catheters after injection. Three participants had suffered from autonomic dysreflexia symptoms during voiding, of whom all reported a noticeable improvement in their autonomic dysreflexia symptoms after toxin injections. Unfortunately, the report presented no data on placebo treatment, and therefore we could not make quantitative comparison between active and placebo treatment.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Gallien-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gallien 2005</LINK> compared a single transperineal injection of BTX-A (Botox®, Allergan Inc.) into the external urethral sphincter with a single placebo (saline) transperineal injection into the external urethral sphincter in MS patients.

The bladder compliance was significantly higher (better) in the BTX-A group without oral baclofen group than in the BTX-A group with oral baclofen.

The report does not describe at which bladder volume the compliance was calculated. This is important because the bladder compliance describes the relationship between change in bladder volume and change in detrusor pressure. Furthermore, this trial did not report the detrusor pressure, which is a shortcoming since it is an important urodynamic measure when evaluating renal function. Therefore, the value of compliance as an outcome in this report may be limited.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2014-05-23 09:03:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Utomo">
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-05-23 09:03:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Utomo">
<P>In patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction, the first aim of any therapy is protection of the upper urinary tract (<LINK REF="REF-Pannek-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pannek 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-St_x00f6_hrer-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stöhrer 2009</LINK>). In patients with detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia (DSD), a high detrusor pressure during the voiding phase can result in a pathologic high-pressure bladder, which needs to be converted into a low-pressure reservoir. In patients for whom conservative treatment (i.e. clean intermittent self-catheterisation and pharmaceutical treatment (e.g. antimuscarinics)) is not possible or feasible, surgical treatment options should be considered. According to the European Association of Urology Guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-St_x00f6_hrer-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stöhrer 2009</LINK>), sphincterotomy is the standard surgical treatment for DSD. Since the introduction of sphincterotomy in 1958 as a treatment of obstruction at the level of the external urethral sphincter in people suffering from neurogenic bladder (<LINK REF="REF-Ross-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ross 1987</LINK>), improvements in surgical care and the development of new surgical options have been developed. However, consensus on what defines optimal surgical management seems to be lacking. This was the background of the current systematic review.</P>
<P>Only a limited number of small randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing a surgical approach with any other intervention in the treatment of functional bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) in adults with neurogenic bladder dysfunction was available. Also, the most recent included trial was performed no less than six years ago (<LINK REF="STD-Cui-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cui 2007</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Primary outcomes: urodynamic measurements</HEADING>
<P>In the only trial comparing sphincterotomy with urethral stent placement (<LINK REF="STD-Chancellor-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Chancellor 1999a</LINK>), the maximum detrusor pressure was lower (mean difference (MD) of -30.00 cmH<SUB>2</SUB>O, 95% confidence interval (CI) 8.99 to 51.01, <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>.4) in the sphincterotomy group compared to the stent group, but only at two years.</P>
<P>Interestingly, this was due to an increase of maximum detrusor pressure in the stent group, rather than because of a decrease in the sphincterotomy group. Results for maximum detrusor pressure were inconclusive at three, six, and 12 months. Results for postvoid residual urine volume and cystometric bladder capacity were inconclusive and consistent with benefit of either sphincteric stent prosthesis or sphincterotomy at three, six, 12, and 24 months.</P>
<P>Four of five included trials assessed intraurethral botulinum A toxin (BTX-A) injections as a surgical option. Unfortunately, we could not combine these in a meta-analysis as the comparator treatment differed in these trials. Comparing a single intraurethral 100 U BTX-A injection (Botox®, Allergan Inc.) with a placebo injection, while administering concomitant alfuzosin in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients (<LINK REF="STD-Gallien-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gallien 2005</LINK>), voiding volume was higher after BTX-A (MD of 69.00 mL, 95% CI 11.87 to 126.13, <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>). Also, both pre-micturition and maximal detrusor pressure were lower after BTX-A. A mean difference of -10.00 cmH<SUB>2</SUB>O, 95% CI -17.62 to -2.38 and -14.00 cmH<SUB>2</SUB>O, 95% CI -25.32 to -2.68, respectively, was found after 30 days (<LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>). However, postvoid residual urine volume as measured by catheterisation, basal detrusor pressure, maximal bladder capacity, maximal urinary flow, bladder compliance at functional bladder capacity, maximal urethral pressure, and closure urethral pressure at 30 days were inconclusive and consistent with benefit of either BTX-A or placebo injections. <LINK REF="STD-Cui-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cui 2007</LINK> compared 200 U intraurethral BTX-A injection (Lanzhou Biotechnology, China) with or without concomitant oral baclofen in spinal cord injury patients. Bladder compliance was better in patients who received BTX-A injections without oral baclofen, compared to the patients who received BTX-A injections with oral baclofen. Compared to the BTX-A group without baclofen, the BTX-A group with baclofen had a MD of -7.50 mL/cmH<SUB>2</SUB>O, 95% CI -10.74 to -4.26 after one month (<LINK REF="CMP-003.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.4</LINK>). Results for maximum uroflow rate, maximal cystometric capacity, and volume per voiding were all inconclusive and consistent with benefit of either BTX-A injection or BTX-A injection with the addition of oral baclofen. We believe that the relevance of bladder compliance as an outcome measure in this setting should be questioned. First, the authors did not report at which bladder volume the compliance was calculated. Second, the trial authors did not provide data for comparison of detrusor pressure, which is a more important parameter for the effectiveness of treatment. Third, the trial authors did not provide a theoretical explanation of why particularly the addition of oral baclofen - which is supposed to act as an antispasticity agent - is not favoured in this trial.</P>
<P>The trial of <LINK REF="STD-de-S_x00e8_ze-2002" TYPE="STUDY">de Sèze 2002</LINK> compared a single 100 U intraurethral BTX-A injection (Botox®, Allergan Inc.) with a single intraurethral lidocaine injection in participants with DSD of mixed aetiology (i.e. traumatic spinal cord injury, MS, or congenital malformation). Botulinum A toxin injections resulted in lower postvoid residual urine volumes with MDs of -163.00 mL, 95% CI -308.65 to -17.35 and -158.30 mL, 95% CI -277.57 to -39.03 after seven and 30 days, respectively (<LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>), though not yet after one day. Results at one month for maximal detrusor pressure on voiding, EUS activity in electromyography, and maximal urethral pressure were inconclusive and consistent with benefit of either BTX-A or lidocaine injections. In addition, participants were significantly more satisfied 30 days after BTX-A injections (<LINK REF="CMP-004.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.5</LINK>).</P>
<P>Finally, <LINK REF="STD-Dykstra-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Dykstra 1990</LINK> performed a trial involving five men with spinal cord injury. These men were injected with either BTX-A (initial dose of 140 U onabotulinumtoxinA with subsequent injections of 240 U) or placebo (saline) once a week for three weeks at three or four sites in the external urethral sphincter. The placebo had no significant effect on DSD in the two participants allocated to the placebo treatment. Their urodynamic parameters were unchanged from baseline values until subsequent injections with BTX-A once a week for three weeks. These subsequent injections resulted in similar responses to those of the three participants who were allocated to the BTX-A treatment.</P>
<P>However, it is unclear how relevant changes in urodynamic parameters, such as postvoid residual urine volumes, are to participants' satisfaction with treatment and particularly whether beneficial urodynamic changes translate into reduced effect on damage to the kidneys, as none of the trials reported this crucial outcome.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Primary outcomes: renal function and urologic complications related to DSD</HEADING>
<P>The remaining two primary outcome measures, renal function and urologic complications related to DSD, were only reported in the trial that compared sphincterotomy with stent placement. Results for renal function vesico-ureteric reflux and hydronephrosis, <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>) at 12 and 24 months, and urologic complications related to DSD (e.g. urinary tract infection, <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>) at three, six, 12, and 24 months were inconclusive and consistent with benefit of either sphincteric stent prosthesis or sphincterotomy.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Participant-reported outcomes and quality of life</HEADING>
<P>Despite the major impact of neurogenic bladder dysfunction on quality of life (QoL), only two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Cui-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cui 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gallien-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gallien 2005</LINK>) used questionnaires as a patient-reported outcome measure. Both used the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), which is a seven-item symptom score originally developed for men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (<LINK REF="REF-Barry-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barry 1992</LINK>), with the addition of a QoL question. Where <LINK REF="STD-Gallien-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gallien 2005</LINK> used this prostate symptom score in both male and female patients, <LINK REF="STD-Cui-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cui 2007</LINK> used the Urogenital Distress Inventory (UDI) (<LINK REF="REF-Shumaker-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shumaker 1994</LINK>) in female participants, which lacks a specific QoL question. Since both trials did not report the data of the QoL question of the IPSS separately, we were not able to draw any conclusions regarding the improvement of QoL after intervention. <LINK REF="STD-Chancellor-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Chancellor 1999a</LINK> reported surveying participants regarding the QoL with respect to the urogenital condition, but the lack of data and information regarding if and which questionnaires were used does not provide us with any meaningful data. In the trial of <LINK REF="STD-de-S_x00e8_ze-2002" TYPE="STUDY">de Sèze 2002</LINK>, a treatment satisfaction score was determined using a single question. However, this single question ("Do you find this treatment to be efficacious?") may not be specific enough and can be interpreted as an improvement in symptoms as well as an improvement in QoL.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Duration of effect</HEADING>
<P>The findings of the aforementioned trials evaluating BTX-A injections suggest that BTX-A may be useful in the treatment of DSD in adults with neurogenic bladder dysfunction. The duration of effectiveness of BTX-A injections is however limited. <LINK REF="STD-Dykstra-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Dykstra 1990</LINK> reported an effect of BTX-A of an average of 60 days after the third (last) injection, and <LINK REF="STD-de-S_x00e8_ze-2002" TYPE="STUDY">de Sèze 2002</LINK> reported BTX-A was efficacious for at least three months in the majority of participants (69%).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>Please see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> on adverse effects.</P>
<P>Twenty-three per cent of participants needed more than one stent insertion procedure, and 19% of participants required a stent explantation. This was in contrast to the adverse effects of sphincterotomy, where a repeat sphincterotomy after six months was required in only 8% of participants. Treatment for bladder neck obstruction was necessary in one out of five of all participants.</P>
<P>Concerning the adverse events in the BTX-A trials, haematuria was reported in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Cui-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cui 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dykstra-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Dykstra 1990</LINK>), but this was due to the cystoscopic injection and not necessarily due to the injected agent. More important are the effects of BTX-A on muscle weakness. This seem related to the dose of BTX-A used.</P>
<P>Two trials using more than 100 U BTX-A reported muscle weakness (<LINK REF="STD-Cui-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cui 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dykstra-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Dykstra 1990</LINK>); this was in contrast to the two trials using 100 U (single dose) BTX-A, in which no muscle weakness was observed (<LINK REF="STD-de-S_x00e8_ze-2002" TYPE="STUDY">de Sèze 2002</LINK>) or reported (<LINK REF="STD-Gallien-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gallien 2005</LINK>). However, the last two trials reported both incontinence for faeces (<LINK REF="STD-de-S_x00e8_ze-2002" TYPE="STUDY">de Sèze 2002</LINK>) and urine (<LINK REF="STD-de-S_x00e8_ze-2002" TYPE="STUDY">de Sèze 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gallien-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gallien 2005</LINK>). The serious adverse events as reported by <LINK REF="STD-Gallien-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gallien 2005</LINK> were not attributable to BTX-A.</P>

<P>In general, the included trials were small, diversely designed, and reported outcomes were defined in different ways. Therefore, due to paucity of evidence, the results should be interpreted cautiously. The risk of selection bias and reporting bias (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>) is certainly present, mainly because of insufficient information to permit judgement. Contacting trial authors resulted in additional information for one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Dykstra-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Dykstra 1990</LINK>), though initially three of five trials did not provide enough information in their report (<LINK REF="STD-Chancellor-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Chancellor 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cui-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cui 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dykstra-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Dykstra 1990</LINK>). These potential risks may be related to inadequate reporting common in older trials (<LINK REF="STD-Chancellor-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Chancellor 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dykstra-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Dykstra 1990</LINK>) or to publication in a non-English language journal (<LINK REF="STD-Cui-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cui 2007</LINK>), rather than to methodological shortcomings.</P>

<P>We applied no language or other restrictions in the search for trials. Despite the comprehensive search, we may still have missed unreported trials or trials only reported in conference abstracts, causing publication bias.</P>
<P>We added non-prespecified outcomes in the protocol to the review as secondary outcomes (See <LINK TAG="PRO_REV_DIFF" TYPE="SECTION">Differences between protocol and review</LINK>). This may have introduced unintentional outcome reporting bias in the review process with the possibility of biased and misleading interpretation of the results (<LINK REF="REF-Kirkham-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirkham 2010</LINK>). However, we added these outcomes because of knowledge of studies that existed, not necessarily because of knowledge of the results.</P>

<P>We identified two systematic reviews that systematically reviewed surgical treatment options in the treatment of DSD (<LINK REF="STD-Mehta-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Mehta 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Naumann-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Naumann 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Mehta-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Mehta 2012</LINK> conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effect of intraurethral BTX-A injections on improving bladder emptying in patients with spinal cord injury. They pooled data from two RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-de-S_x00e8_ze-2002" TYPE="STUDY">de Sèze 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dykstra-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Dykstra 1990</LINK>) and six uncontrolled trials, and concluded that BTX-A was effective in significantly reducing postvoid residual urine volume, detrusor pressure, and urethral pressure after one month. They made no statements about the clinical utility of BTX-A. Because this review included non-randomised controlled trials, the data used for meta-analysis were pre-intervention versus postintervention.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Naumann-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Naumann 2008</LINK> conducted an evidence-based review of the safety and efficacy of BTX-A in the treatment of autonomic and urologic disorders and low back and head pain. The conclusions and recommendation of the safety and efficacy of BTX-A in the treatment of DSD were based on the quality of the trials (<LINK REF="REF-Gross-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gross 2009</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Gallien-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gallien 2005</LINK> received the highest classification based on the quality of the trial, and <LINK REF="STD-de-S_x00e8_ze-2002" TYPE="STUDY">de Sèze 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Dykstra-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Dykstra 1990</LINK> received the second best classification. Based on these three trials, <LINK REF="STD-Naumann-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Naumann 2008</LINK> recommended that BTX-A should be considered for DSD in people with spinal cord injury with a level B rating for recommendations (<LINK REF="REF-Gross-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gross 2009</LINK>).

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-05-09 13:59:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>At present, there are insufficient data available to determine the optimal surgical treatment of BOO in adults with neurogenic bladder dysfunction. Four out of five of the trials focused on BTX-A treatment. This review has found evidence of limited quality that BTX-A injection - either administered by itself or in combination with another treatment - confers benefit with regard to increasing voided urine volume, lowering detrusor pressure, and decreasing postvoid residual bladder urine volume. In addition, one small study found that it appears to lead to a higher satisfaction than lidocaine injection. However, the necessity of regular reinjection of BTX-A is a significant drawback. A sphincterotomy might be a more effective treatment option for lowering bladder pressure in the long-term; however, results from one small study comparing sphincterotomy versus sphincteric stent prosthesis on urodynamic measures were inconclusive.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-05-09 13:59:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Unfortunately, this review failed to provide robust evidence in favour of any of the surgical treatment options, because of the limited availability of eligible trials, the variability in the interventions (e.g. dose and mode of injection of BTX-A) of the included trials, and particularly because of their small size (ranging from five to 86 participants). Also, the duration of follow-up of the included trials was limited, with an average of eight months.</P>
<P>Therefore, more and larger RCTs are needed to evaluate the most effective surgical intervention for functional BOO in adults with neurogenic bladder dysfunction. Furthermore, RCTs of specific surgical treatment options for DSD (i.e. urethral balloon dilatation, intrathecal baclofen, pudendal nerve block, suprapubic catheterisation) are lacking. Randomised controlled trials assessing the effectiveness of BTX-A need to address the remaining uncertainty about the optimal dose and mode of injection, keeping in mind the possible dose-related adverse events.</P>
<P>Trials should use standardised terminology and outcomes in accordance with International Continence Society (ICS) standards (<LINK REF="REF-Abrams-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abrams 2002</LINK>) and the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2010</LINK>) to improve the quality of the reports and draw meaningful conclusions. In addition, further trials are advised to select outcomes that really matter to patients and practitioners, which is facilitated by the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) initiative (<LINK REF="REF-Williamson-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williamson 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>The lack of trials assessing QoL from the patient's point of view as an outcome is worrying, as the medical (technical) success does not necessarily correspond with the emotional judgement of success reported by the patient. Health-related QoL should receive much more attention in future trials. Furthermore, none of the included trials addressed socioeconomic outcomes. In future trials, the duration of effectiveness of BTX-A injections should be considered as a socioeconomic outcome.</P>
<P>This systematic review included only RCTs and quasi-RCTs. However, because of the limited availability of eligible trials, future reviews should consider including evidence from non-randomised trials for outcomes, although this will introduce bias.</P>
