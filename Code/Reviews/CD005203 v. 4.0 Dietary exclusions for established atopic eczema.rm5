<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Dietary exclusions for improving established atopic eczema in adults and children</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Atopic eczema is the most common inflammatory skin disease of childhood in developed countries. The cause of atopic eczema is probably due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Atopic eczema varies in severity, often from one hour to the next and the disease can be associated with complications such as bacterial and viral infections. There is a substantial economic cost not only to the family of the person with atopic eczema but also to health services. Although there is currently no cure for atopic eczema, a wide range of treatments are used to control the symptoms. One such approach is a dietary one, whereby certain foods such as cows' milk are excluded on the basis that they are thought to cause eczema to worsen. The reason for undertaking this review is because the effectiveness of removing various foods from the diet in the short term management of atopic eczema is unclear. </P>
<P>The general quality of the studies was poor. The main findings of the review suggest that there is some evidence from one study for the use of an egg-free diet in infants with a suspected egg allergy who have positive specific IgE antibodies to eggs in their blood. Other studies that compared a dietary exclusion with ordinary diets did not test the people taking part to see if they were allergic to the foods concerned. There appears to be little benefit in eliminating cows milk from the diet or using an elemental (liquid diet containing only amino acids, carbohydrates, fat, minerals and vitamins) or 'few foods diet' for improving atopic eczema in people who have not undergone any form of testing. </P>
<P>Three of the studies used soya based substitute which itself can be allergenic to people with atopic eczema.</P>
<P>Adhering to elimination diets is difficult. The studies were performed in different populations with only one study describing the severity of the atopic eczema. The clinical relevance of changes in severity scores obtained in many studies is unknown. </P>

<P>We searched The Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register (to March 2006), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (<I>Issue </I>1, 2006), MEDLINE (2003 to March 2006), EMBASE (2003 to March 2006), LILACS (to March 2006), PsycINFO (1806 to March 2006), AMED (1985 to March 2006), ISI Web of Science (March 2006), www.controlled-trials.com, www.clinicaltrials.gov and www.nottingham.ac.uk/ongoingskintrials (March 2006).

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-05-23 16:01:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Diane A  Horsley">
<P>We found 9 RCTs involving a total of 421 participants of which 6 were studies of egg and milk exclusion (N=288), 1 was a study of few foods (N=85) and 2 were studies of an elemental diet (N=48).</P>
<P>There appears to be no benefit of an egg and milk free diet in unselected participants with atopic eczema. There is also no evidence of benefit in the use of an elemental or few-foods diet in unselected cases of atopic eczema. There may be some benefit in using an egg-free diet in infants with suspected egg allergy who have positive specific IgE to eggs - one study found 51% of the children had a significant improvement in body surface area with the exclusion diet compared to normal diet (RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.11) and change in surface area and severity score was significantly improved in the exclusion diet compared to the normal diet at the end of 6 weeks (MD 5.50, 95% CI 0.19 to 10.81) and end of treatment (MD 6.10, 95% CI 0.06 to12.14).</P>
<P>Methodological difficulties have made it difficult to interpret these studies. Poor concealment of randomisation allocation, lack of blinding and high dropout rates without an intention-to-treat analysis indicates that these studies should be interpreted with great caution.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There may be some benefit in using an egg-free diet in infants with suspected egg allergy who have positive specific IgE to eggs. Little evidence supports the use of various exclusion diets in unselected people with atopic eczema, but that may be because they were not allergic to those substances in the first place. Lack of any benefit may also be because the studies were too small and poorly reported. Future studies should be appropriately powered focusing on participants with a proven food allergy. In addition a distinction should be made between young children whose food allergies improve with time and older children/adults.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Disease definition</HEADING>
<P>Atopic eczema (AE) is a non-infective chronic inflammatory skin disease characterised by an itchy red rash. The terms 'atopic eczema' and 'atopic dermatitis' are used synonymously. "Atopy" refers to a form of allergy in which there is a heritable tendency to develop "IgE" hypersensitivity reactions. However up to 40% of children with atopic eczema are not atopic, when defined according to allergy tests such as skin prick tests (<LINK REF="REF-Bohme-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bohme 2001</LINK>). Others have found that up to two thirds of people with atopic dermatitis are not atopic (<LINK REF="REF-Flohr-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flohr 2004</LINK>), implying that continued use of the term 'atopic dermatitis' is problematic.</P>
<P>A revised nomenclature for allergy (<LINK REF="REF-Johansson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johansson 2001</LINK>) has been updated by the World Allergy Organisation (<LINK REF="REF-Johansson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johansson 2004</LINK>). The new nomenclature is based on the mechanisms that initiate and mediate allergic reactions. The term 'eczema' is proposed to replace the provisional term 'atopic eczema/dermatitis syndrome' (AEDS). What is generally known as 'atopic eczema/dermatitis' is probably not one single disease but rather an aggregation of several diseases with certain characteristics in common. The term 'atopy' cannot be used until an IgE sensitisation has been documented by IgE antibodies in the blood of a person or by a positive skin prick test to common environmental allergens such as pollen, house dust mite, cow's milk or egg. If this is done then the term 'eczema' can be split into 'atopic eczema' and 'non-atopic eczema'.</P>
<P>Whilst recognising the logic of the new nomenclature, most health care workers still think of atopic eczema as the clinical syndrome of an itchy inflammatory skin condition with a tendency to settle in the skin creases without doing any further investigations to find out if such individuals are atopic. For the purpose of this review therefore, we will use the term 'atopic eczema' throughout for ease of communication, knowing that in many cases, testing for atopy in such individuals has not been carried out. Since it is possible that individuals who are allergic to a particular substance are more likely to respond to a diet that excludes that substance than people who do not react to such tests, we will make it clear which studies have undertaken such allergy tests to further define the study populations in this review.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Epidemiology and causes</HEADING>
<P>Atopic eczema is the most common inflammatory skin disease of childhood in developed countries, affecting 15 to 20% of children in the UK at any one time (<LINK REF="REF-Hoare-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoare 2000</LINK>). Two-thirds of people with the disease have a family history of atopic eczema, asthma or hay fever. The cumulative prevalence of atopic dermatitis varies from 20% in Northern Europe and the USA to 5% in the South-Eastern Mediterranean (<LINK REF="REF-Thestrup-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thestrup 2002</LINK>). Prevalence data for the symptoms of atopic eczema were collected in the global ISAAC study (International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood). The results of this study suggest that atopic eczema is a worldwide problem affecting 15 to 20% of children (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 1999</LINK>). Of those children with atopic eczema, only 2% under the age of 5 years have severe disease and 84% have mild disease (<LINK REF="REF-Emerson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emerson 1998</LINK>). Two per cent of adults have atopic eczema and many of these have a more chronic and severe form (<LINK REF="REF-Charman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Charman 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Atopic eczema is often associated with other atopic diseases e.g. asthma and rhinitis (<LINK REF="REF-Beck-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beck 2000</LINK>). The incidence of common allergic disease has increased in the past 30 years (<LINK REF="REF-Fendrick-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fendrick 2001</LINK>) and the increase in prevalence of atopic disease in the past 3 decades appears to be a real phenomenon and has been observed in countries as far apart as Japan, USA, Finland and Africa (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 1992</LINK>). The cause of eczema is not well understood and probably is due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors (<LINK REF="REF-Cookson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cookson 2002</LINK>). In recent years research has pointed to the possible role of environmental agents such as house dust mite (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Bever-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Bever 2002</LINK>), pollution (<LINK REF="REF-Polosa-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Polosa 2001</LINK>), and prenatal or early exposure to infections (<LINK REF="REF-Kalliomaki-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kalliomaki 2002</LINK>). Food allergy may be common in atopic eczema especially if the eczema is severe (<LINK REF="REF-Guillet-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guillet 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zeiger-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zeiger 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eigenmann-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eigenmann 1998</LINK> ).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Clinical features</HEADING>
<P>Atopic eczema may be acute (short and severe) with redness, scaling, oozing and vesicles, or it may be chronic (long-term) with skin thickening, altered pigmentation and exaggerated surface markings. The condition affects mainly the creases of the elbows and knees, and the face and neck, although it can affect any part of the body. The severity of eczema is variable, ranging from localised mild scaling to generalised involvement of the whole body with redness, oozing and secondary infection. Itching is the predominant symptom which can induce a vicious cycle of scratching, leading to skin damage, which in turn leads to more itching - the so called "itch scratch itch" cycle. There is a tendency to a dry sensitive skin even in those who have 'grown out' of the disease. This is thought to be due to a defect in the lipid barrier of the epidermis. In adulthood, the skin (especially of the hands) may be prone to inflammation in the presence of environmental irritants such as soaps (<LINK REF="REF-Archer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Archer 2000</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Natural history</HEADING>
<P>Atopic eczema usually starts within the first 6 months of life, and by 1 year, 60% of those likely to develop it will have done so. Remission occurs by the age of 15 years, in 60 to 70% of cases, although some relapse later. In the more severely affected child, development and puberty may be delayed (<LINK REF="REF-Baum-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baum 2002</LINK>). Many children with eczema go on to develop asthma and hay fever, which might also be triggered by food allergy (<LINK REF="REF-Ricci-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ricci 2006</LINK>)</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Impact</HEADING>
<P>Atopic eczema varies in severity, often from one hour to the next. Severity can be measured in a number of ways. A systematic review of named outcome scales for atopic eczema found that of the 13 named scales in current use, only one (Severity Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis, SCORAD) had been fully tested for validity, repeatability and responsiveness (<LINK REF="REF-Charman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Charman 2000</LINK>). Itching and scratching can adversely affect quality of life through chronic sleep disturbance. This may have an impact on family life. The disease can be associated with complications such as bacterial and viral infections (<LINK REF="REF-McHenry-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">McHenry 1995</LINK>). The unsightly appearance of the skin and the need to apply greasy ointments can limit a child's inclination to participate in social and sporting activities and thus affect their confidence. Adults with atopic eczema often have low self-esteem and relationships can be difficult to initiate and sustain. Everyday tasks such as housework, gardening, childcare and food preparation present problems when the skin on the hands is cracked. Promotion at work may be blocked for people who do not 'look good'.</P>
<P>There is a substantial economic cost not only to the family of the person with atopic eczema (<LINK REF="REF-Kemp-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kemp 2003</LINK>) but also to the health services of the country as a whole (<LINK REF="REF-Herd-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herd 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Verboom-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verboom 2002</LINK>). Direct costs to the family are encountered when purchasing treatments, special clothing and bedding; indirect costs are experienced from lost working days when parents are looking after a sick child. The wider economic implications lie in the costs of health professionals, the lost opportunities of parents of sick children who do not have the option of seeking employment and the child who, as a result of missing schooling, has limited employment prospects (<LINK REF="REF-Su-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Su 1997</LINK>).</P>

<P>There is currently no cure for atopic eczema.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Diet and atopic eczema</HEADING>
<P>Food hypersensitivity may be the first stage in the development of 'allergic diseases' such as atopic eczema (<LINK REF="REF-Chandra-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chandra 2002</LINK>). Food allergy may be an important factor in up to 20% of children with atopic eczema under 4 years (<LINK REF="REF-Oranje-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oranje 2000</LINK>). The incidence of food allergy is highest around the age of six to nine months. Many clinicians have found that elimination of specific foods found by food challenge to elicit symptoms can lead to significant improvement in eczematous symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Sampson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sampson 2003</LINK>). Challenges in people with food allergies can lead to eczematous lesions and infiltration of allergic inflammatory cells and animal studies have suggested that eczema may be caused by food allergies (<LINK REF="REF-Li-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>However, many food reactions in people with atopic eczema may not necessarily be mediated through immune reactions (<LINK REF="REF-David-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">David 2000</LINK>). As sensitisation to food early in life may be a predisposing factor (<LINK REF="REF-Baena_x002d_Cagnani-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baena-Cagnani 2001</LINK>) it is important to investigate whether the elimination of dietary triggers could help to alleviate the symptoms of atopic eczema. The role of dietary factors in atopic eczema either as a cause or as a treatment, through the use of exclusion diets, remains unclear (<LINK REF="REF-Oranje-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oranje 2000</LINK>). Many trialists advocate double blind placebo controlled food challenges to establish whether a child has a true food allergy (<LINK REF="REF-Sampson-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sampson 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is a vast amount of literature claiming that dietary elimination causes improvement of atopic eczema in some cases. However, much of the evidence fails to withstand close scrutiny (<LINK REF="REF-David-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">David 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are three main types of dietary exclusion (<LINK REF="REF-David-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">David 2000</LINK>):</P>
<P>(1) the simple elimination of cow's milk protein and egg;<BR/>(2) 'the few foods' diet (a diet in which all but a handful of foods is excluded) (<LINK REF="REF-David-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">David 1993</LINK>). One problem with the 'few foods diet' is poor adherence because the diet is so restrictive (<LINK REF="REF-Hathaway-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hathaway 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-David-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">David 1989</LINK>);<BR/>(3) the 'elemental' diet, more accurately described as a non-macromolecular diet since ordinary foodstuffs are all avoided, and the participant receives a liquid diet which contains amino acids, carbohydrate, fat, minerals and vitamins. The palatability of the elemental formula is poor.</P>
<P>Many people, with or without their doctor's or dietician's help, experiment by excluding a particular food suspected of causing a reaction for a variable time. Most investigators would base elimination diets upon proven food allergies, either by challenge or serum food-specific IgE antibodies exceeding specific diagnostic decision points (<LINK REF="REF-Sampson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sampson 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>The advantage of dietary interventions is that they may address one of the primary causes, as opposed to merely suppressing the symptoms, although there can be serious consequences to any dietary manipulation that leaves the individual deficient in calories, protein or minerals such as calcium. (<LINK REF="REF-David-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">David 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Devlin-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Devlin 1989</LINK>). Avoidance of multiple foods is potentially hazardous and requires continued paediatric and dietary supervision (<LINK REF="REF-David-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">David 1984</LINK>).</P>
<P>The role of food is much debated in atopic eczema, but the allergenic relevance of some proteins seems to be important only in a small number of people, especially in the first years of life (<LINK REF="REF-Svejgaard-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Svejgaard 1985</LINK>).</P>

<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of dietary exclusion for the treatment of established atopic eczema/dermatitis. We excluded double blind placebo controlled food challenges conducted in isolation, since these are not therapeutic trials but diagnostic or provocation tests.</P>
<P>Comparisons considered were active exclusion diet vs control or a comparison of two active diets.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>We included participants who had atopic eczema diagnosed by a doctor. In the National Health Service Technology Assessment (HTA) systematic review of treatments for atopic eczema (<LINK REF="REF-Hoare-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoare 2000</LINK>), specific terms were used to identify trial participants as listed in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. The list classifies conditions into 'definite', 'possible' and 'not' atopic eczema and we have used this list as a guide. We excluded those studies using terms in the 'not atopic eczema' category such as 'allergic contact eczema' . We found some studies using terms in the 'possible atopic eczema' category, such as 'childhood eczema' . One or more authors scrutinised these and we included them if the description of the participants clearly indicated atopic eczema (i.e. itching and flexural involvement).</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2008-05-23 13:37:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>For studies with a similar type of intervention, we performed a meta-analysis, to calculate a weighted treatment effect across trials, using a random effects model. We have expressed the results as risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD and 95% CI) for continuous outcomes. The results are also expressed as number needed to treat (NNT) where appropriate, for a range of plausible control event rates. Where it has not been possible to perform a meta-analysis the data have been summarised for each trial.</P>

<P>Where paired data were available for cross-over studies we calculated the conditional odds ratio with 95% CI using the methodology as described by <LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2003</LINK>. If paired data were not available then data, where available, were taken from the first phase of the cross-over study and if appropriate then the first phase was treated as a parallel study. Cross-over studies are not ideal for dietary exclusion studies since carry-over effects may invalidate data in the second period. Non-randomised controlled studies are listed but not discussed further. Studies relating to adverse effects are described qualitatively.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-05-27 13:37:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Diane A  Horsley">
<P>We found some evidence to support the use of an egg-free diet in infants with a suspected egg allergy who have a positive specific IgE to eggs in their blood. This perhaps highlights the importance of allergy testing beforehand. Only 2 of the other 11 included studies tested for food allergy (<LINK REF="STD-Isolauri-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Isolauri 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Niggemann-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Niggemann 2001</LINK>), but those studies dealt with comparisons of 2 different forms of exclusion diets rather than a comparison of an exclusion diet versus normal diet, and have therefore not contributed to the question of whether any form of exclusion diet is helpful in such people. The other included studies of unselected people with atopic eczema did not find any evidence of benefit for exclusion diets. It is useful to know that exclusion diets given to unselected people with atopic eczema are not likely to be helpful, as benefit from dietary exclusions could be due to non-allergic mechanisms. Not showing any benefit from such dietary exclusions in unselected people does not mean they are not helpful in people with proven allergy to that particular food. Three of the RCTs used potentially allergenic soya based milk substitute which itself can be allergenic in atopic eczema. Adverse events for people on exclusion diets included gastrointestinal symptoms followed by exacerbation of eczema or just exacerbation of eczema.<BR/>

The clinical importance of changes in severity scores obtained in many studies is unknown. Drop-out rates are particularly high for elimination diets and those containing hydrolysate milk substitutes and this will always remain a problem. Overall interpretation of the above studies was difficult due to the poor methodological quality of the studies.</P>

<P>Nine poor quality studies were included in the review involving 421 participants: 6 egg and cow's milk exclusion diets; 1 was a few foods diet; 2 were elemental diets.</P>
<P>Of the egg and cow's milk exclusion diets, three studies used soya based milk substitute which itself can be allergenic in atopic eczema. Three small cross-over studies studied various populations ranging from infants to adults. Only two studies followed participants for more than six months. Long-term outcomes and consequences of an egg and milk free diet were not discussed by any of the studies. One study in unselected breast feeding mothers and babies found an improvement in their babies eczema during the exclusion period and when they went back to their normal diet - however possible improvement may well have been spontaneous. One small study in unselected children found a significant improvement in eczema severity during the trials period when an egg and milk exclusion diet was compared to an egg and milk diet, however just under half of the participants were not included in the final analysis. One study in infants (11 to 17 months) with sensitivity to eggs found a significant improvement in body surface area with the exclusion diet compared to normal diet.</P>
<P>One study of the few foods diet found no significant change in body surface area, skin severity score, sleep disturbances in children when few foods diet plus whey compared to few foods diet plus casein hydrolysate or usual diet.</P>
<P>Two elemental diet studies were unable to find any significant difference in eczema severity when an elemental diet was compared to a normal hospital diet in adults or when an elemental diet was compared to a pre existing formula in children. Elemental diets are difficult since they are unpalatable for many and required hospitalisation and dietetic input.</P>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Elimination diets can be difficult to follow. The studies were performed in different populations with only one study giving results on the severity of atopic eczema. The clinical importance of small changes in severity scores obtained in many studies is unknown. Although diets excluding foods such as cows' milk are commonly tried there is little evidence for benefit in their use in unselected people with atopic eczema. That does not mean to say that they could not be beneficial in people with proven cows' milk allergy, but such studies have not been done yet. There may be some benefit in the use of an egg-free diet in infants with a suspected egg allergy who have a positive specific IgE to eggs in their blood. There does not appear to be any benefit in the use of elemental or few foods diet in unselected people with atopic eczema.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-05-27 13:40:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Diane A  Horsley">
<P>Future studies should be big enough to answer the questions posed, and well reported according to CONSORT guidance (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>). Common sense suggests that studies of food allergy exclusions should be done on people with a history of suggested food allergy, confirmed by appropriate allergy testing or challenge tests. A distinction should be made between young children, older children and adults, because food allergy in children tends to improve in time. Disease severity should be measured using valid instruments and include quality of life assessments and patient-centred outcomes that are easy to interpret clinically. Where possible, long-term outcomes (greater than six months) should also be recorded in such studies.</P>
