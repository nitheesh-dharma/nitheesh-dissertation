It is still just under the 1000 word limit!!!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Liz S notes 04/11/2014&lt;/b&gt; - I edited the search methods a little bit, and also the PRISMA diagram to show the previously included studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;CJC notes 3/11/14&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; (action points in bold). This is a great update, thanks for all the hard work here!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Have the conclusions really not changed???? Research implications might need to be updated perhaps at the least, also more data so more confidence in the results? Note from Emma - I added the what's new event - and looks like Chris doesn't exactly agree with it!! Can you discuss this as a team and edit it please. Happy to discuss further if need be....&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Please check the abstract carefully, the results were not updated but I have added a new paragraph with the updated results. Are you happy with this?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; I have deleted the Chi2 results except for the test for difference in subgroups. Chi2 is very sensitive to the number of trials, which is why we use I2 as the main way of reporting heterogeneity. If the authors are very keen to have both the changes can be rejected, but I think sticking to I2 is better!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Could you simplify the footnotes to the SoF tables to say &amp;quot;Downgraded by one point because....&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Not downgraded because&amp;quot;. We do not need the &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;full statistical results here. Also number 11. says no reason given!!!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. I have altered the wording for the subgroup sections for clarity (I hope).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6. &lt;b&gt;I have removed Barakat from the 6MWD results please, as the SD in the Forest plot is almost certainly an SE. You have already done this for SGRQ as previously discussed. I have amended the text for this result section, but please check that you are happy with the new pooled results.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interpretation of the 95% CI in relation to MCID is tricky. Upper and lower are not clear for SGRQ as -4 units is the MCID, so I have altered the wording slightly. There is still likely to be clinical benefit even if the end of the 95% CI crosses the MCID, but I agree that we cannot prove this to be the case!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;I could not find any reference to Roman in the review????&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; There seems to be Roman/Gomez in the additional table?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Otherwise all the data that I checked for SGRQ total scores looks fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Emma W notes 27/10/2014&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HI All, great job with a big update. The overall message is quite simple which is good. In terms of copy editing, there was quite a bit of basic copy editing to be done - deleting extra spaces before punctuation, formatting lists, formatting text and abbreviations and the references needed quite a lot of work. I have just gone on and done this for you - Emma J kindly did all the 350+ references - and this will save time during copy editing later. If you want to see what changes were made let me know and I can send you a document showing them. As expected with a document of this size, there were several typos. The ones I was unsure about I have edited using tracked changes and highlighted. Please can you go through the entire review checking out the highlights and the tracked changes that remain and resolve any issues. The following issues are mostly minor - the biggest thing is the SOF table and the abstract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I would change the first sentence with one describing briefly what pulm rehab is.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have added several things that you need to include to meet the Cochrane standards in the abstract - Using tracked changes I just wrote right on in there... I recommend that you make these changes and then go through the MECIR standards reporting standards R3 to R18 to check everything is in there (http://editorial-unit.cochrane.org/sites/editorial-unit.cochrane.org/files/uploads/MECIR%20Reporting%20standards%201.1_17122012_2.pdf). We recommend that you include a description of the GRADE of the evidence together with the treatment effect - for example (Dyspnoea score: MD 1.0 units; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.8 to 1.3 units; n = 12 trials, xxx participants,&lt;span class=&quot;marker&quot;&gt; moderate quality evidence&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Background&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;in a few places you need to go back and use the proper symbol, but it's not clear enough for me to be able to edit them myself so I highlighted them instead. It's a pain finding the symbols in RevMan, so here they are: &amp;#177; &amp;#8804; &amp;#8805; can you do a copy and paste job from these symbols throughout the review please&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;PR - I have gone with the convention to describe pulmonary rehabilitation in the ATS guidelines - using the words spelt out in full in the text, and PR in tables&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was speaking with someone affected by interstitial lung disease and she was saying how important it was to be offered pulmonary rehab as soon as you are diagnosed with a disease so that you don't shy away from exercise in the first instance and start on that spiral downwards that you mention in the review. Does that sound familiar to you clinically? Does it mention the importance of starting on a pulmonary rehab programme straight away in the guidelines or somewhere else? If so, can you consider adding this to the review to encourage people newly diagnosed to ask for PR if they have not already been referred?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods - detailed information on RoB - I moved this to the appendix as it is making the review quite long. Hope that is OK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Differences between protocol and review needs completion. Please list anything which has changed since the last published version. I stared this list in the 'what's new' event at the top of the review&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tables - I did a couple of minor changes to improve the appearance in the online published version&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;changed 'not available' to na and added this to footnotes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;in table 3 moved the subgroup column from 1st column to 3rd column&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;couple of things that look like some kind of typo highlighted- please check&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary of findings table - &lt;/b&gt;Last but by no means least, all the outcomes need to be included on the SOF table. Please can you report one of the CRQ domains, then the total SGRQ domain and then one each of the other outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;References&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) Please can you go through the 'Warnings' section of the Validation Report and remove any refs that are not linked from the text. There are also a couple of other queries on the report which need extra info.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2) I've activated the standard headings that come under Discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3) Please check GOLD statements - necessary to have all of them or just the 2014 version? I couldn't find GOLD 2011, so if you still want this you'll need to input the URL and date accessed (as per other websites - you'll see from my amendments).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4) NICE 2004 &amp;amp; &lt;a link_type=&quot;REFERENCE&quot; href=&quot;NICE 2010&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;NICE 2010&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; are these the same &amp;#8211; use only one?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5) &lt;a link_type=&quot;REFERENCE&quot; href=&quot;Stanton 1995&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Stanton 1995&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; please add authors up to 6 &amp;#8211; I can&amp;#8217;t find this ref anywhere on internet to see whether there are any further authors. Up to 6 authors should be listed then 'et al'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6) Additional refs: WHO, World Health Statistics, 2008 &amp;#8211; need more info here &amp;#8211; a URL would be good plus date accessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;7) Please could you have a look at the PLS - this should be as per PLEACS: http://airways.cochrane.org/sites/airways.cochrane.org/files/uploads/PLEACS_0.pdf&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;***Comments related to 2006 update ***&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.3 Beta&lt;br&gt;July 12 CJC edit&lt;br&gt;Thanks Toby - I am happy with your description of the results of the sensitivity analysis.

If you just include studies where there is adequate allocation concealment and blinding what are the results please? [TJL: Removing studies where allocation concealment was unclear or not reported and/or blinding of outcome assessment was not reported or not undertaken altered the pooled effect estimate for maximal exercise capacity only (weighted mean difference 5.89; 95% confidence interval -0.18 to 11.96). I have not added text regarding this - is it worthwhile? I am not sure that this proves a differential effect. It could be a function of reducing the statistical power of the analysis by removing the studies. Thoughts?]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spellchecked : done&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next action : Back to authors for minor changes as above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;=============================================&lt;br&gt;Sent to YL and SM 30/05/02. Do not delete this line.&lt;br&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;TJL wrote 111104:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Yves,&lt;br&gt;Enfin.....I have managed to put the references in to classification pending for all the new studies. I have also managed to pull out the references to studies already included and excluded and added these. In all, there are some 95 studies that I have gone through, and the good news is that the majority can be excluded. I have detailed the reasons for this in the unpublished notes section of each study in the section marked 'classification pending'. Where data are missing I have reported this in the notes section and given the dates of my correspondence with the trialists and whether they have responded (as yet).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obviously the next phase involves all parties expressing dis/agreement with my selection. Of the studies that are in the classification pending section, 63 can be excluded at this stage. I have annotated 29 studies as either 'include' or 'poss include'. Five papers are awaiting assessment - two because they are unavailable in the UK through the British Library's own worldwide searches, one because it was inadequately reported and two as they are awaiting translation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once we have settled on the final list of definite includes I can set about extracting the data for these studies. I should hope that we can get the data we need prior to your trip to the UK Yves - I have contacted all the trialists where there are missing data. I have also translated the &lt;a link_type=&quot;REFERENCE&quot; href=&quot;Wright 2002&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Wright 2002&lt;/a&gt; and Worth 2002 papers and I have attached them as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One important question we need to think about is whether we are including studies looking at rehabilitation immediately after an exacerbation of COPD. Several studies have looked at this, but I wonder whether we should leave that to a different review topic. The work ahead is probably large enough, and the size of the literature in the acute COPD field is growing and would warrant a separate review I think. Anyway, I hope that the attached files come in useful!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Best wishes,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toby&lt;br&gt;Old title: *Pulmonary rehabilitation for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease UPDATE&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2015-04-21 16:39:06 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh" REVIEW_NO="PRH-COP" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.3.5 " REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="9.0">

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-02-05 17:05:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) describes a chronic lung condition that prevents the air supply from getting to the lungs. Symptoms include breathlessness, coughing, tiredness and frequent chest infection. Worldwide, COPD is a major cause of ill health.</P>
<P>Pulmonary rehabilitation programmes include exercise as a key component; some programmes contain other interventions such as assessment, education, psychological support and dietary advice. Pulmonary rehabilitation is one of the key recommended approaches in the treatment of COPD. This review compared the impact of pulmonary rehabilitation versus usual care on the health-related quality of life of people with COPD. We included 65 studies involving 3822 participants. Participants were randomly assigned to receive pulmonary rehabilitation or usual care. The quality of the studies was generally good.</P>
<P>
<B>This review highlights that pulmonary rehabilitation improves the health-related quality of life of people with COPD. Results strongly support inclusion of pulmonary rehabilitation as part of the management and treatment of patients with COPD. </B>
</P>
<P>Future studies should concentrate on identifying the most important components of pulmonary rehabilitation, the ideal length of a programme, the intensity of training required and how long the benefits of the programme last.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-02-05 17:05:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Widespread application of pulmonary rehabilitation (also known as respiratory rehabilitation) in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) should be preceded by demonstrable improvements in function (health-related quality of life, functional and maximal exercise capacity) attributable to the programmes. This review updates the review reported in 2006.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2015-02-05 17:05:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>To compare the effects of pulmonary rehabilitation versus usual care on health-related quality of life and functional and maximal exercise capacity in persons with COPD.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-02-05 17:05:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>We identified additional randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register. Searches were current as of March 2014.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2015-02-05 17:05:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>We selected RCTs of pulmonary rehabilitation in patients with COPD in which health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and/or functional (FEC) or maximal (MEC) exercise capacity were measured. We defined 'pulmonary rehabilitation' as exercise training for at least four weeks with or without education and/or psychological support. We defined 'usual care' as conventional care in which the control group was not given education or any form of additional intervention. We considered participants in the following situations to be in receipt of usual care: only verbal advice was given without additional education; and medication was altered or optimised to what was considered best practice at the start of the trial for <B>
<U>all</U>
</B> participants.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-02-05 17:05:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>We calculated mean differences (MDs) using a random-effects model. We requested missing data from the authors of the primary study. We used standard methods as recommended by The Cochrane Collaboration.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-02-05 17:05:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Along with the 31 RCTs included in the previous version (2006), we included 34 additional RCTs in this update, resulting in a total of 65 RCTs involving 3822 participants for inclusion in the meta-analysis.</P>
<P>We noted no significant demographic differences at baseline between members of the intervention group and those who received usual care. For the pulmonary rehabilitation group, the mean forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV<SUB>1</SUB>) was 39.2% predicted, and for the usual care group 36.4%; mean age was 62.4 years and 62.5 years, respectively. The gender mix in both groups was around two males for each female. A total of 41 of the pulmonary rehabilitation programmes were hospital based (inpatient or outpatient), 23 were community based (at community centres or in individual homes) and one study had both a hospital component and a community component. Most programmes were of 12 weeks' or eight weeks' duration with an overall range of four weeks to 52 weeks.</P>
<P>The nature of the intervention made it impossible for investigators to blind participants or those delivering the programme. In addition, it was unclear from most early studies whether allocation concealment was undertaken; along with the high attrition rates reported by several studies, this impacted the overall risk of bias.</P>
<P>We found statistically significant improvement for all included outcomes. In four important domains of quality of life (QoL) (Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ) scores for dyspnoea, fatigue, emotional function and mastery), the effect was larger than the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of 0.5 units (dyspnoea: MD 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.56 to 1.03; N = 1283; studies = 19; moderate-quality evidence; fatigue: MD 0.68, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.92; N = 1291; studies = 19; low-quality evidence; emotional function: MD 0.56, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.78; N = 1291; studies = 19; mastery: MD 0.71, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.95; N = 1212; studies = 19; low-quality evidence). Statistically significant improvements were noted in all domains of the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), and improvement in total score was better than 4 units (MD -6.89, 95% CI -9.26 to -4.52; N = 1146; studies = 19; low-quality evidence). Sensitivity analysis using the trials at lower risk of bias yielded a similar estimate of the treatment effect (MD -5.15, 95% CI -7.95 to -2.36; N = 572; studies = 7).</P>
<P>Both functional exercise and maximal exercise showed statistically significant improvement. Researchers reported an increase in maximal exercise capacity (mean Wmax (W)) in participants allocated to pulmonary rehabilitation compared with usual care (MD 6.77, 95% CI 1.89 to 11.65; N = 779; studies = 16). The common effect size exceeded the MCID (4 watts) proposed by <A HREF="Puhan 2011(b)">Puhan 2011(b)</A>. In relation to functional exercise capacity, the six-minute walk distance mean treatment effect was greater than the threshold of clinical significance (MD 43.93, 95% CI 32.64 to 55.21; participants = 1879; studies = 38).</P>
<P>The subgroup analysis, which compared hospital-based programmes versus community-based programmes, provided evidence of a significant difference in treatment effect between subgroups for all domains of the CRQ, with higher mean values, on average, in the hospital-based pulmonary rehabilitation group than in the community-based group. The SGRQ did not reveal this difference. Subgroup analysis performed to look at the complexity of the pulmonary rehabilitation programme provided no evidence of a significant difference in treatment effect between subgroups that received exercise only and those that received exercise combined with more complex interventions. However, both subgroup analyses could be confounded and should be interpreted with caution.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-02-05 17:05:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Pulmonary rehabilitation relieves dyspnoea and fatigue, improves emotional function and enhances the sense of control that individuals have over their condition. These improvements are moderately large and clinically significant. Rehabilitation serves as an important component of the management of COPD and is beneficial in improving health-related quality of life and exercise capacity. It is our opinion that additional RCTs comparing pulmonary rehabilitation and conventional care in COPD are not warranted. Future research studies should focus on identifying which components of pulmonary rehabilitation are essential, its ideal length and location, the degree of supervision and intensity of training required and how long treatment effects persist. This endeavour is important in the light of the new subgroup analysis, which showed a difference in treatment effect on the CRQ between hospital-based and community-based programmes but no difference between exercise only and more complex pulmonary rehabilitation programmes.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-02-05 17:05:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a multi-factorial progressive chronic lung disease that causes obstruction in airflow. This obstruction results in persistent and progressive breathlessness, productive coughing, fatigue and recurrent chest infection (<LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2014</LINK>). COPD is also associated with extrapulmonary effects such as muscle wasting, osteopaenia (reduction in protein and mineral content of bone tissue), cardiovascular disease and depression and therefore is now best understood as a systemic disease (<LINK REF="REF-Agusti-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agusti 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Agusti-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agusti 2005</LINK>). Worldwide, COPD is a major cause of morbidity. It is estimated that 210 million people are living with COPD (<LINK REF="REF-Franchi-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Franchi 2009</LINK>), and it is projected that by the year 2030, COPD will be the third most frequent cause of death globally (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2008</LINK>). At this time, COPD is an incurable condition that is associated with significant economic costs due to progressive disease severity and frequent hospital admissions and readmissions (<LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guarascio-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guarascio 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Risk factors for COPD are numerous and include genetics, recurrent respiratory infection, low socioeconomic status, exposure to air pollutants, poor nutrition and asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Eisner-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eisner 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2014</LINK>). However smoking is recognised as a major cause of COPD, and the more a person smokes, the more likely he or she is to develop this condition (<LINK REF="REF-Forey-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forey 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>COPD is a heterogeneous condition with marked variation in progression between individuals (<LINK REF="REF-Casanova-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casanova 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nishimura-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nishimura 2013</LINK>). The initial underlying pathology of COPD is confined to the lungs, and a clinical diagnosis is based on presenting symptoms and confirmation of airflow obstruction with a postbronchodilator spirometry forced expiratory volume in one second/forced vital capacity ratio (FEV<SUB>1</SUB>/FVC) &lt; 0.70 (<LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2014</LINK>). The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines are usually used to grade the severity of airflow limitations as mild (FEV<SUB>1</SUB> &#8805; 80% predicted: GOLD 1), moderate (50% &#8804; FEV<SUB>1</SUB> &lt; 80% predicted: GOLD 2), severe (30% &#8804; FEV<SUB>1</SUB> 50% predicted: GOLD 3) or very severe (FEV<SUB>1</SUB> &lt; 30% predicted: GOLD 4) (<LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>The symptoms of COPD make engagement in physical activity unpleasant as the result of air trapping and increased hyperinflation in the lungs, which result in increased breathlessness due to subsequent inefficient breathing (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_-Donnell-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">O' Donnell 2007</LINK>). Increased breathlessness provokes anxiety, which inevitably leads to further breathlessness, exacerbation of COPD symptoms and panic. This causes a vicious circle whereby any activities that involve physical exertion are avoided, causing muscle de-conditioning, which further reduces capacity to engage in physical activity (<LINK REF="REF-Bourbeau-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bourbeau 2007</LINK>). Physical inactivity is therefore a key predictor of mortality in people with COPD (<LINK REF="REF-Garcia_x002d_Aymerich-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia-Aymerich 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spruit-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spruit 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Waschki-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waschki 2011</LINK>). Consequently, the joint American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) (<LINK REF="REF-Spruit-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spruit 2013</LINK>) guidelines highlight the importance of exercise in the treatment and management of COPD.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-02-05 17:05:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Treatment interventions for COPD include smoking cessation, pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies and, in specific circumstances, supplemental oxygen, ventilatory support, surgical treatment and palliative care (<LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2014</LINK>). However, best evidence and all current international guidelines ratify the central role of pulmonary rehabilitation in the treatment of people with COPD (<LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nici--2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nici 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ries-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ries 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spruit-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spruit 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR), which was first defined by the American College of Chest Physicians Committee in 1974, is a proactive approach to minimising COPD symptoms, improving health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and increasing physical and emotional involvement in everyday life (<LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nici--2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nici 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ries-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ries 2007</LINK>). The ATS in conjunction with the ERS has published numerous comprehensive statements on PR, with the most recent update in 2013. In the latest update, pulmonary rehabilitation was defined newly as a "&#8230;comprehensive intervention based on a thorough patient assessment followed by patient tailored therapies that include, but are not limited to, exercise training, education, and behaviour change, designed to improve the physical and psychological condition of people with chronic respiratory disease and to promote the long-term adherence to health-enhancing behaviours" (<LINK REF="REF-Spruit-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spruit 2013</LINK>). This new definition differs from the previous one (2006) in that it focuses on the interdisciplinary and therefore more holistic approach to PR rather than on the previous multi-disciplinary approach; highlights the importance of behaviour change; and places PR firmly within the concept of integrated care (<LINK REF="REF-Spruit-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spruit 2013</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
<P>Depending on culture, healthcare systems and resources, the structure, personnel, content and settings of PR programmes may vary (<LINK REF="REF-Nici--2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nici 2006;</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Spruit-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spruit 2013</LINK>). However, individually tailored exercise training is considered the cornerstone of PR (<LINK REF="REF-Nici--2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nici 2006;</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Ries-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ries 2007;</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Spruit-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spruit 2013</LINK>). In particular, strength, low- and high-intensity training, exercise endurance and upper and lower extremity training are recommended (<LINK REF="REF-Nici--2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nici 2006;</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Ries-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ries 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Spruit-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spruit 2013</LINK>). In addition to exercise, the typical comprehensive PR programme includes patient assessment, education, psychosocial support and nutritional counselling (<LINK REF="REF-ATS-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATS 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spruit-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spruit 2013</LINK>). Pulmonary rehabilitation is typically delivered to groups of patients (rather than to individuals), but no evidence suggests the optimal size of the exercise group. However, the American Association of Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Rehabilitation (<LINK REF="REF-AACVPR-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">AACVPR 2011</LINK>) recommends a staff-to-participant ratio of 1:4, and the British Thoracic Society (<LINK REF="REF-British-Thoracic-Society--2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">British Thoracic Society 2001</LINK>) a ratio of 1:8. The setting for PR programmes varies; both community-based (<LINK REF="STD-Cambach-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Cambach 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Casey-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Casey 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wijkstra-1994a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wijkstra 1994a</LINK>) and home-based programmes (<LINK REF="REF-Maltais-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maltais 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Viera--2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Viera 2010</LINK>) are available. However, traditionally, most PR programmes have been hospital based (<LINK REF="REF-Bourbeau-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bourbeau 2010</LINK>), with participants attending as in-patients or on an out-patient basis.<BR/>
</P>
<P>The optimal duration of programmes, number of sessions offered per week and type of staff required to deliver PR programmes are unclear. <LINK REF="REF-Beauchamp-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beauchamp 2011</LINK> concludes, following a systematic review, that available evidence is insufficient to show the optimal duration of PR programmes for people with COPD. However, a programme duration of at least eight weeks is recommended to attain a substantial effect (<LINK REF="REF-Beauchamp-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beauchamp 2011</LINK>). Likewise the number of times per week that programmes are offered differs; typically hospital-based out-patient programmes are offered two or three days per week, and in-patient programmes are offered over five days (<LINK REF="REF-Spruit-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spruit 2013</LINK>). The optimal number of sessions required remains unclear. However, the 2006 ATS/ERS guidelines specify three sessions per week or a twice-weekly supervised and one unsupervised home session (<LINK REF="REF-Nici--2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nici 2006</LINK>). Finally, key requirements for staff delivering the programme are that they are clinically competent, having the required skills and knowledge and maintain patient safety (<LINK REF="REF-Spruit-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spruit 2013</LINK>).<BR/>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-02-05 17:05:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Pulmonary rehabilitation seeks to reduce COPD symptoms, reestablish and improve functional ability, enhance participation in everyday life, promote autonomy and improve HRQoL (<LINK REF="REF-Spruit-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spruit 2013</LINK>). It does this by focusing on the systemic aspects of the disease that are common among patients with COPD (<LINK REF="REF-AACVPR-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">AACVPR 2011</LINK>). The exercise component of PR increases inspiratory volume and reduces dynamic hyperinflation, both of which reduce dyspnoea when the person is performing tasks (<LINK REF="REF-Casaburi-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casaburi 2009</LINK>). Exercise also increases muscle function, delaying fatigue and resulting in increased exercise tolerance. Meanwhile, the educational component of PR focuses on collaborative self-management and behaviour change (<LINK REF="REF-Spruit-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spruit 2013</LINK>). It encompasses providing information and knowledge regarding COPD; building skills such as goal setting, problem solving and decision making; and developing action plans that allow individuals to better recognise and manage the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Spruit-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spruit 2013</LINK>). The behaviour change element focuses on modifying nutritional intake and smoking patterns; adhering to medication and regular exercise; and utilising effective breathing techniques and energy-saving strategies (<LINK REF="REF-Spruit-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spruit 2013</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-02-05 17:05:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Review authors undertook the original version of this Cochrane review in 2001 in response to worldwide endorsement of PR as integral to the management of COPD and lack of clear evidence as to the impact of these programmes on HRQoL and exercise tolerance (<LINK REF="REF-Lacasse-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lacasse 2001</LINK>). The review included 23 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), and review authors concluded that PR (exercise training for a minimum of four weeks with or without education and/or psychological support) resulted in statistically significant improvement in HRQoL and modest improvement in exercise capacity (<LINK REF="REF-Lacasse-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lacasse 2001</LINK>). This review was updated in 2006, included 31 RCTs and again reported statistically significant improvement in HRQoL. However, results for both functional and maximal exercise capacity were below the threshold of clinical significance. <LINK REF="REF-Lacasse-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lacasse 2006</LINK> concluded that further RCTs comparing PR versus usual care for patients with COPD were not needed. Despite this, a large number of RCTs published since 2006 have endorsed the need for this current update. Furthermore, recent RCTs tend to use disease-specific quality of life indices as primary outcome measures,, combined with more refined maximal and functional exercise capacity measurement tools (<LINK REF="REF-Curtis-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curtis 2003;</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-de-Torres-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Torres 2002;</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Gross-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gross 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jones-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2003</LINK>). Consequently in the current review, we will take a more focused approach to assessment of primary and secondary outcomes. In recent years, wide variation has been noted in the follow-up assessment times utilised within studies, and this may have an impact on study outcomes. Therefore in the current review, we will include only assessments completed up to and within three months of completion of the intervention. Also, risk of bias requirements for Cochrane reviews have been altered since the last update; review authors of this current update will ensure that these new requirements are met. Finally, as a separate systematic review examining the effects of PR following exacerbations of COPD has been undertaken (<LINK REF="REF-Puhan--2011_x0028_a_x0029_" TYPE="REFERENCE">Puhan 2011(a)</LINK>), we will exclude from this review studies that commenced within four weeks of an acute exacerbation of COPD.</P>

Two review authors (BMC, EM) entered all data into the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>) and checked them for accuracy.</P>
<P>If a study reported multiple group comparisons (e.g. exercise therapy with inspiratory muscle training compared with exercise therapy alone or with conventional community care), treatment groups considered relevant to PR were combined as if one intervention group,.and this group was compared with the group receiving conventional community care. Studies in which multiple group comparisons included interventions that were not considered relevant to PR such as acupuncture were not combined.</P>

<P>The lead review author (BMC) assessed the risk of bias for all included studies. A second review author (DC, EM or KM) independently assessed the risk of bias for each study. The review authors followed the criteria for assessing risk of bias provided by The Cochrane Collaboration in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) and contained in RevMan (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>).

<P>We considered several important potential sources of bias that have proved to be major determinants of the magnitude of the effect size in clinical trials: unconcealed randomisation, unblinded study personnel, incomplete outcome data and attrition of more than 20% of those randomly assigned. The first of these has been associated with an overestimation of treatment effect by up to 40% (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>), and the second may result in differential encouragement during performance testing, with the potential for distortion of the results (up to 30.5 metres in a six-minute walk test) (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 1984</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK> argued that loss to follow-up of 20% or greater should be a matter of concern as it relates to the possibility of bias.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Continuous data</HEADING>
<P>Different measures of HRQoL and exercise capacity have been reported in the primary studies. Both primary outcomes (HRQoL) and secondary outcomes (exercise capacity) are continuous outcomes. For these continuous variables, we recorded mean change from baseline or mean postintervention values and standard deviation (SD) for each group for outcomes measured using the same metrics. When 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and standard errors (SEs) were reported, we calculated SDs as guided by the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). When SDs were missing from studies and it was not possible to obtain the results from study authors, we used a mean value for the SD of the other studies that reported that outcome. All outcomes were reported independently, so standardised mean differences (SMDs) for outcomes were not required. Mean differences (MDs) with 95% CIs were calculated for each study by using a random-effects model.</P>

<P>Review authors undertook statistical analysis by using Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>). Throughout the analysis, we used mean differences (MDs) as determined (to take into account pre-experiment group differences) from the differences between preintervention and postintervention changes in treatment and control groups. We combined MDs according to random-effects analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Shadish-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shadish 1994</LINK>) and presented the results as average treatment effects with 95% CIs and estimates of Tau² and I². In the case of cross-over trials, we considered only the first study period and excluded from the analysis data obtained during the second study period. We explored heterogeneity through a priori specified subgroup analyses. When possible, for each outcome, we discussed the summary effect estimate in the context of its minimal clinically important difference (MCID). The MCID is defined as the smallest difference in score corresponding to the smallest difference perceived by the average patient that would mandate, in the absence of troublesome side effects and excessive costs, a change in management of a patient's condition (<LINK REF="REF-Jaeschke-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jaeschke 1989</LINK>).</P>

<SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2015-02-05 17:05:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>To explain anticipated heterogeneity among study results, we defined a set of three a priori hypotheses on which sensitivity analyses were to be based. We identified potential sources of heterogeneity in relation to the outcomes of exercise capacity and HRQoL. We then classified these hypotheses into subcategories as follows.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>The contribution of each of the components of PR programmes to patient improvement in exercise capacity and HRQoL is not known. We hypothesised that the more comprehensive the rehabilitation programme, the larger would be the effect size in improving exercise capacity and HRQoL. We also hypothesised that a difference in intervention effect may be noted between hospital only-based and community/home-based interventions. Therefore, we performed a subgroup analysis of:</P>
<UL>
<LI>pulmonary rehabilitation and exercise only interventions versus PR plus a more comprehensive intervention within which education was included; and</LI>
<LI>hospital only-based versus community/home-based programmes.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Methodological quality</HEADING>
<P>We hypothesised that the results of trials would be influenced by their methodological quality. For the purpose of this subgroup analysis, we defined high-quality trials as those at low risk of bias for:</P>
<UL>
<LI>allocation concealment; or</LI>
<LI>incomplete outcome data (i.e. loss to follow-up &#8805; 20%).</LI>
</UL>
<P>We assessed for subgroup differences by using interaction tests available within RevMan (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>).

Of these, the CRG and the SGRQ have become the recognised standard of assessment of HRQoL amongst patients with COPD and are reported here. We analysed the CRQ and the SGRQ separately.

The lower limit of the confidence interval around the common treatment effect of the dyspnoea domains (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>) exceeded the MCID, indicating not only statistical significance but also clinical significance in the effect of PR.

Of these, 38 (1879 participants: 1012 actively treated, 867 controls) presented the results in a format that could be used for the meta-analysis (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>). Investigators reported a statistically significant increase, on average, in the mean difference in metres walked associated with PR (MD 43.93 m, 95% CI 32.64 to 55.21; Tau² = 713.49; I² = 74%; <LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>). Both the common effect and the lower limit of its confidence interval exceeded the MCID for the 6WMD of 30 metres, as recommended by <LINK REF="REF-Holland-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holland 2014</LINK>, indicating the clinical significance of the effect of PR. .</P>
<P>Eight trials (694 participants) reported data on the incremental shuttle walk test (ISWT). These test results were analysed independently from those of the 6MWT. On average, a statistically significant increase in mean metres walked was noted among participants allocated to PR compared with those allocated to usual care (MD 39.77, 95% CI 22.38 to 57.15; Tau² = 181.56; I² = 32%). This result is slightly below the MCID of 47.5 m (<LINK REF="REF-Singh-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Singh-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 2014</LINK>) to make this a finding of clinical significance.</P>
<P>Similar to previous outcomes on maximal exercise, both the six-minute walk test and the analyses demonstrated substantial heterogeneity.</P>
<P>Several other outcome measures were used to measure functional capacity, but because of the limited numbers of trials providing data for these other outcomes (endurance shuttle walk test: two trials; 12-minute walk test: four trials); four-minute walk test: one trial)), these findings were not included in the meta-analysis.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2015-02-05 17:05:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>This review summarised 65 studies involving 3822 participants with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 2090 of whom were randomly allocated to some form of exercise rehabilitation for a minimum duration of four weeks, and 1732 individuals randomly assigned to usual care. This is the second update of this review, which was last updated in 2006 (<LINK REF="REF-Lacasse-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lacasse 2006)</LINK>. Pulmonary rehabilitation is now accepted within the scientific community as an essential strategy in the ongoing management of people with COPD (<LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2014</LINK>). Development of objective health-related quality of life (HRQoL) outcome measures (<LINK REF="REF-Kirshner-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirshner 1985</LINK>) and demonstration of a physiological rationale for exercise training in people with COPD (<LINK REF="REF-Casaburi-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casaburi 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maltais-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maltais 1996</LINK>) have facilitated this acceptance. Results of the previous version of this meta-analysis strongly supported pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) in the management of COPD, and results of this current update reconfirm these findings.</P>
<P>Three aspects of the meta-analysis warrant comment. First, we examined the short-term effects of PR in COPD, that is, the benefits of rehabilitation found at the completion of a programme. When the original review was undertaken, few investigators were examining the long-term benefits of rehabilitation (<LINK REF="REF-Guell-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guell 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ries-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ries 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Troosters-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Troosters 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wijkstra-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wijkstra 1995</LINK>). More recently, focus on this aspect of PR has increased and exploration of strategies to maintain early benefits continues (<LINK REF="REF-Brooks-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brooks 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Foglio-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Foglio 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ries-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ries 2003</LINK>). This review does not attempt to examine these issues. Second, we have been conservative in concluding clear benefit only when the 95% confidence interval (CI) representing the smallest treatment effect was still greater than the minimal clinically important difference (MCID). Third, we excluded a number of well-conducted studies that have contributed to our understanding of PR, but in which control participants received interventions beyond what was considered conventional care. An example of this is <LINK REF="STD-Ries-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ries 1995</LINK>, which was excluded on the grounds that control participants had been given an educational programme. Similarly, several studies in which an intervention such as inspiratory muscle training, psychosocial support or breathing exercises was compared with exercise training were excluded. Only studies in which usual care was directly compared with exercise rehabilitation were included for analysis.</P>
<P>As the care of patients with COPD is largely concerned with treating symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Pauwels-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pauwels 2001</LINK>), we believe that HRQoL should be considered as the primary outcome in PR. The present meta-analysis reconfirms the findings of the previous version that PR is effective in relieving dyspnoea and fatigue, and in improving patients' emotional function and control over the disease. The magnitude of the improvement lies beyond the MCID.</P>
<P>In most trials, investigators measured HRQoL by using either the Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire (CRQ) or the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). Head-to-head comparisons of these questionnaires have been published (<LINK REF="REF-Harper-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harper 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rutten_x002d_van-M_x00f6_lken-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutten-van Mölken 1999</LINK>). In both studies, analyses of reliability, validity and responsiveness did not clearly favour one instrument above the other. Rutten-van Mölken and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Rutten_x002d_van-M_x00f6_lken-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutten-van Mölken 1999</LINK>) suggested that the choice between the CRQ and the SGRQ should be based on other considerations, such as the required sample size. Only one trial included in the meta-analysis reported results from both the CRQ and the SGRQ (<LINK REF="STD-Griffiths-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Griffiths 2000</LINK>), with no clear indication that one questionnaire is more sensitive to change than the other. Therefore, comparisons from this meta-analysis are only indirect. We found wider 95% CIs around the pooled treatment effect from the SGRQ - a situation that may be explained by the smaller number of participants contributing to this analysis.</P>
<P>Pulmonary rehabilitation programmes included in the meta-analysis differed in several aspects, including clinical setting, duration and composition. This we believe is responsible for the substantial heterogeneity observed in the results obtained and is in keeping with a recent study by <LINK REF="REF-Spruit-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spruit 2014</LINK> and supported by <LINK REF="REF-Rochester-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rochester 2014</LINK>, who also identified this as an issue requiring further investigation. For instance, the contributions of educational activities and psychological support to exercise training remain uncertain. This information would be of outmost importance to physicians and allied healthcare professionals who prescribe rehabilitation and to those who allocate the resources. We addressed this issue in a systematic overview of the literature (<LINK REF="REF-Lacasse-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lacasse 1997</LINK>). Since the time this review was published, further evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) has been published to better define the type and intensity of exercise (<LINK REF="STD-Bernard-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bernard 1999</LINK>), as well as the influence of programme components, including patient education and self-management (<LINK REF="REF-Bourbeau-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bourbeau 2003</LINK>), nutritional support (<LINK REF="REF-Steiner-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steiner 2003</LINK>) and respiratory muscle training (<LINK REF="REF-Watson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watson 1997</LINK>). Sometimes, evidence even took the form of systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Ferreira-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferreira 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lotters-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lotters 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2005</LINK>). Such questions were too specific to be directly addressed in this meta-analysis, which aimed to investigate the overall effect of rehabilitation in COPD (not the effects of its components). Nevertheless, homogeneity among study results suggested that less sophisticated rehabilitation programmes may also be effective in improving HRQoL, although the between-study comparison from which this conclusion follows is relatively weak.</P>
<P>Investigators have identified an increase in exercise tolerance and functional activities such as walking as other relevant outcomes of rehabilitation (<LINK REF="REF-Fishman-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fishman 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pauwels-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pauwels 2001</LINK>). Our current interpretation of the results of the six-minute walk test (6MWT) analysis differs from that of the previous version of the meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Lacasse-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lacasse 2006</LINK>). In 2006, results of the meta-analysis were compared with an MCID of 54 metres (95% CI 37 to 71 metres; <LINK REF="REF-Redelmeier--1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Redelmeier 1997</LINK>). From this comparison, the clinical significance of results obtained from the 2006 meta-analysis was interpreted as uncertain. Since 2006, several studies have further investigated the issue of the MCID in field walk tests in chronic respiratory disease. Results of these studies have recently been summarised in an important systematic review, which was supported by the European Respiratory and American Thoracic Societies (<LINK REF="REF-Holland-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holland 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Singh-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 2014</LINK>). Although variability across studies and methods used to determine the MCID is evident, available evidence suggests that the MCID for the 6MWT lies between 25 and 33 metres (median estimate 30 metres). Results of our meta-analysis (i.e. MD of 43.93 metres with 95% CI between 36.24 and 55.21 metres) indicate the clinical significance of the effects of PR.</P>
<P>When compared with the treatment effects of other important modalities of care for patients with COPD, such as long-acting inhaled therapy or oral theophylline and its new derivatives (<LINK REF="REF-Kew-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kew 2014</LINK>
<U>; </U>
<LINK REF="REF-Ram-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ram 2005</LINK>), rehabilitation resulted in greater improvement in important domains of HRQoL and functional exercise capacity.</P>
<P>The importance of measures of maximal exercise capacity remains to be defined. An initial test may be useful in assisting with the prescription of an appropriate level of training. Retesting may provide physiological evidence that a training response has occurred and may be useful in adjustment of intensity levels during the programme (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 1988</LINK>). As the results of maximal exercise tests correlate poorly with those of HRQoL measures (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wijkstra-1994a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wijkstra 1994a</LINK>), maximal exercise testing cannot serve as a substitute for such measures when the outcome of a rehabilitation programme is evaluated.</P>

<P>Results of this meta-analysis strongly support pulmonary rehabilitation, including at least four weeks of exercise training, as part of the spectrum of treatment for patients with COPD. We found clinically and statistically significant improvements in important domains of health-related quality of life, including dyspnoea, fatigue, emotional function and mastery, in addition to the six-minute walk/distance test - a measure of functional exercise.</P>
<P>Pulmonary rehabilitation has long been underused in patients with COPD (<LINK REF="REF-Brooks-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brooks 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Puhan--2011_x0028_a_x0029_" TYPE="REFERENCE">Puhan 2011(a)</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yohannes--2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yohannes 2004</LINK>). With the support of current international statements or clinical practice guidelines targeting respiratory rehabilitation in COPD (<LINK REF="REF-Bolton-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bolton 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nici--2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nici 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spruit-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spruit 2013</LINK>), we hope that the results of this meta-analysis will encourage the implementation of new programmes.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-02-05 17:05:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Overall, the conclusions of this meta-analysis are in agreement with those of prior meta-analyses published in 1996 and in 2001 (<LINK REF="REF-Lacasse-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lacasse 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lacasse-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lacasse 2001</LINK>). The addition of 34 RCTs since the 2006 update resulted, as expected, in narrowing of the CIs around the common effects of rehabilitation in the outcomes examined. This update continues to support the strong argument that PR is beneficial in improving HRQoL. It also reiterates the view presented in the 2006 update that additional RCTs comparing PR and conventional care in COPD are no longer warranted. However findings of the subgroup analysis undertaken as part of this update do stimulate new questions in relation to PR. The subgroup analysis finding that identified a difference in treatment effect between hospital-based programmes and community-based programmes suggests that further research should be undertaken to compare these two approaches. Similarly, the fact that the subgroup analysis identified no differences between basic exercise PR programmes and those that provided more complex interventions suggests the need to examine and identify the most essential components of PR programmes for achieving the best patient outcomes. Other factors that remain uncertain include the degree of supervision, the intensity of the training and how long the treatment effect persists. Recent recommendations provided by current guidelines from the ATS or ACSM that at least three weekly sessions are necessary for a treatment effect raise issues that require consideration beyond this current review. These specific issues demand further elucidation through RCTs and further meta-analysis.</P>

<P>The review authors DC, BMC, KM and DD were involved in the PRINCE study conducted by <LINK REF="STD-Casey-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Casey 2013</LINK>, a cluster-randomised trial that was included in this review. The risk of bias table for this study was therefore completed by two independent review authors, who were not involved in this trial but were experienced in conducting Cochrane systematic reviews. These were the review authors EM and Miriam Brennan, Lecturer at the School of Nursing &amp; Midwifery, NUI Galway.</P>

<P>In this current update, the following changes were made from the previous version.</P>
<UL>
<LI>We made the following changes to the inclusion and exclusion criteria.</LI>
<UL>
<LI>We excluded randomised controlled trials that focused on participants:</LI>
<UL>
<LI>who were ventilated; or</LI>
<LI>who had an acute exacerbation within four weeks before commencement of the intervention</LI>
</UL>
<LI>We excluded interventions for which the physical activity component was considered to not be aerobically demanding (such as respiratory muscle training, breathing exercises, Tai Chi and yoga). The degree of aerobic demand was assessed for each individual intervention by examining the detailed description of the intervention in identified studies. We also excluded programmes of less than four weeks' duration.</LI>
</UL>
<LI>We clarified what was considered usual care.</LI>

<P>
<B>Search strategy used for review versions published up to 2004</B>
</P>
<P>We searched all records in the Cochrane Airways Group Register coded as 'COPD' for original articles published in any language using the following strategy: rehabilitat* or fitness* or exercis* or physical* or train*</P>
<P>In the first version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Lacasse-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lacasse 1996</LINK>), 522 publications were retrieved from the computerised search. The review authors reduced this list to 68 potentially eligible papers (quadratic weighted Kappa 0.53, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.61) that were assessed in detail. From this study list, 47 were excluded as the result of wrong population studies (n = 4), intervention not meeting the definition of rehabilitation (n = 7), control group not receiving conventional community care (n = 29), trials not randomised (n = 7). Both primary review authors agreed to include 17 papers in the meta-analysis (quadratic Kappa 0.89, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.00). Six of the 14 RCTs included in the original meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Lacasse-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lacasse 1996</LINK>) were not uncovered by this literature search. Therefore, a total of 23 randomised controlled trials were included. This represents an addition of nine RCTs to the meta-analysis published in 1996 (<LINK REF="REF-Lacasse-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lacasse 1996</LINK>). We contacted the authors of these trials for any additional information required; response rate was 91% (21/23).</P>
<P>An updated search for the review was undertaken in October 2004, which identified an additional 998 references. These were filtered to a list of 139 references, which were considered in the update of the review. Of these, 93 studies failed to meet the inclusion criteria. The original version of the review as previously indicated had included 23 trials. From the updated search (2004), eight additional RCTs (represented by 17 references) met the inclusion criteria of the review (<LINK REF="STD-Behnke-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Behnke 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boxall-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Boxall 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Casaburi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Casaburi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chlumsky-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Chlumsky 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Finnerty-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Finnerty 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-G_x00fc_ell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Güell 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singh-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xie-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Xie 2003</LINK>). Six papers were awaiting assessment (<LINK REF="REF-Corrado-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corrado 1995</LINK>: published as conference abstract; <LINK REF="REF-Fern_x00e1_ndez-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fernández 1998</LINK>: paper not available; <LINK REF="REF-Shu-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shu 1998</LINK>: published as conference abstract; <LINK REF="REF-Tregonning-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tregonning 2000</LINK>: published as conference abstract; <LINK REF="REF-Ward-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ward 1999</LINK>: published as conference abstract; <LINK REF="REF-Wright-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 2002</LINK>: unclear study methods). One trial was ongoing (<LINK REF="REF-Whiteford-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whiteford 2004</LINK>). As an outcome of the update in 2004, a total of 31 RCTs (represented by 65 references) contributed to the meta-analysis.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Sequence generation (possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>A detailed description of the methods used to generate the allocation sequence was developed for each study to facilitate an assessment of whether it should produce comparable groups.</P>
<P>Risk of bias for sequence generation was graded based on the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</LI>
<LI>high risk (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number); or</LI>
<LI>unclear risk.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Allocation concealment (possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>A description of the methods used to conceal the allocation sequence for each study was presented, and this determined whether the intervention allocation might have been anticipated in advance of, or during, recruitment, or changed after assignment.</P>
<P>Risk of bias associated with allocation concealment was graded as follows:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);</LI>
<LI>high risk (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth); or</LI>
<LI>unclear risk.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Blinding of participants and personnel (possible performance bias)</HEADING>
<P>The nature of the interventions involved in pulmonary rehabilitation would make it highly unlikely or impossible to blind participants or personnel delivering the interventions.</P>
<P>However, it would be possible to blind outcome assessors. Therefore, we assessed the risk of bias for blinding of outcome assessors as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>high risk;</LI>
<LI>low risk; or</LI>
<LI>unclear risk.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Blinding of outcome assessment (checking for possible detection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study the methods used, if any, to blind outcome assessors from knowledge </P>
<P>of which intervention participants received. We will assess the risk of bias for blinding of outcome assessment as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk;</LI>
<LI>high risk; or</LI>
<LI>unclear risk.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Incomplete outcome data (possible attrition bias associated with withdrawals, drop-outs, deviations from original protocol)</HEADING>
<P>A description of completeness of data for each outcome at all stages of the study was presented. This included examining attrition and exclusions from the analysis. Each study was examined to identify whether attrition and exclusions were reported (comparing the numbers presented at each stage with the total number of randomised participants). The studies were also examined for rationale and justifications explaining any attrition or exclusions. In instances where enough information could be identified or was obtained from the trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses. We assessed the risk of bias for completeness of data as follows:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk (20% or less missing data);</LI>
<LI>high risk (more than 20% missing data); or</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Selective reporting bias</HEADING>
<P>Studies were examined for selective outcome reporting bias by cross-checking that all outcomes identified in the methods section of the results publication were reported in the results section of the trial publication(s).</P>
<P>The risk of bias for selective reporting was graded as follows:</P>
<UL>
<LI>high risk (where not all of the study&#8217;s prespecified outcomes had been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not prespecified; outcomes of interest were reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study failed to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</LI>
<LI>low risk (where it was clear that all of the study&#8217;s prespecified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported); or</LI>
<LI>unclear risk.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Other sources of bias (bias due to problems not covered by the items above)</HEADING>
<P>If the review authors believed that any other possible sources of bias were matters of concern, these were recorded.</P>
<P>The level at which studies were seen to be free of other problems that could put them at risk of bias was graded as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk;</LI>
<LI>high risk; or</LI>
<LI>unclear risk.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Overall risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>An overall judgement was made in relation to whether studies were at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) and identified above. The magnitude of the overall bias, along with the degree to which the bias was likely to have impacted the findings, was assessed for each study using the following grades:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk;</LI>
<LI>high risk; or</LI>
<LI>unclear risk.</LI>
