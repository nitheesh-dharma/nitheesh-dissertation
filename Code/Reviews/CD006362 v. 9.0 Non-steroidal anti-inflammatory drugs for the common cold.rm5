<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-09-16 08:29:03 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz  Dooley">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
<BR/>We carried out a review on the effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for treating pain or respiratory symptoms such as cough associated with the common cold.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
<BR/>The common cold is the most common and widespread illness known to humans. NSAIDs, for example, aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen, have analgesic (pain-reducing) and antipyretic (fever-reducing) effects. NSAIDs have been widely used for over a century for the treatment of pain and fever associated with the common cold.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
<BR/>The evidence is current to April 2015. This review found nine studies (1069 participants of both genders, including children, adults and older people from the USA, Japan, Belgium and Denmark) that compared various NSAIDs either with each other or with an inactive substance that has no treatment value (placebo).</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
<BR/>Our findings suggest that NSAIDs may improve most analgesia-related symptoms caused by the common cold (headache, ear pain, and muscle and joint pain), but there is no clear evidence that NSAIDs are effective in improving coughs and runny noses caused by the common cold. Some of the included trials reported gastrointestinal complaints, rash and oedema (fluid retention) in the NSAIDs group.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
<BR/>The quality of the evidence may be estimated as 'moderate' because of imprecision. The major limitations of this review are that the results of the studies are quite diverse and the number of studies for each outcome is quite small.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusion</B>
<BR/>NSAIDs are somewhat effective in relieving the discomfort caused by a cold but there is no clear evidence of their effect in easing respiratory symptoms. The balance of benefit and harms needs to be considered when using NSAIDs for colds.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-09-10 19:12:50 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Four review authors extracted data. We subdivided trials into placebo-controlled RCTs and head-to-head comparisons of NSAIDs. We extracted and summarised data on global analgesic effects (such as reduction of headache and myalgia), non-analgesic effects (such as reduction of nasal symptoms, cough, sputum and sneezing) and side effects. We expressed dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and continuous data as mean differences (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMD). We pooled data using the fixed-effect and random-effects models.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-09-11 08:14:52 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz  Dooley">
<P>We included nine RCTs with 1069 participants, describing 37 comparisons: six were NSAIDs versus placebo and three were NSAIDs versus NSAIDs. The overall risk of bias in the included studies was mixed. In a pooled analysis, NSAIDs did not significantly reduce the total symptom score (SMD -0.40, 95% CI -1.03 to 0.24, three studies, random-effects model), or duration of colds (MD -0.23, 95% CI -1.75 to 1.29, two studies, random-effects model). For respiratory symptoms, cough did not improve (SMD -0.05, 95% CI -0.66 to 0.56, two studies, random-effects model) but the sneezing score significantly improved (SMD -0.44, 95% CI -0.75 to -0.12, two studies, random-effects model). For outcomes related to the analgesic effects of NSAIDs (headache, ear pain, and muscle and joint pain) the treatment produced significant benefits. The risk of adverse effects was not high with NSAIDs (RR 2.94, 95% CI 0.51 to 17.03, two studies, random-effects model) but it is difficult to conclude that such drugs are no different from placebo. The quality of the evidence may be estimated as 'moderate' because of imprecision. The major limitations of this review are that the results of the studies are quite diverse and the number of studies for one result is quite small.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-05-17 20:10:28 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The common cold is an acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) and is the most common and widespread illness known to humans, affecting all age groups. Young children suffer an average of six to eight colds a year, while adults experience approximately two to four colds a year. Although the common cold is usually mild, with symptoms lasting one to two weeks, it is a leading cause of medical visits and days missed from school and work (<LINK REF="REF-Heikkinen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heikkinen 2003</LINK>). Nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea, sneezing and coughing accompanied by general malaise are typical symptoms of the common cold. Over 200 serologically different viral types are responsible for common colds, with the rhinovirus being the most common cause (<LINK REF="REF-Eccles-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eccles 2005</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-07-23 17:23:56 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite ongoing research into antiviral drugs, there are no effective therapies for the prevention or treatment of the common cold. Therefore, treatment of colds is normally aimed at relieving the symptoms of the illness. Several classes of drugs are currently available, including decongestants, anticholinergics, antihistamines and antitussives. These are effective, to a greater or lesser extent, in treating symptoms of the common cold (<LINK REF="REF-AlBalawi-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">AlBalawi 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-De-Sutter-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Sutter 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Li-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ostberg-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ostberg 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saraswat-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saraswat 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2014</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-06-22 17:11:24 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>NSAIDs have been widely used for over a century for the treatment of pain and fever associated with the common cold. Despite their widespread present day use and the long medical history of the use of NSAIDs in relieving pain associated with the common cold, there is a lack of clinical data to support the efficacy of NSAIDs treating this condition. There is some evidence that cold symptoms might be the result of inflammatory mediators such as kinins and prostaglandins, which can be blocked by NSAIDs, rather than the result of the direct cytopathic effects of viruses (<LINK REF="REF-Eccles-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eccles 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gwaltney-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gwaltney 2002</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-08-31 09:21:01 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>Several studies have proposed that NSAIDs could be effective in alleviating common cold symptoms, including sneezing and coughing (<LINK REF="STD-Sperber-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Sperber 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sperber-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sperber 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winther-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Winther 2001</LINK>). However, no consensus has been reached on this issue. This systematic review is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2009 (<LINK REF="REF-Kim-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 2009</LINK>).</P>

<P>In the previous searches, we identified 60 trials; of these, nine met the inclusion criteria. In this 2015 updated search, we did not identify any potential new trials. All included studies were double-blinded RCTs. Four of the six trials of community-acquired colds were multicentre trials.</P>

<P>The nine included studies involved 1069 participants suffering from colds. In six studies, 891 participants had community-acquired colds, and in three studies, 178 participants were experimentally infected with cold viruses. For experimentally infected colds, inoculated populations were analysed. Only 72.5% of experimentally infected participants had cold symptoms. Therefore, we included non-symptomatic infected participants in this analysis.</P>
<P>Three studies were performed in the USA, four in Japan, and one each in Belgium and Denmark. Trials took place in a total of 154 settings. Most were participants from hospitals, clinics and outpatient departments. One trial involved medical students and university staff. Three trials of experimentally infected colds did not report the trial setting. One trial involved mainly students and two trials reported participants only as volunteers.</P>
<P>Five trials compared NSAIDs with a placebo, three trials compared one NSAID with another, and one trial compared two NSAIDs with a placebo.</P>
<P>Five studies used ibuprofen, two used aspirin and two studies used loxoprofen. Ketoprofen, fenoprofen, fentiazac and naproxen were used in one study. Seven trials used visually identical capsules, one trial used a double-dummy method and one trial used coded vials. The duration of treatment varied from a single dose to two daily doses for seven days.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2015-09-16 08:29:53 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz  Dooley">
<P>In summary, if non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are administered to community-infected or experimentally infected cold patients, their analgesic effect against pain and irritation induced by the cold is relatively effective, but reports on whether they are helpful in relieving respiratory symptoms, such as coughing and sneezing, are not consistent and the evidence is insufficient.</P>
<P>Despite a comprehensive search, only nine studies met the inclusion criteria, six of which were placebo-controlled randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and three of which were head-to-head RCTs. When we evaluated the methodological quality of the included studies using The Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>), the overall quality of studies was mixed, largely due to missing information regarding randomisation procedures. We assessed two studies as being of high quality (<LINK REF="STD-Goto-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Goto 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ryan-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Ryan 1987</LINK>). Our outcomes were mainly subjective and blinding of participants may be critical. All nine studies were described as 'double-blind' and considered 'adequate'.</P>
<P>Among the results used to examine the effect of NSAIDs on the common cold, the ones looking at the analgesic effect evaluated headache, throat irritation, muscle and joint pain, ear pain, malaise and chills. Among them, headache, ear pain and muscle and joint pain showed significant results and malaise showed borderline significance. However, throat irritation was not improved, and chills showed mixed results. For some cases where symptoms did not improve, the reasons were uncertain. Whether the cold was community-acquired or experimentally infected, the trial quality and dose of NSAIDs could not explain the differences. In the case of throat irritation, if the cold was an infection with a rhinovirus, there was the possibility that the treatment was not effective because throat pain disappeared naturally over a short period of time (<LINK REF="REF-Heikkinen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heikkinen 2003</LINK>). There is also the possibility that the mechanism of throat pain may be different from that of headache and muscle pain. In the case of chills, NSAIDs were obviously effective in one trial, but worsened the symptoms in the other trial. Chills are known to happen mainly when the fever has lowered, therefore the measure of improvement may be different from the other symptoms and depend on whether there was a fever before the administration of treatment or not. However, because there was no information on the body temperature before starting the treatment in the two trials, we cannot draw a conclusion on this matter. Apart from these two symptoms, NSAIDs improved most of the analgesia-related symptoms caused by a cold. Therefore, we recommend the use of NSAIDs for these symptoms.</P>
<P>Three trials studied whether NSAIDs had a comprehensive effect on various symptoms caused by the common cold (<LINK REF="STD-Goto-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Goto 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sperber-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Sperber 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sperber-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sperber 1992</LINK>). Two of them were conducted with participants whose cold was experimentally infected by a rhinovirus (<LINK REF="STD-Sperber-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Sperber 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sperber-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sperber 1992</LINK>). One of those showed a statistically significant difference in the effect of NSAIDs (<LINK REF="STD-Sperber-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sperber 1992</LINK>), and when we merged the results of the two studies the results were significant. However, one recently published trial reported that the total symptom score showed no significant difference between the two groups (<LINK REF="STD-Goto-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Goto 2007</LINK>). The results of the pooled analysis were not significant and there was heterogeneity, but the reason for this was unclear.</P>
<P>Among the studies two trials examined whether NSAIDs reduced the duration of a cold (<LINK REF="STD-Goto-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Goto 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sperber-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Sperber 1989</LINK>). The results of the pooled analysis were not significant and there was heterogeneity. NSAIDs did not have any effect on the severity or duration of a cold. There were only two trials and the number of participants in the studies was small, therefore it is hard to draw a definite conclusion about the effects of NSAIDs on the duration of a cold.</P>
<P>One of the current issues related to the administration of NSAIDs for the common cold is whether NSAIDs are helpful in relieving respiratory symptoms such as cough. Many of the studies on the common cold recommend the administration of NSAIDs to ease coughing caused by a cold (<LINK REF="REF-Heikkinen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heikkinen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Irwin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irwin 2000</LINK>). The recently published American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines recommend the combined administration of first-generation antihistamine and nasal decongestant or the administration of naproxen for cough caused by a cold (<LINK REF="REF-Pratter-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pratter 2006</LINK>). Respiratory symptoms examined in this review were cough, nasal discharge and sneezing. The medication was not effective for cough in two trials and pooled results did not show a significant improvement (<LINK REF="STD-Sperber-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sperber 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winther-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Winther 2001</LINK>). None of the three trials showed a significant result for nasal discharge, and pooled results were not significant (<LINK REF="STD-Sperber-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Sperber 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sperber-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sperber 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winther-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Winther 2001</LINK>). However, in the case of sneezing, one trial showed a significant improvement and pooled results showed a moderate effect (<LINK REF="STD-Winther-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Winther 2001</LINK>). Considering these results, which differ from existing guidelines, there is no clear evidence that NSAIDs are effective for coughs caused by a cold, or should be recommended in order to ease cough caused by a cold.</P>
<P>NSAIDs draw attention due to their adverse effects. For some NSAIDs, their long-term use increases the risk of cardiovascular disease (<LINK REF="REF-Matchaba-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matchaba 2004</LINK>) and may cause gastrointestinal side effects (<LINK REF="REF-Ofman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ofman 2002</LINK>). The frequency of gastrointestinal side effects increases in proportion to the dose and period of NSAID medication but the risk of gastrointestinal side effects cannot be excluded with short-term use (<LINK REF="REF-Hern_x00e1_ndez_x002d_D_x00ed_az-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hernández-Díaz 2000</LINK>). In trials included in this review, the risk of side effects was not high but it is difficult to conclude that they are no different from placebo in terms of side effects.<BR/>
</P>
<P>In this review, three trials studied which specific NSAIDs were more effective in treating a cold (<LINK REF="STD-Itoh-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Itoh 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Katsu-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Katsu 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nagaoka-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Nagaoka 1980</LINK>). One study found that fentiazac was more effective than ibuprofen (<LINK REF="STD-Nagaoka-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Nagaoka 1980</LINK>). However, this is probably because the dose of ibuprofen used in the trial was 600 mg/day, lower than that used in other trials.</P>
<P>The absence of epithelial destruction during rhinovirus infections has led to the idea that the clinical symptoms of the common cold may not be caused by a direct cytopathic effect of the viruses but instead are primarily caused by the inflammatory response of the host by media such as kinins, leukotrienes and histamines (<LINK REF="REF-Heikkinen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heikkinen 2003</LINK>). Accordingly, NSAIDs are believed to ease not only fever and irritation but also respiratory symptoms such as coughing. However, this was not proven in the review. Further research is needed to examine their effects.</P>
<P>For analgesic effects on a cold, acetaminophen was also frequently used along with NSAIDs. However, in this review we did not examine which of the medications was superior in terms of effect and safety. Further research is needed to evaluate this.</P>
<P>Major limitations of this review are that the results of the research are quite diverse and the number of studies for each outcome is quite small. For this reason, it is somewhat difficult to draw clear conclusions.</P>
<P>In conclusion, NSAIDs are recommended for relieving irritation or pain caused by a cold but the notion that NSAIDs are effective in relieving respiratory symptoms such as cough and nasal discharge needs more solid evidence.</P>

<P>We are unable to support the theory that NSAIDs are effective in reducing cough, based upon the data included in this review. A large trial to study the effect of NSAIDs on colds may make this relationship clearer. For analgesic effects on the common cold, acetaminophen is also frequently used along with NSAIDs. However, in this review we did not examine which of these treatments was superior in terms of effect or safety. For this evaluation, we consider another review necessary.</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY MODIFIED="2011-06-25 15:27:05 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In their Cochrane Review on non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for the common cold, Kim et al. (1) "recommend NSAIDs for relieving discomfort or pain caused by the common cold&#8221; without any reservations. However, the common cold is a rather harmless condition, whereas NSAIDs can have serious and even lethal adverse effects (2-4). The review also has methodological shortcomings.</P>
<P>One problem is the excessive number of outcomes; the review authors report on no less than 26 primary outcomes. Four of these, sneezing, headache, pain in muscles/joints and earache, were statistically significant, but the first 3 outcomes were based on only 2 trials, including 159 participants, and the last outcome on only 1 trial.</P>
<P>One of these 2 trials was an experimental study (5) of 87 healthy volunteers that were inoculated with rhinovirus. The trial had unclear sequence generation, unclear concealment of allocation and was not analysed using intention to treat, as 8 people were excluded from the analysis. The volunteers were treated with very high doses of naproxen, up to 1500 mg daily, which is higher than what has been approved for treatment of acute pain conditions (6), and as the risk of harms increases linearly with the dose (7),  this is particularly problematic. This trial is also included in the analysis for global effects where it had the largest effect of the 3 included trials and contributed to substantial heterogeneity, which suggests bias or problems with generalisability. Further, as it can be problematic to generalise findings from experimental settings to patients (8), it is questionable to pool this trial with trials from clinical settings.</P>
<P>The second trial (9) included 80 patients with natural colds that received 1200 mg ibuprofen daily. This trial also had unclear sequence generation and unclear allocation concealment. Additionally, for analysis 2.9 and 2.10 of Chilliness score, the authors have erroneously extracted the results from the placebo arm of this trial as though they belonged to another trial (5) and vice versa. This raises the question whether there were other data extraction errors. Data extraction errors are frequent in meta-analyses using SMD (10).</P>
<P>Adverse effects are not mentioned in the Discussion and only briefly in Results. According to the authors, 5 trials assessed adverse effects but they only reported data from 4 trials. The omitted trial (9) reported adverse effects (e.g. pain in abdomen, ear buzzing) as continuous outcomes, and not as binary (5). While it is reasonable not to pool trials with binary and continuous outcomes, we are puzzled as to why the authors omitted reporting any adverse effects data from this trial in their Cochrane Review. We wonder whether adverse effects from other trials were similarly ignored.</P>
<P>The 4 trials where the review authors reported adverse effects assessed 9 outcomes and for all outcomes, the confidence intervals were wide (e.g. for overall adverse effects, RR 2.94 [0.51, 17.03]). Based on this uncertainty, adverse effects of NSAIDs cannot be dismissed and it is therefore surprising that the authors did not refer to additional evidence, as recommended in <I>The Cochrane Handbook</I> (11). NSAIDs are known to cause serious harms (2-4).</P>
<P>Additionally, in Methods the authors state &#8220;We assessed heterogeneity amongst trials by using the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test for heterogeneity with a 10% level of statistical significance and I<SUP>2</SUP> test.&#8221; In their protocol the I<SUP>2 </SUP>is not mentioned at all. While there was substantial heterogeneity for overall side effects (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 58%) the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test for heterogeneity was not statistically significant (P = 0.12). So, based on their own criteria the authors should have analysed the data using a fixed-effect model, which would have shown a significant increase in overall side effects, relative risk 2.88 [1.11, 7.45] (P = 0.03).</P>
<P>Additionally, there are some discrepancies between what was reported in the protocol and what was done in the review. Kim et al. originally stated in their protocol (1) that they would search databases for unpublished trials, contact authors for missing data and examine publication bias, but apparently did not do any of this. The identified trials were all very small. It is therefore likely that the identified sample of published trials is biased (12), as small trials with non-statistical findings are often not published.</P>
<P>In their abstract, the authors recommend NSAIDs for &#8220;reliving discomfort or pain&#8221;. This statement is highly misleading, as it indicates that NSAIDs have other clinical effects than their analgesic effect. The authors do not use the word &#8220;discomfort&#8221; anywhere else in the review, but we assume it refers to either global outcomes or non-analgesic outcomes. However, the authors found no effect on global outcomes and the effect on &#8220;sneezing&#8221; is likely spurious, as it occurred for only one out of 13 non-analgesic outcomes, and was based on the 2 problematic trials already described.</P>
<P>Based on these methodological problems, and the serious adverse effects of the drugs, we believe there is no sound basis for recommending NSAIDs for the common cold and urge the authors to present a more balanced view.</P>

</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2013-05-17 20:04:24 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Thank you for your feedback.<BR/>I think that the comments fall into four main areas.</P>
<P>1. Adverse effects.<BR/>2. Discrepancy between the protocol and review.<BR/>3. The methodological issues of weak studies, and multiple outcomes.<BR/>4. The heterogeneity tests used, and the choice of random-effects or fixed-effect model.</P>
<P>We will discuss the feedback according to the four main areas.</P>
<P>
<B>1. Adverse effect issues</B>
<BR/>Safety-related issues of NSAIDs, in particular, the issues of cardiovascular disease and gastrointestinal disease have been reviewed in many studies but no clear conclusion has been drawn on what problems there can be in short-term uses such as the use for a common cold. Of course, the risk of gastrointestinal side effects may increase even in short-term usage.<BR/>We agree with the commentators that there have not been many safety-related discussions in the review and the power is not high enough to conclude on the safety of NSAIDs based on trials in this review. We also agree that review of other systematic reviews related to safety issues is necessary.<BR/>As for the trial on which the commentators stated that it omitted safety-related results, the trial author mentioned that there was no abnormal adverse events in the trial and the outcomes mentioned by the commentators classified it as effectiveness outcomes.</P>
<P>
<B>2. Discrepancy between the protocol and review - search of unpublished trials and publication bias</B>
<BR/>In the methods, we did make some efforts to search for unpublished trials.<BR/>&#8220;We searched reference lists of review articles and of all included studies to find other potentially eligible studies. We contacted authors of the included trials to request unpublished studies&#8221;. However, we did not find any additional trials.</P>
<P>We did examine publication bias by funnel plot analysis. We omitted them because there were too many funnel plots in our review.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>3. The methodological issues of weak studies, and multiple (26) outcomes</B>
<BR/>As mentioned by the commentators, the number of results may be too large. This problem is mainly because outcomes of trials and duration or dose of therapy were quite diverse, so it was inevitable (in this sense).<BR/>The effect of NSAIDs may not be different according to whether a cold is induced experimentally or happens naturally.<BR/>A calculation error that the commentators pointed out was corrected.<BR/>We added the following to the Discussion:<BR/>&#8220;Major limitations of this review is that the results of the research are quite diverse and the number of studies for one result is quite small. For this reason, it is somewhat difficult to draw clear conclusions."</P>
<P>
<B>4. The heterogeneity tests used, and the choice of random-effects or fixed-effect model</B>
<BR/>The reason for changing the protocol and review methodology in connection to heterogeneity is because <I>The</I> <I>Cochrane Handbook</I> was upgraded from 4.2 to 5.0 during the review and the 5.0 version recommends the use of I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic and so we added it. In the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test, some heterogeneity was observed as I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic = 58%, although not statistically significant, so in the actual analysis we presented both the fixed-effect model and the random-effects model.<BR/>For the above reason, we are going to add new text to the Results, Discussion and Conclusions sections.</P>
<P>Results<BR/>Two trials assessed the overall side effects of NSAIDs, and there was moderate heterogeneity. The results of a pooled analysis for overall side effects was significant in the fixed-effect model (risk ratio (RR) 2.88 (95% CI 1.11 to 7.45), (P = 0.03), but not in random-effects model (RR 2.94, 95% CI 0.51 to 17.03).<BR/>Three trials reported gastrointestinal adverse effects and found no differences between the groups.<BR/>Lethargy/drowsiness, feeling hyperactive, feeling more awake, flushed face, difficulty sleeping, light-headedness and dry mouth were reported in one to two trials and the results were not significantly different between the treatment groups.</P>
<P>Discussion<BR/>NSAIDs are drawing attention for their side effects. For some NSAIDs, their long-term use increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and may cause gastrointestinal side effects. The frequency of gastrointestinal side effects increases in proportion to the dose and period of medication with NSAIDs but the risk of gastrointestinal side effects cannot be excluded in short-term use. In trials included in this review, the risk of side effects was not evidently high; it is hard to conclude that they are not different from placebo in terms of side effects.</P>
<P>Conclusion<BR/>NSAIDs are somewhat effective in relieving discomfort caused by a cold, but there is no clear evidence of their effect in easing respiratory symptoms. The use of NSAIDs for a cold should be decided in consideration of side effects.<BR/>
