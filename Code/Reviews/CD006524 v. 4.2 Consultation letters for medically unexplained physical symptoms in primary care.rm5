<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-11-10 11:48:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In 10% to 35% of all consultations in primary care, no organic cause can be found for the physical symptoms of the patient. Patients may present with symptoms such as fatigue, headaches, dizziness, non-specific low back pain and chest pain. Such symptoms can lead to frequent consultations with the physician and high medical costs as well as causing considerable worry and disability for the patient. Patients suffering from MUPS are more likely than the average patient to experience depressive and anxiety disorders. Studies have reported positive effects of screening by a psychiatrist in the treatment of MUPS in primary care. After screening, the psychiatrist sends the primary care physician a 'consultation letter' (CL) which states the diagnosis and that patients are best helped by: 1) having their symptoms taken seriously; 2) not being told their symptoms are 'all in your head'; 3) not being referred for further investigation unless there is a clear indication of a somatic disorder; 4) undergoing a physical examination at each visit; and 5) being seen at regular intervals.</P>
<P>In our review we found six studies, with a total of 449 patients, in which one of two interventions were applied. One intervention (four studies, 267 patients) was a CL following a consultation between the patient and the psychiatrist; the other (two studies, 182 patients) was a CL following a joint consultation between patient, psychiatrist and primary care physician. In each case comparison was against care as usual, provided by the primary care physician. The first intervention resulted in reduced medical costs (three studies) and improved physical functioning (three studies). We found evidence for a slight reduction in the severity of the MUPS, reduced medical consumption and improved social functioning following the second intervention, although in only one of two studies assessed. There are serious limitations in generalizability of the results to modern healthcare: most trials reported doctor-related outcomes with patient-related outcomes varying in results; the intervention appears to be far more effective for the most serious but rare disorders, and less so in the more common forms of MUPS; five of the six studies were performed in the United States and four studies before 1995. Furthermore the studied populations were small and five of the six studies were of moderate quality.</P>
<P>Our final conclusion is that CLs may be helpful for physicians who treat patients with MUPS (based on the provider-related outcomes). However, until further studies are conducted to find out if the intervention results in improved patient-related outcomes, the overall effectiveness of CLs cannot be demonstrated.</P>

<P>We included six RCTs, with a total of 449 patients.

<P>There is limited evidence that a CL is effective in terms of medical costs and improvement of physical functioning for patients with MUPS in primary care. The results are even less pronounced in patients with clinically less severe, but more meaningful, forms of MUPS and the results vary for other patient-related outcomes. All studies, except one, were performed in the United States and therefore the results can not be generalized directly to countries with other healthcare systems. Furthermore all studies were small and of only moderate quality. There is very limited evidence that a joint consultation with the patient by a psychiatrist in the presence of the physician, together with the provision of a CL, reduces severity of somatization symptoms and medical consumption.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-11-08 16:39:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In general practice, 10% to 35% of all consultations (<LINK REF="REF-Bridges-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bridges 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Escobar-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Escobar 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-De-Waal-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Waal 2004</LINK>) concern patients with medically unexplained symptoms. These patients present with physical symptoms such as fatigue, non-specific headache and non-cardiac chest pain (NCCP), for which no organic cause can be found. These symptoms are commonly described as medically unexplained physical symptoms (MUPS) (<LINK REF="REF-Burton-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burton 2003</LINK>). If the patient attributes the symptoms to an organic cause and seeks medical help, this process is described as 'somatization'; however, MUPS is a more objective term, which is more frequently used in recent scientific literature and is more in accordance with use in primary care (<LINK REF="REF-Burton-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burton 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is a continuum from incidental and short-lasting MUPS, to persisting and recurrent MUPS, to a life-long history with at least 13 MUPS, which is categorized as somatization disorder according to DSM IV (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK>). Somatization disorder is one of the most serious and rare somatoform disorders, which is an important group of disorders in DSM IV. Other examples of somatoform disorders are conversion, body dismorphic disorder and hypochondriasis, but these disorders are outside the scope of this review. In the continuum of severity of MUPS referred to above, the forms with more symptoms and longer lasting symptoms are associated with higher levels of disability and psychiatric comorbidity (e.g. depression and anxiety), decline in subjective health, increased healthcare utilization and a corresponding increase in costs (<LINK REF="REF-Bridges-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bridges 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Escobar-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Escobar 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Craig-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Craig 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Escobar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Escobar 1998</LINK>). There are several somatoform diagnostic subgroups which are used in many studies, especially abridged somatization disorder (ASD) and multisomatoform disorder (MSD). These are subthreshold forms of somatization disorder. For the diagnosis of ASD a lifetime history of four (men) to six (women) MUPS according to DSM criteria is needed<I> </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Escobar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Escobar 1998</LINK>)<I>, </I>while for the diagnosis of MSD a patient needs to be affected by three current MUPS, along with a history of MUPS of at least two years (<LINK REF="REF-Kroenke-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kroenke 1997</LINK>).<I> </I>The prevalence rates of somatization disorder, ASD and MSD differ widely with percentages of 1% to 4%, 20% and 8% in general practice populations<B>
<I> </I>
</B>
<I>(</I>
<LINK REF="REF-Gureje-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gureje 1997</LINK>). Because of their high prevalence, ASD and MSD are clinically most meaningful to primary care. As severity, count of symptoms and prevalence rates vary so widely, there should be caution in comparing, especially somatization disorder with ASD and MSD. Of the patients with five or more current MUPS, 50% meet the criteria for another psychiatric disorder (e.g. depression or anxiety) and 63% report psychological symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Simon-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simon 1991</LINK>). In 50% of cases, this psychiatric comorbidity is not recognized by the primary care physician (<LINK REF="REF-Bridges-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bridges 1985</LINK>). Primary care physicians describe patients with MUPS as difficult and time-consuming (<LINK REF="REF-Schilte-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schilte 2000</LINK>) and MUPS are also associated with a more difficult doctor-patient relationship, because the doctor and the patient hold different opinions about the causes and treatment of MUPS (<LINK REF="REF-Hahn-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hahn 2001</LINK>). Therefore, there is a need to improve adequate diagnosis and treatment of patients with MUPS. Since MUPS are associated with great reduction in subjective health and increased healthcare utilization, many studies have one or both types of these outcomes as a primary outcome.</P>
<P>MUPS are also common in the occupational health setting. In many countries occupational health care is part of, or related to, primary care with regard to the counselling of employees who are on sick leave. MUPS are responsible for a considerable amount of long-term sick leave, due to disorders such as chronic fatigue syndrome, NCCP and fibromyalgia. These disorders are associated with delayed recovery, prolonged sick leave and disabilities (<LINK REF="REF-Eriksen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eriksen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Furze-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furze 2001</LINK>). In most of these disorders the medical condition alone does not explain the severity of the disabilities and the duration of the sick leave (<LINK REF="REF-Peski-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peski 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Norrm_x00e9_n-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norrmén 2008</LINK>). Sickness absence, in general, is associated with reduced well-being, a heavy socio-economic burden, and high costs (<LINK REF="REF-Marmot-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marmot 1995</LINK>). A correlation with dysfunctional health beliefs has been demonstrated, and interventions focusing on these beliefs are effective in hastening return to work (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Tulder-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Tulder 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Petrie-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petrie 2002</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-11-08 16:45:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Primary care physicians need effective therapeutic strategies for the treatment of MUPS (<LINK REF="REF-Kerwick-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kerwick 1997</LINK>). Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) provided by a psychologist has been shown to be effective (<LINK REF="REF-Kroenke-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kroenke 2000</LINK>), but patients with MUPS often refuse psychological or psychiatric referral for treatment. A Cochrane review showed limited evidence of effectiveness for cognitive interventions provided by general practitioners for patients with MUPS (<LINK REF="REF-Huibers-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huibers 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>An alternative intervention is the consultation letter (CL). This was used for the first time in a standardized way by Smith (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-1986a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1986a</LINK>), and later by other investigators (<LINK REF="REF-Rost-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rost 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dickinson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dickinson 2003</LINK>). In these studies, primary care patients were screened for multiple and recurrent MUPS by means of validated questionnaires and a structured psychiatric interview carried out by a research psychiatrist. If the diagnosis of multiple and recurrent MUPS (in a severe or less severe form, depending on the study criteria for the investigation) was confirmed, a standardized detailed CL was sent to the patient's primary care physician. Although the CL is sent to the primary care physician, it is often referred to in studies as a patient consultation letter, and this may be confusing, because the letter is not usually sent to the patient. Sometimes the letter is referred to as a 'care recommendation letter' (<LINK REF="STD-Dickinson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dickinson 2003</LINK>a), but in this review we will refer to them as CLs.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-11-08 17:00:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The chronic relapsing course of the disorder and its low mortality and somatic morbidity rates are described within the CL. It also contains detailed recommendations concerning management, i.e. to avoid diagnostic procedures and hospitalization, to see these patients at regular intervals and to perform a physical examination at each visit. There are three components that may contribute to the effect of the intervention and that can explain how the intervention might work: confirmation of the diagnosis of persistent MUPS, management rules for communication and management rules for case management. Which component is the most effective, or if there is a synergetic effect is not known. In several studies (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-1986a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1986a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rost-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rost 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dickinson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dickinson 2003</LINK>), this CL intervention has resulted in improved health outcomes. It is assumed that labelling symptoms as MUPS reduces the clinical uncertainty of the primary care physician and prevents potentially harmful invasive examinations and (somatic) referrals (<LINK REF="STD-Dickinson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dickinson 2003</LINK>). CLs might be an efficient method, in terms of time-saving and cost-effectiveness, for use in primary care to improve the health and well-being of patients with MUPS.</P>
<P>The intervention, based on the combination of screening and a CL, can be placed in the model of collaborative care, where the primary care patient is seen by a psychiatrist. The consultation is patient-centred. The primary care physician remains the responsible care-giver, but receives advice about diagnosis and treatment from the psychiatrist. This model has been reported to have favourable effects on the treatment provided by the primary care physician and on improving outcomes in patients with depression (<LINK REF="REF-Von-Korff-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Von Korff 1995</LINK>). Collaborative care is recommended for complicated and persistent MUPS according to the review of Henningsen (<LINK REF="REF-Henningsen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henningsen 2007</LINK>), although the effects have yet to be evaluated. This intervention might overcome the reluctance of patients to psychiatric referral. This is because it has the advantage that the patient is only referred for one consultation for advice on diagnosis and treatment. There is no treatment by the psychiatrist, and the primary care physician continues as the treating physician.<B>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2010-11-08 17:02:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A systematic review with regard to the intervention with patient CLs is required to assist and improve the management of patients with MUPS in primary care. Such a review has yet not been performed. Earlier systematic reviews were focused on the treatment by a psychologist, multidisciplinary treatment or pharmacological treatment and on patients with specific somatoform disorders (e.g. somatisation disorder, hypochondriasis) and certain functional disorders (e.g. chronic fatigue disorder, fibromyalgia). Furthermore, the studies included in these reviews were often centred on patients in secondary or tertiary care, limiting the generalizability to use in primary care.</P>

<P>Unexplained physical symptoms were assessed with validated questionnaires, such as the SCL-90 somatization subscale (<LINK REF="REF-Derogatis-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derogatis 1977</LINK>), or schedules used in a psychiatric interview, e.g. the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS), which is based on the symptoms listed in the DSM-III-R (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1987</LINK>), DSM-IV (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK>) or DSM-IV-TR (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2000</LINK>).</P>

<P>The intervention must consist of a CL written by a psychiatrist and sent to a primary care physician (general practitioner or occupational health physician), concerning a patient with MUPS, in a physical one-to-one setting (between patient and physician) after screening with validated questionnaires and/or structured interviews carried out by a research assistant or a psychiatrist. The key components of the CL should be:</P>
<OL>
<LI>an explanation of MUPS and somatization, a description of its low mortality rate;</LI>
<LI>recommendations for the care of the patient;</LI>
<LI>recommendations for the communication with the patient.</LI>
</OL>
<P>At the very least the CL should include diagnosis (1) and either recommendations for the care of or communication with the patient (2 or 3). The CL could be a standard letter for patients with MUPS, or a patient-related document with recommendations with regard to the diagnosis of MUPS and specific recommendations within the context of this specific patient.</P>
<P>The advice of the psychiatrist had to be applied in a primary care setting by the primary care physician. This advice could be given in several ways, but it had at least to be written advice which was sent to the primary care physician. The advice could also be a combination of written advice and oral advice, or written advice and advice by telephone from the psychiatrist after the consultation.</P>
<P>We excluded studies if:</P>
<OL>
<LI>the treatment was not provided by the primary care physician in a face-to-face setting (e.g. group setting, by telephone, guided self-help intervention, Internet programme);</LI>
<LI>the treatment was provided by other disciplines (nurse, psychologist) in primary care and the results were not presented to every discipline (in such cases the role of the primary care physician was not clear);</LI>
<LI>there was no consultation setting with the primary care physician being the treating physician, e.g. the psychiatrist performed part or most of the treatment;</LI>
<LI>the patient was not seen by the psychiatrist (e.g. a consultee-centred consultation in which the patient was not seen by the psychiatrist and only the primary care physician was counselled by the psychiatrist);</LI>
<LI>there was no written advice from the psychiatrist (e.g. only oral advice or advice by telephone after the consultation);</LI>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2010-11-08 17:18:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We assessed methodological quality according to The Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008a</LINK>)<I>.</I> We added three additional criteria to the Risk of Bias checklist: assessing MUPS with validated instruments, a complete description of baseline characteristics and acceptable pre-randomization dropout (see <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK> for more information). We judged this to be of importance for the following reasons:</P>
<UL>
<LI>studies assess MUPS in many different ways and not always with well validated instruments;</LI>
<LI>patients with MUPS have high prevalence rates of psychiatric co-morbidity which, together with socio-demographic characteristics, are moderators for the effectiveness of the intervention;</LI>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Study design and length of study</HEADING>
<P>The four studies which compared the CL to care as usual (CAU) all had a cross-over design (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rost-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Rost 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dickinson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dickinson 2003</LINK>). We only included results from before the cross-over, because only during that period could the intervention condition be compared with the control condition. We judged that after cross-over there would be carry-over effects. Including first phase data of cross-over trials might introduce potential bias, because the report can be based on test of carry over, incomplete data from the control condition and such designs can be underpowered. However, the reports in the four studies on these topics were transparent and the risk of this kind of bias was judged to be limited. The time points for cross-over were at 12 months for three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Rost-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Rost 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dickinson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dickinson 2003</LINK>) and at nine months for one study (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1986</LINK>). We considered that these time-points were sufficiently comparable. These four studies were performed in a primary care setting, and the primary care physicians were the providers of care.</P>
<P>In both studies comparing joint consultation to CAU there was cluster randomization. In the high-utilizers study (<LINK REF="STD-Katon-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Katon 1992</LINK>) the patients were randomized at physician level. This was the only study in which the patients were not selected for having somatization symptoms, but because they were distressed, high-utilizing patients of physicians in primary care clinics. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Feltz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Feltz 2006</LINK>) patients were randomized on practice level. In both studies the family physicians were the providers of care. The intervention condition was conducted for a period of 12 months in the Katon study and six months in the Van der Feltz study.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Intervention</HEADING>
<P>In four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rost-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Rost 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dickinson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dickinson 2003</LINK>), the intervention group received separate psychiatric screening and only the primary care physician was provided with a CL. The contents of the CL are described in the <LINK TAG="BACKGROUND" TYPE="SECTION">Background</LINK> section. In two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Katon-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Katon 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Feltz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Feltz 2006</LINK>), the primary care physician and a psychiatrist had a joint consultation with the patient and the CL was tailored to the patient's diagnosis. In addition, in the Van der Feltz study patients also received a letter with recommendations.</P>
<P>In all studies the control condition was CAU, provided by the primary care physician.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>Participants were recruited from primary care. They were recruited from private and university family practices, by the physician (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rost-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Rost 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Feltz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Feltz 2006</LINK>) and also by advertisements in the local media (<LINK REF="STD-Rost-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Rost 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1995</LINK>). In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Dickinson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dickinson 2003</LINK>) an interviewer recruited and screened patients in the primary care clinic. In another study (<LINK REF="STD-Katon-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Katon 1992</LINK>), the patients selected were those in the top 10% of ambulatory health care visits for their age-sex group. After physicians checked potential participants against exclusion criteria, these patients were then recruited by letter and telephone.</P>
<P>Two studies included patients who fulfilled DSM-III criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1986</LINK>) or DSM-III-R criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Rost-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Rost 1994</LINK>) for somatization disorder (SD). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1995</LINK>) included patients who fulfilled criteria for abridged somatization disorder (ASD) (symptoms screened with DSM-III-R criteria). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Dickinson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dickinson 2003</LINK>) included patients who fulfilled criteria for SD, ASD and multiform somatoform disorder (MSD) (symptoms screened with DSM-III-R criteria). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Feltz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Feltz 2006</LINK>) included patients who fulfilled ICD-10 criteria for somatoform disorders. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Katon-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Katon 1992</LINK>) included patients who met criteria for psychiatric distress (by fulfilling a sum score for anxiety and depression or a score for somatization) or patients who were referred by the primary care physician for a psychiatric consultation. This was the only study in which patients who did not fulfil criteria for somatization using a validated tool were also included; 20.2% of the patients fulfilled criteria for SD and 73% for ASD. The level of somatization was high in the population, but it was not specified to the diagnostic subgroups (e.g. SD, depressive disorder, anxiety disorder). Therefore, although the study fulfilled the inclusion criteria and almost three-quarters of the patients fulfilled criteria for ASD, the results of our review are also given in a subgroup analysis without this study.<I> </I>

<P>From the included studies we evaluated the effects of two interventions: 'CL versus CAU' and 'joint consultation of patient with the psychiatrist, with the physician present, and CL versus CAU'.</P>
<P>We pooled results of studies that evaluated the same intervention if there were sufficient data (means, standard deviations, effect sizes). We measured these results with the same instruments (e.g. in US dollars regarding costs; subscales of the RAND and SF-36 for functioning) and therefore the pooled MDs could be reported in weighted MDs. If data were available, but could not be pooled, we took a narrative approach. There were no comparable data available for the two comparisons with regard to the primary outcomes, so we could not perform meta-analysis. If in the future comparable data from further studies become available, and there is not too much heterogeneity, we think that data can be pooled for the two comparisons because the joint consultation can be clinically considered as an 'extension' of the screening by the psychiatrist before formulating the CL.</P>

However it should be noted that there is an overlap between the subgroups with a SD, ASD and MSD in the Dickinson study. Because of 95.5% overlap between the MSD subgroup and the SD and ASD subgroups and comparable confidence intervals (<LINK REF="STD-Dickinson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dickinson 2003</LINK>), this will not have had any great influence on the MD and could only have decreased the MD slightly, because of the greatest effect in the SD subgroup and smaller and comparable effects in the ASD and MSD subgroups.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">CL intervention</HEADING>
<P>With regard to the CL intervention, the primary outcomes in the four studies showed a reduction in medical costs (three studies reported on this outcome). The reduction was greater for patients with SD (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rost-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Rost 1994</LINK>) than for patients with ASD (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1995</LINK>): in percentages these were reductions in median costs of 53%, 45% and 32.9% (costs for psychiatric care excluded). The reductions were mainly due to smaller reductions in types of inpatient medical consumption, with one study reporting a clear reduction in hospital days for patients with a SD (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>The secondary outcomes showed an improvement in physical functioning for the patients with a SD, ASD and MSD. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1986</LINK>) reported that for patients with a SD there was a reduction of physical functioning, but these data could not be used for pooling because there were no reported standard deviations. With use of an imputed SE for the outcome of this study, the pooled data still showed an improvement in physical functioning, but no longer an improvement in the subgroup of patients with SD. For mental, social functioning and perceived health there were non-significant differences. There was a small reduction in perceived health. There were no data on sick leave or return to work.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Joint consultation and CL</HEADING>
<P>Two studies reported on the intervention the joint consultation followed by a CL. In patients with somatoform disorders (<LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Feltz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Feltz 2006</LINK>) there were significant improvements in severity of somatization symptoms, medical consumption and social functioning. In the group of distressed high utilizers (<LINK REF="STD-Katon-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Katon 1992</LINK>), in which 73% fulfilled the criteria for ASD, there were no indications of effect of the intervention. In the intervention group in this study there were significant improvements in the use of antidepressants, the long-term use of antidepressants, and the antidepressant prescription rate among the physicians.</P>
<P>In conclusion, there is evidence that the use of a CL in primary care, in the treatment of patients with multiple MUPS, results in reduced medical costs (for SD and ASD) and improved physical functioning (for SD, ASD, MSD) with the strongest effects on SD, which is the most severe but also most rare disorder, regarding medical costs.</P>
<P>There is limited evidence that the use of a CL letter in primary care results in reduced inpatient medical consumption in patients with somatoform disorders</P>
<P>There is limited evidence that in primary care joint consultation with the patient with multiple MUPS by a psychiatrist, in the presence of the primary care physician, results in reduced symptom severity, reduced medical consumption and improved social functioning in patients with somatoform disorders</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Limitations</HEADING>
<P>Some remarks should be made about the limitations in external validity:</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Clinical relevance</HEADING>
<P>First of all, two of the six studies (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rost-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Rost 1994</LINK>) concerned patients with a SD. This disorder is rare in primary care, with a prevalence of approximately 0.5% (<LINK REF="REF-De-Waal-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Waal 2004</LINK>). This is in contrast to sub-threshold somatoform disorders, with a prevalence of 10-24% (<LINK REF="REF-Escobar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Escobar 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kroenke-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kroenke 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-De-Waal-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Waal 2004</LINK>). Therefore more weight should be given to the results in the patient groups with sub-threshold forms, showing less reduction in medical costs and less improvement of physical functioning than the patient groups with somatization disorder.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Health care setting, period</HEADING>
<P>Five of the six studies were performed in the United States (the other study was performed in the Netherlands), so the results in other countries could vary considerably, due to differences in the role of the primary care physician and the insurance policies.</P>
<P>The outcomes which are reported in the studies vary. Concerning the main pathology, two studies reported on the severity of somatization symptoms and psychiatric comorbidity. The other four studies focused on SD, ASD and MSD, for which a lifetime history or a two-year history of MUPS and a symptom count is sufficient.</P>
<P>None of the studies were performed in an occupational health setting and there were no data on sub-populations of employees, so no conclusions can be drawn on the effect of the intervention for employees regarding return to work or functioning at work. The results show an effect on improving physical functioning and a small effect on reducing social function, which can be of importance in the functioning and return to work of employees, but no conclusions can be drawn with regard to the exact effects.</P>
<P>Furthermore, it should be borne in mind that four of the six included studies were from 1995 and earlier. The results of these studies are well known to many medical professionals, and health care has changed a lot since then. For example, the average duration of hospital admissions is greatly reduced. These are two reasons why these interventions will probably no longer achieve the same effect sizes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Physician- versus patient-centred aspects</HEADING>
<P>The interventions described in these studies are mainly physician-centred interventions. Only <LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Feltz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Feltz 2006</LINK> included a letter for the patient. Furthermore, four of the six studies did not measure patient-centred outcomes like symptom severity as primary outcomes or patient satisfaction as a secondary outcome. So this gives little insight as to how the patient-centred aspects of these interventions could be improved. In the light of the perceived reduced general health status of patients with persisting MUPS, this leaves room for further improvement.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Components of the intervention</HEADING>
<P>There are three important aspects of interventions for patients with multiple and recurrent somatization symptoms: psychiatric screening, case management (e.g. regular appointments, and limiting referrals and diagnostic procedures) and patient-physician communication (e.g. take the patient seriously, don't tell the patient "it 'is all in your head", make a physical examination). From the results of our review it is not possible to draw any conclusions with regard to which aspects contributed most to the favourable outcomes. Further research is needed, but in the meantime attention must be paid to all three aspects.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Strengths</HEADING>
<P>Strengths of the included studies, with regard to external validity, were that the study patients were of all ages, except children, and with a gender distribution comparable to what is reported in other studies concerning somatoform disorders. All the studies were performed in primary care, and urban and rural populations were involved. Although the results in patients with a SD were greater than in the patients with less serious somatization syndromes, the resulting reductions in medical costs and improvements in physical functioning were still significant. Given the high prevalence of sub-threshold somatization syndromes, there is a high potential for improvement in these outcomes in primary care.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2010-11-09 15:41:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We assessed only one study as being of overall high quality<I> (</I>
<LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Feltz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Feltz 2006</LINK>) (although see below for details of possible selection bias)<I> </I>and five studies as only of moderate quality with regard to internal validity. The conclusions mentioned above were, with regard to the CL intervention, drawn from four studies with 267 patients in the intervention condition (with 183 patients with ASD from <LINK REF="STD-Dickinson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dickinson 2003</LINK>: lower totals for the 111 patients with MSD, and 88 patients with SD). With regard to the reduction in medical costs and improvement in physical functioning, these conclusions are to be interpreted with caution, due to the fact that these results are established in diagnostic subgroups and lack transparency in the underlying studies. Furthermore, the results are varying, with one study in patients with a SD<I> </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Smith-1986a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1986a</LINK>) reporting a negative effect on physical functioning, although this was in a small study population, and if the results could have been pooled the results would still have been positive.</P>
<P>The conclusions regarding joint consultation of the psychiatrist in the presence of the primary care physician, followed by a CL, concerned two studies with 182 patients in the intervention condition. The patient populations were quite different. The patients in the study of distressed high utilizers did not all fulfil the inclusion criteria, and there was no subgroup analysis on the patients who fulfilled the criteria for ASD (73%) and for SD (20.2%). In the last group there was selection bias, due to the fact that the included patients were selected because they were highly distressed, whereas not all patients with somatoform disorders are distressed. Therefore conclusions with regard to the effect of consultation with the psychiatrist, with the use of a CL can only be drawn from the results of the study with patients with somatoform disorders (<LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Feltz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Feltz 2006</LINK>), providing limited evidence.<I> </I>
</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Dickinson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dickinson 2003</LINK>) showed an important overlap between the patients with SD, ASD and MSD. A study of patients fulfilling only the criteria for MSD and not SD and ASD would have given a clearer indication of the effect of the intervention on patients with this less serious form of somatoform disorders.</P>
<P>Due to the study design, one study with cluster randomization (<LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Feltz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Feltz 2006</LINK>) had a small control group. Although we assessed this study of high quality, it should be taken into account that selection bias could have been of influence, which should be kept in mind when interpreting the results. In this study there was heterogeneity of the included patients; for example 34% of the patients fulfilled the criteria for undifferentiated somatoform disorder, 25% for persistent pain disorder and 15% for hypochondriasis. A strong point is that this heterogeneity reflects the patient population in primary care.</P>
<P>All studies were of moderate and high quality, and therefore no analysis was done for the included studies to control for the inclusion of low quality studies.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2010-11-09 15:46:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For the inclusion of the studies we chose a definition with high sensitivity and low specificity. The relatively low number of included studies indicates that this was probably a good approach. The intervention consisted of two components (psychiatric screening and a CL) which we defined in different ways for our search. It is possible that we missed studies which defined one or two components in other terms.</P>
<P>One can also argue that our perspective was too narrow. In the field of consultation-liaison psychiatry, interventions with psychiatric screening and the use of a CL have evolved to collaborative care with, amongst other things, the involvement of mental health specialists and education of the patient. Although this is a promising development, these are complex interventions to assess in patients with a broad scale of psychiatric disorders. We chose an intervention with two components and the patient group with MUPS to obtain insight into the critical components of the effect.</P>
<P>However, one question in our review remains: is there a critical element in the two components of screening for the diagnosis and the guidelines for treatment? Does the uncertainty of the diagnosis hamper the primary care physician providing care for patients with MUPS? Or does the primary care physician not apply the recommendations adequately without the 'reminder' of a CL? To our knowledge there are no studies which the two components have been evaluated separately.</P>
<P>We used the Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias Tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008a</LINK>), adding three additional criteria because of the complicated assessment of patients with MUPS, the role of comorbidity and the potential pre-randomization bias. While we were completing this review, guidelines for assessing the quality of RCTs were updated. Using the GRADE approach would have resulted in a more qualified description of the strength of evidence, and we recommend using this approach in future revisions. However, we think that we checked the main factors determining the quality of the RCTs (<LINK REF="REF-Feinstein-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feinstein 1985</LINK>) and that we detected most risks of bias. The impossibility of blinding of care providers stays associated with these kind of interventions, and in analogy blinding can not be avoided for patients in joint consultations.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2010-11-09 16:09:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To our knowledge this is the first review on the effectiveness of CLs. Most reviews on the treatment of patients with MUPS focus on the effectiveness of cognitive behavourial therapy (CBT) and antidepressants. A small number of reviews involved the topic of CLs.</P>
<P>The results of our review are in line with the findings of Looper and Kirmayer (<LINK REF="REF-Looper-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Looper 2002</LINK>) in their review of behavioral approaches to somatoform disorders and the review on the effectiveness of treatments for somatization in general practice in Blankenstein's thesis (<LINK REF="REF-Blankenstein-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blankenstein 2001</LINK>). They reviewed the same studies as we did (until 2002), although Looper did not include the Katon study of distressed high utilizers. We found more evidence than <LINK REF="REF-Sumathipala-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sumathipala 2007</LINK>, who stated that there was limited evidence for the effectiveness of CLs for patients with MUPS in terms of reducing medical health charges and improving physical functioning. He referred to <LINK REF="REF-Rost-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rost 1994</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1995</LINK>. If our findings are broadened, they are also in line with the findings of <LINK REF="REF-Henningsen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henningsen 2007</LINK>, who performed a review on the management of functional somatic syndromes (FSS). Earlier research indicates that there is much overlap in symptoms between the different somatic syndromes and somatoform disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Wessely-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wessely 1999</LINK>). Although <LINK REF="REF-Henningsen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henningsen 2007</LINK> had no specific focus on CLs, they stated that the therapeutic rationale of the effect of non-pharmacological treatments (psychotherapy and graded exercise) in FSS is that these treatments typically aim at overall function and not the alleviation of specific symptoms. In this rationale there is overlap with how the intervention of CL might work in patients with MUPS, whereas the CL is more aimed at handling the consequences of MUPS than the causes.</P>
<P>Three reviews show that CBT and antidepressants are the most effective treatment options for patients with multiple MUPS (<LINK REF="REF-Kroenke-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kroenke 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Looper-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Looper 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sumathipala-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sumathipala 2007</LINK>). However, interpretation of this evidence should take into account that patients with multiple MUPS vary in their willingness to be referred to a mental health specialist. In most of the RCTs used for the reviews there was acceptable compliance, defined in one review as two-thirds (<LINK REF="REF-Looper-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Looper 2002</LINK>), but pre-randomization dropout was seldom described adequately. Furthermore, it is important to remember that the results of this review are based on five of six studies performed in United States healthcare settings. Outcomes could vary in other countries with different healthcare settings and, for example, more or fewer possibilities at point of use to the consumer.</P>
<P>Applying the recommendations of CLs does not mean that the patients will be less worried or more satisfied with care. Indeed our results show that there is a slight reduction in perceived and general health. The primary care physician should take this into account and also address the worries of the patient. How to give good reassurance is still a topic of further investigations, but recent studies (<LINK REF="REF-Epstein-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Epstein 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Salmon-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salmon 2007</LINK>) have reported that when physicians reacted on the concerns of patients with MUPS with empathy, this resulted in more satisfaction with the patient-physician relationship.</P>
<P>No direct evidence is available to make it possible to draw conclusions on the best care for employees with MUPS, in relation to their functioning at work and return to work from sick absence. However, from the evidence obtained from primary care, it can be concluded indirectly that the diagnosis of MUPS and adherence to the guidelines will contribute to an improvement in at least physical functioning. Since interventions result in a reduction in hospital stays and 'bed days' it is possible that applying these interventions to employees with MUPS in occupational health care will lead to a reduction in the period and/or frequency of sickness absence.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-11-09 16:14:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<UL>
<LI>There is evidence from studies of moderate quality that the use of CLs in primary care is effective, but primarily with regard to healthcare (provider) related outcomes, in reducing financial costs, and only secondary for patient-related outcomes, in improving physical functioning.</LI>
<LI>There is evidence from studies of moderate quality that if primary care physicians are taught to take patients with persistent MUPS seriously, see these patients at regular intervals, and perform physical examinations at each visit, but do not make referrals or further investigation unless there is a clear indication, that this will result in fewer medical costs, less medical consumption (especially hospital days) and better physical functioning.</LI>
<LI>There is limited evidence that joint consultation with the patient (by the psychiatrist in the presence of the physician) results in a reduction of severity of somatization symptoms, less medical consumption and improved social functioning.</LI>
<LI>Other interventions are needed when psychiatric comorbidity, mental functioning, social functioning and disability are (also) to be addressed in patients with somatization symptoms.</LI>
<LI>Other health care professionals should be careful with referrals and diagnostic procedures for patients with somatization symptoms, and should first communicate with the primary care physician. Furthermore, in caring for these patients, attention should be paid to the management of communication (as mentioned in the CL).</LI>

<P>Further RCTs and studies are needed to address the following issues:</P>
<UL>
<LI>To evaluate both the CL intervention and the CL intervention with joint consultation with the patient, with emphasis on the severity of somatization symptoms, psychiatric comorbidity, functioning and patient satisfaction as outcomes.</LI>
<LI>To assess pre-randomization dropout rates.</LI>
<LI>To clarify how a diagnosis of somatoform disorders or MUPS helps in the therapeutic choices and communication in care, and what the critical components are in the recommendations, with regard to aspects of case management and communication, preferably by means of qualitative research and testing tailored interventions in RCTs.</LI>
<LI>To tailor the intervention more to the patient's or physicians's perspective, preferably by means of qualitative research and testing tailored interventions in RCTs.</LI>
<LI>To evaluate these interventions in countries with other healthcare systems than the United States.</LI>
<LI>To evaluate these interventions in the field of occupational health, with physical, mental and social functioning, return to work, frequency and duration of sickness absence of employees as primary outcomes.</LI>

<P>We performed the protocol as described. We sub-divided medical consumption into medical outpatient care and medical inpatient care since, due to the nature of the intervention, the effects on outpatient care and inpatient care were expected to be different. We added perceived health as a secondary outcome. This outcome is included in measurement instruments to assess functioning (especially RAND and SF-36), but also measures other aspects than physical and mental (role) functioning. To make this distinction we added this outcome.</P>
<P>In this review we assessed the methodological quality according to The Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008a</LINK>) and not with the Tulder checklist (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Tulder-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Tulder 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Tulder 2003</LINK>) as indicated in our protocol. This was done on advice of the peer reviewers, to enhance the comparability of the review. We extended the checklist with three criteria: assessing MUPS with validated instruments; complete description of baseline characteristics and acceptable pre-randomization dropout.</P>
<P>We also added some references with regard to what is known about the relationship between MUPS and sickness absence.</P>

<P>a) Screening: by an interviewer who used an 11-item screening for unexplained physical symptoms. For all patients with 3 or more positive items on the screening, a diagnostic interview was performed by a trained interviewer, using the somatization section of the NIMH Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS) Version III-R. The results were reviewed by the study physician to confirm that the physical symptoms were medically unexplained. Patients were selected if they fulfilled the criteria for SD, ASD or MSD.<BR/>b) Intervention: the family physicians of patients of the intervention group were sent a Care Recommendation letter about the patients who met the criteria for a somatoform disorder. This letter consisted of the components mentioned in the Notes of <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1986</LINK>.</P>
