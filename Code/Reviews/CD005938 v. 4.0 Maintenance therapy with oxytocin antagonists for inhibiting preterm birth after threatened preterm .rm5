<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-09-18 11:07:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Preterm labour is indicated by regular contractions of the uterus and changes in the cervix (the opening of the womb) before 37 weeks of pregnancy. Preterm labour and birth may be associated with illness or death of the baby, and often place a substantial emotional burden on families. Preterm birth may also result in childhood disability. Even a short-term prolongation of pregnancy after the onset of threatened or actual preterm labour can allow the administration of corticosteroids to the mother to hasten fetal lung maturation and transfer of the mother to a centre with neonatal intensive care facilities. A range of drugs (tocolytic) are used to suppress labour. The oxytocin antagonist atosiban is one of these. Once the episode of threatened preterm labour settles, maintenance treatment with a tocolytic can then be used to try to prevent any reoccurrence. This has to be balanced against potential adverse outcomes such as intrauterine infection, fetal death, an increase in severe disability for survivors, and side-effects of the drugs.</P>
<P>This review identified only one good quality multicentre controlled trial which showed that subcutaneously administered atosiban as maintenance therapy did not reduce the incidence of preterm birth or improve neonatal outcomes when compared with placebo treatment. The trial randomised 513 women in whom preterm labour (with intact membranes and limited cervical dilatation) ceased following intravenous treatment with atosiban. The mean gestation at enrolment was around 31 weeks and the proportion of multiple births was similar in the two groups. Atosiban infused at 6 mL/hr (30 µg/min) did not reduce preterm birth before 28, 32, or 37 weeks. Women on maintenance therapy were discharged home with a continuous subcutaneous infusion pump and daily nursing contact. There was an increase in injection site reaction for the atosiban group. There is insufficient evidence of benefit to justify this intervention.</P>

<P>There is insufficient evidence to support the use of oxytocin receptor antagonists to inhibit preterm birth after a period of threatened or actual preterm labour. Any future trials using oxytocin antagonists or other drugs as maintenance therapy for preventing preterm birth should examine a variety of important infant outcome measures, including reduction of neonatal morbidity and mortality, and long-term infant follow-up. Future research should also focus on the pathophysiological pathways that precede preterm labour.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2013-10-01 20:01:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-09-22 18:57:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In developed countries, preterm birth, defined as birth before 37 completed weeks (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2012</LINK>), is the most important cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality after congenital anomalies (<LINK REF="REF-Goldenberg-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldenberg 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Preterm birth occurring between 20 and 36 completed weeks is a major contributor to perinatal mortality and morbidity. More than one in 10 babies born worldwide in 2010 was born premature, with an annual estimation of 15 million preterm births (<LINK REF="REF-Blencowe-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blencowe 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2012</LINK>). Preterm birth accounts for approximately 75% of perinatal mortality and more than 50% of long-term morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Hack-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hack 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Preterm birth is associated not only with high immediate costs attributable to neonatal intensive care, but also with substantial long-term costs, including costs for special education (<LINK REF="REF-Petrou-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petrou 2011</LINK>), and other services for infants and children with intellectual and physical disability (<LINK REF="REF-Petrou-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petrou 2011</LINK>). In addition to the lengthy neonatal intensive care treatment required for many preterm infants, preterm birth often constitutes a major crisis in the lives of parents, and places a substantial emotional burden on families (<LINK REF="REF-McCain-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCain 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>The exact causes of preterm birth are not known. Preterm labour can be the final clinical endpoint of several distinct but converging pathophysiological pathways, including: inflammation/infection causing maternal/fetal cytokine and prostaglandin production; maternal/fetal stress leading to endocrine changes; mechanical stress due to abnormal uterine distention; or abruption (placenta/decidual haemorrhage). Because there are several mechanisms, which can occur independently or in combination, it is difficult to identify universal management strategies to prevent preterm birth. To reduce the incidence of preterm birth, a better understanding of the complex triggers of the final common pathway is needed.</P>
<P>The incidence of preterm birth is increasing in developed and developing countries affecting, on average, 11.8% of births in low-income countries and 9.3% to 9.4% in upper-middle- and high-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>In developed countries, the incidence of preterm birth varies within a narrow range from 6% to 10% (<LINK REF="REF-Lumley-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lumley 2003</LINK>). This incidence has not declined over the past two decades despite intensive antenatal care programs aimed at identifying high-risk groups for preterm birth, the widespread use of tocolytic agents, and other preventive and therapeutic interventions.</P>
<P>The incidence of preterm birth is probably much higher in low-income than high-income countries, but precise data are lacking because of inaccurate estimation of gestation (<LINK REF="REF-Kramer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kramer 2003</LINK>) and registration of births (<LINK REF="REF-Kramer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kramer 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lumley-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lumley 2003</LINK>). Nevertheless, preterm delivery is one of the major direct causes of neonatal death in low-income countries, and is estimated to account for more than 1.1 million neonatal deaths worldwide annually (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although the incidence in preterm birth has not declined, even short-term prolongation of pregnancy is beneficial if it enables the administration of corticosteroids to the mother to hasten fetal lung maturation (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2006</LINK>) and/or transfer to a centre with neonatal intensive care facilities (<LINK REF="REF-Powell-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powell 1995</LINK>). Perinatal mortality and morbidity is significantly reduced after administration of a full course of corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>A range of drugs (tocolytic) have been used to inhibit preterm labour to allow time for such co-interventions. These drugs are the topics of Cochrane systematic reviews including nitric oxide donors (glyceryl trinitrate) (<LINK REF="REF-Duckitt-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duckitt 2002</LINK>), calcium channel blockers (such as nifedipine) (<LINK REF="REF-King-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 2003</LINK>), betamimetics (<LINK REF="REF-Anotayanonth-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anotayanonth 2004</LINK>), magnesium sulphate (<LINK REF="REF-Crowther-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowther 2002</LINK>), cyclo-oxygenase (COX) inhibitors (<LINK REF="REF-Khanprakob-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khanprakob 2012</LINK>) and oxytocin receptor antagonists (<LINK REF="REF-Papatsonis-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papatsonis 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>For those women with preterm labour who are treated with tocolytics and remain undelivered after 48 hours, maintenance treatment with a tocolytic is sometimes used to further delay delivery and to prolong pregnancy. Maintenance treatment regimens of differing duration, and using a number of different tocolytic, have been proposed. These include betamimetics (<LINK REF="REF-Dodd-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dodd 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nanda-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nanda 2002</LINK>), magnesium sulphate (<LINK REF="REF-Han-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Han 2013</LINK>), and calcium channel blockers (<LINK REF="REF-Gaunekar-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gaunekar 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The potential advantages of prolonging pregnancy should be balanced against potential adverse outcomes such as intrauterine infection, fetal demise, and side-effects of the drugs. Prolonging pregnancy at the border of viability could increase the short-term survival rate, but without improving overall survival and/or at the cost of an increase in severe disability for survivors. Therefore, the assessment of effects of interventions to improve outcomes should be based not only on mortality rates but also on major morbidity including long-term outcomes.<BR/>
<BR/>Oxytocin antagonists (commonly atosiban) are used for tocolysis in several countries and atosiban has been registered in Europe as a tocolytic agent. This review will determine if there is sufficient evidence to support the use of maintenance therapy with oxytocin antagonists after an episode of threatened or actual preterm labour.</P>

<P>The included trial (<LINK REF="STD-Valenzuela-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Valenzuela 2000</LINK>) was considered of good quality with a low risk of bias for each of the bias domains assessed with the exception of reporting bias, which had an unclear risk of bias.. The trial employed a blinded method of randomisation according to a computer-generated schedule using pre-numbered envelopes containing the allocation to study group provided to the pharmacist at each centre for use in sequential order. The randomisation schedule was developed using permuted blocks of four and was stratified by centre but not gestation. Blinding of the intervention was undertaken with the use of a placebo which was identical in appearance and administration to the atosiban arm of the trial.<BR/>
</P>
<P>One woman in the placebo group, who did not receive treatment, was excluded post-randomisation. Eight participants in the placebo group received some atosiban in error but were analysed by intention-to-treat for the purposes of assessing efficacy.</P>
<P>The primary outcome variable, on which the sample size calculation was based, was the number of days from the start of maintenance therapy until the recurrence of preterm labour.</P>
<P>Although all mothers appear accounted for in the reported outcomes of the study, the numbers of infants referred to in the text and tables amount to 568, 563 (272 placebo, 291 atosiban) and 558 infants (269 placebo, 289 atosiban), without further explanation of the discrepancies. One of these discrepant infants is possibly the single fetal death (in the atosiban group).</P>

<P>This review included data from one study with a total of 513 women .</P>
<P>Compared with placebo, the use of atosiban as maintenance therapy for prevention of recurrent preterm labour did not reduce the incidence of preterm birth before 37 weeks (risk ratio (RR) 0.89; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71 to 1.12), 32 weeks (RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.47 to 1.55), or 28 weeks (RR 0.75; 95% CI 0.28 to 2.01). While not defined as an a priori outcome measure of this review, the median interval from the start of maintenance therapy to the first recurrence of labour was prolonged (32.6 days in the atosiban group versus 27.6 days in the placebo group, P = 0.02), as was the time to recurrence of preterm labour (36.2 versus 28.2 days, P = 0.03).

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-09-22 18:59:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The results of this review do not support the use of atosiban as maintenance therapy after an episode of preterm labour. When atosiban was compared with placebo, there was no reduction of the incidence of preterm birth and no improvement of any reported neonatal outcome. The treatment involved at least maternal inconvenience (continuous subcutaneous infusion pump for days to weeks) and although there was no excess of severe maternal side-effects, the incidence of maternal injection site reactions was significantly higher among women treated with atosiban maintenance than among those receiving placebo.</P>
<P>Any more than minor risk or burden to the pregnant mother of treatment for the sake of her fetus can only be justified if infant outcomes improve. Atosiban maintenance therapy when compared with placebo prolonged the interval until first recurrence of preterm labour. Although this was statistically significant, clinical relevance is dubious because the neonatal outcomes were very similar in the two groups. Although the trial size was calculated with the intention of demonstrating a difference in interval until labour recurred, not a difference in neonatal outcomes, the absence of even a trend towards improved infant outcomes leads the review authors to conclude that there is insufficient evidence to support the use of atosiban for this indication.</P>
<P>Outcomes of the infants born during the trial whose outcomes are not reported could affect the results. However, their outcomes would need to be markedly skewed between treatment groups to affect the overall conclusions. A further minor caution is that gestation at delivery is reported by infants, not by mothers. Since progeny of multiple births inevitably deliver in very quick succession, logic suggests that multiple births should not be considered independently when comparing gestation at delivery. However, the proportion of multiple births in the two groups was similar (25 of 251 in the placebo group and 20 of 261 in the atosiban group), and the distribution of gestation at delivery was sufficiently similar that it is unlikely that re-analysis would markedly affect interpretation of the study results.</P>
<P>The mean gestation at enrolment in the trial was approximately 31 weeks. A pharmaco-economic analysis mentioned by the authors but published only in abstract form suggests that benefits of treatment may be greater at earlier gestations (<LINK REF="REF-Gagnon-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gagnon 1998</LINK>). Indeed, after mid-third trimester preterm birth, neonatal outcomes are sufficiently good that benefits to the infant of prolonging the pregnancy after corticosteroid treatment and transfer to a tertiary centre are relatively small. However, in the absence of data showing greater benefits, no recommendation for atosiban maintenance treatment can be made at any gestation.</P>
<P>The intention of this review was to consider maintenance treatment after threatened or actual preterm labour. Entry criteria for the sole trial included a definition of preterm labour that included regular contractions and documented cervical changes. It is conceivable that treatment of women with less advanced changes in the lower uterine segment and cervix would be more effective. However, such women may also be less likely to progress to very preterm delivery regardless of treatment. Furthermore, the number of women who delivered very prematurely in this study was small, despite the rigour of the entry criteria.</P>
<P>Several systematic reviews have reported that various tocolytic agents can postpone progression of preterm labour and delay preterm birth for at least 48 hours, although the incidence of neonatal morbidity and mortality was not reduced (<LINK REF="REF-Anotayanonth-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anotayanonth 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gyetvai-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gyetvai 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-King-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 1988</LINK>). However, after preterm labour has been suppressed, the review authors have concluded that maintenance therapy using a variety of agents does not reduce the incidence of preterm birth or improve neonatal outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Dodd-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dodd 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gaunekar-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gaunekar 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Han-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Han 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Khanprakob-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khanprakob 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nanda-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nanda 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sanchez_x002d_Ramos-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanchez-Ramos 1997</LINK>). The triggering factors and mechanisms of preterm birth are likely to vary between pregnancies and preterm birth is the final common outcome of several discrete but converging pathophysiological pathways, including ascending infection, (utero) placental insufficiency, uterine distension and fetal stress. Tocolytic agents are thought to act where these pathways merge, when pathological influences may already be well established. Therefore, to have a substantial influence on neonatal outcomes, management strategies to prevent preterm birth may need a greater focus on the underlying causes and earlier steps in the development of preterm labour.<BR/>
<BR/>In this review, atosiban subcutaneously administered as maintenance therapy after a period of preterm labour was not shown to be associated with a reduction of the incidence of preterm birth, or any improvement of neonatal outcome.</P>

<P>A single large, high-quality trial of atosiban administered by continuous subcutaneous infusion as maintenance therapy after a period of preterm labour has not shown clinically significant benefits. To justify the risks and burdens of treatment for pregnant women, any future trials using oxytocin antagonists or other drugs as maintenance therapy for preventing preterm birth should examine a variety of important infant outcome measures, including not only reduction of neonatal morbidity and mortality, but also long-term infant follow-up. Future research should also focus on the pathophysiological pathways that precede preterm labour.</P>

<P>513 women in a multicentre trial who had preterm labour and intact membranes, with pregnancies between 20 and 33 6/7 weeks, less than or equal to 3 cm cervical dilatation, and a live fetus, who after uterine quiescence was achieved using IV atosiban (not placebo) were randomised to either placebo or atosiban maintenance therapy.</P>
<P>Exclusion criteria: fetal or placental abnormalities by ultrasonography, maternal indications for delivery, urinary tract infection, and overt clinical manifestations of substance abuse.</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2013-09-22 09:34:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Active drug and placebo were administered at the same volume and rate. <BR/>
<BR/>Atosiban group: Atosiban for maintenance was administered by a subcutaneous infusion pump to provide a continuous atosiban infusion of 6 mL/hr (30 µg/min). <BR/>Placebo group: Placebo for maintenance was administered by a subcutaneous infusion pump to provide a continuous placebo infusion of 6 mL/hr.<BR/>
<BR/>If subsequent IV treatment with atosiban was given for any additional episode of preterm labour, subcutaneous maintenance therapy using the assigned study treatment was recommenced if uterine quiescence was achieved. Both active drug and placebo were administered until the end of week 36 of gestation, delivery, or progression of labour requiring a tocolytic agent other than atosiban.<BR/>All women on maintenance therapy were discharged home with daily nursing contact for all. Compliance was checked by diaries kept by women and drugs used.</P>

<P>The objective of the study was to determine the safety and efficacy of maintenance therapy with the oxytocin receptor antagonist atosiban. The primary end point was the number of days from the<BR/>start of maintenance therapy until the first recurrence of labour.</P>
