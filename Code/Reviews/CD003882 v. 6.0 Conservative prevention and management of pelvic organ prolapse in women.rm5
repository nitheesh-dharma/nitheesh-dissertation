<TITLE>Conservative management of pelvic organ prolapse in women</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-11-09 22:25:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Pelvic organs, such as the uterus, cervix, bladder or bowel, may protrude into the vagina because of weakness in the tissues that normally support them. The symptoms that they cause vary, depending on the type of prolapse. Conservative methods, such as pelvic floor muscle training (exercises to improve the pelvic floor muscles) or lifestyle changes (for example, avoiding lifting or losing weight), are commonly recommended for prolapse. The review looked for randomised trials of conservative methods, either to prevent or treat prolapse, from which to judge their effects.</P>
<P>Six trials were included. Four trials compared pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with no intervention, and two trials compared pelvic floor muscle training plus surgery to surgery alone. PFMT compared to no intervention was found in individual trials to improve prolapse symptoms, but data could not be combined. Data on prolapse severity was combined from two trials and results indicated that PFMT increases the chance of improvement in prolapse stage by 17% compared to no treatment. Pelvic floor muscle function appeared to be improved in women who received PFMT in the two trials which measured this. Bladder symptoms were improved with PFMT in two out of three trials measuring this; bowel symptoms were measured in one trial, and an improvement with PFMT was found.</P>
<P>The two trials which looked at the benefit of PFMT in addition to surgery, were small but of good quality. Findings were contradictory: women benefited from PFMT, in terms of urinary symptoms and pelvic floor muscle strength, in one trial but not the other.</P>
<P>The evidence from the trials suggests there is some benefit from conservative treatment of prolapse, specifically for PFMT as compared to no intervention. More randomised controlled trials are still needed to look at different regimens of PFMT, the cost in relation to benefit, and the long-term effects. The combination of PFMT and surgery requires to be evaluated in a large randomised trial. There is a dearth of trials addressing lifestyle changes as a treatment for prolapse, and trials aimed at prevention of prolapse. Trials of one type of conservative intervention versus another, and combinations of conservative interventions, are also lacking.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-06-27 18:42:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Pelvic organ prolapse is common, and some degree of prolapse is seen in 50% of parous women. Women with prolapse can experience a variety of pelvic floor symptoms. Treatments include surgery, mechanical devices and conservative management. Conservative management approaches, such as giving lifestyle advice and delivering pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT), are often used in cases of mild to moderate prolapse. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2004, and previously updated in 2006.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2011-06-24 09:39:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To determine the effects of conservative management (physical and lifestyle interventions) for the prevention or treatment of pelvic organ prolapse in comparison with no treatment or other treatment options (such as mechanical devices or surgery).</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2011-11-07 21:12:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Trials Register (searched 6 May 2010), EMBASE (1 January 1996 to 6 May 2010), CINAHL (1 January 1982 to 10 May 2010), PEDro (January 2009), the UK National Research Register (January 2009), ClinicalTrials.gov (April 2009), Current Controlled Trials register (April 2009), CENTRAL (Issue 1, 2009) and ZETOC (January 2009) and the reference lists of relevant articles.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised and quasi-randomised trials in women with pelvic organ prolapse that included a physical or lifestyle intervention in at least one arm of the trial.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers assessed all trials for inclusion/exclusion and methodological quality. Data were extracted by the lead reviewer onto a standard form and cross checked by another. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. Data were processed as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-11-09 22:23:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Six trials were included; three of these trials are new to this update. Four trials were small (less than 25 women per arm) and two had moderate to high risk of bias. Four trials compared PFMT as a treatment for prolapse against a control group (n = 857 women); two trials included women having surgery for prolapse and compared PFMT as an adjunct to surgery versus surgery alone (n = 118 women).</P>
<P>
<I>PFMT versus control</I>
</P>
<P>There was a significant risk of bias in two out four trials in this comparison. Prolapse symptoms and women's reports of treatment outcomes (primary outcomes) were measured differently in the three trials where this was reported: all three indicated greater improvement in symptoms in the PFMT group compared to the control group. Pooling data on severity of prolapse from two trials indicated that PFMT increases the chance of an improvement in prolapse stage by 17% compared to no PFMT. The two trials which measured pelvic floor muscle function found better function (or improvement in function) in the PFMT group compared to the control group; measurements were not known to be blinded. Two out of three trials which measured urinary outcomes (urodynamics, frequency and bother of symptoms, or symptom score) reported differences between groups in favour of the PFMT group. One trial reported bowel outcomes, showing less frequency and bother with symptoms in the PFMT group compared to the control group.</P>
<P>
<I>PFMT supplementing surgery versus surgery alone</I>
</P>
<P>Both trials were small and neither measured prolapse-specific outcomes. Pelvic floor muscle function findings differed between the trials: one found no difference between trial groups in muscle strength, whilst the other found a benefit for the PFMT group in terms of stronger muscles. Similarly findings relating to urinary outcomes were contradictory: one trial found no difference in symptom score change between groups, whilst the other found more improvement in urinary symptoms and a reduction in diurnal frequency in the PFMT group compared to the control group.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-11-09 22:24:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is now some evidence available indicating a positive effect of PFMT for prolapse symptoms and severity. The largest most rigorous trial to date suggests that six months of supervised PFMT has benefits in terms of anatomical and symptom improvement (if symptomatic) immediately post-intervention. Further evidence relating to effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of PFMT, of different intensities, for symptomatic prolapse in the medium and long term is needed. A large trial of PFMT supplementing surgery is needed to give clear evidence about the usefulness of combining these treatments. Other comparisons which have not been addressed in trials to date and warrant consideration include those involving lifestyle change interventions, and trials aimed at prolapse prevention.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Description of the condition</HEADING>
<P>Pelvic organ prolapse is common and is seen in 50% of parous women (<LINK REF="REF-Beck-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beck 1991</LINK>). One community survey found that 40% of the general female population aged 45 to 85 years had evidence of pelvic organ prolapse of at least POP-Q stage II (within 1 cm above or below the hymen) (<LINK REF="REF-Slieker_x002d_ten-Hove-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Slieker-ten Hove 2004</LINK>). Around 10% of women in the community undergo surgery at some time in their lives for the management of prolapse or urinary incontinence (<LINK REF="REF-Olsen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olsen 1997</LINK>). Pelvic organ prolapse includes anterior vaginal wall prolapse (urethrocele, cystocele), posterior vaginal wall prolapse (enterocele, rectocele) and prolapse of the apical segment of the vagina (cervix/cuff, uterine or vault prolapse) (<LINK REF="REF-Bump-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bump 1996</LINK>). A woman can present with prolapse of one or more of these compartments. A problematic issue in prolapse research to date is the different ways in which prolapse is defined. For example, prolapse may be identified based on anatomical measurements, presence of symptoms or the fact that prolapse surgery has been performed. This hampers comparisons across studies. Systems such as the POP-Q which provide a severity grading based on the anatomy of the vagina compared to nulliparous anatomy, do not take into account what is normal for multiparous women, nor do they consider whether symptoms are present.</P>
<P>The aetiology of pelvic organ prolapse is complex and multi-factorial. Risk factors include pregnancy, childbirth, congenital or acquired connective tissue abnormalities, denervation or weakness of the pelvic floor, ageing, menopause and factors associated with chronically raised intra-abdominal pressure (e.g. heavy lifting) (<LINK REF="REF-Bump-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bump 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gill-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gill 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MacLennan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacLennan 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Women with prolapse commonly have a variety of pelvic floor symptoms including pelvic heaviness; dragging sensation in the vagina; bulge, lump or protrusion coming down from the vagina; and backache. Bladder and bowel symptoms, and sexual dysfunction are also frequently present.</P>
<P>Choice of treatment for prolapse depends on the severity of prolapse and its symptoms, and the woman's general health and preference. Options available for treatment can be categorised as conservative, mechanical and surgical. Conservative or mechanical management is generally considered for women with a mild degree of prolapse, those who wish to have more children, and the frail or those unwilling to undergo surgery. Separate Cochrane reviews of surgical (<LINK REF="REF-Maher-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maher 2010</LINK>) and mechanical interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2004</LINK>), and the effects of oestrogen (<LINK REF="REF-Ismail-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ismail 2010</LINK>) have been undertaken.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Description of the intervention</HEADING>
<P>Conservative prevention or treatment of prolapse is defined here as physical or lifestyle interventions.</P>
<P>Physical interventions include pelvic floor muscle assessment, pelvic floor exercises and pelvic floor muscle bracing against increased intra-abdominal pressure (e.g. lifting, coughing). The term "pelvic floor muscle training" (PFMT) is used in this review to encompass these components of treatment which are normally used together. (For consistency, when describing studies, if authors have used the term "pelvic floor exercises" or "pelvic floor exercise programme" we have referred to pelvic floor muscle training instead.) PFMT involves the contraction of the pelvic floor muscles, to improve strength, endurance and timing of contractions and ultimately to better support the pelvic organs. Through assessment and prescription of daily exercises, women begin to lengthen contractions, increase repetitions and reduce rest periods. Electrical stimulation and biofeedback, which are often used as adjuncts to PFMT, are also included under the heading of physical interventions in this review.</P>
<P>Lifestyle interventions include weight loss, reducing exacerbating activities (e.g. lifting, coughing) and treating constipation.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">How the intervention might work</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Biological rationale for PFMT for POP</HEADING>
<P>The pelvic floor muscles play a critical role in giving structural support to the pelvic organs and pelvic openings (<LINK REF="REF-DeLancey-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeLancey 1993</LINK>).  Pelvic floor muscle activity adjusts to variations in posture and intra-abdominal pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Morgan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morgan 2005</LINK>). It is hypothesised that improving pelvic floor muscle function (strength, endurance and coordination) may improve this structural support for the pelvic organs.</P>
<P>There are two main hypotheses for PFMT being an effective treatment for POP. Firstly, intensive strength training for the pelvic floor muscles may build up pelvic structural support by increasing muscle volume and elevating the levator plate (pelvic floor muscles and pelvic organs) to a higher position inside the pelvis.  This increased strength may hypertrophy and improve stiffness of the pelvic floor muscles (<LINK REF="REF-Bo-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bo 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bo-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bo 2006</LINK>). The hypothesis of improving pelvic floor muscle strength is supported for treatment of urinary incontinence where the anatomical position of the pelvic floor muscles has been shown to be different in continent and incontinent women (<LINK REF="REF-Hoyte-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoyte 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peschers-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peschers 2001</LINK>) and increased urethral stability at rest and during effort following 14 weeks of supervised PFMT has been shown (<LINK REF="REF-Balmforth-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balmforth 2004</LINK>). DeLancey demonstrated that women with POP generated less vaginal closure force during a maximal voluntary contraction than controls (<LINK REF="REF-DeLancey-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeLancey 2007</LINK>). Improving pelvic floor muscle strength in women with POP may have an important role to play in the treatment of POP.</P>
<P>Secondly, an intentional, effective pelvic floor muscle contraction prior to and during effort (cough) has been shown to reduce leakage from stress urinary incontinence - the Knack (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1998</LINK>). Bladder neck descent has been shown to be significantly less when women were asked to contract the pelvic floor prior to a cough than when coughing without contraction (<LINK REF="REF-Peschers-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peschers 2001</LINK>). Thus the Knack/pelvic floor muscle pre-contraction has become a standard element of PFMT for urinary incontinence (<LINK REF="REF-Dumoulin-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dumoulin 2010</LINK>). There are no studies looking at the effectiveness of such a technique on the effect of POP. <LINK REF="REF-Carri_x00e8_re-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carrière 2006</LINK> recommends pre-contracting the pelvic floor muscles not only during a cough but for any daily task that results in increased intra-abdominal pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Carri_x00e8_re-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carrière 2006</LINK>). Activities involving raised intra-abdominal pressure (heavy lifting, chronic coughing) have been cited in the aetiology of POP (<LINK REF="REF-Gill-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gill 1998</LINK>) so it is logical to find a way to help women with POP to counteract intra-abdominal pressure increases. Thus, it is possible to apply this principle of the Knack or pre-contracting the pelvic floor muscles with any rise in intra-abdominal pressure to many activities such as coughing, sneezing and lifting to prevent descent of the bladder neck and possibly other pelvic organ structures for the treatment of POP.</P>
<P>The aims of PFMT for treating POP are, therefore, to improve pelvic floor muscle strength (to improve structural support to the pelvic organs), co-ordination and timing (to improve pelvic organ support during increases in intra abdominal pressure).</P>
<P>The aims of conservative treatment in the management of pelvic organ prolapse include:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to increase strength and endurance of the pelvic floor muscles to better support the pelvic organs;</LI>
<LI>to decrease the frequency or severity of symptoms associated with prolapse (vaginal, bladder, bowel and sexual symptoms, and backache);</LI>
<LI>to prevent the severity of the prolapse from becoming worse;</LI>
<LI>to avert or delay the need for surgery.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Why it is important to do this review</HEADING>
<P>Pelvic floor muscle training appears to be effective compared to no treatment or inactive control in the treatment of urinary stress, urge and mixed incontinence (<LINK REF="REF-Dumoulin-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dumoulin 2010</LINK>). However, its role in managing prolapse is not established (<LINK REF="REF-Poma-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poma 2000</LINK>). The extent to which any of the lifestyle interventions are effective in managing prolapse is also unknown (<LINK REF="REF-Bump-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bump 1998</LINK>). The importance of clarifying the place of conservative treatment in the prevention and management of prolapse, particularly in relation to the role of PFMT, has been highlighted (<LINK REF="REF-Thakar-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thakar 2002</LINK>).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Braekken-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Braekken 2010</LINK> undertook a trial where they randomised 109 women (59 intervention, 50 control), the results of which were reported in two articles. Women had stage I, II or III prolapse of any type (determined by POP-Q), and 63% were reporting symptoms of prolapse.  Randomisation was stated as stratified by severity of prolapse. The intervention group women were instructed in PFMT for six months (weekly physiotherapy appointments for three months then fortnightly visits) with home exercise (three sets of eight to 12 close to maximal contractions daily). Both groups were given lifestyle advice and taught "the Knack". Prolapse stage (POP-Q), prolapse, bladder and bowel symptoms, pelvic floor muscle manometry and ultrasound measurements were taken at six months (women in the control group were offered PFMT after this).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Frawley-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Frawley 2010</LINK> compared physiotherapist-led pre- and post-operative PFMT versus usual care in 58 women (30 intervention, 28 control) undergoing prolapse repair surgery, with or without hysterectomy. Intervention comprised one pre-operative PFMT instruction session, and seven post-operative appointments, and a final appointment at nine months post-operatively. Outcomes measured at four time points (pre-operatively prior to randomisation, and three, six and 12 months post-operatively) included urinary symptoms and associated impact (UDI-19, IIQ-7), 3-day bladder diary, 48-hour pad test, bowel symptoms, general exercise participation and blinded pelvic floor muscle strength (manometry and modified Oxford grading scale). No prolapse-specific outcomes were measured.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Ghroubi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ghroubi 2008</LINK> reported on a trial carried out in Tunisia which was published in French with an English abstract.  The translation of this paper proved difficult but there was a reasonable amount of information obtainable. The trial involved 47 women with stage I or II cystocele (with or without additional stage I rectocele), randomised to PFMT plus healthy living advice (n = 27) or a non treated group (n = 20). There was no description of the randomisation or blinding.  The intervention included 24 clinic-based sessions (containing pelvic floor exercises, electrical stimulation and digital biofeedback) and lifestyle advice.  Women were asked to perform 20 pelvic floor muscle contractions at home each day after the 10<SUP>th</SUP> session. Outcome measures included pelvic heaviness, urinary symptoms, pelvic floor muscle strength, quality of life, urodynamics and patient satisfaction.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Hagen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hagen 2009</LINK> described a feasibility study designed to inform the development of a larger multi-centre trial to assess the use of PFMT in the management of pelvic organ prolapse. The feasibility study included a small (n = 47: 23 intervention, 24 control) randomised controlled single blind trial. Women with stage I or II prolapse were eligible. The intervention group had 5 physiotherapy appointments over 16 weeks and were advised to do up to six sets of exercises daily, and the control group were sent a lifestyle advice leaflet only. Prolapse was assessed by vaginal examination (POP-Q) at baseline and at 20 weeks post-randomisation by a gynaecologist blinded to group allocation. A postal questionnaire, including assessment of prolapse, urinary, bowel and vaginal symptoms, prolapse-related quality or life and general health status, was completed by women at baseline, 20 and 26 week post-randomisation.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Jarvis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jarvis 2005</LINK> described a trial to assess the effectiveness of PFMT as an adjunct to surgery. Women who were booked to have surgery to correct pelvic organ prolapse and/or incontinence were randomised to an intervention (a pre-operative and two post-operative physiotherapy appointments) or a control group (no physiotherapy appointments). Intervention women were advised to do four sets of exercises per day. Sixty women were randomised (30 intervention, 30 control). Two of those women were not having surgery to correct prolapse. Outcome measures included urinary diaries and paper towel test (to measure volume of urine leakage), pelvic floor muscle strength (modified Oxford scale and manometry), bladder symptoms and continence-related quality of life. There were no prolapse-specific outcomes measured.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Piya_x002d_Anant-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Piya-Anant 2003</LINK> described a trial of PFMT, and advice on reducing constipation, in an elderly Thai population. All women over 60 years of age and living within 10 km of the hospital where the trial was conducted were originally assessed for the presence of anterior wall pelvic organ prolapse (the authors refer to this as "genital prolapse"). Clusters of women defined by post-code area were then randomised to an intervention (PFMT and advice to reduce constipation) or control group. There were 654 women included in this cluster randomised controlled trial. Follow-up was conducted at six, 12 and 24 months. Outcomes were assessed in terms of the success of the intervention in preventing the worsening of anterior wall prolapse. This was assessed via clinical examination using a non-standard method of assessment.</P>

<P>Overall the risk of bias from included studies was medium, and there was uncertainty about some sources of bias due to a lack of information being reported (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). Four of the six included trials were small, with less than 25 women randomised to each comparison arm (<LINK REF="STD-Frawley-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Frawley 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ghroubi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ghroubi 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hagen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hagen 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jarvis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jarvis 2005</LINK>). The remaining two trials had more than 50 women randomised per arm (<LINK REF="STD-Braekken-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Braekken 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Piya_x002d_Anant-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Piya-Anant 2003</LINK>), and the latter had a substantially larger sample size, in excess of 300 women per arm.</P>
<P>Risk of bias was judged to be low in four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Braekken-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Braekken 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Frawley-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Frawley 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hagen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hagen 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jarvis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jarvis 2005</LINK>) and uncertain or high in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Ghroubi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ghroubi 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Piya_x002d_Anant-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Piya-Anant 2003</LINK>) (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Random allocation and allocation concealment</HEADING>
<P>In three trials, random allocation was generated either by computer or random number tables and concealed in envelopes, either stored off site or distributed by someone other than the staff providing the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Braekken-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Braekken 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Frawley-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Frawley 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jarvis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jarvis 2005</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Hagen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hagen 2009</LINK> women were randomised using a telephone system which was accessed by researchers in the study office who notified the participant of her group allocation by letter. Two trials gave no detail of the randomisation method (<LINK REF="STD-Ghroubi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ghroubi 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Piya_x002d_Anant-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Piya-Anant 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two trials reported differences between randomised groups in baseline demographic variables or outcome measures (<LINK REF="STD-Braekken-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Braekken 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Frawley-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Frawley 2010</LINK>), suggesting the random allocation process had not been successful in producing similar groups. In addition, the numbers randomised to the two arms differed somewhat in <LINK REF="STD-Braekken-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Braekken 2010</LINK> (59 intervention versus 50 control) and <LINK REF="STD-Ghroubi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ghroubi 2008</LINK> (27 intervention versus 20 control). <LINK REF="STD-Braekken-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Braekken 2010</LINK> also described randomising women within strata defined according to whether they had prolapse beyond the hymen or not. However of the 40 women with prolapse beyond the hymen 25 were randomised to intervention and 15 to control suggesting there had been no stratification.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Blinding during treatment and at outcome assessment</HEADING>
<P>In general women and their treating clinician could not be blinded to women's group allocation as they were required to participate in or deliver the PFMT. Blinding of outcome assessment was attempted where possible in five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Braekken-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Braekken 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Frawley-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Frawley 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hagen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hagen 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jarvis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jarvis 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Piya_x002d_Anant-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Piya-Anant 2003</LINK>), although the methods of blinding were not always described. One trial did not describe any blinding (<LINK REF="STD-Ghroubi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ghroubi 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Pelvic floor ultrasounds were taken and assessed blinded to women&#8217;s group in the <LINK REF="STD-Braekken-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Braekken 2010</LINK> trial, but pelvic floor assessments were not blinded. In <LINK REF="STD-Frawley-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Frawley 2010</LINK>, assessment of the pelvic floor was undertaken by a physiotherapist blind to group allocation, although the method of blinding was not stated; the operating surgeon was not blinded. In <LINK REF="STD-Hagen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hagen 2009</LINK>, at follow-up, prolapse severity (POP-Q) was assessed by the woman's gynaecologist who was blind to the group allocation of the woman. Blinding was achieved by reminding the woman and the gynaecologist prior to assessment not to discuss group allocation, and providing a chaperone at the examination to enforce this. In <LINK REF="STD-Jarvis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jarvis 2005</LINK> it was stated that assessment of the women at follow-up, both pelvic floor muscle assessment and paper towel test, was blind to their group allocation, although no detail was given. <LINK REF="STD-Piya_x002d_Anant-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Piya-Anant 2003</LINK> stated that the assessor was blinded both to the previous assessment results of the participant and to their group status, however the method of blinding was not reported.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Description of dropout and withdrawal</HEADING>
<P>In four out of six trials the dropouts and withdrawals were adequately reported (<LINK REF="STD-Braekken-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Braekken 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Frawley-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Frawley 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hagen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hagen 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jarvis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jarvis 2005</LINK>).

A very low dropout rate of 2% was reported in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Braekken-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Braekken 2010</LINK>). In other trials (where dropouts were adequately reported) the range was between 10% (<LINK REF="STD-Jarvis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jarvis 2005</LINK>) and 15% (<LINK REF="STD-Hagen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hagen 2009</LINK>).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Braekken-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Braekken 2010</LINK> reported that fewer women in the PFMT group than the control group had no improvement in POP-Q stage (81% versus 92%). They reported no significant difference in the subgroup of women with prolapse beyond the hymen (80% versus 80%). <LINK REF="STD-Hagen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hagen 2009</LINK> found the percentage of women who had no improvement in their POP-Q stage from baseline to 20 weeks was significantly less in the intervention group (55%) than in the control group (100%). The pooled risk ratio of 0.83, (95% CI 0.71 to 0.96, <LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>) indicates that PFMT decreases the risk of no improvement (or increases the risk of improvement) in prolapse stage by 17% compared to no PFMT.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Hagen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hagen 2009</LINK> also reported on the change in individual POP-Q measurements and found that change in point Ba (most distal position of the upper anterior vaginal wall) for the intervention group (-1.09 cm SD 1.22) indicated significantly more improvement than for the control group (0.56 cm SD 1.01) (MD -1.65, 95% CI -2.63 to -0.67 <LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>.2).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Piya_x002d_Anant-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Piya-Anant 2003</LINK> reported at six, 12 and 24 months the percentage of women with worse prolapse compared to baseline in both the intervention and control groups (results were only presented graphically with P values). Results were presented separately for those women who initially had mild prolapse and those who initially had severe prolapse. For the mild group there was a significant difference between intervention and control group at 12 months only; in the severe group there was a significant difference between intervention and control group at 24 months only (28% versus 72% had worse prolapse).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Braekken-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Braekken 2010</LINK> also used ultrasound to measure the position of the bladder and rectum within the pelvis, and the dimensions of the muscles and hiatal area, to indicate the severity of prolapse. They found the change in resting position in standing of the bladder and rectum, compared to baseline, were significantly greater (both were higher) in the intervention group than the control group; and changes in measures of the muscles and hiatal area were also significantly in favour of the intervention group.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-11-09 23:07:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is the second update of this review, which considers whether conservative interventions are effective for the management of pelvic organ prolapse. The scope of the review has now been broadened to include prevention trials. Reviews relating to other forms of treatment for prolapse also exist and are covered in other Cochrane reviews: surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Maher-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maher 2010</LINK>), mechanical devices (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2004</LINK>) and oestrogen (<LINK REF="REF-Ismail-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ismail 2010</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Summary of the results</HEADING>
<P>Six trials of relevance to this review were identified; three of these are new to this update. The trials relate to either PFMT as a treatment for prolapse (<LINK REF="STD-Braekken-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Braekken 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ghroubi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ghroubi 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hagen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hagen 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Piya_x002d_Anant-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Piya-Anant 2003</LINK>), or a treatment adjunct (<LINK REF="STD-Frawley-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Frawley 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jarvis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jarvis 2005</LINK>) for prolapse. The results of two large ongoing treatment trials (<LINK REF="STD-Hagen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hagen 2010</LINK> (ISRCTN 35911035), <LINK REF="STD-Barber-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Barber 2009</LINK>) are awaited which will add significantly to future updates of this review. No trials were found of lifestyle interventions. No prevention trials were found either although a trial of PFMT for the prevention of prolapse is ongoing (<LINK REF="STD-Hagen-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hagen 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was limited data which could be pooled across studies, therefore synthesis was mainly of a qualitative nature for most outcomes.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Physical interventions versus control/waiting list/no active treatment (four trials)</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Primary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Prolapse symptoms were significantly improved in three out of three trials that measured this (<LINK REF="STD-Braekken-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Braekken 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ghroubi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ghroubi 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hagen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hagen 2009</LINK>). There was evidence from each trial separately that prolapse symptoms improved as a result of PFMT. The largest of these trials (<LINK REF="STD-Braekken-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Braekken 2010</LINK>) found in the intervention group significantly more improvement in prolapse symptom frequency and bother in a subgroup analysis of symptomatic women.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Secondary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Prolapse severity was reported to be significantly improved in three out of three trials that measured this (<LINK REF="STD-Braekken-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Braekken 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hagen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hagen 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Piya_x002d_Anant-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Piya-Anant 2003</LINK>). Two trials measured severity using the POP-Q system, allowing results to be pooled. The pooled risk ratio of 0.83 indicated that having PFMT increased the chance of improvement in prolapse stage by 17% compared to no PFMT.</P>
<P>Unfortunately the largest of these three included trials, which considered the effect of PFMT in preventing anterior prolapse from worsening, had serious limitations which affected the generalisability and rigor of the findings (<LINK REF="STD-Piya_x002d_Anant-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Piya-Anant 2003</LINK>). Prolapse severity was measured using a non-standardised methods; denominators and numerators were not clearly reported and analyses did not take into account clustering effects. For these reasons, the authors' conclusion that the pelvic floor muscle programme was effective in preventing worsening of severe prolapse should be treated cautiously.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Other outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Pelvic floor muscle strength was measured in two trials and results favoured the intervention groups. However in one trial the measurement was not blinded (<LINK REF="STD-Braekken-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Braekken 2010</LINK>) and in the other there was no information on blinding so it is suspected measurement was unblinded also (<LINK REF="STD-Ghroubi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ghroubi 2008</LINK>). Urinary outcomes were considered in three trials. <LINK REF="STD-Braekken-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Braekken 2010</LINK> found better urinary outcomes, both in terms of prevalence of symptom improvement and symptom summary score, in the PFMT compared to the control group. Urodynamic and symptom prevalence outcomes were more favourable in the PFMT group than the control group in <LINK REF="STD-Ghroubi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ghroubi 2008</LINK>, although these measures may not have been blinded. <LINK REF="STD-Hagen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hagen 2009</LINK> however found no difference between groups in urinary symptom score in their small feasibility trial. <LINK REF="STD-Braekken-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Braekken 2010</LINK> reported that the frequency and bother associated with bowel problems (loose faecal and flatus incontinence) was less in the group receiving PFMT.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Physical and/or lifestyle interventions supplementing surgery versus surgery alone (two trials)</HEADING>
<P>There was no prolapse-specific data available from either trial. Both trials reported on pelvic floor muscle strength and urinary outcomes but findings were contradictory. <LINK REF="STD-Frawley-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Frawley 2010</LINK> had a more intensive intervention yet found little difference between groups on either type of outcome, whilst <LINK REF="STD-Jarvis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jarvis 2005</LINK> found significant benefit of PFMT for both.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Overall completeness and applicability of evidence</HEADING>
<P>There is still relatively little evidence from large, well-conducted trials to inform this review, and a lack of data on long-term outcomes. Only one comparison (<B>Physical interventions versus control/waiting list/no active treatment) </B>had sufficient, high quality data to allow any conclusions to be drawn. A limited amount of pooling of results across trials was possible due to different measures being used by different research teams.</P>

<P>There are now some rigorous trial findings to support the use of PFMT as a treatment for women with prolapse, however the evidence remains limited. There was insufficient evidence about other interventions or combinations of interventions to inform practice.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-11-08 10:59:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There remains a need for more trials of PFMT, with longer follow-up and different intensities of intervention. These might also explore the effects of electrical stimulation and biofeedback as these have not been formally included in trials to date. No trials of lifestyle changes (either on their own or in combination with other treatments) were found. Generally lifestyle advice is often given alongside PFMT, and <LINK REF="STD-Piya_x002d_Anant-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Piya-Anant 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hagen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hagen 2009</LINK> reported an element of lifestyle advice within their interventions, although the main focus of these trials was PFMT. A trial that looks at the effects of, for example, weight loss or reducing constipation, specifically in women with prolapse, may be beneficial. A large trial of PFMT as an adjunct to prolapse surgery is still required, with prolapse-specific outcomes, to assess any added benefit of PFMT alongside prolapse surgery. A 2 x 2 factorial trial of two types of surgery for apical prolapse with or without PFMT is underway, due to complete in 2012 (<LINK REF="STD-Barber-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Barber 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Standardisation of the use of validated outcome measures, both anatomical and symptom-based, is needed to ensure data from future prolapse trials are relevant and have the potential for appropriate data pooling.</P>

<B>Treatment arms:</B> 2 groups, PFMT and control</P>
<P>
<B>Randomisation</B>: a statistician generated and stored the allocation envelopes. Immediately after a woman's initial gynaecologist examination the 1st author gave the next numbered envelope to the woman at the University hospital. The woman opened the opaque sealed envelope herself. Random permuted blocks were not used which resulted in unequal group sizes. There was a significant difference at baseline between the randomised groups in the prevalence of prolapse symptoms (43/59 PFMT group, 26/50 control group).</P>
<P>
<B>Stratification</B>: States 2 strata, maximum descent at or above the hymen, below the hymen. However when analyses were reported the number of women was not equal within the "below the hymen" strata: 25 intervention, 15 control. This suggests women were not randomised within strata.</P>
<P>
<B>Blinding</B>: the ultrasound films were assessed by an assessor blind to the women's group, clinical and background information. POP-Q assessment was also blinded in this way. Pelvic floor assessment was not blinded: carried out by the 1st author who was also involved in delivering the intervention.</P>
<P>
<B>Power calculation</B>: sample size based on effect size of 0.6 (from study of PFMT for stress urinary incontinence), alpha=0.5, power 80%. Suggested 45 women per group was needed.</P>
<P>
<B>Intention to treat analysis:</B> was performed.  Did not perform &#8220;per protocol&#8221; analysis as there were very few drop-outs. Baseline values carried forward for 2 women who dropped out.</P>

<B>Stratification: </B>No stratification was used.</P>
<P>
<B>Treatment arms: </B>Comparisons: The trial had 2 arms: 1) physiotherapy-supervised PFMT intervention (treatment appointment pre-operatively (n = 1) and post-operatively (n = 7)) 2) usual care provided by the surgeon.</P>
<P>
<B>Blinding: </B>It was not possible to blind patient to group allocation.  The surgeon performing the woman's operation was not blinded.  Assessment of the pelvic floor was undertaken by physiotherapist (first author) blind to the woman's group. Not stated how the assessor remained blinded. The first author also undertook the analysis and was unblinded at that stage. Treatment physiotherapist delivering the intervention was not blinded.</P>
<P>
<B>Power calculation</B>: Sample size calculation was based on published prevalence relating to overactive bladder. To detect a 20% difference between groups with 80% power at 5% level of significance, 22 women per group were needed. A target of 58 in total was set to allow for drop-outs.</P>

The width of the genital hiatus decreased (from 4.12 ± 0.27 to 3.78 ± 0.30 cm). The separate effects of pelvic floor exercises and Kolpexin could not be elucidated.</P>
