<TITLE MODIFIED="2011-01-04 11:11:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">Oral naltrexone as maintenance treatment to prevent relapse in opioid addicts who have undergone detoxification</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-01-10 01:50:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Opioid dependence is considered to be a lifelong, chronic relapsing disorder. Substantial therapeutic efforts are needed to keep people drug free. Methadone treatment plays a vital role in detoxification or maintenance programs but some individuals who are on methadone continue to use illicit drugs, commit crime and engage in behaviours that promote the spread of communicable diseases. Naltrexone is a long acting opioid antagonist that does not produce euphoria and is not addicting. It is used in accidental heroin overdose and for the treatment of people who have opioid dependence. Naltrexone is particularly suitable to prevent a relapse to opioid use after heroin detoxification for those for whom failure to comply with treatment has major consequences, for example health professionals, business executives and individuals under legal supervision. Medication compliance and retention rates with naltrexone treatment are however low.<BR/>In this review of the medical literature oral naltrexone, with or without psychotherapy, was no better than placebo or no pharmacological treatments with regard to retention in treatment, use of the primary substance of abuse or side effects. The only outcome that was clearly in favour of naltrexone was a reduction of re incarcerations by about a half but these results were from only two studies. In single studies naltrexone was not superior to benzodiazepines or buprenorphine for retention, abstinence or side effects. The review authors identified a total of 13 randomised controlled studies that involved 1158 opioid addicts treated as outpatients following detoxification. Less than a third of participants were retained in treatment over the duration of the included studies. The mean duration was six months (range one to 10 months). None of included studies considered deaths from fatal overdoses in people treated with naltrexone.<BR/>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-02-28 12:09:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<P>Research on clinical application of oral naltrexone agrees on several things. From a pharmacological perspective, naltrexone works. From an applied perspective, the medication compliance and the retention rates are poor.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate the effects of naltrexone maintenance treatment versus placebo or other treatments in preventing relapse in opioid addicts after detoxification. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2011-02-28 12:10:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<P>We searched: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL - <I>The Cochrane Library</I> issue 6 2010), PubMed (1973- June 2010), CINAHL (1982- June 2010). We inspected reference lists of relevant articles and contacted pharmaceutical producers of naltrexone, authors and other Cochrane review groups.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2011-02-28 12:10:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<P>All randomised controlled clinical trials which focus on the use of naltrexone maintenance treatment versus placebo, or other treatments to reach sustained abstinence from opiate drugs</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Three reviewers independently assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data. One reviewer carried out the qualitative assessments of the methodology of eligible studies using validated checklists. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-02-28 12:07:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<P>Thirteen studies, 1158 participants, met the criteria for inclusion in this review.</P>
<P>Comparing naltrexone versus placebo or no pharmacological treatments, no statistically significant difference were noted for all the primary outcomes considered. The only outcome statistically significant in favour of naltrexone is re incarceration, RR 0.47 (95%CI 0.26-0.84), but results come only from two studies. Considering only studies were patients were forced to adherence a statistical significant difference in favour of naltrexone was found for retention and abstinence, RR 2.93 (95%CI 1.66-5.18).</P>
<P>Comparing naltrexone versus psychotherapy, in the two considered outcomes, no statistically significant difference was found in the single study considered.</P>
<P>Naltrexone was not superior to benzodiazepines and to buprenorphine for retention and abstinence and side effects. Results come from single studies.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-01-10 01:47:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The findings of this review suggest that oral naltrexone did not perform better than treatment with placebo or no pharmacological agent with respect to the number of participants re-incarcerated during the study period. If oral naltrexone is compared with other pharmacological treatments such as benzodiazepine and buprenorphine, no statistically significant difference was found. The percentage of people retained in treatment in the included studies is however low (28%). The conclusion of this review is that the studies conducted have not allowed an adequate evaluation of oral naltrexone treatment in the field of opioid dependence. Consequently, maintenance therapy with naltrexone cannot yet be considered a treatment which has been scientifically proved to be superior to other kinds of treatment.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-01-04 11:28:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<P>Opioid dependence is considered a chronic lifelong relapsing disorder, which requires substantial therapeutic efforts to keep patients drug free (<LINK REF="REF-Mc-Lellan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mc Lellan 2000</LINK>). Estimates of the prevalence of problem opioid use in European countries during the period 2002&#8211;07 range roughly between one and six cases per 1 000 population aged 15&#8211;64; overall prevalence of problem drug use is estimated to range from under three cases to 10 cases per 1 000. The average prevalence of problem opioid use in the countries providing data is estimated to be between 3.6 and 4.6 cases per 1 000 of the population aged 15&#8211;64. Assuming that this reflects the EU as a whole, it implies some 1.4 million (1.2&#8211;1.5 million) problem opioid users in the EU and Norway in 2007 (<LINK REF="REF-EMCDDA-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMCDDA 2009</LINK>). In Australia the prevalence of heroin users in years 2007-2008 has been estimated of 1.6 per 1000 (<LINK REF="REF-AIHW-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">AIHW 2009</LINK>). In US, of the 7.0 million persons aged 12 or older classified with dependence on or abuse of illicit drugs in 2008, 1.7 million persons were classified with dependence on or abuse of opioid (<LINK REF="REF-SAMHSA-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">SAMHSA 2009</LINK>).<BR/>The introduction of methadone in the 1960's dramatically changed the course of opiate dependence treatment. The rationale of this treatment (aimed at detoxification or at maintenance) is simple and the research evidence to support the value of methadone is overwhelming. Reviews confirms that methadone treatment plays a vitally important role in reducing morbidity and mortality associated with heroin use (<LINK REF="REF-Amato-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amato 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clark-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Faggiano-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faggiano 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mattick-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mattick 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mattick-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mattick 2009</LINK>)<BR/>Although methadone produces the cited benefits, it is far from being a perfect medication. It is true that some individuals being treated with methadone continue to use illicit drugs, commit crime and engage in behaviours that promote the spread of communicable diseases (<LINK REF="REF-Rawson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rawson 2000</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-10-01 09:49:49 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<P>Naltrexone is a long-acting, non-selective opioid-antagonist with highest affinity to mu-opioid receptors (<LINK REF="REF-Preston-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Preston 1993</LINK>), used for the treatment of opioid dependence to prevent a relapse to opioid use after heroin detoxification and to treat accidental heroin overdose. During the 1970's it was hoped that naltrexone would be widely used as a heroin addiction treatment since it is non-addicting and produce no euphoria. It is a pure mu opioid receptor antagonist that provides a complete 24 to 72 hour (depending on dose) blockade of all opiate effects (<LINK REF="REF-Rawson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rawson 2000</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-10-01 09:53:06 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<P>Oral naltrexone is approved for relapse prevention of alcohol and opioid dependence in several countries. A daily ingested dose of 50 mg sufficiently blocks the effect of opioids to prevent relapse.The clinical research and the clinical application of naltrexone over the past two decades have had consistent findings. From a pharmacological perspective, the naltrexone has good pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties. <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Connor-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Connor 2000</LINK> stated that naltrexone has low retention rates and no efficacy on reducing opioid use compared with placebo. <LINK REF="REF-Ward-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ward 1999</LINK> concluded that naltrexone has only been effective in opioid dependence for whom failure to comply with treatment has major consequences. Although there are selected patient groups who may be good candidates for naltrexone treatment e.g. health professionals (<LINK REF="REF-Ling-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ling 1984</LINK>), business executives (<LINK REF="REF-Washton-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Washton 1984</LINK>) and individuals under legal supervision (<LINK REF="REF-Brahen-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brahen 1984</LINK>), in general the compliance rates with naltrexone treatment are very poor.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2011-01-10 01:51:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The risk of bias assessment  for RCTs and CCTs in this review were performed using the 5 criteria recommended by the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). The recommended approach for assessing risk of bias in studies included in Cochrane Review is a two-part tool, addressing five specific domains (namely sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, and other issues). The first part of the tool involves describing what was reported to have happened in the study. The second part of the tool involves assigning a judgement relating to the risk of bias for that entry. This is achieved by answering a pre-specified question about the adequacy of the study in relation to the entry, such that a judgement of "Yes" indicates low risk of bias, "No" indicates high risk of bias, and "Unclear" indicates unclear or unknown risk of bias. To make these judgments we used the criteria indicated by the handbook adapted to  the addiction field. See <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK> for details.</P>
<P>The domains of sequence generation and  allocation concealment (avoidance of selection bias) were addressed in the tool by a single entry for each study.</P>
<P>Blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessor (avoidance of performance bias and detection bias) were considered separately for objective outcomes (e.g. drop out, use of substance of abuse measured by urine-analysis, subjects relapsed at the end of follow up, subjects engaged in further treatments) and subjective outcomes (e.g. duration and severity of signs and symptoms of withdrawal, patient self-reported use of substance, side effects, social functioning as integration at school or at work, family relationship, ).</P>
<P>Incomplete outcome data (avoidance of attrition bias) were considered for all outcomes except for the drop out from the treatment, which is very often the primary outcome measure in trials on addiction. It was assessed separately for results at the end of the study period and for results at follow up.</P>
</QUALITY_ASSESSMENT>
<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2010-07-08 09:25:46 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Dichotomous outcomes were analysed by calculating the relative risk (RR) for each trial, with the uncertainty in each result expressed with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Continuous outcomes were analysed by calculating the weighted mean difference (MD) or the standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95%CI. For outcomes assessed by scales we compared and pool the mean score differences from the end of treatment to baseline (post minus pre) in the experimental and control group. In case of missing data about the standard deviation of the change we imputed this measure using the standard deviation at the end of treatment for each group.</P>
</EFFECT_MEASURES>
<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2010-07-08 09:26:09 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We didn't use data presented as number of positive urine tests over total number of tests in the experimental and control group as a measure of substance abuse. This is because using the number of tests instead of the number of participants as the unit of analysis violates the hypothesis of independence among observations. In fact, the results of tests done in each participant are not independent.</P>
<P>If all arms in a multi-arm trial are to be included in the meta-analysis and one treatment arm is to be included in more than one of the treatment comparisons, then we divided the number of events and the number of participants in that arm by the number of treatment comparisons made. This method avoid the multiple use of participants in the pooled estimate of treatment effect while retaining information from each arm of the trial. It compromises the precision of the pooled estimate slightly.</P>

<P>The main problem associated with oral naltrexone was the high drop out rate: 72% in our included studies; to overcome this problem the sustained released naltrexone has been proposed and is currently being assessed. However, a parallel Cochrane review on sustained released naltrexone (<LINK REF="REF-Lobmaier-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lobmaier 2008</LINK>) concluded that there is insufficient evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of sustained-release naltrexone for treatment of opioid dependence.</P>
<P>A concern about lack of information on mortality data, limit the applicability of the produced evidence due the relevant problem of fatal overdoses in naltrexone treated patients.<BR/>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2010-12-29 09:57:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The majority of the studies where not of high quality. Only two studies reported information about sequence generation and only three about allocation concealment. Eight out of thirteen studies were double blind, the other were open trial. Nevertheless we think that this did not introduce bias in the main outcomes addressed in this review, because the retention in treatment is an objective measure and abstinence is assessed by urine analysis in all trials . Incomplete outcome data was addressed correctly in the majority of the studies and in any case it does not introduce bias for the outcome retention and retention and abstinence which are the main outcomes on which the review is focused.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-01-10 02:03:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The findings of this review suggest that oral naltrexone did not performed better than treatment with placebo or no pharmacological treatments a part from the number of participants re-incarcerated during the study period. If oral naltrexone is compared with other pharmacological treatments such as benzodiazepine and buprenorphine, no statistically significant difference was found. The percentage of people retained in treatment in the include studies was low (28%).</P>
<P>The conclusion of this review is that the studies conducted to date have not allowed an adequate evaluation of oral naltrexone treatment in the field of opioid dependence. Consequently, maintenance therapy with naltrexone cannot yet be considered a treatment which has been scientifically proved to be superior to other kinds of treatment.</P>
<P>Naltrexone may be an efficacious adjuvant in therapy, especially for participants who fear severe consequences if they do not stop taking opioids . This target group consists of health-care professionals, who might lose their job or parolees who risk re-incarceration. Other highly motivated addicts may profit from naltrexone treatment. However further studies are required to confirm this impression. As described before, some circumstances may increase the probability of a positive outcome of naltrexone treatment, such as stable social contacts (spouse, family, friends), occupation, a confidential relationship with the therapist and clear instructions on the treatment itself, with participants giving their informed consent. Certainly, these conditions favour positive results in the therapy of drug addicts generally, not only in the case of naltrexone (<LINK REF="STD-Grey-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Grey 1986</LINK>) showed family support to be of significant benefit in the methadone group.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-10-01 13:47:55 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<P>RCTs evaluating effectiveness for treatment of opioid dependence should compare oral naltrexone to sustained-release naltrexone or agonist replacement treatment with methadone or buprenorphine. Besides effectiveness, any research on naltrexone should also focus on mortality and other safety outcomes to make an analysis of harm-benefit possible.</P>
