<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-09-16 12:31:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Paracervical block involves injection of local anaesthetic around the cervix to numb nearby nerves. Cervical dilatation and uterine interventions (such as hysteroscopy, endometrial biopsies, fractional curettage, and suction terminations) can be performed without any analgesia or anaesthesia; with regional anaesthetic injections as with paracervical block; using oral or intravenous analgesics and sedatives; or under general anaesthesia. Many gynaecologists use paracervical block for uterine intervention but it is unclear how effective and safe this method is. We included nine new studies in this updated review with a total of 26 studies involving 2790 women undergoing uterine interventions. The women were randomly allocated to paracervical block or an alternative. We found that, statistically, women had significantly less pain during cervical dilatation and uterine intervention with paracervical block than with placebo injection (saline or water) but clinically this difference may be unimportant. Paracervical block had no effect in five uncontrolled studies. There was no evidence that paracervical block reduced pain compared to alternative regional anaesthetic methods or systemic analgesics and sedatives. There was little information on important side effects. After updating, this review found that no local anaesthetic technique prevented pain as well as one would expect from general anaesthesia.</P>

<P>This updated review includes nine new studies, in total 26 studies with 28 comparisons and involving 2790 participants. No study of local paracervical versus general anaesthesia met our criteria. Ten studies compared local anaesthetic versus placebo. Paracervical local anaesthetic (PLA) reduced pain on cervical dilatation with a standardized mean difference (SMD) of 0.37 (95% CI 0.17 to 0.58) and a relative risk (RR) of severe pain of 0.16 (95% CI 0.06 to 0.74). PLA also reduced abdominal pain during, but not after, uterine intervention (SMD 0.74, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.19); there was no evidence of any effect on postoperative back or shoulder pain. Comparisons against no treatment did not demonstrate any effect of PLA. Five studies compared paracervical block with uterosacral block, intracervical block, or intrauterine topical anaesthesia. Two of these studies showed no significant difference in pain during the procedure. Compared to intrauterine instillation, PLA slightly reduced severe pain (from 8.3 to 7.6 on a 10-point scale), which may be negligible. Six studies compared PLA with sedation. There were no statistically significant differences in pain during or after the procedure, postoperative analgesia requirement, adverse effects, patient satisfaction, and the operator's perception of analgesia. We performed risk of bias assessment using six domains and found that more than half of the included studies had low risk of bias.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-09-16 12:26:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found that no technique provided reliable pain control in the 26 included studies. Some studies reported that women experienced severe pain (mean scores of 7 to 9 out of 10) during uterine intervention, irrespective of the analgesic technique used. We concluded that the available evidence fails to show whether paracervical block is inferior, equivalent, or superior to alternative analgesic techniques in terms of efficacy and safety for women undergoing cervical dilatation and uterine interventions. We suggest that woman are likely to consider the rates and severity of pain during uterine interventions when performed awake to be unacceptable in the absence of neuraxial blockade, which are unaltered by paracervical block.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-09-16 12:33:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Indications for cervical dilatation and uterine intervention include abnormal uterine bleeding that does not respond to medical treatment, postmenopausal bleeding, and abortion. General anaesthesia provides adequate operating conditions for cervical dilatation and uterine intervention. However, there are some situations where general anaesthesia is hazardous, for example when patients are frail, unwell, or when no anaesthesiologist is available. The choice of anaesthesia and analgesia is dependent on effectiveness, cost, safety, and side effects. Other factors are the patient's and physician's preferences. Paracervical local anaesthesia offers an alternative for cervical dilatation and uterine intervention as it does not require general anaesthetic equipment or personnel trained to give general anaesthesia.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-09-16 12:38:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Paracervical block has been performed since 1925 (<LINK REF="REF-Aimakhu-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aimakhu 1972</LINK>). Injection of local anaesthetic around the cervix, at the 'three and nine o'clock positions', anaesthetizes the second to fourth sacral nerve roots as they pass through Frankenhäuser's plexus at a depth of 2 to 4 mm (<LINK REF="REF-Piyamongkol-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Piyamongkol 1998</LINK>). Physical pain originates from the S2 to S4 parasympathetic &#64257;bres (the Frankenhäuser plexus) that innervate the cervix and the lower part of the uterine body (<LINK REF="REF-Scott-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1991</LINK>). The uterine fundus and lower part of the uterine body are innervated by sympathetic &#64257;bres from T10 to L1 via the inferior hypogastric nerve and the ovarian plexus (<LINK REF="REF-Maltzer-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maltzer 1999</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-09-16 12:41:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Most gynaecologic procedures cause pain or discomfort, especially on cervical dilatation. The pain is transmitted by sensory and sympathetic pathways to the lateral spinothalamic tracts of the spinal cord. Paracervical anaesthetics block transmission of pain through sympathetic, parasympathetic and sensory fibres before they enter the uterus at the level of the internal os (<LINK REF="STD-Chanrachakul-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Chanrachakul 2001</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-09-16 12:42:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Many gynaecologists inject paracervical local anaesthetic before cervical dilatation and uterine intervention, but its effectiveness is unclear. The effectiveness of paracervical blockade may be affected by the anatomical and physiological changes that accompany pregnancy and the menopause. We compared the effectiveness and safety of paracervical blockade before cervical dilatation and uterine interventions versus no treatment, placebo, other methods of regional anaesthesia, sedation and systemic analgesia, and general anaesthesia.</P>

Two authors (TT and US) independently evaluated the eligibility of studies from their title, abstract, and the full paper. We analysed the results of the randomized controlled studies that we had selected and graded their methodological quality by using the GradeProfiler programme version 3.2.2 and through construction of the risk of bias tables for the following items: random sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding of the intervention administered; incomplete data; selective reporting; and other bias. We used the GradeProfiler programme version 3.2.2 to grade the quality of the relevant articles in terms of their: limitation of design; inconsistency; indirectness; imprecision; and publication bias. The quality of evidence across studies for the outcome was graded into four levels: high; moderate; low; and very low. We resolved any disagreements through discussion.

<P>Where appropriate, we analysed pooled data using <LINK REF="REF-RevMan-5.1" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 5.1</LINK>. The method of meta-analysis was dependent on the nature of the outcomes. For categorical data (for example the proportion of participants with an event) we related the number reporting an event to the number at risk in each group to derive a relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). We pooled continuous differences between groups in the meta-analysis (for example pain relief on a visual analogue scale (VAS)) as mean differences (MD) or standardized mean differences (SMD), as appropriate, with their 95% CIs. In the case of various units of pain score measurements among studies, we used SMD for analysis. We used a fixed-effect model unless significant heterogeneity was encountered, in which case we used a random-effects model.</P>

Ten included studies, with 984 women, compared paracervical block with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Amirian-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Amirian 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chanrachakul-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Chanrachakul 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chatfield-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Chatfield 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chudnoff-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Chudnoff 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cicinelli-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Cicinelli 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Egziabher-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Egziabher 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glantz-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Glantz 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lau-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lau 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Titapant-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Titapant 2003</LINK>).

In conclusion, half of the included studies had adequate quality in terms of randomised allocation concealment and blinding.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-09-17 06:35:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All of the techniques used in the 26 included studies failed to reliably prevent pain in conscious women having uterine interventions. The available evidence does not show if paracervical block is inferior, equivalent, or superior to the alternative analgesic techniques, either in terms of efficacy or safety. Some women are likely to experience severe pain if they undergo uterine interventions with paracervical blockade, or one of the other conscious methods assessed in this review. Either general anaesthesia or neuraxial blockade is probably necessary to avoid severe pain during uterine intervention. Clinicians should stop using paracervical block as a method of pain control.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-09-17 06:37:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our systematic review showed that pain experienced by women having uterine interventions is inadequately controlled by paracervical block. The findings of the 26 included studies suggest that the other methods that were compared with paracervical block (local anaesthetic methods, sedation and systemic analgesics) also inadequately control the pain. Researchers should conduct systematic reviews of these other methods to confirm or refute this finding. Should they do so, potential participants in trials should be informed of the results of this systematic review, which should also inform the design of any future randomized controlled trials.</P>
