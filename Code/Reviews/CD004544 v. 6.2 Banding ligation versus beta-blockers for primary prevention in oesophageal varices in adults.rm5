<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-06-18 11:53:16 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Non-selective beta-blockers are used as a first-line treatment for primary prevention in patients with medium- to high-risk oesophageal varices. However, the effect of non-selective beta-blockers on mortality is debated and many patients experience adverse events. This review includes 19 randomised trials on banding ligation versus beta-blockers for patients with high-risk oesophageal varices and no history of bleeding. Bias control was unclear in most trials. There was no difference in mortality among the patients randomised to banding ligation compared with beta-blockers. The trials with adequate bias control based on the assessment of randomisation methods found no difference in bleeding rates. The trials with unclear randomisation methods found that banding ligation reduced bleeding. The effect of banding ligation was associated with the duration of follow-up and publication status of the trials. The results of trials with less than 20 months of follow-up found a better effect of banding ligation compared to trials with longer follow-up. Trials published in abstract form were more positive towards the effect of banding ligation than trials published as full paper articles. The combined evidence suggests that banding ligation and beta-blockers may be used as primary prophylaxis in oesophageal varices in adult patients. Additional evidence from trials with adequate bias control and sufficient follow-up is still needed to determine long-term effects.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-06-18 11:48:43 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nineteen randomised trials on banding ligation versus non-selective beta-blockers for primary prevention in oesophageal varices were included. Most trials specified that only patients with large or high-risk oesophageal varices were included. Bias control was unclear in most trials. In total, 176 of 731 (24%) of the patients randomised to banding ligation and 177 of 773 (23%) of patients randomised to non-selective beta-blockers died. The difference was not statistically significant in a random-effects meta-analysis (RR 1.09; 95% CI 0.92 to 1.30; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%). There was no evidence of bias or small study effects in regression analysis (Egger's test P = 0.997). Trial sequential analysis showed that the heterogeneity-adjusted low-bias trial relative risk estimate required an information size of 3211 patients, that none of the interventions showed superiority, and that the limits of futility have not been reached. When all trials were included, banding ligation reduced upper gastrointestinal bleeding and variceal bleeding compared with non-selective beta-blockers (RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.91; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 19% and RR 0.67; 95% CI 0.46 to 0.98; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 31% respectively). The beneficial effect of banding ligation on bleeding was not confirmed in subgroup analyses of trials with adequate randomisation or full paper articles. Bleeding-related mortality was not different in the two intervention arms (29/567 (5.1%) versus 37/585 (6.3%); RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.53 to 1.39; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%). Both interventions were associated with adverse events.</P>

<P>This review found a beneficial effect of banding ligation on primary prevention of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patient with oesophageal varices. The effect on bleeding did not reduce mortality.

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-06-18 11:53:16 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Oesophageal varices is one of the most serious complications to cirrhosis and portal hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-Le-Moine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Le Moine 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bosch-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bosch 2003</LINK>). During a five-year period, about one in five patients with cirrhosis will die from variceal bleeding (<LINK REF="REF-Gunnarsdottir-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gunnarsdottir 2005</LINK>). Oesophageal varices develop when the hepatic venous pressure gradient exceeds 10 mmHg (<LINK REF="REF-Arguedas-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arguedas 2003</LINK>). A reduction in the hepatic venous pressure gradient by at least 20% of the baseline pressure or to less than 12 mmHg reduces the risk of bleeding (<LINK REF="REF-Turnes-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turnes 2006</LINK>). Interventions that decrease portal pressure may, therefore, help to prevent bleeding from oesophageal varices (<LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Amico-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Amico 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Randomised trials and meta-analyses show that non-selective beta-blockers reduce the number of bleeding events when used as primary prevention in oesophageal varices (<LINK REF="REF-Cheng-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheng 2005</LINK>). Treatment with non-selective beta-blockers is widely used as a first-line treatment for primary prevention in medium- to high-risk oesophageal varices (<LINK REF="REF-Lebrec-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lebrec 2005</LINK>). However, the effect on mortality is debated and many patients experience adverse events (<LINK REF="REF-Garcia_x002d_Pagan-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia-Pagan 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cheng-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheng 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lebrec-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lebrec 2005</LINK>). Banding ligation has been assessed as an alternative treatment, but the results of individual trials are conflicting (<LINK REF="STD-Avgerinos-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Avgerinos 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vlachogiannakos-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vlachogiannakos 2000</LINK>). Previous meta-analyses of randomised trials found no clear difference between banding ligation and beta-blockers regarding mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Khuroo-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khuroo 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Triantos-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Triantos 2006</LINK>). However, the frequency of adverse events associated with banding ligation may be underestimated due to the inclusion of selected patient groups and the fact that only experienced operators participated in the trials (<LINK REF="REF-Mahadeva-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahadeva 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parente-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parente 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lim-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lim 2006</LINK>). In our previous systematic review on banding ligation versus beta-blockers we found that banding ligation may decrease the risk of bleeding (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2007</LINK>). However, there was no clear effect on mortality and adverse events were unclearly reported. We, therefore, performed this updated review with inclusion of subsequent trials (<LINK REF="STD-Tripathi-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Tripathi 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perez-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Perez 2010</LINK>).</P>

<P>The risk of bias in included trials was assessed using individual components. The risk of bias was classed as low if the individual components were classed as adequate. Based on previous evidence (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wood-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 2008</LINK>), the randomisation methods (allocation sequence generation and concealment) were extracted as the primary measures of bias control. An allocation sequence generation based on a computer, random number table, or similar was classified as adequate. The allocation concealment was classed as adequate if based on a central independent unit, serially numbered opaque sealed envelopes, or on-site locked computer. Additional measures of bias control included blinding, handling of missing data (whether all patients randomised were accounted for in the analyses), and reporting bias (whether the most clinically relevant outcome measures were reported). We also assessed other sources of bias including sample size calculations and comparability between intervention groups (differences between prognostic variables at baseline may reflect skewed allocation and distort the result of the trial).</P>

<P>Based on peer review comments stressing the importance of analysing the effect of the interventions on bleeding, we performed sensitivity, subgroup, and regression analyses for our primary outcome mortality and for the outcome upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the influence of trial characteristics on the overall result and on intertrial heterogeneity (publication status, bias control, duration of follow-up), and regression analyses (Egger's 'test of bias') to evaluate evidence of bias or small trial effects. Differences between subgroups were expressed as P and I<SUP>2</SUP> values. We also performed trial sequential analyses to assess the risk of random errors due to sparse data and multiple comparisons in our cumulative assessment of the intervention effects (<LINK REF="REF-Brok-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wetterslev-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wetterslev 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brok-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thorlund-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorlund 2009</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Wetterslev-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wetterslev 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thorlund-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorlund 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).

<P>Thirteen trials (72%) were performed as single centre trials. The remaining five trials included two to 13 clinical sites. The mean sample size was 79 patients (range 24 to 152). All trials assessed primary prevention in the management of patients with oesophageal varices and no previous bleeding. Included patients with cirrhosis were diagnosed based on clinical, biochemical, or histological signs. Most trials specified that only patients with large or high-risk oesophageal varices were considered for inclusion. The criteria used for assessing the risk of bleeding were red colour signs (red wale markings, cherry red spots, or haematocystic spots), tortuous varices protruding as far as at least one third of the oesophageal lumen, or pseudotumorous varices (also known as F2 or F3 varices). Other trials classified varices as high risk if they had a diameter of at least 5 mm or at least 3 mm plus at least one red colour sign. The reported exclusion criteria were contraindications to beta-blockers or severe concurrent illnesses, such as renal or malignant disease. In two trials, all patients were eligible for liver transplantation (<LINK REF="STD-Gheorghe-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gheorghe 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Norberto-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Norberto 2007</LINK>). The mean age for patients randomised to banding ligation was 53 years (range 42 to 62) and to beta-blockers 52 years (range 39 to 59). Most patients were men (mean proportion 66%) and few had alcoholic liver disease (mean 22%). Seven trials (37%) were published in abstract form and the remaining trials as full paper articles during the period 1998 to 2010 (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). The trials were performed in Egypt (n = 2), Great Britain (n = 2), India (n = 2), Mexico (n = 2), Taiwan (n = 2), USA (n = 2), China (n = 1), Czech Republic (n = 1), Germany (n = 1), Greece (n = 1), Italy (n = 1), Korea (n = 1), and Romania (n = 1).</P>
<P>Banding ligation was performed with conventional or multiband ligators and was repeated at three to four week intervals until the varices were eradicated. On average, two to three sessions were necessary to achieve variceal eradication. Subsequently, patients were followed at three to six month intervals and banding ligation was repeated in the case of variceal recurrence.</P>
<P>One trial assessed nadolol (<LINK REF="STD-Lo-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lo 2004</LINK>). The initial daily dose was 40 mg adjusted based on the heart rate (mean 60 mg). One trial assessed carvedilol (<LINK REF="STD-Tripathi-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Tripathi 2009</LINK>). The initial daily dose of carvedilol was 6.25 mg. The dose was increased to 12.5 mg if tolerated (the mean dose was not reported). The remaining trials assessed propranolol. The initial daily dose of propranolol ranged from 20 to 120 mg (mean 60 mg). The dose was adjusted to achieve a 20% to 25% reduction in heart rate, a resting heart rate of 55 beats per minute or less, or to a maximum dose of 160 or 320 mg. The mean dose administered in the trials was 70 mg/day (range 30 mg to 93 mg).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-06-18 11:51:18 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The present review compared the effects of banding ligation versus non-selective beta-blockers for patients with oesophageal varices and no history of bleeding. The overall analyses suggested that banding ligation reduced upper gastrointestinal bleeding and variceal bleeding compared with non-selective beta-blockers. However, this effect did not reflect reduced mortality suggesting that non-selective beta-blockers may have beneficial effects that are not related to bleeding. An alternative reason could be the potential influence of bias since the effect of banding ligation on bleeding could not be confirmed when the analysis was limited to trials with a low risk of selection bias. None of the included trials reported baseline differences between intervention groups regarding prognostic factors such as variceal size or Child-Pugh score. However, without adequate randomisation, the subgroup analyses suggest that the distribution of unknown and known factors may influence the overall result. Non-comparability between intervention groups may be the reason why trials with an unclear control of selection bias found a clear benefit of banding ligation on bleeding.</P>
<P>Adverse events are likely to influence compliance with the intervention assessed. Due to the variation in reporting, we were unable to determine whether an increased risk of adverse events (for example, in trials using a high dose of beta-blockers) led to reduced compliance. The assessment of adverse events in meta-analyses of published trials is often difficult. One of the reasons for this is the lack of consensus regarding the classification of serious and non-serious adverse events. In the ICH-GCP guidelines, adverse events leading to death, hospitalisation, or prolongation of existing hospitalisation are classified as serious (<LINK REF="REF-ICH_x002d_GCP-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICH-GCP 1997</LINK>). None of the included trials used these definitions. The lack of agreement on definitions is likely to explain the differences in the reported frequencies of adverse events. </P>
<P>For example, one trial classified the development of hypotension and first degree heart block after treatment with beta-blockers as serious adverse events but not the development of melena after banding ligation (<LINK REF="STD-Jutabha-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jutabha 2005</LINK>). The trial did not register any serious adverse events after banding (<LINK REF="STD-Jutabha-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jutabha 2005</LINK>) whereas a similar trial registered five serious adverse events in the form of bleeding occurring after banding (<LINK REF="STD-Schepke-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Schepke 2004</LINK>). A trial comparing banding ligation with no intervention for patients with contraindications to beta-blockers found high iatrogenic bleeding rates (that is, after banding ligation) (<LINK REF="STD-Triantos-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Triantos 2005</LINK>). This trial was terminated early. A potential explanation for differences between trials is related to the types of band ligators that were used. The conventional banding devices involved insertion of an overtube, which increased the risk of bleeding and oesophageal perforation. The currently used multiband devices do not involve this procedure. Accordingly, a randomised trial found that the multiband device was safer to use than the conventional device (<LINK REF="REF-Wong-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wong 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>One trial assessed the effect of banding versus no intervention for primary prophylaxis of bleeding in patients intolerant to beta-blockers (<LINK REF="STD-Triantos-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Triantos 2005</LINK>). The trial was stopped prematurely because of unacceptably high iatrogenic bleeding rates after banding. The reason may be the high proportion of patients with small varices in the trial. Similar results were found in a large randomised trial showing that sclerotherapy should not be used for prevention of bleeding from small varices (<LINK REF="STD-PROVA-1991" TYPE="STUDY">PROVA 1991</LINK>). Likewise, a randomised, double-blind trial found no benefit of treating patients with cirrhosis and no or small oesophageal varices with propanolol (<LINK REF="STD-Cales-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Cales 1999</LINK>). Overall, the evidence suggests that interventions for primary prophylaxis should mainly be considered for patient with varices that have a high risk of bleeding.</P>
<P>The fact that no significant difference is found between the two treatments regarding mortality does not necessarily mean that the treatments are equally effective. The objective of non-inferiority trials is to ensure that an experimental treatment is not worse than the established treatment by more than a prespecified delta value. The delta value is also known as the non-inferiority margin which is included in the sample size calculation (<LINK REF="REF-Henaff-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henaff 2006</LINK>). Non-inferiority trials generally require larger sample sizes than superiority trials. In a number of the included trials, the authors concluded that banding was 'as effective and safe' as treatment with non-selective beta-blockers (<LINK REF="STD-Lui-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lui 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lo-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lo 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lay-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lay 2006</LINK>). These conclusions are debatable as none of the trials were designed to establish non-inferiority. In one of the included trials (<LINK REF="STD-Thuluvath-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Thuluvath 2005</LINK>), investigators estimated that 90 patients in each intervention group would be required to show a difference in bleeding. The trial was prematurely terminated due to the observed bleeding rates which occurred in 2 of 16 patients randomised to banding ligation and 1 of 15 patients randomised to beta-blockers. Despite the selection of high-risk patients, the number of events were lower than anticipated. The authors concluded that 424 patients would be required in each arm to show a clinically relevant difference (<LINK REF="STD-Thuluvath-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Thuluvath 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The assessment of bleeding varied considerably in the included trials. Two trials did not specify whether variceal or non-variceal bleeding was assessed (<LINK REF="STD-Mora-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mora 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Abdelfattah-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Abdelfattah 2006</LINK>). Four trials reported both incident variceal and non-variceal bleeding (<LINK REF="STD-Sarin-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sarin 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Song-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Song 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lo-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lo 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Psilopoulos-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Psilopoulos 2005</LINK>). The remaining trials only reported incident variceal bleeding. Both outcome measures seem relevant. For example, some trials suggest that banding ligation may accentuate portal hypertensive gastropathy (<LINK REF="STD-Lo-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lo 2001</LINK>). We originally planned to analyse bleeding using the BAVENO criteria (<LINK REF="REF-de-Franchis-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Franchis 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-de-Franchis-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Franchis 2005</LINK>), but we were unable to do so because none of the trials provided the necessary data.</P>

<P>Banding ligation versus non-selective beta blockers for primary prevention in patients with oesophageal varices. The outcome is all-cause mortality. The heterogeneity-adjusted low-bias trial relative risk estimate required information size (HALBRIS) is 3211 patients. The calculation is based on 0% heterogeneity; a proportion of people dying in the control group (Pc) of 23%; a relative risk reduction of 18.7% based on the intervention effect in trials with a low risk of bias; an alpha of 5%; and a beta of 20%. The red lines sloping towards a Z value of 1.96 and -1.96 are the trial-sequential alpha spending monitoring boundaries. The red lines originating from the Z line of 0 broadening towards the HALBRIS are the beta spending monitoring boundaries. The blue line is the cumulative Z curve, which does not cross the alpha or beta spending boundaries.</P>

<P>Banding ligation versus non-selective beta blockers for primary prevention in patients with oesophageal varices. The outcome is upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The heterogeneity-adjusted low-bias trial relative risk estimate required information size (HALBRIS) is 1890 patients. The calculation is based on 13% heterogeneity; a proportion of people with upper gastrointestinal bleeding in the control group (Pc) of 20.4%; a relative risk reduction of 25.9% based on the intervention effect in trials with a low risk of bias; an alpha of 5%; and a beta of 20%. The red lines sloping towards a Z value of 1.96 and -1.96 are the trial sequential alpha spending monitoring boundaries. The blue line is the cumulative Z curve, which crosses the conventional boundary after the sixth trial (314 patients) and the alpha spending boundary after the 13th trial (981 patients).</P>

<P>Banding ligation versus beta blockers for primary prevention in patients with oesophageal varices. The outcome is variceal bleeding. The heterogeneity-adjusted low-bias trial relative risk estimate required information size (HALBRIS) is 2125 patients. The calculation is based on 30% heterogeneity; a proportion of people with upper gastrointestinal bleeding in the control group (Pc) of 19.1%; a relative risk reduction of 39.1% based on the intervention effect in trials with low risk of bias; an alpha of 5%; and a beta of 20%. The red lines sloping towards a Z value of 1.96 and -1.96 are the trial sequential alpha spending monitoring boundaries. The blue line is the cumulative Z curve, which crosses the conventional boundary after the fifth trial (224 patient), but not the alpha spending monitoring boundaries. </P>
