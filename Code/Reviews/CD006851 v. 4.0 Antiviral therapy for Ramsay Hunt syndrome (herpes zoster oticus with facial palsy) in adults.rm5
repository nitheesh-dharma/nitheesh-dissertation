<P>It seems logical that antiviral drugs might help patients with a herpes virus infection of the ear producing facial weakness (a condition known as 'Ramsay Hunt syndrome'). These drugs often help similar viral infections elsewhere in the body. However, trials that might address this issue have not been done and there is therefore some uncertainty about their usefulness. Since patients can experience side-effects when taking these drugs, the risks of these have to be balanced with the unknown prospect of benefit when considering whether to use them in Ramsay Hunt syndrome.</P>

<P>Herpes zoster oticus (HZO) is a viral infection of the ear and when associated with acute facial paralysis is known as Ramsay Hunt syndrome.

<P>We found no evidence that anti-viral agents have a beneficial effect on outcomes in Ramsay Hunt syndrome, despite their widespread use in this condition. The use of these drugs in patients with herpes zoster infections in other parts of the body might suggest that they have a role in herpes zoster oticus. As usual, the absence of positive evidence of benefit (or, in this case, the 'negative' result of one small, statistically under-powered study) does not necessarily indicate that antivirals are ineffective. However, these drugs are associated with a number of adverse effects and this must be taken into consideration when undertaking the requisite risk-benefit analysis before instigating treatment.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Definition, prevalence and aetiology</HEADING>
<P>Herpes zoster oticus is a viral infection of the inner, middle and external ear characterised by herpetic blisters (small vesicles) of the skin of the external canal, pinna and/or the oral mucosa and severe otalgia (ear pain). These symptoms can be accompanied by one or more of the following: vestibulocochlear dysfunction (e.g. vertigo, hearing loss, hyperacusis, tinnitus), taste impairment, dry mouth and eyes.</P>
<P>When herpes zoster oticus is associated with acute peripheral facial paralysis the condition is known as Ramsay Hunt syndrome type 2 (<LINK REF="REF-Ramsay-Hunt-1907" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramsay Hunt 1907</LINK>). Although the terms 'herpes zoster oticus' and 'Ramsay Hunt syndrome' are frequently used interchangeably in the literature, this review will focus only on Ramsay Hunt syndrome and will include trials with participants suffering from herpes zoster oticus with accompanying facial weakness.</P>
<P>The incidence of Ramsay Hunt syndrome is about five cases per 100,000 of the US population annually, with a significantly increased incidence in patients older than 60 years (<LINK REF="REF-Murakami-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murakami 1997</LINK>). The condition is considered to be both less frequent and less severe in children (<LINK REF="REF-Hato-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hato 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sweeney-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sweeney 2001</LINK>), but reports of children are limited in the literature and the clinical features and prognosis of paediatric Ramsay Hunt syndrome remain unclear. Vaccination against chickenpox (both in childhood and in later life) may prevent or reduce its occurrence (<LINK REF="REF-Guess-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guess 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hato-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hato 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oxman-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oxman 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Ramsay Hunt syndrome is caused by the reactivation of latent varicella-zoster virus in the geniculate ganglion (the sensory ganglion of the facial nerve) which affects the seventh and eighth cranial nerves. This is due to the close proximity of the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) and the vestibulocochlear nerve (cranial nerve VIII) (<LINK REF="REF-Sweeney-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sweeney 2001</LINK>). The subsequent dysfunction of cranial nerves VII and VIII is thought to be caused primarily by varicella-zoster virus neuritis and to a lesser extent by inflammatory oedema. Maximal facial paralysis is generally seen within one week. Although less common than Bell's palsy (i.e. idiopathic facial palsy), Ramsay Hunt syndrome generally causes more severe dysfunction and has a poorer prognosis for facial nerve recovery (<LINK REF="REF-Uri-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uri 2003</LINK>). There are currently three published Cochrane reviews and one published Cochrane protocol covering interventions for Bell's palsy (<LINK REF="REF-Allen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allen 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-He-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">He 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Salinas-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salinas 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Teixeira-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Teixeira 2006</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">History, examination and diagnosis</HEADING>
<P>Diagnosis is primarily clinical and is based on the presentation of a combination of severe ear pain, small vesicles on the pinna or oral mucosa and facial palsy. When patients present with acute facial weakness a high index of suspicion is required in order to recognise the condition, deliver prompt treatment and obtain the best possible outcome. Although the appearance of vesicles usually precedes or presents simultaneously with facial paralysis, it may be delayed until after facial weakness is clinically evident, thus making the condition initially indistinguishable from Bell's palsy. Symptoms and signs of vestibulocochlear dysfunction are not always present, but can include hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, nystagmus, nausea and vomiting.</P>
<P>The clinical picture remains the cornerstone of diagnosis, as serum titres of varicella-zoster virus antibodies are only useful when comparing the acute and convalescent stages of the condition (<LINK REF="REF-Dickins-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickins 1988</LINK>). The use of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect varicella-zoster virus from skin of the affected area of the ear may help to distinguish between patients with Bell's palsy and those with Ramsay Hunt syndrome in the very early stages (<LINK REF="REF-Murakami-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murakami 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>The <I>early</I> diagnosis of Ramsay Hunt syndrome is always said to be extremely important. In the treatment of herpes infections in general, antiviral therapy is most effective when given within the first 72 hours of the onset of symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Dworkin-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dworkin 2007</LINK>). If diagnosis is made and antiviral treatment commenced within this timeframe, the facial palsy recovery rate has been reported in non-randomised studies to be as high as 75% (<LINK REF="REF-Dickins-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickins 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murakami-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murakami 1997</LINK>). Significant factors for increased risk of poor prognosis are said to include: the absence of demonstrable nerve excitability, complete paralysis and being aged over 50 years at presentation (<LINK REF="REF-Sweeney-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sweeney 2001</LINK>). In contrast, the prognosis for associated sensorineural hearing loss is excellent, and only around 5% of patients will have residual hearing impairment (<LINK REF="REF-Kaberos-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaberos 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murakami-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murakami 1997</LINK>). Other potentially chronic sequelae are post-herpetic neuralgia, tinnitus and vestibular dysfunction (<LINK REF="REF-Dworkin-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dworkin 2007</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Management options</HEADING>
<P>The standard first-line treatment for herpes zoster infections at sites in the body other than the ear is the anti-viral agent acyclovir, which is given either intravenously or orally. Other antiviral agents that may be prescribed include valacyclovir (<LINK REF="REF-Beutner-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beutner 1996</LINK>), famcyclovir (<LINK REF="REF-Tyring-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tyring 1995</LINK>) or brivudin (<LINK REF="REF-Dworkin-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dworkin 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Antiviral therapy is only effective against virus <I>replication</I> in herpes zoster infections - that is, it can prevent further proliferation and spread of the varicella-zoster virus but cannot eradicate the viruses. Oral antiviral treatment has been evaluated in the treatment of herpes zoster infections in other parts of the body and has been shown by two meta-analyses (of four and five randomised controlled trials respectively) to lessen the severity of herpes zoster infection in immunocompetent adults. It reduces the duration of viral shedding and new lesion formation, thereby accelerating rash healing and reducing the duration of pain (<LINK REF="REF-Jackson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jackson 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wood-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is generally held that the use of oral antivirals is limited to a period of 7 to 10 days and needs to be started within 72 hours of the onset of a rash. They are generally very well tolerated if administered at standard doses (acyclovir: 800 mg five times/day for 7 to 10 days; famcyclovir: 500 mg three times/day for seven days; valacyclovir: 1000 mg three times/day for seven days) and providing patients are kept well hydrated (<LINK REF="REF-Dworkin-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dworkin 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goodman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodman 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kinishi-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kinishi 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lampee-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lampee 1986</LINK>). The most common side effects are nausea (and occasionally vomiting) and headache, which occur in 10% to 20% of cases. Other possible side effects from prolonged use include renal impairment, diarrhoea, dizziness, fatigue, skin rash, anorexia, leg pain, sore throat and hair loss (<LINK REF="REF-Bean-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bean 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dickins-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickins 1988</LINK>). Any allergic reaction to antiviral medications is a contraindication to their use (<LINK REF="REF-Peterslund-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peterslund 1981</LINK>).</P>
<P>Oral brivudin appears to have a higher potency against varicella-zoster virus than the oral regimes of acyclovir, valacyclovir and famcyclovir. It also has a simpler regime (once a day) and no nephrotoxic effects (<LINK REF="REF-Dworkin-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dworkin 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gross-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gross 2003</LINK>). However, antivirals cannot prevent either the acute or chronic pain produced by the infection and experienced by about 20% of patients over 50 years of age, and therefore supplementary therapies, most frequently adjuvant corticosteroids, are often prescribed. The rationale for their use is to reduce nerve inflammation and associated pain.</P>
<P>Although antivirals have become standard therapy for Ramsay Hunt syndrome in Europe and the US in recent years, and a number of primary studies assessing their effectiveness have been published, we found no systematic review of randomised studies addressing this question. Therefore, this systematic review aims to evaluate the effects of antiviral therapy on outcomes in patients with Ramsay Hunt syndrome.</P>

<P>The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) was searched using the search terms listed in <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>. These terms were combined with the first two sections of the highly sensitive search strategy designed by The Cochrane Collaboration for identifying randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials in the PubMed and EMBASE databases. Strategies for all other databases were modelled on the CENTRAL version. The strategies were also combined with a search filter designed to retrieve cost-effectiveness studies in MEDLINE and EMBASE, and the NHS Economic Evaluation Database (in <I>The Cochrane Library</I>) was also searched for relevant studies.</P>
<P>References of retrieved articles from electronic searches were searched and a search for existing meta-analyses and non-Cochrane systematic reviews was performed.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality assessment</HEADING>
<P>The quality of the trials was assessed and graded independently by two authors according to the criteria described in The Cochrane Handbook 4.2.6 (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2006</LINK>). Gradings were compared and any inconsistencies between the authors in the interpretation of inclusion criteria and their significance to the selected study were discussed and resolved.</P>
<P>The selected study was assessed for the following characteristics:</P>
<OL>
<LI>The adequacy of the randomisation process (possible selection bias). Adequate randomisation includes any one of the following methods: computer generated or table of random numbers, drawing of lots, coin-toss, shuffling cards or throw of a dice. Inadequate methods of randomisation include the following: case record number, date of birth or alternate numbers.</LI>
<LI>The adequacy of the allocation concealment (possible selection bias). Adequate methods of allocation concealment include either central randomisation (i.e. separate to other aspects of trial administration) or sequentially numbered sealed opaque envelopes. Inadequate concealment means an open allocation sequence in which either participants or trialists were able to foresee the upcoming assignment.</LI>
<LI>The blinding of outcome assessors (i.e. whether the persons assessing the outcome of care were aware of which treatment the participant had received - possible performance bias).</LI>
<LI>The extent and handling of losses to follow up (possible attrition bias). Adequate handling of losses to follow up involves a clear description and explanation being given of any significant difference between the losses of the intervention groups. An unacceptable loss in any one intervention group was considered to be loss greater than 20%.</LI>

Data will be analysed by intention-to -treat (ITT). Sensitivity analyses will be performed in which we will assume that 1) all missing participants failed to recover and 2) all missing participants recovered completely.

<P>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ramos-Macias-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ramos Macias 1992</LINK>) met our inclusion criteria. This study enrolled 15 patients with Ramsay Hunt syndrome with ages ranging from 21 to 91 years. No details are given about the timing of the onset, diagnosis or enrolment in the study. Details of the randomisation and allocation concealment are not stated in the original paper. This information was obtained from the principal author who confirmed that the randomisation process and the allocation were computer generated.</P>
<P>Seven patients had 'complete axonotmesis' and eight had 'incomplete' palsies. This is problematic because no information is given about the distribution of these two categories between the treatment and control groups. For example, we cannot be certain that all the patients with the incomplete palsies were not in the treatment group and the more severely affected patients in the control group.</P>
<P>All participants received intravenous corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 20 mg/8 hours for 10 days). Seven participants only received this treatment (control group) whilst eight (the treatment group) received in addition intravenous acyclovir (10 mg/kg/8h for 10 days). It is not clear whether the participants or study personnel (and in particular those assessing outcomes) were blinded to the allocation.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2008-06-06 14:47:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We classified this study as grade C because of the uncertainty about blinding. The possibility of an uneven distribution of complete and incomplete palsies between the two groups is another potential source of bias and we conclude overall that this is a low quality study.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2008-06-06 14:51:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is not clear from the published data (<LINK REF="STD-Ramos-Macias-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ramos Macias 1992</LINK>) at what time point the reported outcomes were assessed. One patient in the treatment group (N = 8) abandoned their treatment due to a generalised rash. The remainder achieved the following levels on the House-Brackmann scale:</P>
<P>Grade I : 3</P>
<P>Grade II : 2</P>
<P>Grade III: 1</P>
<P>Grade IV : 1</P>
<P>The proportion of patients with Grade II or I was 5/8 (63%). Intention to treat principles were followed and the patient who discontinued treatment was included in the denominator.</P>
<P>The results in the control group (N = 7) were:</P>
<P>Grade I : 1</P>
<P>Grade II : 2</P>
<P>Grade III : 3</P>
<P>Grade IV : 0</P>
<P>Grade V : 1</P>
<P>The proportion of patients with Grade II or I was 3/7 (43%).</P>
<P>There is no statistically significant difference between the two groups (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). No information is available about any other outcome measures. Only one adverse event (as mentioned above) was reported.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-06-19 15:39:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ian J Chamberlain">
<P>We found no evidence that anti-viral agents have a beneficial effect on outcomes in Ramsay Hunt syndrome, despite their widespread use in this condition. The use of these drugs in patients with herpes zoster infections in other parts of the body might suggest that they have a role in Ramsay Hunt syndrome. As usual, the absence of positive evidence of benefit (or, in this case, the 'negative' result of one small, statistically under-powered, study) does not necessarily indicate that antivirals are ineffective. However, these drugs are associated with a number of adverse effects and this must be taken into consideration when undertaking the requisite risk-benefit analysis before instigating treatment.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-06-25 14:25:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Anti-viral agents may, or may not, be effective in patients with Ramsay Hunt syndrome. On the basis of fundamental patho-physiological principles it would seem reasonable to use them.  However, these agents are associated with a number of side effects and adverse events which must be considered before they are prescribed.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-06-19 15:39:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ian J Chamberlain">
<P>High quality, appropriately powered randomised controlled trials are required to evaluate the effect of antiviral agents in patients with Ramsay Hunt syndrome (herpes zoster oticus with accompanying facial weakness). Such studies should include:</P>
<P>Participants - with Ramsay Hunt syndrome within 7 days of onset. The degree of facial weakness (complete/incomplete, and the degree of the latter) should be stated for all participants and treatment and control groups should be balanced.</P>
<P>Interventions - oral antiviral agents with or without concomitant administration of steroids (see our companion review <LINK REF="REF-Uscategui-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uscategui 2008</LINK>)</P>
<P>Outcomes - improvement in facial movement (specifically proportion of participants with complete/near complete recovery), presence of motor synkinesis or autonomic dysfunction at six months. In addition presence of vestibulocochlear symptoms, e.g. balance impairment, sensorineural hearing loss or tinnitus. Presence of any adverse effects.</P>
