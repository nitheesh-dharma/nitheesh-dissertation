<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-09-12 11:31:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We reviewed the evidence from 12 studies about the effect of treatments for cough in patients with whooping cough.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>We wanted to discover whether any medicines are effective at treating cough in patients with whooping cough (also known as pertussis). These medicines included pertussis immunoglobulin (antibodies to increase the body's resistance to whooping cough) and treatments already used to treat symptoms of asthma and hay fever (antihistamines, salbutamol, steroids). Patients with whooping cough may experience severe coughing bouts. These may be accompanied by whooping (the sound made when taking a deep breath in after coughing) and vomiting, which can lead to dehydration, difficulty breathing and being admitted to hospital. We aimed to find out whether any medicines are effective at reducing coughing bouts in patients with whooping cough. We also aimed to find out whether any medicines reduced whooping, vomiting, cyanosis (turning blue because of lack of oxygen), serious complications (such as strokes and seizures), admission to hospital, time spent in hospital or death (from any cause). In addition, we looked at possible side effects of the medicines.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence in this review is current up to January 2014. We included 12 studies, which included a total of 578 participants. Ten studies involved a total of 448 children and two involved a total of 130 adolescents and adults. Five studies did laboratory tests to confirm the presence of whooping cough in all participants who took part. Nine studies compared the medicine to a placebo (i.e. a 'dummy' medicine which did not contain the active ingredient being studied) and three studies compared the medicine to no treatment. Seven studies involved hospital inpatients. Three studies reported their start and finish dates; one study recruited participants over 14 months, another over 18 months and another over 31 months.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Six studies including 196 participants reported their results in enough detail for us to assess them. Based on these results, antihistamines (one study, 49 participants), pertussis immunoglobulin (one study, 24 participants) and salbutamol (two studies, 42 participants) did not reduce the number of coughing bouts in patients with whooping cough. Neither pertussis immunoglobulin (one study, 46 participants) nor steroids (one study, 11 participants) decreased the length of time participants spent in hospital. One study reported similar rates of side effects in participants treated with pertussis immunoglobulin (4%; rash) or placebo (5%; loose stools, pain and swelling of the skin around where the injection was given). Studies of antihistamines, salbutamol and steroids did not report any results on side effects. None of these six studies reported any results on vomiting, cyanosis, serious complications, death or admission to hospital.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Overall, the quality of evidence was low and many of the studies were conducted some years ago. Only three trials reported adequate details of how the type of treatment given was properly concealed from both participants and healthcare professionals. Methods of recording numbers of coughing bouts and whoops also differed between studies. Estimates of the effects of the different treatments were imprecise due to the small numbers of participants from whom results were available. Additionally, these results may not be generalisable to adults or community settings, since most studies involved children and were done in hospital inpatient settings.</P>

<P>Around 16 million cases of whooping cough (pertussis) occur worldwide each year, mostly in low-income countries.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-09-12 11:31:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 12 trials of varying sample sizes (N = 9 to 135), mainly from high-income countries, including a total of 578 participants. Ten trials recruited children (N = 448 participants). Two trials recruited adolescents and adults (N = 130 participants). We considered only three trials to be of high methodological quality (one trial each of diphenhydramine, pertussis immunoglobulin and montelukast). Included studies did not show a statistically significant benefit for any of the interventions. Only six trials, including a total of 196 participants, reported data in sufficient detail for analysis. Diphenhydramine did not change coughing episodes; the mean difference (MD) of coughing spells per 24 hours was 1.9; 95% confidence interval (CI) -4.7 to 8.5 (N = 49 participants from one trial). One trial on pertussis immunoglobulin reported a possible mean reduction of -3.1 whoops per 24 hours (95% CI -6.2 to 0.02, N = 47 participants) but no change in hospital stay (MD -0.7 days; 95% CI -3.8 to 2.4, N = 46 participants). Dexamethasone did not show a clear decrease in length of hospital stay (MD -3.5 days; 95% CI -15.3 to 8.4, N = 11 participants from one trial) and salbutamol showed no change in coughing paroxysms per day (MD -0.2; 95% CI -4.1 to 3.7, N = 42 participants from two trials). Only one trial comparing pertussis immunoglobulin versus placebo (N = 47 participants) reported data on adverse events: 4.3% in the treatment group (rash) versus 5.3% in the placebo group (loose stools, pain and swelling at injection site).</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-09-12 11:37:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-09-12 11:37:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Whooping cough, or pertussis, is a highly infectious disease caused by the gram-negative coccobacillus <I>Bordetella pertussis </I>(<I>B. pertussis</I>). About 16 million cases of pertussis are estimated to occur worldwide each year, of which 95% are in low-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2010</LINK>). Although pertussis vaccination coverage is high, the incidence of pertussis notifications in recent years has been increasing (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 2012</LINK>). During 2012, pertussis outbreaks were reported in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Public-Health-England-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Public Health England 2013</LINK>) and in the United States (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2012</LINK>).The rate of case-fatality among infants in low-income countries may be as high as 4% (<LINK REF="REF-Tan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tan 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2011</LINK>). There is evidence of a global resurgence in the incidence of pertussis and, with improved recognition, increasing reports of pertussis in adolescent and adult populations (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cherry-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cherry 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dworkin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dworkin 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Quinn-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quinn 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tan 2005</LINK>). This means neonates and infants are particularly vulnerable to the possibility of disease transmitted by infectious adults in the community. Childhood immunisation has dramatically reduced the incidence of severe disease but the protection provided by childhood immunisation or natural infection is not lifelong. Protection following vaccination is estimated to last between four and 12 years (<LINK REF="REF-Wendelboe-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wendelboe 2005</LINK>). </P>
<P>Clinically, pertussis is a prolonged disease and can be classically divided into catarrhal, paroxysmal and convalescent stages. The symptoms during the catarrhal stage are similar to a minor upper respiratory infection or head cold (coryza) with an intermittent non-productive cough commonly lasting one to two weeks, with possible fever. The paroxysmal phase is when coughing begins to occur in spells (paroxysms) that may last for over a minute. The gasping for air between coughing defines the characteristic inspiratory whoop, although infants may not whoop as older children do. Coughing paroxysms can also lead to post-tussive vomiting, which may result in dehydration, especially in low-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-Long-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Long 2000</LINK>). </P>
<P>Serious complications of the disease may occur in young infants, including apnoea, cyanosis, pneumonia, convulsions, cerebral haemorrhage, encephalopathy and death (<LINK REF="REF-Mattoo-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mattoo 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McEniery-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">McEniery 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-von-K_x00f6_nig-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">von König 2002</LINK>). In such cases hospitalisation for supportive care or intensive care may be required. The severity of the paroxysmal phase usually peaks after one or more weeks and may persist for two or three months with an average of five coughing episodes a day before gradual improvement (<LINK REF="REF-Harnden-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harnden 2006</LINK>). Even without severe complications the coughing spasms are very distressing for the child and parents.</P>
<P>The clinical manifestations of the disease are affected by several known factors, including the age of the patient, immunisation status or history of natural infection, presence of passively acquired antibody, and antibiotic treatment. While the disease stages are foreshortened in immunised children, pertussis can be a major cause of persistent cough. A study in the UK found that 37% of school children who were coughing for more than two weeks had evidence of a recent infection (<LINK REF="REF-Harnden-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harnden 2006)</LINK>.</P>
<P>In adults the clinical presentation can range from no cough to mild or 'classic pertussis', which includes the characteristic whoop, possible post-tussive vomiting or a prolonged cough illness (<LINK REF="REF-Hewlett-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hewlett 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wright-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 1995</LINK>). Other complications reported in adults include urinary incontinence (<LINK REF="REF-Postels_x002d_Multani-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Postels-Multani 1995</LINK>), hearing loss, inguinal hernia, cracked ribs, carotid artery dissection, pneumonia and pneumothorax, which may result in development of subcutaneous emphysema (<LINK REF="REF-Rothstein-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rothstein 2005</LINK>). These complications can have social and economic implications resulting in the individual being absent from work or school and requiring frequent use of healthcare resources (<LINK REF="REF-Rothstein-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rothstein 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Diagnosis of infection in the older population is important for treatment and surveillance purposes, but also to prevent transmission to unvaccinated babies. Recent advances in laboratory diagnostic methods have rapidly evolved from the less sensitive techniques such as culture and antigen detection to polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the more sensitive antibody detection in serum and oral fluid against pertussis toxin (PT) (<LINK REF="REF-Fry-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fry 2013</LINK>). These advances have contributed to rapid and reliable identification which help with treatment and control measures.</P>
<P>The current global increase of pertussis and growing awareness of the implications in older populations have led to new strategies in improving vaccine coverage. Many countries, like the UK, have changed from the whole cell vaccine to the acellular vaccine. Vaccine regimes have also been extended in some countries to include pre-school and adolescent boosters as well as incorporating the 'cocoon strategy' that aims to ensure vaccine coverage of adolescents, adults and postpartum women (<LINK REF="REF-Forsyth-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forsyth 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ward-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ward 2005</LINK>); a strategy currently implemented in Australia and parts of the USA. Overall, much effort has been placed on standardising case definitions of surveillance and outbreak investigations. Diagnostic methods are advancing and considerable progress has been made in improving the understanding of pertussis even at the molecular level (<LINK REF="REF-King-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 2008</LINK>). There are difficulties for those in low-income countries where these tools may not be available. The current challenge is assisting those that suffer from the consequences of this disease.</P>

In the early stages options are fairly standard and the preferred agents include a short treatment of macrolide antibiotics such as azithromycin or erythromycin (<LINK REF="REF-Altunaiji-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altunaiji 2011</LINK>). Antibiotics have no effect on the clinical symptoms or course of pertussis but are prescribed primarily to eradicate <I>B. pertussis</I> from the nasopharynx and to limit the spread of infection (<LINK REF="REF-Altunaiji-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altunaiji 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Much of the morbidity of whooping cough is due to the effects of the paroxysmal cough. The treatment of the cough is symptomatic, that is, treatment aims to reduce the severity of the cough paroxysms until the disease has run its course (<LINK REF="REF-Long-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Long 2000</LINK>), but the value of current interventions used to relieve the ongoing symptoms is limited. The treatments that have been recommended include corticosteroids (for example, dexamethasone), salbutamol (beta2-adrenergic agonist), pertussis immunoglobulin and antihistamines (for example, diphenhydramine). Experimental data also suggest that leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) may have some benefit in the treatment of pertussis-induced cough (<LINK REF="REF-Thivierge-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thivierge 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vandebriel-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vandebriel 2007</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-07-18 14:47:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Corticosteroids, such as dexamethasone, are synthetic adrenocortical steroids. These drugs alter the body's natural defensive response, reduce symptoms such as swelling and allergic-type reactions, and are often used to treat different kinds of inflammation. Salbutamol is a beta2-adrenergic agonist widely used for the relief of bronchospasm in conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. There are a number of different types of antihistamine medicines available that are classified as either first generation or second generation, the difference being that the latter causes less drowsiness. Antihistamines work by blocking the effects of histamine, a mediator of airway inflammation, which can lead to symptoms such as sneezing and coughing. Pertussis immunoglobulin products are therapies directed at pertussis toxin, the major virulence factor of <I>B. pertussis</I>. LTRAs are cysteinyl leukotriene type 1 receptor antagonists, which are currently used in the treatment of asthma and allergic rhinitis. LTRAs work by inhibiting leukotriene-mediated bronchoconstriction and airway inflammation in these patients. In the mouse model, pertussis infection is associated with increased production of the cytokine interleukin-13 (<LINK REF="REF-Vandebriel-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vandebriel 2007</LINK>). Interleukin-13 is known to upregulate cysteinyl leukotriene production and receptor expression (<LINK REF="REF-Thivierge-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thivierge 2001</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-05-14 10:28:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Specific treatments for the underlying cause of cough should ideally reduce or eliminate it. Unfortunately, in the case of pertussis, there are no disease-specific therapies available that can relieve the progressive nature of the cough. Although early antibiotic intervention is recommended in suspected or confirmed pertussis cases, this is primarily intended to reduce disease transmission, and has not been shown to alter the clinical course of the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Altunaiji-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altunaiji 2011</LINK>). The paroxysmal stage of pertussis can be life-threatening for young infants and distressing for both child and parent. In adults this coughing phase can continue for several weeks, and can be uncomfortable and distressing. </P>
<P>To date there has been no significant evidence of benefit for any individual treatment in reducing the symptoms and morbidity associated with whooping cough.</P>

<P>This systematic review examining the symptomatic treatment of whooping cough has found that there is insufficient evidence to support the use of current interventions. Only one trial indicated some benefit in the use of pertussis immunoglobulin but more research is required to substantiate this finding.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-09-12 11:31:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For the 2009 review we updated the earlier search strategy (<LINK REF="REF-Pillay-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pillay 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="APP-05" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 5</LINK>), by including all treatment terms and interventions associated with whooping cough before excluding terms such as antibiotics and vaccines. Antibiotic and vaccine reviews have been performed for these interventions. A Cochrane Review on antibiotic treatment in whooping cough has been published (<LINK REF="REF-Altunaiji-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altunaiji 2011</LINK>), and the previously withdrawn Cochrane Review on acellular vaccines for preventing whooping cough in children, <LINK REF="REF-Tinnion-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tinnion 2001</LINK>, has been updated by a new team of authors (<LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2012</LINK>). In 2009 we added one included trial to the previous review published in 2003 (<LINK REF="REF-Pillay-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pillay 2003</LINK>). We did not identify any new studies to include when we updated our searches in 2012. We included two new studies following our 2014 search update (<LINK REF="STD-Ghaffari-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ghaffari 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2014</LINK>), but neither of these reported data suitable for further analysis in relation to our pre-specified outcomes.</P>
<P>No statistically significant effects were found for any of the interventions. Pertussis immunoglobulin could plausibly result in anything from a decrease in the mean number of whoops by 6.22 over 24 hours to an increase of 0.02 over 24 hours (<LINK REF="STD-Granstrom-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Granstrom 1991</LINK>). For all the other interventions sample sizes were small and confidence intervals for the mean differences were wide. This indicates that there is insufficient evidence to reach any conclusion regarding their effectiveness. The pre-specified subgroup and sensitivity analyses were not feasible because of the small number of trials identified.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-09-12 10:43:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Twelve trials from our literature search between 1950 and 2014 met our inclusion criteria. Most of the trials were generally old and poorly reported while the majority of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were performed in the 1980s. This partially explains the poor quality and inconclusive nature of the trials. There were two exceptions (<LINK REF="STD-Halperin-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Halperin 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2014</LINK>), which were well designed and well executed.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2014-09-12 11:31:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There were several key limitations to the included trials. The trials were too heterogenous in regards to their interventions and outcomes to allow pooling of results. The trials varied greatly in dose regimes and duration of treatment. There was inconsistency in measuring outcomes and the timing of those intervals. The outcome data were also presented differently, that is, frequency of whoops per hour or duration of symptoms. Methods of monitoring coughs were variable but expected to be due to the year of publication. The later trials were likely to include the recording of the progressive cough with monitors and digital equipment. Age and sex of children/participants enrolled in the trials were not always mentioned and only one study from which data were suitable for analysis included children over 12 years of age and adults (<LINK REF="STD-Mertsola-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Mertsola 1986</LINK>). Immunisation status and antibiotic treatments were not always stated. In the majority of trials participants were given antibiotics prior to intervention.</P>
<P>Fifteen trials were excluded from this review. These trials might have provided some useful information but the many methodological errors, including poor-quality methods or analysis, problems with recruitment, time frame and allocation of patients and non-interpretable results, lead to several forms of bias and misleading conclusions. In some of the excluded trials the trial authors concluded that their work was more of a pilot study and more research on their intervention was recommended.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2014-09-12 11:31:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Throughout much of the literature we report a lack of controlled trials and contradictory reports for cough relief in whooping cough. No strong evidence exists of any treatment that can relieve the serious cough caused by whooping cough, although there was one study that found some evidence that pertussis immunoglobulin preparations might help. There are many short, single-blinded trials, clinical observations and 'personal impressions' that discuss promising results for patients and may indeed hold some credit. However, well-designed, placebo-controlled, double-blind trials of potential agents and or combinations are lacking and such trials need to be initiated for those with pertussis in a similar way that trials of therapies for croup and asthma have been performed. This void in new therapies for cough is not limited to those suffering from pertussis but is a general problem for treating coughs of various causes. <LINK REF="REF-Chung-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chung 2009</LINK> has noted that new therapies for cough are lacking while in several countries there are growing concerns about the safety and efficacy of commonly used cough medicines (<LINK REF="REF-MHRA-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">MHRA 2009</LINK>). Overall there is a need for new, effective antitussive drugs for patients with whooping cough. </P>

<P>Given the growing prevalence of pertussis in infants, adolescents and adults, there is an urgent need for large, well-designed randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to identify effective antitussive treatments for pertussis-induced cough. More importantly, good-quality, well-reported RCTs with adequate statistical power are required. Well-designed trials are required and the design should follow CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) guidelines (<A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org">www.consort-statement.org</A>). CONSORT comprises a checklist and flow diagram to help improve the quality of reports of RCTs. The checklist includes descriptions of the randomisation procedure (allocation concealment), the mechanisms of blinding, number of people lost during the follow-up and some details about the analysis made.</P>

<P>The number of participants with severe pertussis in the intervention arm decreased from 16 (53.3%) before treatment to 7 (23.3%) after treatment but remained almost unchanged in the control arm (17 (56.7%) before treatment versus 16 (53.3%) after treatment). The number of participants with moderate pertussis decreased from 14 (46.7%) before treatment to 6 (20%) after treatment in the intervention arm, but only from 13 (43.3%) before treatment to 10 (33.3%) after treatment in the control arm. Severe and moderate pertussis were diagnosed using a questionnaire scoring system based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) clinical case definitions of pertussis.
