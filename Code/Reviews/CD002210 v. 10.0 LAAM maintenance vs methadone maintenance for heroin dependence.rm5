<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>LAAM may be more effective at reducing heroin dependence than methadone, but it is associated with adverse effects, some of which may be life-threatening</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Opiate drugs are used to help people reduce their dependence on heroin (an opiate drug). Methadone needs daily doses, but the effects do not last 24 hours for many people. A dose of LAAM (levomethadyl acetate hydrochloride) works for two or three days. LAAM is not as widely available internationally as methadone, and may be withdrawn from the market because of concerns about life-threatening effects on the heart. The review found that LAAM is more effective than methadone at reducing heroin dependence, but there was not enough evidence from trials to draw conclusions about safety.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>LAAM and methadone are both opiate agonists and have been shown to reduce dependence on heroin when given continuously under supervised dosing conditions. LAAM has a long duration of action requiring dosing every two/three days compared to methadone which requires daily dosing. LAAM is not as widely available internationally as methadone, and may be withdrawn from the market following ten cases of life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias and an association with QT prolongation. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To compare the efficacy and acceptability of LAAM maintenance with methadone maintenance in the treatment of heroin dependence. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched MEDLINE (January 1966 - August 2000), PsycINFO (1887 - August 2000), EMBASE (January 1985 - August 2000), and Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Issue 2 2000). We hand searched NIDA monographs until August 2000 and reference lists of articles. The specialised register of trials of the Cochrane Group on Drugs and Alcohol was searched until February 2003.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All randomised controlled trials, controlled clinical trials and controlled prospective studies comparing LAAM and methadone maintenance for the treatment of heroin dependence, outcomes of efficacy or acceptability were included.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data on retention in treatment, heroin use, side-effects and mortality were collected by two reviewers independently. A meta-analysis was performed using RevMan. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Eighteen studies, (15 RCTs, 3 Controlled prospective studies) met the inclusion criteria for the review. Three were excluded from the meta-analysis due to lack of data on retention, heroin use or mortality. Cessation of allocated medication (11 studies, 1473 participants) was greater with LAAM than with methadone, (RR 1.36, 95%CI 1.07-1.73, p=0.001, NNT=7.7 (or 8)). Non-abstinence was less with LAAM (5 studies, 983 participants; RR 0.81, 95%CI 0.72-0.91, p=0.0003, NNT=9.1 (or 10)). In 10 studies (1441 participants) there were 6 deaths from a range of causes, 5 in participants assigned to LAAM (RR 2.28 (95%CI 0.59-8.9, p=0.2). other relevant outcomes, such as quality of life and criminal activity could not be analysed because of lack of information in the primary studies.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>LAAM appears more effective than methadone at reducing heroin use. More LAAM patients than methadone ceased their allocated medication during the studies, but many transferred to methadone and so the significance of this is unclear. There was no difference in safety observed, although there was not enough evidence to comment on uncommon adverse events. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-03-25 14:21:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-03-25 14:19:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The United Nations International Drug Control Programme conservatively estimates that 80 million people worldwide (approximately 1 in 700) are currently abusing heroin and other opiate type substances (<LINK REF="REF-UNIDCP-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNIDCP 1997</LINK>). Although opiates are relatively free from long term adverse health consequences when consumed in a safe manner, they are considered the most harmful of all illicit drugs (<LINK REF="REF-UNIDCP-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNIDCP 1997</LINK>) largely due to their powerful reinforcing effects, the problems of respiratory depression in overdose and blood borne virus spread associated with injecting drug use.</P>
<P>Substance dependence is defined by the World Health Organisation (ICD-10) as the occurrence of three or more of the following components in the preceding 12 months:<BR/>- A strong desire or sense of compulsion to take the substance<BR/>- An impaired capacity to control substance taking behaviour in terms of onset, termination or levels of use<BR/>- Substance use with intention of relieving withdrawal symptoms and with awareness that this strategy is effective<BR/>- Physiological withdrawal state<BR/>- Evidence of tolerance such that increased doses of the substance are required in order to achieve effects originally produced by lower doses<BR/>-Narrowing the personal repertoire of patterns of substance use - with opiate use becoming routine<BR/>-Progressive neglect of alternative pleasures or interests in favour of substance use<BR/>-Persisting with substance use despite clear evidence of overly harmful consequences.</P>
<P>Mortality of untreated heroin dependence is consistently estimated at 1-3% per year, at least half of which is due to heroin overdose (<LINK REF="REF-Darke-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Darke 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Spoorer-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spoorer 1999</LINK>). Follow up studies have found that this risk continues for many years after the diagnosis of heroin dependence is made (<LINK REF="REF-Haastrup-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haastrup 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sanchez_x002d_Carbonell-00" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanchez-Carbonell 00</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bargagli-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bargagli 2001</LINK>) indicating that heroin dependence may be regarded as a chronic condition.</P>
<P>Morbidity from heroin dependence stems largely from blood borne viral illnesses spread by unsafe injecting practices. For example, it is estimated that 5-10% of HIV infections worldwide are due to contaminated injection equipment, with injecting drug users (IDU) making up 6 to 80% of the total HIV infected population in different countries (<LINK REF="REF-UNIDCP-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNIDCP 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Beyond mortality and morbidity statistics, heroin dependence inflicts enormous social and economic costs due to crime, unemployment, relationship breakdown and the cost of law enforcement. In developed countries this has been repeatedly estimated at close to 0.4% of GDP (<LINK REF="REF-UNIDCP-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNIDCP 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>It has been demonstrated that by far the most cost effective way of reducing the harms associated with heroin use are "demand reduction" methods such as the treatment of heroin users (<LINK REF="REF-UNIDCP-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNIDCP 1997</LINK>) as opposed to "supply reduction" measures of law enforcement, border protection and crop eradication.</P>
<P>The aims of treatment are often multilayered, assisting heroin users to:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>reduce their heroin and other drug use and to support their efforts to lead a drug free life</LI>
<LI>search for and treat any underlying medical or psychiatric conditions that have led to the dependence on heroin use</LI>
<LI>reduce or prevent the harms associated with heroin use including overdose, HIV, hepatitis B&amp;C, and problems of the illicit drug lifestyle.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>Different approaches to assisting dependent heroin users include withdrawal (or detoxification) and relapse prevention treatments programs (including naltrexone assisted relapse prevention), therapeutic communities, outpatient drug free counselling and long term opiate substitution (or maintenance). Despite enjoying a mixed popularity among heroin users, treatment providers and policy makers, maintenance treatments such as methadone have consistently been shown to enable dependent heroin users to achieve a sustained reduction in their heroin use (<LINK REF="REF-Ward-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ward 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Dole-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dole 1969</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Yancovitz-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yancovitz 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Gunnel-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gunnel 1981</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Ball-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ball 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Simpson-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simpson 1982</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Newman-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newman 1979</LINK>), at least for the duration of the maintenance treatment.</P>
<P>The basis of maintenance treatments such as methadone is that by substituting methadone for heroin, users will be more able to regain control over their heroin use. Once on a stable dose, experiences of intoxication or withdrawal are infrequent. Although still physically dependent on the maintenance medication there will be less need to spend time on drug related activities and when ready, they may withdraw from the maintenance treatment in an attempt to lead an opiate free life (<LINK REF="REF-Ward-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ward 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>When determining the success of maintenance treatments the outcomes are:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Retention in treatment</LI>
<LI>Reduction in opiate use</LI>
<LI>Continuous abstinence from opiates</LI>
<LI>Global assessments of health</LI>
<LI>Functioning in various life domains (ie social functioning, employment)</LI>
<LI>Seroconversion for HIV and hepatitis</LI>
<LI>Injection risk practices</LI>
<LI>Improvement in co-morbidity</LI>
<LI>Secondary drug use</LI>
<LI>Quality of life measures</LI>
<LI>Safety</LI>
<LI>Satisfaction with treatment</LI>
<LI>Criminal activity</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>Although the vast majority of patients will reduce the frequency of their drug use and the amount they spend on heroin, in practice many people continue to use heroin or other psychoactive drugs while taking maintenance treatments, possibly because they are continuing to experience withdrawal symptoms or because they are seeking a drug effect which is not provided by the maintenance therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Lintzeris-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lintzeris 1996</LINK>). Nonetheless, this group are in frequent contact with treatment providers and have reduced mortality and levels of criminal activity (<LINK REF="REF-Ward-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ward 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>One of the limiting factors of methadone maintenance treatment is the duration of action of each methadone dose, necessitating either daily visits to a pharmacy or the provision of "take-away" doses. Also, for about a third of individuals in treatment, methadone doses do not prevent withdrawal symptoms for the whole 24 hours inter dosing interval (<LINK REF="REF-Dyer-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dyer 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Dyer-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dyer 1999</LINK>). LAAM has the potential to overcome both these problems. Having a much longer duration of action than methadone, providing opiate effects for 48 or 72 hours or even longer depending on the dose (<LINK REF="REF-Walsh-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh 1998</LINK>), LAAM is dispensed on an alternate daily or three times a week basis. LAAM has traditionally been described as a pro-drug with the metabolites nor-LAAM and dinor-LAAM both more potent that LAAM, but recent studies have shown that LAAM itself may have comparable potency to methadone (Eissenberg 1999, <LINK REF="REF-Walsh-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Developed as an analgesic medication in the 1950's, LAAM was abandoned once the long duration of action was identified. In the 1970's it was realised that the long duration of action would be beneficial for opiate substitution therapy and studies were conducted in the heroin dependent population (Ling 1976, Ling 1978, Savage 1976). While methadone is widely available, LAAM has only been marketed in the USA (1993) and several countries in the European Union (Denmark, Germany, The Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom) since approval in 1997. Following 10 cases of life-threatening arrhythmias in association with QT prolongation, the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA) has recommended that marketing authorisation be withdrawn in Europe and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recommended that LAAM not be used as a first line therapy. Several studies and one meta-analysis have been performed comparing LAAM to methadone without showing a consistent difference in the relative efficacy (Ling 1976, Ling 1978, Savage 1976, <LINK REF="REF-Glanz-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glanz 1997</LINK>), hence the need for this Cochrane review.</P>
</BACKGROUND>

<P>1. Electronic Searching<BR/>We searched Medline (January 1966 to August 2000) <I>see</I> <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>, PsycInfo (1887 to August 2000), EMBASE (January 1985 to August 2000), and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Issue 2 2000). The specialised register of trials of the Cochrane Group on Drugs and Alcohol was searched until February 2003.</P>
<P>Studies detected by this strategy not excluded on the basis of title or abstract were retrieved in full.<BR/>
<BR/>2. The bibliography of major review articles and studies was used to search for articles that looked like relevant studies<BR/>3. CPDD Abstracts and NIDA monographs of the last 30 years<BR/>4. Pharmaceutical industry: BI<BR/>5. Personal Contact</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Study Selection</P>
<P>Each potentially relevant study located in the search was obtained as a full article and independently assessed for inclusion by two reviewers. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. Studies that met the inclusion criteria for the review but reported no outcome measures that could be compared to other studies were regarded as "included studies" and referred to in narrative review but not included in the meta-analysis.</P>
<P>Assessment of the methodological quality:</P>
<P>Study quality was assessed according to the quality scales developed by the Cochrane collaboration drug and alcohol review group. Each study was given a score out of 16. The quality score was used as a descriptive feature of the study rather than a means of exclusion. Sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the effect of excluding studies with scores significantly lower than the others. In addition a regression analysis was used to test the effect of quality on the outcomes measured. </P>
<P>Data extraction</P>
<P>For each study chosen for inclusion data extraction was completed independently by two reviewers considering the outcomes mentioned above. Any disagreement was resolved by consensus. Authors of recent studies (post 1982) were contacted for additional information. <BR/>Definitions of primary outcome measures used were as follows:</P>
<P>01 Treatment cessation<BR/>01.01 Cessation of allocated medication - Proportion of those allocated to a particular medication who cease that medication prior to the completion of the study.<BR/>01.02 Cessation of all opioid substitution therapy - Proportion of those allocated to a particular medication who cease all opioid substitution therapy (both LAAM and methadone) prior to the completion of the study. Missing doses were allowed as per individual study protocols but not "dropping out" and then subsequent recommencement of maintenance treatment. <BR/>01.03 Cessation of allocated medication (incomparable LAAM and methadone doses) - as per 01.01 but for studies that used LAAM doses fixed at greater than 1.4 or less than 1.0 times the methadone dose.</P>
<P>02 Heroin use<BR/>02.01 Non abstinence<BR/>Proportion of those allocated to a treatment group who do not demonstrated or report a period of abstinence. Abstinence was defined as no heroin use for at least a four week period at some time during the study. <BR/>02.02 Percentage of urine tests indicative of heroin use as a proportion of those collected (per person per week). Mean and standard deviation of each individuals' percentage of urine tests negative for opiates. The denominator for each individual is the number of urine tests collected. <BR/>02.03 Number of urine tests indicative of heroin use as a proportion of those collected (per study). This is a statistically invalid approximation outcome included for reference only. It is calculated by taking the proportion of the total number of urine specimens collected in each treatment group indicative of heroin use and converting it to a fraction of the number allocated to each group. For example if in one treatment group of 50 people 1000 specimens were collected of which 500 were negative for opiates then the recorded proportion is 25/50. This approximates (albeit badly) the scenario in which only one urine specimen is collected from each study participant.<BR/>02.04 Non abstinence (incomparable LAAM and methadone doses) - as per 02.01 but for studies that used LAAM doses fixed at greater than 1.4 or less than 1.0 times the methadone dose.</P>
<P>03 Mortality <BR/>03.01 All cause mortality - any death due to any cause during the study period. </P>
<P>04 Reasons for cessation of treatment - post hoc outcome measure<BR/>04.01 Drop out due to side effects - proportion who cease allocated medication due to "side effects", "not liking drug", or "dose too high" <BR/>04.02 Drop out due to medication not holding - proportion who cease allocated medication before the end of the study period due to "drug not holding" (ie not preventing withdrawal symptoms between doses).</P>
<P>Data on the other outcomes were collected but analysis was not attempted due to a lack of data in the primary studies.</P>
<P>Data synthesis </P>
<P>The studies were stratified by the type of intervention. Flexible dose studies were compared with flexible dose studies. Fixed dose studies with comparable doses of methadone and LAAM (1:1 to 1:1.4) were compared separately. Studies with non comparable LAAM and methadone doses were examined separately. Studies were divided into those which examine the effect of LAAM alone vs methadone and those that examine the effect of LAAM and methadone combined vs methadone alone (ie in which subjects had a choice between LAAM and methadone in the intervention arm). Studies were also stratified on the basis of population (those using street heroin users at baseline and those using methadone maintained volunteers) and by outcomes (when outcome measures that were slightly different were pooled). Meta-analysis and narrative review were performed where appropriate for each of the nominated outcomes. The denominator for each outcome was the number of people allocated to each treatment group. Cross-over trials were examined as parallel group studies, taking the first treatment period only. Non randomised trials were included in separate meta-analyses to randomised trials.</P>
<P>Statistical analysis: </P>
<P>Statistical analysis was performed using the Revman software package (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2000</LINK>). In order to make some use of the heroin use data from earlier studies in which heroin use data was not reported adequately, a dichotomous variable "Number of urine tests indicative of heroin use as a proportion of those collected (per study)", was created. This is an approximation that was used in a previous meta-analysis of LAAM vs methadone (<LINK REF="REF-Glanz-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glanz 1997</LINK>). </P>
<P>The relative risk was used to compare dichotomous measures and the weighted mean difference for continuous measures. Where significant heterogeneity was detected the random effects model was used.</P>

<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>Eighteen studies, (15 RCTs and 3 controlled prospective studies) met the inclusion criteria for the review. Three were excluded from the meta-analysis due to lack of data on retention, heroin use or mortality. A description of included and excluded studies is contained in the 'Characteristics of Included Studies' and the 'Characteristics of Excluded Studies' tables. All of the studies were conducted in the US in the 1970's apart from recent trials in the US and Australia. Except for <LINK REF="STD-Irwin-1976a" TYPE="STUDY">Irwin 1976a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Grevert-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Grevert 1977</LINK>, all the earlier studies were conducted entirely with males as US regulations restricted the use of LAAM in females. The larger studies (Ling 1978; Ling 1976) were conducted amongst US war veterans. Eight studies were conducted using current dependent street heroin users at entry and eight used methadone maintained volunteers. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Whysner-1978-phase-2" TYPE="STUDY">Whysner 1978 phase 2</LINK>) recruited both. In <LINK REF="STD-Grevert-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Grevert 1977</LINK> patients were already on LAAM and methadone prior to the commencement of the study. No studies excluded cocaine users and the only study that reported levels of cocaine use (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 2000</LINK>) found 45% of the sample met DSM IV criteria for abuse or dependence. The mean age between studies varied from 25 to 26 yrs and the mean duration of heroin use from 5 to 11 yrs. Employment rates varied from full employment (<LINK REF="STD-Freedman-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Freedman 1981</LINK>) to approximately 30% in the other studies in which it was reported. </P>
<P>All studies except two (Ling 1976; <LINK REF="STD-Lehmann-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Lehmann 1976</LINK>) used flexible dosing regimens with dose adjusted by physicians. All studies used LAAM three times weekly (tiw) except for <LINK REF="STD-White-2002" TYPE="STUDY">White 2002</LINK> (alternate days), <LINK REF="STD-Ritter-2001-A" TYPE="STUDY">Ritter 2001 A</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ritter-2001-B" TYPE="STUDY">Ritter 2001 B</LINK> (flexible), <LINK REF="STD-Lehmann-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Lehmann 1976</LINK> (every three days), and <LINK REF="STD-Irwin-1976a" TYPE="STUDY">Irwin 1976a</LINK> (daily or alternate days). The LAAM dose was increased for the 3 day (Friday) dose by 10-40% (alternatively 5-10mg) except for 3 studies (Ling 1976; Savage 1976; <LINK REF="STD-Senay-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Senay 1974</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Goldstein-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Goldstein 1974</LINK>, the three day dose was initially the same as the two day dose but was later increased by 33%. The mean "2 day" doses of LAAM (for example the Monday and Wednesday doses of a Monday, Wednesday, Friday regimen) varied between 50% and 142% of the doses prescribed to the methadone groups. </P>
<P>There was also significant variability in the attendance requirements. Methadone patients were required to attend for dosing 2-7 days per week, with methadone take-away doses given for the remaining days. Except for the Australian studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ritter-2001-A" TYPE="STUDY">Ritter 2001 A</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ritter-2001-B" TYPE="STUDY">Ritter 2001 B</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-White-2002" TYPE="STUDY">White 2002</LINK>) LAAM patients were required to attend at least 3 days per week (as no take-away doses were given) and in some cases up to 7 days a week when placebo doses were also given. Generous methadone take-away policies and restrictions on LAAM take-away doses in America meant that methadone patients in some studies (Ling 1976; Ling 1978; Savage 1976; <LINK REF="STD-Senay-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Senay 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whysner-1978-phase-2" TYPE="STUDY">Whysner 1978 phase 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zaks-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Zaks 1972</LINK>) could end up attending less frequently than LAAM patients. Overall, however, LAAM patients were required to attend for dosing on a similar number of days (ratio 0.43 to 1.43) to methadone patients. </P>
<P>Two studies used fixed dosing schedules that were incomparable. Comparable LAAM:methadone dose ratios were determined "a priori" to be between 1.0 and 1.4 in accordance with current thinking (Eissenberg 1999; <LINK REF="REF-Marion-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marion 1995</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Goldstein-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Goldstein 1974</LINK> the LAAM dose was fixed at 75mg post induction, 1.5 times the methadone dose (50mg). In Ling 1976, the LAAM dose was fixed at 80mg post induction, 1.6 times the lower dose methadone group (50mg) and 0.8 times the higher dose methadone group (100mg). </P>
<P>Seven studies were blinded (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Goldstein-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Goldstein 1974</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Karp_x002d_Gelernter-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Karp-Gelernter 1982</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lehmann-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Lehmann 1976</LINK>, Ling 1976, Savage 1976, <LINK REF="STD-Senay-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Senay 1974</LINK>). Blinding was performed by providing LAAM patients with placebos on non dosing days using 30mg dextromethorphan (<LINK REF="STD-Karp_x002d_Gelernter-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Karp-Gelernter 1982</LINK>; Savage 1976; <LINK REF="STD-Senay-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Senay 1974</LINK>), quinine (<LINK REF="STD-Goldstein-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Goldstein 1974</LINK>), or dextromethorphan plus quinine (Ling 1976). In the remaining 2 studies the placebo used is not clear. In all blinded studies, if patients were given take-away doses, these were always on placebo days; methadone patients took home methadone, LAAM patients took home placebo. Dosing of blind studies was done in a variety of ways: fixed dosing (<LINK REF="STD-Goldstein-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Goldstein 1974</LINK>; Ling 1976; <LINK REF="STD-Lehmann-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Lehmann 1976</LINK>); dosing formula based on urine results and attendance (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 2000</LINK>); or under clinician control based on a 1:1(Savage 1976), 1.2:1 (<LINK REF="STD-Senay-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Senay 1974</LINK>) or 1.3:1 (<LINK REF="STD-Karp_x002d_Gelernter-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Karp-Gelernter 1982</LINK>) dose equivalence with methadone. Of these three studies, clinicians were described as blinded in Savage 1976 and <LINK REF="STD-Senay-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Senay 1974</LINK> but it is unclear for <LINK REF="STD-Karp_x002d_Gelernter-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Karp-Gelernter 1982</LINK> as they gave Friday dose increases to LAAM patients who requested them. No studies published data to support the effectiveness of the blinding process and the investigators of two of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Goldstein-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Goldstein 1974</LINK>; Savage 1976) commented that they thought the blind was ineffective. </P>
<P>The studies varied considerably in the levels of heroin use during treatment, with four studies (Ling 1978; Savage 1976; <LINK REF="STD-White-2002" TYPE="STUDY">White 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zaks-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Zaks 1972</LINK>) reporting considerably lower levels of heroin use in treatment than the others. Ling 1978 is the most notable with 50% abstinent for the entire duration of the study, although it is reported that a particularly stable group of long term methadone maintained patients were predominant amongst those who volunteered for the study (<LINK REF="REF-Newmann-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newmann 1975</LINK>). It is not clear why Savage 1976 (which selected street heroin users at baseline) or <LINK REF="STD-Zaks-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Zaks 1972</LINK> (which selected prior maintenance treatment failures) have achieved greater reduction in heroin use than other studies. </P>
<P>All but three studies attempted to compare LAAM alone vs methadone alone. The Turning Point studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ritter-2001-A" TYPE="STUDY">Ritter 2001 A</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ritter-2001-B" TYPE="STUDY">Ritter 2001 B</LINK>) compare standard therapy plus LAAM (ie patients were able to change from LAAM to methadone if they so desired) to standard therapy alone (in which only methadone was available). <LINK REF="STD-Resnick-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Resnick 1982</LINK> allowed both the LAAM and the methadone groups to switch medications freely, testing only the effect of starting with one or the other.</P>
<P>Only the Turning Point studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ritter-2001-A" TYPE="STUDY">Ritter 2001 A</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ritter-2001-B" TYPE="STUDY">Ritter 2001 B</LINK>) and the Senay studies (<LINK REF="STD-Senay-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Senay 1977</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Senay-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Senay 1974</LINK>) attempted to follow up patients who had ceased taking the study medication. In other studies, participants were followed until they ceased taking the study medication or stopped meeting the trial requirements. Of these, only <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 2000</LINK>, and the subset of <LINK REF="STD-Whysner-1978-phase-2" TYPE="STUDY">Whysner 1978 phase 2</LINK> published in <LINK REF="REF-Marcovici-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marcovici 1981</LINK> reported if LAAM patients who "dropped out" of the study were transferring to methadone. Of the 16 studies that measured heroin use, 13 performed regular urine tests, one collected hair, and 2 relied on self reported heroin use. Urine testing was conducted between once and thrice weekly and reported as the percentage of collected specimens positive (or negative) for opiates. Only <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 2000</LINK> reported the urine test data as a continous measure with the mean and standard deviation of the individual patients' data. Two studies (Ling 1976; Ling 1978) reported urine data using a complex scoring system that did not allow comparison with other studies. <BR/> <BR/>Three studies met the inclusion criteria but were not included in the meta analysis because of incomplete data (<LINK REF="STD-Irwin-1976a" TYPE="STUDY">Irwin 1976a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lehmann-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Lehmann 1976</LINK>), or because no outcomes were measured that could be included in the meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Grevert-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Grevert 1977</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is also worth noting that the largest LAAM vs methadone randomised trial conducted to date (<LINK REF="STD-Whysner-1978-phase-2" TYPE="STUDY">Whysner 1978 phase 2</LINK>, n=1300+) has remained unpublished apart from some preliminary results (<LINK REF="REF-Whysner-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whysner 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thomas-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 1979</LINK>), reports on mood states (<LINK REF="REF-Newmann-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newmann 1979</LINK>) and one of the sites which published separately (<LINK REF="REF-Marcovici-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marcovici 1981</LINK>(n=130) - the data from which was used for this review). The study was conducted in the mid 1970's by a private company (John Whysner and associates) and provided data to support LAAM's registration in the USA. To date, it has not been possible to locate heroin use, retention, or mortality outcomes for the remaining 1170 or more participants. </P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>Methodological quality of included studies was assessed using the quality scales developed by the drug and alcohol Cochrane review group for experimental studies and controlled prospective studies. Criteria and maximum scores measured in these scales for experimental studies are: randomisation (2), allocation concealment (6), blinding (3), inclusion of patients in the analysis (3), similarity at baseline (1), equality of treatment - apart from the experimental intervention (1). Criteria and maximum scores measured in these scales for controlled prospective studies are: determination of the population base (2), confounding control (8), inclusion of all patients in the analysis (4), description of base characteristics (1), description of treatments (1). </P>
<P>Since most of the studies were published many years ago, attempts were not made to contact authors for quality information. This has produced a bias in quality scores to the Turning Point studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ritter-2001-A" TYPE="STUDY">Ritter 2001 A</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ritter-2001-B" TYPE="STUDY">Ritter 2001 B</LINK>) in which the information was already known to the review authors. This has not influenced the meta-analysis, as quality scores were not used to exclude or weight studies. </P>
<P>With the exception of the studies that were excluded from the meta-analysis due to lack of relevant data (<LINK REF="STD-Grevert-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Grevert 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Irwin-1976a" TYPE="STUDY">Irwin 1976a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lehmann-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Lehmann 1976</LINK>) all studies bar one received fairly similar quality scores. That study was <LINK REF="STD-Resnick-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Resnick 1982</LINK> which received low scores because it was not a randomised study, and did not make any other attempts to control for confounders. It is included in the meta-analysis for retention (the only outcome measured) in accordance with our protocol not to exclude studies on the basis of quality scores alone. <LINK REF="STD-Resnick-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Resnick 1982</LINK> is a small study, the results are consistent with other studies and excluding it does not change the results. It is also a slightly different study to the others in that LAAM was available to those ceasing methadone treatment whereas usually only the converse was the case.</P>
<P>With regards to the quality of the remaining studies (which are all experimental studies);<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>The method of randomisation was stated only in one of the published papers (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 2000</LINK>). This is possibly due to the era in which these studies were conducted in which the method of randomisation was generally not expected to be published. In the remaining studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ritter-2001-A" TYPE="STUDY">Ritter 2001 A</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ritter-2001-B" TYPE="STUDY">Ritter 2001 B</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-White-2002" TYPE="STUDY">White 2002</LINK>) the method of randomisation was adequate. In no cases did studies report inadequate randomisation techniques. </LI>
<LI>The method of allocation concealment was not stated in all but three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ritter-2001-A" TYPE="STUDY">Ritter 2001 A</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ritter-2001-B" TYPE="STUDY">Ritter 2001 B</LINK>; Ling 1978) and this is possibly also due to the era in which the studies were published. In no cases were inadequate allocation techniques reported.</LI>
<LI>Although credit was given for attempts at blinding, is it not known whether blinding was effective since no studies provided data to support the effectiveness of the blind and two authors reported that they thought their blinding attempts were ineffective (<LINK REF="STD-Goldstein-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Goldstein 1974</LINK>; Savage 1976). Blinding the dose also makes it difficult to detect any effects that might be due to the reduced dispensing frequency of LAAM vs methadone. Blinding in the collection of outcome measures was only specifically mentioned in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 2000</LINK>), although this is unlikely to have made much difference to the "hard" outcomes of retention, heroin use and mortality.</LI>
<LI>Failure to conduct "Intention To Treat" analyses and to follow up all patients beyond cessation of the allocated medication was the major flaw of all the studies. Only <LINK REF="STD-Ritter-2001-A" TYPE="STUDY">Ritter 2001 A</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ritter-2001-B" TYPE="STUDY">Ritter 2001 B</LINK> attempted follow up of all patients for all outcomes but achieved less than 80% follow up. <LINK REF="STD-Senay-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Senay 1974</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Senay-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Senay 1977</LINK> attempted follow up to determine treatment status only. Follow up of trial participants who are not in treatment is notoriously difficult but is nonetheless a major limitation of all the studies.</LI>
<LI>Baseline demographics were generally well reported with the exception of the amount of heroin use, which is an important predictive variable for studies using methadone stabilised patients at baseline.</LI>
<LI>Equality of treatment is difficult to determine. Factors such as dose levels, induction rates (from heroin), transfer protocols (from methadone), maintenance dose levels, dosing frequency, dispensing frequency, dose adjustments for altered dosing frequency, counselling availability and quality have all been shown to (or can reasonably be expected to) influence outcome. Some studies had multiple groups to deliberately test the effects of dose levels (Ling 1976; <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 2000</LINK>), dispensing frequency (<LINK REF="STD-Karp_x002d_Gelernter-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Karp-Gelernter 1982</LINK>), availability of counselling (<LINK REF="STD-Senay-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Senay 1974</LINK>) and dosing frequency (<LINK REF="STD-Irwin-1976a" TYPE="STUDY">Irwin 1976a</LINK>). These groups are obviously not comparable, had different outcomes and were not included in the review. Often there was inadequate reporting of treatment methods to determine the equivalence of treatment. Maintenance dose levels and frequency of dispensing were usually not reported adequately.</LI>
</UL>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>Of the 18 studies included in the review, 15 were included in the meta-analyses. Although initially it was hoped that it would be possible to examine more outcome measures; of the primary outcome measures identified only retention and heroin use were suitable for meta-analysis (global measures of treatment were not examined as an outcome measure due to differences in definition). Of the secondary outcome measures only mortality (as a measure of safety) was suitable for meta-analysis. </P>
<P>01 Treatment cessation</P>
<P>01.01 Cessation of allocated medication <BR/>Ten studies were included with 1454 participants. Patients were more likely to have ceased LAAM by the end of the study period than methadone (RR 1.36, 95%CI 1.07-1.73, p=0.001). The difference in retention was more marked in shorter (3 month vs 6 or 12 month) studies (1.64 vs 1.24), suggesting that the difference in retention mainly occurs early on. Results were robust to sensitivity analyses in that excluding <LINK REF="STD-Resnick-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Resnick 1982</LINK> as it was the poorest quality study or including Ling 1976 and <LINK REF="STD-Goldstein-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Goldstein 1974</LINK> (excluded because no two treatment groups had equivalent LAAM:methadone dose ratios) made no difference to the results. There was no trend for quality, blinding or maintenance treatment status at baseline to influence outcome. Using the pooled risk difference, an average number needed to treat (NNT) with LAAM for one additional patient to cease treatment with their allocated medication is 7.7 (or 8). </P>
<P>01.02 Cessation of all opioid substitution therapy<BR/>Two studies were included with 179 participants. Although <LINK REF="STD-Senay-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Senay 1974</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Senay-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Senay 1977</LINK> reported treatment status at the end of the study they do not report if treatment has been continuous during that time and so they were not included. There were no significant differences between the two groups (RR 1.01, 95%CI 0.58-1.76, p=1). Confidence intervals are large enough to include a 10% effect size in either direction but exclude the larger effect size seen with methadone alone vs LAAM alone.</P>
<P>01.03 Cessation of allocated medication (incomparable LAAM and methadone doses)<BR/>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Goldstein-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Goldstein 1974</LINK>; Ling 1976) compared LAAM doses greater than 1.4 times the methadone dose (384 participants). Treatment cessation was greater with LAAM (RR 1.22, 95%CI 1.03-1.46, p=0.02). One study (Ling 1976: 284 participants) compared LAAM doses less than methadone doses. Treatment cessation was greater with LAAM (RR 1.44, 95%CI 1.18-1.77, p=0.0004). </P>
<P>01.04 Cessation of allocated medication (non RCTs)<BR/>One study was included with 19 participants. There was no difference detected due to lack of power (RR 1.13, 95%CI 0.43-2.93)</P>
<P>02 Heroin use</P>
<P>02.01 Non abstinence<BR/>Five studies were included with 983 participants. Continuous abstinence of at least 4 weeks was reported in 3 different ways by different studies but the results were similar and were combined. There were significantly lower rates of non abstinence in subjects allocated to LAAM treatment (RR 0.81, 95%CI 0.72-0.91, p=0.0003). There was no trend for quality or blinding to influence outcome. All studies used objective measures (urine or hair testing) except for <LINK REF="STD-Ritter-2001-A" TYPE="STUDY">Ritter 2001 A</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ritter-2001-B" TYPE="STUDY">Ritter 2001 B</LINK> which used self reported abstinence. Exclusion of these studies in a sensitivity analysis did not significantly alter the finding. Using the pooled risk difference, an average NNT with LAAM for one less patient to have a period of non-abstinence is 9.1 (or 10).</P>
<P>02.02 Percentage of urine tests negative for opiates of those collected (per person per week)<BR/>This preferred method of reporting repeated urine test data, a continuous measure of heroin use, was only reported by one study, with 110 comparable participants. It found a Weighted Mean Difference (WMD) of -10.0, 95%CI -11.5 to -8.5, p&lt;0.00001) in favour of LAAM. </P>
<P>02.03 Number of urine tests indicative of heroin use as a proportion of those collected (per study) <BR/>This dichotomous approximation of outcome 02.02 is used in this meta-analysis because only half the studies published heroin use data that could be used in the above comparisons (02.01 or 02.02). Eight studies were included with 1262 participants. The analysis using this method was consistent with the results of the other methods (RR 0.87, 95%CI 0.72-1.05, p=0.15), however the meta-analysis for this measure are difficult to interpret as this approach is statistically flawed (<LINK REF="REF-Davoli" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davoli</LINK>). </P>
<P>02.04 Non abstinence (incomparable LAAM and methadone doses)<BR/>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Goldstein-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Goldstein 1974</LINK>: 80 participants) was included comparing LAAM doses greater than 1.4 times the methadone dose. The other incomparable dose study (Ling 1976) was not included because abstinence was not reported. There was no difference detected due to inadequate numbers (RR 1.12, 95%CI 0.74-1.69, p=0.6).</P>
<P>03 Mortality</P>
<P>03.01 All cause mortality. </P>
<P>Ten studies with 1441 participants were included. Five deaths were reported in patients randomised to LAAM, two were violent, one was due a heroin overdose (during LAAM induction), one due to alcohol induced liver failure, and one was a motor vehicle accident in a patient who had ceased LAAM some months earlier. The one death in the methadone group was due to a brain tumour in a patient with HIV. There was a non-significant trend for mortality to be higher with LAAM (RR2.28, 95%CI 0.59-8.90, p=0.2), however there were not enough deaths in this sample to draw any meaningful conclusions. </P>
<P>04 Reasons for cessation of treatment </P>
<P>This outcome was included post-hoc to try and explain the observed difference in retention when it was noticed that several studies had included reasons for drop out. The studies in which it was measured reported that 30-60% of LAAM drop outs were either due to LAAM side-effects or for the medication not holding. Patients were stratified by treatment status at baseline, as it was anticipated that those already taking methadone were less likely to experience problems with methadone than street heroin users not taking any opioid substitute. Studies with mixed heroin users and methadone stabilised patients (<LINK REF="STD-Whysner-1978-phase-2" TYPE="STUDY">Whysner 1978 phase 2</LINK>), and incomparable doses (<LINK REF="STD-Goldstein-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Goldstein 1974</LINK>; Ling 1976) were excluded.</P>
<P>04.01 Drop out due to side effects.</P>
<P>Street heroin users. This was reported in two studies with 209 participants. There were almost twice as many drop outs due to side effects with LAAM than with methadone (RR 1.88,95%CI 1.08-3.27, p=0.02). </P>
<P>Methadone stabilised patients. Two studies were included (731 participants). More drop outs were seen due to LAAM side effects than methadone (RR 2.54, 95%CI 1.45-4.44, p=0.001). </P>
<P>04.02 Drop out due to medication not holding.</P>
<P>Street heroin users: this was reported in one study with 110 comparable participants. There were inadequate numbers for a clear difference (RR 0.67,95%CI 0.20-2.23, p=0.5). </P>
<P>Methadone stabilised patients: two studies were included (628 participants). 18.9% of those who transferred from methadone to LAAM dropped out due to the medication not holding compared to none who stayed on methadone (RR 117.40, 95%CI 7.29-1889.72, p=0.0008).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-03-25 14:21:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>With regards to efficacy, this systematic review and meta-analysis finds methadone and LAAM broadly comparable in the populations studied. Cessation of allocated medication was higher with LAAM than with methadone, whereas a greater number of LAAM patients had periods of at least 4 weeks of no heroin use. With regards to safety, there were no gross differences detected between the two medications and there was inadequate evidence to comment on uncommon events such as may be due to differences in QT prolongation.</P>
<P>These remarks need some further qualification. In particular, the finding of better retention on methadone requires careful interpretation.</P>
<P>Firstly, while LAAM patients generally had the option to "drop out" and transfer to methadone (either within the study or elsewhere), methadone patients (with the exception of the <LINK REF="STD-Resnick-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Resnick 1982</LINK> study), did not have the option to transfer to LAAM and so would have been more inclined to stay in the study. What is the evidence that this occurred? Several studies (Ling 1978, <LINK REF="STD-Whysner-1978-phase-2" TYPE="STUDY">Whysner 1978 phase 2</LINK>, Savage 1976) report this qualification in discussing their findings. In addition, <LINK REF="REF-Marcovici-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marcovici 1981</LINK>(part of the <LINK REF="STD-Whysner-1978-phase-2" TYPE="STUDY">Whysner 1978 phase 2</LINK> study) followed up the 14 LAAM patients who transferred to methadone (and were regarded as drop outs), reporting no noticeable clinical improvement.</P>
<P>Secondly, it appears that an anti-LAAM sentiment was prevalent in America at the time of many of the studies. <LINK REF="REF-Newmann-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newmann 1975</LINK> documents this and reports that most patients entered the two larger studies (Ling 1976, Ling 1978) were hoping to be allocated to the methadone group.</P>
<P>If these two points led to significantly higher drop outs with LAAM it would be expected that blinding studies would have affected retention, which it did not. However it is doubtful that blinding was effective as no studies reported data supporting the effectiveness of the blind, and two studies (Savage 1976, <LINK REF="STD-Goldstein-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Goldstein 1974</LINK>) suggested the blind was ineffective. Since all patients would know that methadone is given every day and LAAM every two or three days, it is doubtful that anyone experienced in the subjective effects of opiates would have difficulty determining the difference between methadone and placebo, particularly as active take-home doses were given to methadone patients whereas LAAM patients were given take-home placebo.</P>
<P>The third reason is that of the take-away policies. Federal law in the USA restricts the use of LAAM take-home doses wheres methadone was frequently administered once or twice a week with take-home doses for the intervening days. The take-home doses are attractive for various reasons: they can be sold; they mean less time spent travelling to the dispensing point; and less disruption to work, family and so on. In the one study which compared two dispensing schedules, less frequent dispensing was associated with better retention for both LAAM and methadone (<LINK REF="STD-Karp_x002d_Gelernter-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Karp-Gelernter 1982</LINK>). Methadone take-home policies in the US at the time of the studies generally did not allow take-home dose at the start of treatment, but then incrementally take-home doses were given (if urine tests were clear of opiates), up to 6 take-home doses per week. Thus many LAAM patients actually attended more frequently than some methadone patients.</P>
<P>A fourth possible reason is that of dosing schedules. Maintenance dose levels have an impact on efficacy, as demonstrated by Ling 1976, which found 80mg LAAM more effective than 50mg methadone but not 100mg methadone. Other studies that have compared doses levels confirm this finding (<LINK REF="REF-Eissenberg-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eissenberg 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Oliveto-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oliveto 1998</LINK> , <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 2000</LINK>). The doses prescribed in the studies have not been consistently reported and the equivalence of maintenance dose levels can not be determined for some flexible dose studies. Other dosing factors such as the obligatory Monday / Wednesday / Friday dosing with often only minimal dose increases on the Friday and 1:1 transfers from methadone (probably 1.2-1.3 is more comparable) may have impacted upon the results.</P>
<P>On the other hand, it does appear that LAAM has higher levels of drop out due to side-effects than methadone as was detected in our post-hoc analysis of heroin users commencing LAAM or methadone. This probably contributed to some of the poorer retention seen with LAAM.</P>
<P>Combined, these facts make interpretation of the retention findings difficult. For those communities considering making LAAM available in addition to methadone, a more meaningful comparison is between methadone alone and methadone +/- LAAM, with all patients followed up to the end point of the study. This was the approach in <LINK REF="STD-Ritter-2001-A" TYPE="STUDY">Ritter 2001 A</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ritter-2001-B" TYPE="STUDY">Ritter 2001 B</LINK>. Another approach is to compare methadone first to LAAM first in the situation where both medications are available (<LINK REF="STD-Resnick-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Resnick 1982</LINK>).</P>
<P>One result of this meta-analysis was the finding of less heroin use with LAAM. This finding is consistent in magnitude across different heroin use measures and with the results of the larger studies although the statistical significance of the finding varied according to the way in which heroin use was measured. The use of urine testing as a continuous outcome measure was highly significant (p=0.00001) but included only one study. The use of the dichotomous outcome measure abstinence/non-abstinence was also highly significant (p=0.0003) and included 5 studies. The use of the urine data as a dichotomous variable when adequate information for inclusion as a continuous variable produced a non significant result (p=0.15) but, as mentioned previously, there are problems with the use of this data for meta-analysis (see below).</P>
<P>Heroin use data, however, is not without its own complexities. Continuous heroin use data measures used in this review were urine testing, self report and hair testing. Urine test data in the form published by all studies except <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 2000</LINK> is not suitable for meta-analysis because using the urine test instead of the subjects as the unit of analysis violates the assumption of independence between observations (<LINK REF="REF-Davoli" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davoli</LINK>). Urine test data are also complicated by large numbers of missing tests both during treatment and after treatment (when most studies stop attempting to collect specimens). The only way to perform a true meta-analysis of urine test results under these circumstances is to get access to individual patient data (<LINK REF="REF-Barnett-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnett 2001</LINK>) or ask authors to provide additional information about the results of urine testing. Given that the studies occurred so long ago, it was not thought possible to re analyse the urine test data and an approximation method used in an earlier meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Glanz-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glanz 1997</LINK>) is included for reference. Self report heroin use data (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ritter-2001-A" TYPE="STUDY">Ritter 2001 A</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ritter-2001-B" TYPE="STUDY">Ritter 2001 B</LINK>) is easier to collect (both during and after treatment) but may be biased when subjects and researchers are not blinded. Hair testing (<LINK REF="STD-White-2002" TYPE="STUDY">White 2002</LINK>) is a potential alternative but invasive and difficult to use as a continuous measure (<LINK REF="REF-Kintz-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kintz 1998</LINK>). An additional problem with the statistical interpretation of all continuous heroin use data for the population in treatment is that it tends to be bi-modal, containing a significant proportion who do not use any heroin at all in the period of measurement. Including treatment "drop outs" further complicates matters by including a third group using heroin more frequently.</P>
<P>Abstinence is a useful measure of heroin use for meta-analysis as it is easy to interpret and can include urine, hair and self-report measures of heroin use. Unfortunately, not all earlier studies included a measure of abstinence in their results. It is only because recent studies have reported abstinence more consistently that this meta-analysis was able to assess this treatment effect.</P>
<P>All studies except <LINK REF="STD-Ritter-2001-A" TYPE="STUDY">Ritter 2001 A</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ritter-2001-B" TYPE="STUDY">Ritter 2001 B</LINK> measure and report heroin use only on those in treatment within the study protocol. This makes interpretation of heroin use data more difficult as the population which is being measured in unclear. Depending upon the way the data is analysed, this can bias heroin use data either towards or away from the medication with better retention. Bias towards the medication with better retention may occur, for example, because there tends to be less drug use the later in treatment. On the other hand, bias away from the medication with better retention may occur, for example, when defining abstinence as "no positive urine tests throughout the whole study" (Ling 1978). Clearly, the longer one stays in the study the greater chance of a positive urine test. These problems are avoided when heroin use is measured in all participants, not just those in treatment.</P>
<P>Is the finding of less heroin use with LAAM consistent with other data? Pharmacology studies suggest that LAAM (with its active metabolites nor-LAAM and dinor-LAAM) has an extremely long duration of action which does not drop away before the next dose to the same extent as methadone (Newcombe 2000). When asked, most patients who had experienced both LAAM and methadone maintenance said they preferred LAAM (<LINK REF="STD-Freedman-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Freedman 1981</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-White-2002" TYPE="STUDY">White 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Tennant-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tennant 1986</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trueblood-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Trueblood 1978</LINK>) because they felt it provided a smoother duration of action, "held" better, and was better at blocking the effects of heroin. This is despite the fact that greater numbers of patients ceased LAAM citing side-effects as the main reason. The fact that a small percentage of patients prefer methadone because they say they feel more intoxicated with methadone also supports the notion that there is a greater peak and deeper trough in opiate effects with daily methadone than alternate daily LAAM.</P>
<P>Due to the lack of consistently measured safety outcomes, meta-analysis was only performed on mortality data. While the ratio of 5 deaths in the LAAM groups to 1 in the methadone is concerning, the meta-analysis was inconclusive due to the small number of deaths. Larger cohorts suggest that LAAM mortality rates are similar to methadone (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 1979</LINK>).</P>
<P>LAAM is currently under increased scrutiny as a series of cardiac arrhythmias have been reported, in association with a prolongation of the QT interval. The exact frequency of this occurrence cannot be accurately determined as previous events may have gone undetected. No such events were reported in the 1071 LAAM patients reported on in these studies. However, only 2 of the studies regularly performed electrocardiograms (ECGs) and neither of them specifically measured QT prolongation.</P>
<P>One safety issue that is not measured in any of the studies here is that of take-home medication which repeatedly leads to the deaths of children (<LINK REF="REF-Robinson-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 1971</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Spadari-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spadari 2000</LINK>) and other opiate naive individuals and those who combine them with other opiates. This is an area in which LAAM provides an advantage over methadone in that fewer take-home doses are necessary. LAAM has been proposed as a "no take-home" alternative to methadone (Ling 1978) and this has been the policy in the USA. One effect of this, however, has been to make LAAM less attractive than methadone to stable patients who can get take-home doses with methadone.</P>
<P>For a patient making the decision to commence methadone or LAAM, which should they commence first? There are likely to be many factors involved; cost, safety, attendance requirements, subjective drug effect, likelihood of achieving desired treatment goals and so on. Since efficacy is fairly similar and since it is fairly straight forward to transfer from one drug to the other, it is difficult to argue on these grounds that one or other should be commenced first. Many patients may prefer to choose on the grounds of perceived safety risk (for example that associated with prolonged QT interval) or convenience (availability, cost, frequency of dosing) and then re-evaluate their choice if there are adverse effects or the desired reduction in heroin use is not achieved.</P>
<P>Is LAAM more suitable for those patients continuing to use heroin in a methadone maintenance program? This is a question that has not been directly addressed by the studies in this review. Seven studies took a population of methadone maintained patients, some using heroin and some not. They did not deliberately select methadone treatment failures. There was no overall difference in outcomes in these studies as compared to those studies selecting heroin users at baseline. Clinicians experienced in the use of both LAAM and methadone (<LINK REF="REF-Tennant-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tennant 1986</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Valdivia-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Valdivia 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Casadonte-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Casadonte 1996</LINK>) report that LAAM is a good alternative for those who cannot tolerate or do not respond to methadone and this is supported by case series data (<LINK REF="STD-Malkerneker-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Malkerneker 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tennant-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tennant 1988</LINK>) but this finding has not been tested in this review.</P>
<P>In conclusion, LAAM patients stopped taking LAAM more than methadone patients ceased methadone. The reasons for this are unclear, but may include side-effects of LAAM, a preference for the subjective effects of methadone, or the designs of the studies themselves. On the other hand, LAAM patients were more likely to cease heroin use. It would seem advantageous for both medicines to be available to patients, at least so that those who do not tolerate one will have access to an alternative. There is no clear reason for favouring one over the other, although questions that have been raised recently as to the safety of LAAM cannot be answered by this review.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Patients considering maintenance treatment with LAAM should be informed that LAAM is an effective medication, that people in research trials have used slightly less heroin and have more frequently gone for periods of time without any heroin use than those taking methadone but have possibly ceased LAAM more frequently due to side-effects. The decision to commence LAAM over other maintenance medications should clearly be weighed against the risks of LAAM some of which (including life threatening arrhythmias due to QT prolongation) are not clear at this stage. Given the ease of transfer to LAAM from methadone or buprenorphine, there seems no reason why patients should necessarily commence with LAAM first. For persons in which methadone and buprenorphine are not effective, LAAM offers an alternative. The as yet unclear risks of LAAM should be weighed against the risks of continued heroin use. </P>
