<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-07-26 18:43:10 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>People often miss taking prescribed medication, because of forgetfulness, changing medication schedules or busy lifestyles. It is estimated that between 40% and 60% of people do not take medication as prescribed, which can lead to worse health outcomes. Packaging of medications with reminder systems for the day and/or time of the week is an attempt to help people take long-term medications. We assessed twelve studies involving 2196 participants who were taking self-administered medications for at least one month. The studies involved different types of packaging, and different medications for various health problems. We found that reminder packaging increased the proportion of people taking their medications when measured by pill count; however, this effect was not large. We also found some evidence that reminder packaging may be beneficial in improving clinical outcomes such as blood pressure. Reminder packing for certain individuals may represent a simple method for improving the adherence to medications; further research is needed to improve the design and targeting of these devices.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-08-08 01:03:56 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Current methods of improving medication adherence for health problems are mostly complex, labour-intensive, and not reliably effective. Medication 'reminder packaging', which incorporates a date or time for a medication to be taken in the packaging, can act as a reminder to improve adherence. This review of reminder packaging is an update of our 2006 Cochrane review. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2011-08-05 15:39:17 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>The objective of this review was to determine the effects of reminder packaging aids for self-administered medication/s taken for at least one month, on adherence and other outcomes.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2011-07-25 15:14:53 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>We updated searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> Issue 9, 2010), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycINFO from the database start dates to September 2010. We searched Current Controlled Trials to identify trials in progress. We performed a cited reference search on the Science Citation Index to identify papers that had cited the original systematic review.</P>
<P>We also searched the Internet, contacted packaging manufacturers, and checked abstracts from the Pharm-line database and reference lists from relevant articles. We did not apply any language restrictions.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2011-07-26 13:21:14 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>We selected randomised controlled trials with at least 80% follow up. We intended to do a sensitivity analysis of those studies that analysed their data on an intention-to-treat basis. Included studies compared a reminder packaging device with no device, for participants taking self-administered medications for at least one month.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2011-04-20 15:09:50 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>Three review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, assessed quality, and extracted data from included studies. Where considered appropriate, data were combined for meta-analysis, or were reported and discussed in a narrative.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-08-08 01:04:36 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included twelve studies containing data on 2196 participants; four of these studies were newly included in this 2011 update of our 2006 Cochrane review.</P>
<P>Six intervention groups in four trials provided data on the percentage of pills taken. Reminder packaging increased the percentage of pills taken (mean difference (MD) 11% (95% confidence interval (CI) 6% to 17%)). Notable heterogeneity occurred among these trials (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 96.3%). Two trials provided data for the proportion of self-reported adherent patients, reporting a reduction in the intervention group which was not statistically significant (odds ratio = 0.89 (95% CI 0.56 to 1.40)). We conducted meta-analysis on data from two trials assessing the effect of reminder packaging on blood pressure measurements. We found that reminder packaging significantly decreased diastolic blood pressure (MD = -5.89 mmHg (95% CI -6.70 to -5.09; P &lt; 0.00001; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%). No effect was seen on systolic blood pressure (mean change -1.01, 95% CI -2.22 to 0.20; P = 0.1, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%). We also conducted meta-analysis on extracted data from two trials that looked at change in glycated haemoglobin. We found that reminder packaging significantly reduced glycated haemoglobin levels (MD -0.72; 95% CI -0.83 to -0.60; P &lt; 0.00001; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 92%), although there was considerable heterogeneity.</P>
<P>No appropriate data were available for meta-analysis of remaining clinical outcomes, which included serum vitamin C and E levels, and self-reported psychological symptoms (one trial each). We reported remaining data narratively. In one study the presence of a reminder packaging aid was found to be preferred by patients with low literacy levels.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-07-26 18:43:27 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-07-26 12:57:19 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>Patient adherence has been defined as the extent to which a person&#8217;s behaviour - taking medication, following a diet, and/or executing lifestyle changes - corresponds with agreed recommendations from a healthcare provider (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2003</LINK>). The change in terms from compliance to adherence recognizes that effective relationships between healthcare providers and patients should be based on partnership, rather than on patients&#8217; passive acceptance of doctors&#8217; demands. We argue that adherence is the second stage of the process of taking medication, the first stage being concordance.</P>
<P>There is growing recognition of concordance, where patient and doctor reach a joint decision on whether and which medication will be appropriate for the patient. Healthcare professionals often try to provide information to patients and to motivate them, and recognise the importance of behavioural skills in improving health. Research has suggested that patients who are satisfied with their provider and medical regimen adhere more diligently to treatment recommendations (<LINK REF="REF-Whitcher_x002d_Alagna-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitcher-Alagna 2002</LINK>). These findings can guide providers to create a treatment relationship that reflects a partnership with their patients, and supports the discussion of therapeutic options, the negotiation of the regimen and clear discussion of adherence. Once a patient has reached this agreement with their doctor, then adherence to the medication is more likely to take place. </P>
<P>Several factors are known to contribute to adherence (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2003</LINK>): the specific condition being treated, the healthcare system and team delivering the intervention, the social and economic conditions of the patient and setting, characteristics of the therapy itself, and contribution of the individual patient. The form of non-adherence that is most common, and most acknowledged by patients and providers, is doses missed because of forgetfulness, changing medication schedules or busy lifestyles (<LINK REF="REF-Stone-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stone 2001</LINK>). Safe medication use demands that each administration, whether one or several per day, be the correct dosage, taken at the correct time each day for the duration of a prescription. Prescriptions vary from short term, over a few days, to long term, over many months or years. Adherence problems can be similar for both time frames, but the longer the term of the medication, the more time there is for mis-administration. People taking multiple drugs are more likely to exhibit poor drug-taking behaviour (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Greenberg-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenberg 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gryfe-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gryfe 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wandless-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wandless 1979</LINK>). The complexity of the prescribed regimens also appears to affect adherence. In one study, less than a quarter of people on multiple drug regimens knew the names and purposes of all of their medicines, and 70% did not know of any single side effect that their medications might cause (<LINK REF="REF-Eagleton-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eagleton 1993</LINK>). Usual modes of packaging may exacerbate such problems: prescribed or over-the-counter medications are typically placed in packages, with the directions for use (often in small print) on the labels. Consumers have little choice as to how medications are packed. If the patient uses the medication packaging as their daily organizer, they may have to correctly and repeatedly take several doses a day. Not remembering which medication to take at which time may lead, understandably, to mistakes.</P>
<P>Typically, 40% to 60% of patients fail to take medication as prescribed (<LINK REF="REF-Esposti-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esposti 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jones-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stewart-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 1972</LINK>). Although under-taking of medications is predominant (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 1992</LINK>), there is also some over-taking of prescribed medications. Non-adherence not only dilutes potential treatment benefits: it has been suggested that between 4%and 35% of patients misuse their medications in a manner posing a serious threat to their health (<LINK REF="REF-Stewart-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 1972</LINK>). An estimated 23% of nursing home admissions were the result of an inability to manage medications at home (<LINK REF="REF-Col-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Col 1990</LINK>). Adherence to a medication regimen is a correlate of clinical outcome.  In a meta-analysis of the association between adherence to drug therapy and mortality, good adherence was associated with lower mortality (odds ratio 0.56, 95% confidence interval 0.50 to 0.63) (<LINK REF="STD-Simpson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Simpson 2006</LINK>). Reductions in adherence are linked with increased morbidity and admission to hospital (<LINK REF="REF-Kennedy-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kennedy 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soumerai-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soumerai 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tamblyn-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tamblyn 2001</LINK>).In the Beta Blocker Heart Attack Trial, death occurred in 13.6% of women whose adherence rate was less than 75%, compared with 5.6% of women whose adherence rate was equal to or greater than 75% (<LINK REF="REF-Gallagher-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gallagher 1993</LINK>). There are also considerable financial implications of poor adherence.  In the UK it has been estimated that £100 million per annum is wasted on medications unused and returned to pharmacists (<LINK REF="REF-National-Audit-Office-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">National Audit Office 2007</LINK>). In the USA the cost of illness due to non-adherence has been reckoned at US $100 billion per annum (<LINK REF="REF-Lewis-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 1997</LINK>). Finally, given that the research and development of a single new drug has been estimated at approximately $1 billion (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2010</LINK>), the fact it may only be taken 50% of the time due to poor adherence suggests other wasted resources.</P>
<P>The review by <LINK REF="STD-Osterberg-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Osterberg 2005</LINK> identified four general categories to improve adherence: patient education; improved dosing schedules; increased access to health care; and improved communication between physicians and patients. They describe strategies to improve dosing schedules, including the use of pillboxes to organize daily doses, simplifying the regimen to daily dosing, and cues to remind patients to take medications. The effectiveness of some of these interventions intended to improve adherence has been evaluated in clinical trials. These range from single interventions such as dose simplification, to complex interventions involving behavioural, educational and affective components. A Cochrane systematic review on adherence to prescription medications (<LINK REF="STD-Haynes-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Haynes 2008</LINK>) selected trials if they measured both medication adherence and treatment outcome, with at least 80% follow up, and for long-term treatments with at least six months follow up for studies with positive initial findings. Using these criteria, &#8220;For long-term treatments, 36 of 83 interventions reported in 70 RCTs were associated with improvements in adherence, but only 25 interventions led to improvement in at least one treatment outcome. Almost all of the interventions that were effective for long term care were complex, including combinations of more convenient care, information, reminders, self-monitoring, reinforcement, counselling, family therapy, psychological therapy, crisis intervention, manual telephone follow-up, and supportive care.&#8221; Using criteria more restrictive than this review in terms of intervention duration and outcomes, Haynes and colleagues identified one study with positive findings which used reminder packaging aids (<LINK REF="STD-Becker-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>Our review differs from the review by Haynes (<LINK REF="STD-Haynes-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Haynes 2008</LINK>) in that we define long-term to mean prescriptions or medications that must be taken for one month or longer; however, we did not require trials to have more than one month of follow up to be included in the review. Prescriptions of this length usually reflect medications that are going to be continued indefinitely, although this is not always the case.</P>
<P>Single or briefly-administered interventions, such as increased pharmacist involvement with antihypertensive therapy, lose effectiveness rapidly after discontinuation (<LINK REF="REF-McKenney-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKenney 1973</LINK>). The relative permanence of reminder packaging may overcome this problem for some types of non-adherence, particularly unintentional non-adherence. Unintentional non-adherence may occur because of forgetfulness, complex regimes, an increasing number of medications to be taken, cognitive defects, difficulty in opening packaging, and memory problems. Intentional non-adherence occurs when an individual makes a conscious decision not to conform to the instructions they have received. This can be due to a number of factors, such as side effects, communication breakdown, poor instructions, or a belief that the medicine will not provide a benefit.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-07-25 15:45:15 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>Reminder packaging is potentially beneficial in aiding unintentional, but not intentional, non-adherence. Packaging aids have been in use for many years (<LINK REF="REF-Canada-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Canada 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eshelman-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Eshelman 1976</LINK>), and are widely used for patients perceived as having problems with medicine-taking at home, particularly the elderly. They appear to be accepted by many healthcare professionals as a solution for people experiencing such problems, despite the variability of evidence for the packaging aids&#8217; effectiveness (<LINK REF="REF-McGraw-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGraw 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rivers-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rivers 1992</LINK>). &#8217;Reminder packaging&#8217; refers to any assembly of medication/s, such as a pill box, blister pack, bottle or single-use container that physically incorporates a system for the day and/or time when the medication/s are to be taken. Reminder packaging comes in a number of forms. The most common is a box divided into days of the week, with several compartments for each day, which are suitable for tablets and capsules only. These are often known as multi-compartment medication compliance aids. Sublingual, dispersible or moisture-sensitive preparations (e.g. omeprazole) cannot be dispensed in such compliance devices. Drugs can also be provided in reminder blister or bubble packs.</P>
<P>There are a number of ways to assemble packaging aids. The multi-compartment containers can be pre-filled by a pharmacist, a healthcare worker, a carer or by the patient themselves. They are normally reusable and filled on a weekly basis. Calendar blister packaging can contain single medications, and is sometimes referred to as unit of use. The packaging can also contain multiple medications. Blister packaged medications come pre-packed, often in a 28-day supply, and are not reusable.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-07-26 18:43:27 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Healthcare professionals need to know the place of packaging aids in the wider context of management of self-administered medications. It has been estimated that over 100,000 patients living in the community in Britain are using multi-compartment medicine aids (<LINK REF="REF-Nunney-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nunney 2001</LINK>). Currently there are no processes in place for the instigation of these aids, and patients receive the devices largely without any assessment of their appropriateness in their given case. The implications for practice is increasingly being recognized.  Our original review (<LINK REF="REF-Heneghan-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heneghan 2006</LINK>) has been cited in joint guidance from the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE, UK) and Royal College of General Practitioners RCGP, UK). These organisations acknowledge that although medication adherence can be improved, no specific intervention can be recommended for all patients based on current evidence (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2009</LINK>).  Reviews have looked at the effects of specific packaging aids and fixed-dose medication regimes (<LINK REF="REF-Connor-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Connor 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morrison-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrison 2000</LINK>). However none of these reviews have systematically assessed the effects of reminder packaging aids as defined in this updated review. This led us to conclude that there was a need for an updated systematic review of randomised controlled trials of reminder packaging aids, and their effect on adherence.</P>

Trials were included in this review if the intervention was used for a minimum of one month, had a minimum 80% follow-up of participants, and the study was unconfounded. By unconfounded, we mean studies where the two groups were not treated differently, except for the provision of the intervention to one group (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>) . Confounding can occur by the use of a different medication regime for one of the two groups, or by the use of packaging within a complex intervention (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Peterson-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Peterson 1984</LINK>). If the two groups were treated unequally apart from the packaging, they were excluded. However, we included interventions where counselling and/or information leaflets were used in the intervention group to demonstrate how the packaging aid was to be used. Where a number of interventions were used in a factorial design, we included the study if the packaging allowed for direct comparison, e.g. telephone reminder and packaging versus telephone reminder.</P>

<P>We included trials in which the participants were taking self-administered medication/s for one month or more. No age limits were set, and all medication as taken by an individual were considered, regardless of medical condition. 'Self-administered' refers to administration of medication with no active participation of a healthcare professional. It allows for administration of medication by a family member or carer for an individual. We included studies in which the medication was packaged by a health professional, such as a pharmacist or a manufacturing company. We excluded studies where direct observation of therapy occurred by a health professional.</P>
<P>We included all settings.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2011-07-25 15:37:56 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>To be included, interventions required a reminder system for the day of the week or the time that the medication was to be taken, and it had to form part of the packaging. We excluded reminders that were separate to the intervention (such as a mailed reminder). We also excluded electronic systems (such as SMS test reminders). Packaging aids were included irrespective of whether the medication required a prescription or not. Trials of over-the-counter medications or vitamin supplements were included, given the role of such medications in preventive healthcare. Injected, topical or inhaled medicines, and co-packaged or fixed-dose combinations were not excluded, as long as the packaging included a reminder system.</P>
<P>Reminder packaging falls into two distinct categories: those that are pre-packaged into blister packs (calendar blister, unit dose, monitored dosage system) or those that are packaged in pill boxes (multi-compartment compliance aid, dose administration aid). Definitions of some of the terms used in regard to packaging aids are as follows:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Monitored dosage system (MDS): medications are manually packed into blister/bubble trays, under the supervision of a pharmacist and then cold or heat sealed with foil. Examples of these systems are the Nomad® and Manrex®. Patients using an MDS are provided with weekly or monthly blister packs.</LI>
<LI>Multi-compartment compliance aid (MCA) or dose administration aid: these are plastic trays or boxes that hold seven days of a patient's medicine and are divided into days of the week. Each day of the week has a sliding lid, which covers compartments for different dosing times (usually four compartments for each day). They are commonly but not exclusively used for multiple medications. Examples of these are Dosett®*, Medidos® and the Mediset.</LI>
<LI>Calendar blister: a blister package designed to aid a patient's memory by incorporating the day/time that each dose is to be taken into the package design.</LI>
<LI>Unit dose: the prescribed amount of each dosage in a package. This type of packaging can incorporate a reminder system.</LI>
<LI>Unit of use: the exact amount of a drug's treatment pre-packaged by the manufacturer or pharmacist in standardised amounts. This type of packaging can incorporate a reminder system.</LI>
</UL>

<BR/>* Other possible spellings: Doset, and Dossette</P>

We searched for studies published in languages other than English, and ongoing trials in Current Controlled Trials (http://controlled-trials.com/). We also searched the Internet using the SumSearch (http://sumsearch.uthscsa.edu/searchform4.htm) and Google search engines (http://www.google.com). Internet search terms were based on the MeSH terms for drug packaging and drug delivery systems along with the specific trade names. We searched the Pharm-line database of abstracts (search date 1 September 2010), and contacted packaging companies where possible. In addition, we searched reference lists of papers retrieved in full text for relevant studies.

Generally, quality criteria were not met due to lack of information, rather than due to explicit reporting of inadequate methods. In the <LINK REF="STD-Azrin-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Azrin 1998</LINK> trial, the family guideline group was excluded from the analysis. This was due to confounding, because the family member received training and instructions on adherence issues and the use of the reminder pill box. <LINK REF="STD-Skaer-1993-NIDDM_x002d_a" TYPE="STUDY">Skaer 1993 NIDDM-a</LINK> reports a 2 x 2 factorial design in which 258 patients were randomly assigned to one of four groups; the methods of randomisation were unclear, with unbalanced groups.

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Effects on adherence</HEADING>
<P>Adherence was measured in two ways: the percentage of pills taken out of the total pills prescribed for the period (continuous), and the proportion of people that self-reported adequate adherence (dichotomous). Five trials provided relevant information that could be used to obtain a pooled estimate for the effect of the intervention on adherence. One provided information on the proportion of people that self-reported adequate adherence (<LINK REF="STD-Becker-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 1986</LINK>), three on the percentage of pills taken (<LINK REF="STD-Azrin-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Azrin 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Skaer-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Skaer 1993a</LINK>; and <LINK REF="STD-Skaer-1993-NIDDM_x002d_a" TYPE="STUDY">Skaer 1993 NIDDM-a</LINK>), and one on both outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Huang-2000-_x0028_TRACE_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2000 (TRACE)</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Schneider-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schneider 2008</LINK> the authors measured adherence as a medication possession ratio (MPR) which they defined as the sum of the day&#8217;s supply for all prescriptions received during the study, divided by the number of days between the dates of the first and last prescription dispensing. Six studies did not provide any information on adherence. <LINK REF="STD-Simmons-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Simmons 2000</LINK> did not collect data on pill counts or self reporting (confirmed by personal communication with the author). <LINK REF="STD-Binstock-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Binstock 1988</LINK> only reported changes in blood pressure, <LINK REF="STD-Winland_x002d_Brown-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Winland-Brown 2000</LINK> did not provide information on the number of study medications taken by participants. <LINK REF="STD-Kripalani-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kripalani 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Jansen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Jansen 2009</LINK> used questionnaires to assess the use of and perceived helpfulness of the adherence device itself. <LINK REF="STD-Suppapitiporn-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Suppapitiporn 2005</LINK> did not comment on adherence.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Pill count</HEADING>
<P>Six intervention groups in four trials provided data on the percentage of pills taken (<LINK REF="STD-Azrin-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Azrin 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huang-2000-_x0028_TRACE_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2000 (TRACE)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Skaer-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Skaer 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Skaer-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Skaer 1993b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Skaer-1993-NIDDM_x002d_a" TYPE="STUDY">Skaer 1993 NIDDM-a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Skaer-1993-NIDDM_x002d_b" TYPE="STUDY">Skaer 1993 NIDDM-b</LINK>). A total of 772 participants provided data in these four studies. The combined analysis showed a significant increase in the percentage of pills taken in the reminder package group (mean difference (MD) 11% (95% CI 6% to 17%; P &lt; 0.0001; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 96.3%)) (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). However, there is considerable heterogeneity between the trials, mainly due to the <LINK REF="STD-Huang-2000-_x0028_TRACE_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2000 (TRACE)</LINK> study. This trial differs in two ways from the other three in this comparison: the population were 'healthy' individuals, and the pills provided were more than required, with over-compliance being common for both the control and the intervention group. We conducted a sensitivity analysis excluding the <LINK REF="STD-Huang-2000-_x0028_TRACE_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2000 (TRACE)</LINK> study.  After exclusion there remained a significant increase in the percentage of pills taken in the reminder package group (MD 13% (95% CI 11% to 15%; P &lt; 0.0001; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 39%)). There was a notable reduction in heterogeneity between remaining trials.  Although there is heterogeneity among the trials included in this comparison, the direction of the effect is consistent in all of them, and a random-effects model was used to obtain the pooled estimate of the effect. A funnel plot of these trials suggests there was an absence of small studies with negative effects (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>). Due to lack of data we could not analyse medication discontinuation rates and reasons for discontinuation.  We were unable to extrapolate pill count data from the medication possession ratio (MPR) used in <LINK REF="STD-Schneider-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schneider 2008</LINK> and were unable to get any more detailed information from the authors directly, which may have enabled us to include these results in the analysis.   </P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Self-reported adherence</HEADING>
<P>Two trials provided data for meta-analysis of the proportion of self-reported adherent patients (<LINK REF="STD-Becker-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huang-2000-_x0028_TRACE_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2000 (TRACE)</LINK>); each had one comparison and one intervention group (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). We extracted data for a total of 339 participants from these two trials. The combined data showed a non-significant reduction in self-reported adherence in the intervention group (odds ratio (OR) = 0.89 (95% CI 0.56 to 1.40; P = 0.61, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%)).</P>

All of these outcomes were reported as continuous variables. The Skaer hypertension and diabetes trials provided no information on clinical outcomes, while <LINK REF="STD-Winland_x002d_Brown-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Winland-Brown 2000</LINK> provided information only on the utilisation of healthcare resources. <LINK REF="STD-Kripalani-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kripalani 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Jansen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Jansen 2009</LINK> did not provide a clinical outcome as their end point to the trials.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Hypertension</HEADING>
<P>Four trials reported the effects of the intervention on blood pressure (<LINK REF="STD-Becker-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Binstock-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Binstock 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schneider-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schneider 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simmons-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Simmons 2000</LINK>). Two of these trials reported means and standard deviations (SDs) for blood pressure measurements (<LINK REF="STD-Schneider-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schneider 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simmons-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Simmons 2000</LINK>). In the <LINK REF="STD-Simmons-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Simmons 2000</LINK> trial the authors reported a significant improvement in diastolic blood pressure: at eight months it decreased by 5.8 ± 1.5 mmHg in the calendar blister group, and increased 0.1 ± 1.9 mmHg in the control group (P &lt; 0.001). There was no significant change in systolic blood pressure at eight months (intervention -3.6 ± 2.3 mmHg versus control -2.6 ± 2.8mmHg, P = 0.89). In the <LINK REF="STD-Schneider-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schneider 2008</LINK> trial the authors also reported a statistically significant difference in diastolic blood pressure at six months between study and control patients. The mean (± SD) diastolic blood pressure was 73.2 ± 8.8 mmHg in study patients compared with 77.7 ± 10.2 mmHg in control patients (P = 0.0367). There was no statistically significant difference in systolic blood pressure at six months (SBP in intervention was 132.7 ± 17.3 mm Hg and in control was 138.2 ± 22.2 mm Hg,  P = 0.2143). At 12 months there was no significant difference in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure between participants in the two groups.</P>

These data suggest that the presence of a reminder packaging device does not lead to a change in systolic blood pressure (mean difference -1.01, 95% CI -2.22 to 0.20; P = 0.1, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>).

In the calendar pack group, blood pressure changed from initial readings of 148/89 mmHg to 133/80 mmHg over the same time period. The <LINK REF="STD-Becker-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 1986</LINK> trial reported no significant improvement in diastolic blood pressure control at three months follow-up for patients receiving unit-dose reminder packaging, the intervention group blood pressure was 85.3 mmHg versus control 88.8 mmHg. No significant differences were observed at the pre-enrolment visit (88.5 mmHg versus 91.6 mmHg) or at the baseline visit (86.3 mmHg versus 89.6 mmHg).

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Patients' satisfaction, harms and barriers to use</HEADING>
<P>Two trials reported on the usefulness of packaging aids. In the <LINK REF="STD-Becker-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 1986</LINK> trial, patients in the intervention group (medications in a single plastic blister, sealed with a foil backing and printed reminder) considered their packaging more difficult and less convenient to use than did patients who received their medications in the regular format (the study reported no numbers). The <LINK REF="STD-Simmons-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Simmons 2000</LINK> trial (medications within a calendar blister package in a labelled box) reported 77% of the intervention group found the packaging to be useful, as opposed to 27% in the control group (P &lt; 0.001).</P>
<P>Two trials used descriptive analysis to evaluate the usefulness of a reminder packaging aid.  In the <LINK REF="STD-Kripalani-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kripalani 2007</LINK> trial patients with a documented history of coronary heart disease were selected from a predominantly inner-city, African/American population with relatively low-literacy skills.  The study group received a pill card to accompany their medication.  This had a pictorial representation of the type of pill they should take, when to take it and what it was for. Of 173 patients who used the pill card,132 patients (76.3 %) reported it as being very helpful in reminding them to take their medication.  The authors also concluded pill card use was highest amongst those with the lowest literacy skills. No data were provided on the proportion of pills taken in the two groups.  Patient feedback from this trial included suggestions such as a wallet-sized card to serve as a more portable reminder, larger font size, and including the strength of each medication on the card. </P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Jansen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Jansen 2009</LINK> trial the authors were testing a novel compliance device (MEMOZAX®) to aid compliance to grass allergen tablets in people with a clinical history of grass pollen induced allergic rhino conjunctivitis.  Follow up was carried out in the middle and end of a grass pollen season. The tablets were packaged in the reminder device which also served as the tablet storage.  An alarm sounded at the same time every day as a reminder to take each tablet.  Dispensing the tablet stopped the alarm.  Seventy one patients that were originally randomised to receive the compliance device through the grass pollen season returned a satisfaction questionnaire.  Fifty-eight of 71 patients (82%) reported using the compliance device sometimes or always, and 32 of 69 (46%) reported the compliance device made it easier or much easier to take their tablets. The remaining trials provided no information on patients&#8217; satisfaction with, or harms or barriers to use of, their medication packaging.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Costs</HEADING>
<P>Costs were reported in the two Skaer trials. In both trials, receipt of the intervention resulted in a small but significant increase in prescription expenditure for reminder packaging and mailed reminders plus packaging. The Skaer hypertension trial (<LINK REF="STD-Skaer-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Skaer 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Skaer-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Skaer 1993b</LINK>) reported small total savings on the reminder packaging and reminder packaging plus mailed reminder when compared to control. Whilst the Skaer 1993 NIDDM trial (<LINK REF="STD-Skaer-1993-NIDDM_x002d_a" TYPE="STUDY">Skaer 1993 NIDDM-a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Skaer-1993-NIDDM_x002d_b" TYPE="STUDY">Skaer 1993 NIDDM-b</LINK>) reported small total savings in the reminder packaging plus mailed reminder group when compared to control, the effect was a non-significant increase in total costs in the reminder packaging group. These results should be interpreted with caution as they were obtained in the context of the US Medicaid system, and no standard deviations were provided, making interpretation difficult. The <LINK REF="STD-Simmons-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Simmons 2000</LINK> trial in New Zealand reported that the packaging costs were US$1.50 per week.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-07-26 21:48:53 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Adherence to medication is poor. The health and cost implications of poor adherence are increasingly being recognised and are leading to health reforms to improve adherence (<LINK REF="REF-Cutler-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cutler 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>The studies examined in this review suggest that reminder packaging appears to improve adherence when judged by pill counts, though not by self-report. The direction of the effect was positive for the four studies that provided data on pill counts (pre-packed and self-packed) for the meta-analysis; however, 72% of the effect came from two studies (four arms) in which the reminder packaging was pre-packed.</P>
<P>With respect to clinical outcomes, only two of the included studies examining blood pressure reported adequate detail to allow a conclusion to be drawn. Both trials showed a significant improvement in diastolic, but not systolic, blood pressure over the trial course; glycated haemoglobin levels also significantly improved in the intervention group in one of these trials. Glycated haemoglobin levels were also significantly reduced in another trial in which a medication reminder device was used, however we felt the quality of this study to be poor. There was no effect on psychological symptoms in the one small trial that studied patients with chronic mental illness, and no effect on vitamin C and E levels in well people. In two trials patient satisfaction with the reminder device in aiding adherence varied widely (46% in one trial and 71% in another). In one trial the use of reminder packaging was preferred by people with low literacy levels. Overall, we felt that there was a lack of consistent information on patient satisfaction, barriers to use, difficulties with using reminder devices, and costs to health services and consumers to draw any firm conclusions about the effects of reminder packaging on these outcomes.</P>
<P>The effects of reminder packs on adherence appear to be somewhat larger than the effects of reminder packs on clinical outcomes. This is to be expected: modest amounts of non-adherence may still leave patients within a therapeutic window, and hence proportional gains in compliance are likely to be more than the proportional gains in clinical outcomes. Even if pill counts are improved they may have no effect on clinical outcomes. A patient must surpass the therapeutic threshold for clinically important differences in outcomes to occur. For hypertension, this level appears to be about 80% (<LINK REF="REF-Haynes-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haynes 1980</LINK>). Although increasing a patient&#8217;s adherence from 50 to 70% may be statistically significant and suggest that an intervention is useful, there may be a sub-optimal lowering of blood pressure accompanying this improvement in adherence.</P>
<P>Our review&#8217;s findings are consistent with our previous review (<LINK REF="REF-Heneghan-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heneghan 2006</LINK>) and a review on interventions to improve medication adherence (<LINK REF="STD-Haynes-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Haynes 2008</LINK>). Haynes&#8217; Cochrane review looked at the impact on clinical outcomes of all possible interventions to improve medication adherence, and concluded that even the most effective interventions lead to only modest improvements. The effective interventions included: more convenient care, information, reminders, self-monitoring, reinforcement and counselling. There is no single intervention strategy which has been shown to be effective across all patients, conditions and settings. Consequently, interventions that target adherence must be tailored to the particular illness-related demands experienced by the patient. To accomplish this, health systems and providers need to develop ways of accurately assessing not only adherence, but also those factors that influence it.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Limitations of this review</HEADING>
<P>There continues to be an overall paucity of high quality trials carried out in this subject area. We found deficiencies in the conduct of most of the trials included in this review. Studies were excluded for duration of treatment, confounding, and serious flaws in randomisation or follow up. Only two of the included studies were judged to be of between adequate and high quality (<LINK REF="STD-Schneider-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schneider 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simmons-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Simmons 2000</LINK>). Unpublished studies of reminder packaging also seem likely, but as these are not registered in current clinical trial registries (http://controlled-trials.com), we were unable to investigate how significant the unpublished literature on adherence is. As only published studies were retrieved for this review, and there was some evidence of publication bias assessed by funnel plot, the findings may potentially overestimate the benefits of reminder packaging (<LINK REF="REF-Easterbrook-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Easterbrook 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>A broader limitation involves the measurement of adherence. In the review by <LINK REF="REF-Vermeire-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vermeire 2001</LINK> the authors point out that there continues to be no 'gold standard' for measuring adherence. Many of the methods used to asses compliance have individual limitations. For example direct methods such as blood serum monitoring or direct observed therapy can be invasive and expensive to maintain. Indirect methods include pill counts, self reporting, medication diaries and pharmacy prescription refill rates. However they also suffer from limitations. For example self-reporting methods have been shown to overestimate compliance.</P>
<P>Our aim was to review a wide range of reminder packaging interventions in all populations; however, our narrow inclusion criteria left only a small number of heterogeneous trials. Differences between trials may therefore be due to artefactual differences in the quality or design of the trials, or to differences in the method of reminder packaging or the patient group. Pill counts as an outcome measure is problematic. For example, one must assume that the pill when removed from the packaging is actually taken on the right day and at the right time. There is also the potential for the dumping of pills before the next appointment or observation period. Adherence has been shown to be significantly higher for the days before and after a clinic visit, and then to decrease again. In a study using micro-electronic monitors to observe pill taking habits, 20 patients averaged 88% compliance before and 86% compliance after the visit, but this dropped to 67% compliance a month later (<LINK REF="REF-Cramer-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cramer 1990</LINK>). Caution should also be applied to the results in this review on pill counts, as most of the information was provided by four groups from the two Skaer 1993 trials. Most of the included studies were small and we could not comment on the effects of different types of reminder packaging. Of the twelve studies, ten were deemed to have a high risk of bias due to one or more methodological criteria being unmet. Studies of adherence that focus on patients who are willing to participate in research studies may also be missing key problems associated with the intervention. This analysis focused on settings where appointment-keeping ensured achievement of the intended benefit. Nine of the twelve trials were undertaken in North America, therefore caution is warranted in generalizing the results of this review to other settings. There was also a lack of evidence in this review for the use of reminder packaging in the elderly population. This is surprising, given that it is this group in which the intervention is most often used.</P>

<P>While reminder packaging may represent a simple method for improving adherence, it can be problematic and errors may occur. Hence, while awaiting further trials, the use of reminder packaging may be justified in selected patients according to needs and preferences. However there is some evidence to suggest that reminder packaging may improve clinical outcomes such as blood pressure in hypertensive patients. We also found evidence that the use of appropriately designed reminder packaging may be preferred by individuals with low literacy levels.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-07-26 15:30:59 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>Further trials of packaging devices that affect adherence are warranted. Research should focus on identifying the type of medication reminders that are convenient for patients to use, and should examine the effectiveness of reminder packaging for different medication doses and schedules. Trials should determine in which age groups and medical conditions reminder packaging will be effective. Further studies should also address issues which are important to consumers and health service providers: costs, barriers to use, patient satisfaction and resource utilization. Comparisons also need to be made between self-packed and pre-packed devices. Outcome measurements in such trials should account for measures of adherence and clinical outcomes, and should follow up participants for at least six months. Initial research may benefit from generating high quality trials looking at the effect of a reminder package on the effect on adherence and clinical outcomes in hypertension medication.</P>

<P>The study was carried out in the Department of Family Practice and Community Health of Temple University School of Medicine. Of 180 patients recruited to the trial, 171 patients aged 20 to 80 years taking medication for previously diagnosed hypertension were included for analysis. All patients had demonstrated poor blood pressure control (diastolic &gt; 90 mm Hg) on at least one visit during the preceding two years. Patients enrolled were primarily middle-aged black women. Less than 20% were employed, most had not completed high school and they had been taking medication for an average of 11 years. Patients who had significant visual, auditory, or mental problems were excluded. The special packaging group reported slightly better compliance and had better blood pressure control at the beginning of the study.</P>

<P>The intervention group (n = 86) received their medications in a single plastic blister sealed pack with a foil backing on which was printed the day of the week and the time of day at which each medication was to be taken. All medications for both groups were provided free of charge. Each package of medication had 28 blisters, each one representing 28 consecutive doses of medication, the intervention was provided as a three month supply of medication. Patients in the control group (n = 85) received all of their medications in separate vials for each pill. Vials were labelled with the drug name, the dosage, the medication instructions, and the physician's name.<BR/>

<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>Self-reports of adherence (patients who admitted less than perfect adherence were considered non-adherent), and pill counts (patients were considered adherent if they had taken 80% or more of their prescribed medication). Blood pressure was taken three times during each visit. The first measure was discarded and an average of the second and third measures was used as the blood pressure measurement for that visit. Blood pressure control was defined as diastolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg.</P>

<P>Group one (control) (n = 32) participated in a bimonthly educational program on high blood pressure conducted by a nurse. Group two (n = 23) participated in an educational program and trained to monitor blood pressure at home. Group three (n = 15) participated in an educational program and developed a compliance contract. Group four (n = 30) participated in an educational program and used calendar pill packs. Group five (n = 11) received a combination of home blood pressure monitoring, contracts, calendar pill packs and the educational program. The calendar pill packs were plastic containers marked with the days of the week from which their medications were dispensed. Comparisons were made between the control group one and group four. </P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>No adherence outcomes were reported. A blood pressure check and compliance questionnaire were completed at the first session and at one year follow up. Outcomes from group one and group four were compared and were measured at three months. </P>

<P>In researching an article for medicine reminder charts, I noticed that the paper by <LINK REF="STD-Kripalani-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kripalani 2007</LINK>, included in this review of reminder packaging, was in fact based on a reminder chart - not packaging. The intervention is separate from the packaging; the pill containers can be used independently. Thus this paper does not appear to fit the criteria for this review.</P>

<FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2011-11-02 10:13:25 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>We thank Professor Raynor for taking the time to read our review and for his comment on the <LINK REF="STD-Kripalani-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kripalani 2007</LINK> paper.</P>
<P>Interestingly, although the author sent us more details about this paper.  its inclusion caused great debate amongst us. Yet, we agreed that the study does meet our inclusion criteria: randomised controlled trials (RCTs) incorporating a reminder packaging aid to improve adherence to self-administered medication/s, when used for at least one month with at least 80% follow-up.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Kripalani-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kripalani 2007</LINK> study participants were given a reminder aid (in this case a pill card) delivered with their medication with the date and time to take the medication, in addition to a picture of the tablet and the reason it was prescribed printed on the reminder aid. Apart from the graphical representation, the information being delivered differed little from the printed information delivered with medication within, for example a Dosette box or blister pack.</P>
<P>In addition, the paper was a subgroup analysis of a larger randomised clinical trial entitled &#8220;Improving Medication Adherence through Graphically Enhanced interventions in Coronary Heart Disease (IMAGE-CHD)&#8221; (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00399880). However this trial not been completed at the time of publication of our review. Once it has and we can obtain more published details we will consider whether to include it in our next update.</P>
<P>Finally, the paper&#8217;s inclusion does not really change the main results and conclusions of our review. They are that few high quality trials exist in this area and further trials are needed. We found some data that reminder packaging aids may affect certain clinical outcomes. The main conclusion drawn from the <LINK REF="STD-Kripalani-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kripalani 2007</LINK> paper was that reminder aids may be well received in patients of the lowest literacy group.</P>
<P>We hope that some advances are made to strengthen this very important area in improving medication adherence by the time we next update this review</P>
<P>We do however appreciate Professor Raynor&#8217;s point and thank him again for commenting on our review.</P>
