The main treatment of schizophrenia is antipsychotic drugs. However, these drugs can have debilitating side-effects. Tardive dyskinesia is an involuntary movement that causes the face, mouth, tongue and jaw to convulse, spasm and grimace. It is caused by long-term or high-dose use of antipsychotic drugs, is difficult to treat and can be incurable. One suggested treatment is to use medication that affects the catecholaminergic system, which is a group of brain chemicals.</P><P><B>Study characteristics</B>.</P><P>The review includes 10 small, short studies published mainly in the 1980s involving a total of 261 people.</P><P><B>Key results</B>.</P><P>One small study found that after 2 weeks' treatment both alpha-methyldopa and reserpine may lead to clinically important improvement in tardive dyskinesia symptoms compared with placebo, but the quality of evidence was low. We are uncertain about the effect of reserpine versus alpha-methyldopa; quality of evidence was very low. Another small trial compared tetrabenazine and haloperidol after 18 weeks' treatment, but again we are uncertain about the effect as the quality of evidence was very low. The included studies did not report on any harmful effects of the drugs.</P><P><B>Quality of the evidence</B>.</P><P>Evidence is weak, limited, short term, and small scale. It is not possible to recommend these drugs as a treatment for tardive dyskinesia and their use is entirely experimental.

Forty-eight studies are excluded. Participants were mostly chronically mentally ill inpatients in their 50s, and studies were primarily of short (2 to 6 weeks) duration.

These drugs can effectively control symptoms such as abnormal perceptions (hallucinations), disordered thinking and fixed false beliefs (delusions). In addition, maintenance therapy with antipsychotics is associated with a reduced risk of relapses (<LINK REF="REF-Schooler-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schooler 1993</LINK>). Antipsychotic medication, however, has also been associated with a wide range of adverse effects, including movement disorders. The appearance of these movement disorders can contribute to poor compliance with antipsychotic treatment and hence relapse (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 1993</LINK>).</P><P>Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is one such movement disorder and is characterised by abnormal, repetitive and involuntary movements (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1992</LINK>). The clinical features include tongue protrusion, side-to-side or rotatory movement of the jaw, lip smacking, puckering and pursing, and rapid eye blinking (<LINK REF="REF-Casey-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casey 1994</LINK>). In some people rapid movements of the arms, legs, and trunk may also occur. TD is a chronic condition of insidious onset, the severity of which spontaneously fluctuates (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1992</LINK>). Studies on the natural history of tardive dyskinesia have reported widely variable remission rates (1% to 62%) depending on patient age, psychiatric diagnosis, course of the psychiatric disorder, and duration of therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Bergen-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bergen 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fernandez-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fernandez 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glazer-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazer 1990</LINK>).</P><P>Although the most frequent cause of TD is the use of antipsychotic medication, it is clinically striking that dose reduction can lead to a temporary exacerbation in symptoms. Conversely, increasing the dose is often associated with a temporary remission (<LINK REF="REF-Cavallaro-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cavallaro 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1980</LINK>). The exact mechanisms of the pathophysiology of TD are unknown. Antipsychotic drugs block certain chemical receptor sites in the brain &#8212; one of these is specific for dopamine (<LINK REF="REF-Casey-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casey 1994</LINK>). One hypothesis explaining the cause of antipsychotic-induced TD is that chronic blockade of dopamine receptors in specific cells of the brain (neurones from the nigrostriatum) causes an overgrowth of these receptors (<LINK REF="REF-Casey-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casey 1994</LINK>). There is also suggestion that the chronic use of antipsychotics may also cause an abnormal production of highly active atoms and chemical groups (cytotoxic free radicals), which may damage specific cells in the brain. This, in turn, could be responsible for the appearance of TD (<LINK REF="REF-Cadet-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cadet 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sachdev-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sachdev 2000</LINK>).</P><P>TD occurs in more than 20% of those using antipsychotic medication continually for longer than three months (<LINK REF="REF-Glazer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazer 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kane-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kane 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tarsy-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tarsy 2011</LINK>). Every year 4% to 5% of adults and 25% to 30% of elderly persons who continually use these drugs begin to show signs of TD (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Correll-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Correll 2004</LINK>). Advancing age is a risk factor for both TD's prevalence and severity, with those who are under 60 years of age being three times more likely to spontaneously remit (<LINK REF="REF-Jeste-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jeste 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1980</LINK>).</P><P>The prevalence of tardive dyskinesia is often thought to be decreasing based on the use of atypical antipsychotics in place of typical antipsychotics (<LINK REF="REF-Cloud-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cloud 2014</LINK>). A systematic review found that the incidence of tardive dyskinesia associated with atypical drugs (2% to 4%) was significantly lower than that for typicals (5% to 8%) (<LINK REF="REF-Correll-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Correll 2008</LINK>). Despite this, the widespread use of atypical drugs in clinical settings, increased off-label use, and an ageing population may still result in an overall increase in the number of cases of TD (<LINK REF="REF-Cloud-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cloud 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glazer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazer 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maher-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maher 2012</LINK>). The problem will be considerably greater for people in countries where use of newer drugs is less prevalent (<LINK REF="REF-Ballesteros-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballesteros 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Martins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martins 2011</LINK>).</P></CONDITION><INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-10-31 15:52:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Catecholamines occur naturally in the body. They are synthesised from the amino acid tyrosine, and examples include epinephrine (adrenaline), norepinephrine and dopamine. There are several pharmaceutical compounds acting as catecholamine analogues that have been tested as treatment for tardive dyskinesia, especially during the 1980s (<LINK REF="REF-Jeste-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jeste 1988</LINK>). This review will present data on pharmaceutical compounds affecting catecholamiergic pathways in different ways.</P><P>The catecholaminergic systems involve a complex cascade of steps that can be modified by pharmaceutical compounds at various junctures. Several strategies have been examined in the treatment of TD. These include: i. increasing the presynaptic release of dopamine (e.g. amantadine); ii. increasing the production of dopamine (e.g. L-dopa); iii. dopamine receptor antagonists (e.g. alpha-methyl-paratyrosine (AMTP)); iv. dopamine receptor agonists (e.g. apomorphine); v. agents that deplete dopamine (e.g. tetrabenazine); vi. agents that block the beta-adrenergic receptors (e.g. propanolol); vii. agents that act as 'false neurotransmitters' (e.g. methyldopa) (see <LINK TAG="CRIT_INTERVENTIONS" TYPE="SECTION">Types of interventions</LINK> for the full list of drugs).</P></INTERVENTION><THEORY MODIFIED="2017-10-31 15:52:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>One of the most influential theories to explain the appearance of TD suggests that long-term use of antipsychotic medication leads to an increase in the number of dopamine and dopamine-related receptors. This hypothesis is usually referred to as the dopamine supersensitivity theory (<LINK REF="REF-Browne-1986b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Browne 1986b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Casey-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casey 1994</LINK>); and hence drugs that influence the catecholaminergic (noradrenergic and dopaminergic) function in the extrapyramidal system have been used as treatments for antipsychotic-induced TD. It was thought that these compounds could reverse dopamine supersensitivity by increasing the levels of available dopamine, thus overcoming the antipsychotic-induced dopamine blockade (<LINK REF="REF-Friedhoff-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedhoff 1977</LINK>).</P><P>Currently, however, there is no clear evidence of the effectiveness of these drugs in treating TD. Nevertheless, they have been associated with many side effects, including drowsiness, confusion, postural hypotension, depression and worsening of psychosis (<LINK REF="REF-Turjanski-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turjanski 2005</LINK>). In addition, an excess of dopamine has itself been associated with movement disorders (choreoathetoid).</P></THEORY><IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-10-31 15:52:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Several atypical antipsychotic drugs have been produced in the last decades that claim to cause less or no TD (<LINK REF="REF-Lieberman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lieberman 1996</LINK>). These claims may or may not be true, and certainly evidence does point to the fact that thoughtful use of older-generation drugs is not associated with any more problems of TD than are newer treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Chouinard-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chouinard 2008</LINK>). However, in a global context, it is likely that the less expensive and more familiar drugs &#8212; such as chlorpromazine or haloperidol &#8212; will continue to be the mainstay of treatment of people with schizophrenia (<A HREF="http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/essentialmedicines/Updated_sixteenth_adult_list_en.pdf">WHO Essential List 2010</A>). Use of drugs such as these is associated with emergence of TD and, therefore, this condition will remain a problem for years to come.</P><P>TD can result in considerable social and physical disability (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 1993</LINK>); and symptoms are often irreversible (<LINK REF="REF-Bergen-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bergen 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fernandez-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fernandez 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glazer-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazer 1990</LINK>). Additionally, TD is frequently associated with lower quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Ascher_x002d_Svanum-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ascher-Svanum 2008</LINK>); and a greater mortality rate (<LINK REF="REF-Chong-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chong 2009</LINK>). Given the high incidence and prevalence of TD among people taking antipsychotic medication, the need for prevention or treatment is clear. Unfortunately, there has been sparse evidence to guide clinicians (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2009</LINK>). Although many treatments have been tested, no one intervention has been shown clearly to be effective. Cessation or reduction of the dose of antipsychotic medication would be the ideal management for TD. In clinical practice this is not always possible, not least because in many individuals such a reduction would lead to relapse. This review focuses on whether the addition of different types of catecholaminergic medications to those already receiving antipsychotic medication is likely to help TD. </P><P>This review is one in a series of Cochrane Reviews evaluating treatments for antipsychotic-induced TD (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>), and is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2006 (<LINK REF="REF-El_x002d_Sayeh-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">El-Sayeh 2006</LINK>).</P></IMPORTANCE></BACKGROUND><OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-10-31 15:47:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>1.

Change data can remove a component of between-person variability from the analysis. On the other hand calculation of change needs two assessments (baseline and endpoint) which can be difficult in unstable and difficult-to-measure conditions such as schizophrenia. We decided to primarily use endpoint data, and only use change data if the former were not available. We combined endpoint and change data in the analysis as we preferred to use mean differences (MD) rather than standardised mean differences throughout (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">2.4 Skewed data</HEADING><P>Continuous data on clinical and social outcomes are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data, we applied the following standards to relevant data before inclusion (see (a), (b) and (c) below).<BR/></P><P>Please note: we entered data from studies of at least 200 participants in the analysis, because skewed data pose less of a problem in large studies. We also entered all relevant change data as when continuous data are presented on a scale that includes a possibility of negative values (such as change data), it is difficult to tell whether data are skewed or not.</P><P>For endpoint data from studies with fewer than 200 participants:</P><P>(a) when a scale starts from the &#64257;nite number zero, we subtracted the lowest possible value from the mean, and divided this by the standard deviation. If this value was lower than 1, it strongly suggests a skew and we excluded these data. If this ratio was higher than 1 but below 2, there is suggestion of skew. We entered these data and tested whether their inclusion or exclusion changed the results substantially. Finally, if the ratio was larger than 2 we included these data, because skew is less likely (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P><P>(b) if a scale starts from a positive value (such as the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) (<LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>), which can have values from 30 to 210), we modified the calculation described above to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skew is present if 2 SD &gt; (S &#8722; S min), where S is the mean score and 'S min' is the minimum score.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">2.5 Common measure</HEADING><P>Where relevant, to facilitate comparison between trials we converted variables that can be reported in different metrics, such as days in hospital (mean days per year, per week or per month) to a common metric (e.g. mean days per month).</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">2.6 Conversion of continuous to binary</HEADING><P>Where possible, we converted continuous outcome measures to dichotomous data. This can be done by identifying cut-off points on rating scales and dividing participants accordingly into 'clinically improved' or 'not clinically improved'. It is generally assumed that if there is a 50% reduction in a scale-derived score such as the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS, <LINK REF="REF-Overall-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1962</LINK>) or the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS, <LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>), this can be considered as a clinically significant response (<LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005b</LINK>).

Cluster trials</HEADING><P>Studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Firstly, authors often fail to account for intra-class correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error whereby P values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>). This causes type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>).</P><P>If any of the included trials had randomised participants by clusters, and where clustering is not accounted for in primary studies, we would have presented such data in a table, with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review we will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intra-class correlation coefficients for their clustered data and to adjust for this by using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Where clustering has been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we will present these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjust for the clustering effect.</P><P>We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a 'design effect'. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) (Design effect = 1 + (m &#8722; 1) * ICC] (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>)). If the ICC is not reported it will be assumed to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>).</P><P>If cluster studies have been appropriately analysed taking into account intra-class correlation coefficients and relevant data documented in the report, synthesis with other studies would be possible using the generic inverse variance technique.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Cross-over trials</HEADING><P>A major concern of cross-over trials is the carry-over effect. It occurs if an effect (pharmacological, physiological or psychological) of the treatment in the first phase is carried over to the second phase. As a consequence on entry to the second phase the participants can differ systematically from their initial state despite a wash-out phase. For the same reason cross-over trials are not appropriate if the condition of interest is unstable (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). As both effects are very likely in severe mental illness, we only used data of the first phase of cross-over studies.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">3.

Continuous</HEADING><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">3.1 Attrition</HEADING><P>We reported and used data where attrition for a continuous outcome was between 0% and 50%, and data only from people who completed the study to that point were reported.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">3.2 Standard deviations</HEADING><P>If standard deviations were not reported, we first tried to obtain the missing values from the authors. If not available, where there were missing measures of variance for continuous data, but an exact standard error and confidence intervals available for group means, and either P value or t value available for differences in mean, we calculated them according to the rules described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>): when only the standard error (SE) is reported, standard deviations (SDs) are calculated by the formula SD = SE * &#8730;(n). Chapters 7.7.3 and 16.1.3 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> present detailed formulae for estimating SDs from P, t or F values, confidence intervals, ranges or other statistics (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). If these formulae did not apply, we calculated the SDs according to a validated imputation method which is based on the SDs of the other included studies (<LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2006</LINK>). Although some of these imputation strategies can introduce error, the alternative would be to exclude a given study&#8217;s outcome and thus to lose information. We nevertheless examined the validity of the imputations in a sensitivity analysis excluding imputed values.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">3.3 Assumptions about participants who left the trials early or were lost to follow-up</HEADING><P>Various methods are available to account for participants who left the trials early or were lost to follow-up. Some trials just present the results of study completers; others use the method of last observation carried forward (LOCF); while more recently, methods such as 'multiple imputation' or 'mixed effects' models for repeated measurements (MMRM) have become more of a standard. While the last two methods seem to be somewhat better than LOCF (<LINK REF="REF-Leon-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leon 2006</LINK>), we feel that the high percentage of participants leaving the studies early and differences in the reasons for leaving the studies early between groups is often the core problem in randomised schizophrenia trials. We therefore did not exclude studies which used the statistical approach. However, we preferred to use the more sophisticated approaches (e.g. MMRM or 'multiple imputation') and only presented completer analyses if some kind of ITT data were not available at all. Moreover, we addressed this issue in the item 'Incomplete outcome data' of the 'Risk of bias' tool.</P></SUBSECTION></SUBSECTION></MISSING_DATA><HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2017-10-31 15:52:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">1.

There is, however, a disadvantage to the random effects model: it puts added weight onto small studies which often are the most biased ones. Depending on the direction of effect these studies can either inflate or deflate the effect size.

The search</HEADING><P>This area of research does not seem to be active. The 2017 update has identified additional data, but most trials predate the year 2000: only one was carried out after, published in 2010. This could be because of reasons such as less concern with TD, or less emergence of the problem in research-active communities because of more thoughtful use of antipsychotic drugs or loss of faith in non-antipsychotic catecholaminergic drugs as a potential treatment.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Few data</HEADING><P>Only a little over 250 people have been included in this review. It is possible that real, and important, effects have not been highlighted because of the necessarily wide CIs of the findings. Many outcomes were not measured at all (see <LINK TAG="APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS" TYPE="SECTION">Overall completeness and applicability of evidence</LINK>), including one of our pre-stated outcome measures. We may have been overambitious in hoping for some of these outcomes in TD trials but simple reporting of satisfaction with care or quality of life still does not seem too demanding and does remain of interest.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">3.

It could be to do with the participant not accepting treatment for a series of reasons, or of participants finding the trial intolerable. It also could be a function of a trial design in which willing participants are still asked to leave because of some degree of protocol violation. In any event, one study reported that 2/17 participants left the celiprolol group compared with a 'not significantly different' 0/18 in the placebo group.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">3.3 Social confidence, social inclusion, social networks, or personalised quality of life</HEADING><P>This group of outcomes was selected as being of importance to patients for the 2017 review update following a service user consultation.

Completeness</HEADING><P>Although we identified a large number of studies on the initial database search, the number of relevant studies was very small in comparison. The majority of studies selected were excluded because of inherent problems in the nature of their cross-over design. That only eight studies were included in the final review does not give full justice to the fact that there has obviously been a reasonable amount of research in this area. This may have implications for future studies as discussed below.</P><P>No outcomes in this review involve large numbers of people, and many outcomes reported no events. None of the studies reported on adverse events. Even if these small studies only set out to show efficacy, not reporting on adverse events is unexpected as non-antipsychotic catecholaminergic compounds are associated with several side effects (<LINK REF="REF-Turjanski-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turjanski 2005</LINK>). In addition, there were very few data on the patient-designated important outcomes of social confidence, social inclusion, social networks, or personalised quality of life; and there were no data on hospital and service utilisation outcomes, economic outcomes, behaviour or cognitive response.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Applicability</HEADING><P>All but one trial were hospital-based but were nevertheless on people who would be recognisable in everyday care. Trials were set in North and South America, Asia, and Europe. Outcomes are understandable in terms of clinical practice. However, most of the interventions in question are experimental in the treatment of tardive dyskinesia. Therefore, should any of the non-antipsychotic catecholaminergic compounds have had important effects, findings might only have been applicable for those compounds accepted as treatment of TD.</P></SUBSECTION></APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS><QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-10-31 15:52:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Overall, the quality of the evidence is low to very low. This means that we have limited to very little confidence in the effect estimates, and the true effect may be, or is likely to be, substantially different from the estimate of the effect. The main reasons for our low confidence in the evidence were as follows.</P><OL><LI>Poor study methodology and reporting of methods resulting in downgrading evidence for risk of bias. Overall the quality of reporting of these trials was poor (see <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). Allocation concealment was not described; generation of the sequence was not explicit; studies were not clearly blinded and we are unsure if data are incomplete or selectively reported or if other biases were operating.</LI><LI>Very small sample sizes resulting in downgrading evidence for imprecision. The largest trial in this review randomised only 50 people. A trial of this size is unable to detect subtle, yet important, differences due to an intervention with any confidence. In order to detect a 20% difference between groups, probably about 150 people are needed in each arm of the study (alpha 0.05, beta 0.8).</LI><LI>Wide CIs (often due to low event rates) that included appreciable benefit or harm for the intervention as well as no effect, resulting in downgrading evidence for imprecision.</LI></OL><P>The small trial sizes, along with the poor reporting of trials, is associated with an exaggeration of effect of the experimental treatment where an effect is detected (<LINK REF="REF-J_x0171_ni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">J&#369;ni 2001</LINK>). This is only evident for the outcome of &#8216;no clinically important improvement in TD' where there is indeed an effect favouring the noradrenergic and dopaminergic drugs compared with placebo (see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>). This finding may be real &#8212; but could equally be a function of biases or of chance.</P></QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE><POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-10-31 15:52:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Missing studies</HEADING><P>We made every effort to identify relevant trials. However, these studies are all small and it is likely that we have failed to identify other studies of limited power. It is likely that such studies would also not be in favour of the intervention group: if they had been so, it is more likely that they would have been published in accessible literature. We do not, however, think it likely that we have failed to identify large relevant studies.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Introducing bias</HEADING><P>We have tried to be balanced in our appraisal of the evidence but could have inadvertently introduced bias. We welcome comments or criticisms. New methods and innovations now make it possible to report data where, in the past, we could not report data at all or had to report data in a different way. We think the 'Summary of findings' tables to be a valuable innovation &#8212; but problematic to those not &#8216;blind&#8217; to the outcome data. It is possible to &#8216;cherry pick&#8217; significant findings for presentation in this table. We have tried to decrease the chance of doing this by asking a new reviewer (HB) to select outcomes relevant for this table before becoming familiar with the data.</P></SUBSECTION></POTENTIAL_BIASES><AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-10-31 15:52:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The only other relevant quantitative review we know of is the previous Cochrane Review (<LINK REF="REF-El_x002d_Sayeh-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">El-Sayeh 2006</LINK>).

For people with antipsychotic-induced tardive dyskinesia</HEADING><P>These studies provide no useful information for service-users. It is unlikely that these data will impact upon the uptake of established strategies for TD such as early detection, dose/drug modification, vitamin E and use of tetrabenazine. However, people with TD could consider these as other experimental treatments for which very little supportive data exist. Few data exist for any treatment for TD.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">2. For clinicians</HEADING><P>These treatments are purely experimental.

For policy makers</HEADING><P>There seem few implications for policy makers except that, perhaps, these compounds should only be used for TD within the context of a well-designed randomised controlled trial.</P></SUBSECTION></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-10-31 15:52:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">1. General</HEADING><P>The power of this review would have been greatly enhanced by better reporting of data. For example, none of the studies made explicit how randomisation was undertaken; and few studies provide data for before the first period of cross-over. We realise that much of the work for these trials predates <A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org/">CONSORT</A> &#8212; first published in <LINK REF="REF-Begg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begg 1996</LINK> &#8212; and that it is only too easy to judge studies of the past by standards of today. Future studies, however, should report to a much higher standard than what we have seen in trials eligible for this review.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Specific</HEADING><P>Well-designed randomised controlled trials, involving a large number of participants over protracted periods of time, are needed if we are to see if non-antipsychotic catecholaminergic drugs could have a role in prevention and treatment of TD. Such studies are of importance to people with the problem, who have long been ignored (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>).</P><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">2.1 Use of cross-over design</HEADING><P>Despite a large number of studies initially highlighted in the search, the data available for this review are very limited. The large number of studies we found, together with the disparate nature of these compounds, highlights the effort as well as the frustration that has gone into researching this topic. As previously mentioned, it is difficult to draw conclusions from a study that only includes 12 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Buruma-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Buruma 1982</LINK>). It seems wasteful that so many studies were excluded because of inadequately designed cross-over formats. Although there are certain advantages in using a cross-over design in chronic conditions such as TD, there are also major disadvantages, one of which is the expected duration over which the drugs in question exert their actions. This cannot be considered as consisting solely of the time taken for the active drug to be removed from the bloodstream &#8212; the much longer period of time that these drugs may effect neurotransmitter or receptor function as well as structure must also be considered. It cannot be assumed that a washout period of a few weeks or less will adequately counteract these carry-over effects. TD is also an unstable condition and people with TD may not remain compliant with medication. All these factors make the arguments for not using cross-over methodology strong, despite the initial attraction (<LINK REF="REF-Armitage-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armitage 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fleiss-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleiss 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pocock-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pocock 1983</LINK>).</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">2.2 Sample size</HEADING><P>The results suggest that larger sample size should be used to provide more precise estimates of effect and to help avoid false conclusions about the effects of the proposed treatment.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">2.3 Length of study</HEADING><P>Only one study included in this review used the intervention for more than five months (<LINK REF="STD-Soni-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Soni 1986</LINK>). TD, however, is a chronic condition of insidious onset, the severity of which fluctuates spontaneously (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1992</LINK>). Even if the compounds under investigation have a swift effect, it is the long-term outcomes that must be considered of most clinical value.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">2.4 Outcomes</HEADING><P>Scale-derived data do have their place. It is important that a scale is validated for measuring changes secondary to treatment in those with TD. Many studies have not used clinically meaningful markers of outcome. They instead tend to either use obscure/modified ratings scales (such as SKAUB) (<LINK REF="STD-Hebenstreit-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Hebenstreit 1986</LINK>); or even more nebulous surrogate end-point measures. Scale-derived data do have their place, but it is important that a scale is validated for measuring changes secondary to treatment in those with TD. In addition, many of the outcomes we initially desired when we started this review have not been investigated. Finally, a service user consultation also informed the addition of outcomes of special importance to patients. We have reconsidered all these outcomes in case they were too ambitious and tried to tailor them to a real-world pragmatic trial design (see <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). Future studies could be well served by using guidelines as described in the CONSORT statement (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>). These may help avoid some of the rectifiable flaws in the study methodologies and as a result allow more studies to be included in the final analyses.</P></SUBSECTION></SUBSECTION></IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH></CONCLUSIONS></BODY><ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS MODIFIED="2017-11-16 12:32:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We would like to thank Clive Adams, Gill Rizzello and Tessa Grant for their advice and technical support.

Personal contact</P><P>We contacted the first author of each included study for information regarding unpublished trials.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Data collection and analysis</HEADING><P>1. Selection of trials<BR/>We downloaded citations from electronic sources including details of author, institution or journal of publication. We (HGE) inspected all reports. These were then re-inspected by (KS and JR) in order to ensure reliable selection. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion, and where there was still doubt we acquired the full article for further inspection. Once the full articles were obtained, we (HGE, KS and JR) decided whether the studies met the review criteria. Whenever we could not resolve any disagreement by discussion, we sought further information and added these trials to the list of those awaiting assessment.</P><P>2. Assessment of methodological quality<BR/>The methodological quality of all included trials was assessed using the criteria described in the Cochrane Handbook (Higgins 2005) and the Jadad Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>). The former is based on the evidence of a strong relationship between allocation concealment and direction of effect (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). The categories are defined below:</P><P>A. Low risk of bias (adequate allocation concealment)<BR/>B. Moderate risk of bias (some doubt about the results)<BR/>C. High risk of bias (inadequate allocation concealment). For the purpose of the analysis in this review, trials were included if they met the Cochrane Handbook criteria A or B.</P><P>The Jadad Scale measures a wider range of factors that impact on the quality of a trial. The scale includes three items:<BR/>1. Was the study described as randomised?<BR/>2. Was the study described as double-blind?<BR/>3. Was there a description of withdrawals and drop outs?</P><P>Each item receives one point if the answer is positive. In addition, a point can be deducted if either the randomization or the blinding/masking procedures described were inadequate.<BR/>For the purpose of the analysis in this review, in addition to the criteria according to the Cochrane Handbook, a cut-off of two points was used in the Jadad scale to check the assessment made by the Handbook criteria. However, we did not use the Jadad Scale to exclude trials in this review.</P><P>3. Data collection<BR/>HGE and JR independently extracted data from selected trials, while KS separately re-extracted information from two different samples (10%). When disputes arose we attempted resolution by discussion. When this was not possible and further information was necessary to resolve the dilemma, we did not enter data but added this outcome of the trial to the list of those awaiting assessment.</P><P>4. Data synthesis<BR/>4.1 Data types<BR/>We assessed outcomes using continuous (for example changes on a behaviour scale), categorical (for example, one of three categories on a symptoms scale, such as 'little change', 'moderate change' or 'much change') or dichotomous measures (for example, either 'no important changes' or 'important changes' in a person's symptoms). Currently RevMan does not support categorical data so we could not analyse them as such.</P><P>4.2 Incomplete data<BR/>With the exception of the outcome of leaving the study early, we did not include trial outcomes if more than 40% of people were not reported in the final analysis.</P><P>4.3 Dichotomous - yes/no - data<BR/>We analysed data on an intention to treat analysis. On the condition that more than 60% of people completed the study, we counted everyone allocated to the intervention regardless of whether they completed the follow up. We assumed that those who dropped out had the negative outcome, with the exception of death. Where possible we made efforts to convert outcome measures to dichotomous data. This can be done by identifying cut off points on rating scales and dividing subjects accordingly into 'clinically improved' or 'not clinically improved'. If the authors of a study had used a predefined cut off point for determining clinical effectiveness we used the reviewers' criteria where appropriate. Otherwise we generally assumed that if there had been a 50% reduction in a scale-derived score, this could be considered as a clinically significant response. Similarly, a rating of 'at least much improved' according to the Clinical Global Impression Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Guy-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guy 1970</LINK>) could be considered as a clinically significant response.</P><P>We calculated the relative risk (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) based on the random effects model, as it takes into account any differences between studies even if there is no statistically significant heterogeneity. It has been shown that RR is more intuitive than odds ratios (<LINK REF="REF-Boissel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boissel 1999</LINK>), and also that odds ratios tend to be interpreted as RR by clinicians (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2000</LINK>). This misinterpretation then leads to an overestimate of the impression of the effect. We inspected graphs to see if an analysis using a fixed effects model made any substantive difference in outcomes that were not statistically significantly heterogeneous. When the overall results were significant we calculated the number needed to treat (NNT) and the number-needed-to-harm (NNH) as the inverse of the risk difference.</P><P>4.4 Continuous data<BR/>4.4.1 Normally distributed data: data on continuous outcomes are frequently skewed, the mean not being the centre of the distribution. The statistics for meta-analysis are thought to be able to cope with some skew, but were formulated for parametric data. To avoid this potential pitfall we applied the following standards to all data before inclusion: (a) standard deviations and means were reported or obtained from authors and (b) for data with finite limits, such as endpoint scale data, the standard deviation (SD), when multiplied by two, was less than the mean. Otherwise the mean is unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>). We reported data that did not meet the first or second standard in the 'other data' tables. If a scale starts from a positive value (such as PANSS, which can have values from 30-210) the calculation described above should be modified to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skewness is present if 2SD&gt;(S-Smin), where S is the mean score and Smin is the minimum score.</P><P>For change data (endpoint minus baseline), the situation is even more problematic. In the absence of individual patient data it is impossible to know if data are skewed, though this is likely. After consulting the ALLSTAT electronic statistics mailing list, we presented change data in MetaView in order to summarise available information. In doing this, it is assumed either that data were not skewed or that the analyses could cope with the unknown degree of skewness. Without individual patient data it is impossible to test this assumption. Where both change and endpoint data were available for the same outcome category only endpoint data are presented. We acknowledge that by doing this much of the published change data were excluded, but argue that endpoint data is more clinically relevant and that if change data were to be presented along with endpoint data it would be given undeserved equal prominence. We are contacting authors of studies reporting only change data for endpoint figures. We reported non-normally distributed data in the 'Other data types' tables.</P><P>4.4.2 Cluster trials<BR/>Studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Firstly, authors often fail to account for intra class correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) whereby P values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This causes type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>).</P><P>Where clustering was not accounted for in primary studies, we presented the data in a table, with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review we will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intra-class correlation co-efficients of their clustered data and to adjust for this using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Where clustering has been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we will also present these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjusted for the clustering effect.</P><P>We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a 'design effect'. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the intraclass correlation co-efficient (ICC) [Design effect = 1+(m-1)*ICC] (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC was not reported it was assumed to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>).</P><P>4.4.2 Rating scales: A wide range of instruments is available to measure mental health outcomes. These instruments vary in quality and many are not valid, or even ad hoc. For outcome instruments some minimum standards have to be set. It has been shown that the use of rating scales which had not been described in a peer-reviewed journal (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>) is associated with bias and therefore we excluded the results of such scales. Furthermore, the instrument should either be a self report or be completed by an independent rater or relative (not the therapist), and the instrument could be considered a global assessment of an area of functioning. However, as it was expected that therapists would frequently also be the rater, we did include such data but commented on this data as 'prone to bias'.</P><P>4.4.3 Summary statistic<BR/>For continuous outcomes we estimated the weighted mean difference (WMD) between groups, again based on the random effects model, as it takes into account any differences between studies even if there is no statistically significant heterogeneity. We inspected data to see if analysis using a fixed effects model made any substantive difference when the results were not statistically significantly heterogeneous. Whenever possible, we took the opportunity to make direct comparisons between trials that used the same measurement instrument to quantify specific outcomes. Where continuous data were presented from different scales rating the same effect, we presented both sets of data and the general direction of effect was inspected.</P><P>5. Heterogeneity<BR/>Firstly, we considered all of the included studies within any comparison to judge clinical heterogeneity. Then we visually inspected graphs used to investigate the possibility of statistical heterogeneity and supplemented this by using, primarily, the I-squared statistic. This provides an estimate of the percentage of variability due to heterogeneity rather than chance alone. Where the I-squared estimate was greater than or equal to 75%, we interpreted this as indicating the presence of high levels of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). If inconsistency was high, we did not summate the data, but presented it separately and reasons for heterogeneity were investigated.</P><P>6. Addressing publication bias<BR/>We entered all data from selected trials into a funnel graph (trial effect versus trial size) in an attempt to investigate the likelihood of overt publication bias.</P><P>7. Sensitivity analyses<BR/>We analysed the effect of including studies with high attrition rates in the sensitivity analysis.</P><P>8. General<BR/>Where possible, we entered data in such a way that the area to the left of the line of no effect indicated a favourable outcome for the treatment groups.</P></SUBSECTION></APPENDIX_BODY></APPENDIX></APPENDICES><EXTENSIONS><EXTENSION ID="FLOW_4" NAME="FIGURE" REVMAN_VERSION="5.1.0" TYPE="FLOWCHART"><ALIAS ALIAS_ID="4"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;10 studies (14 references) included in quantitative synthesis (meta-analysis)&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="120"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;10 studies (14 references) included in qualitative synthesis&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="120"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;71 full-text articles assessed for eligibility&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="120"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;722 records screened&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="120"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;722 records after duplicates removed&lt;/p&gt;"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;704 records identified through database searching&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="120"/><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;10 additional records identified through reference lists of tardive dyskinesia Cochrane reviews&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="120"/><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;8 records found from searching in 2017&lt;/p&gt;"/></FLOWCHARTBOX><OUT TEXT="&lt;p&gt;651 records excluded&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="120"/></FLOWCHARTBOX><OUT TEXT="&lt;p&gt;57 full-text articles (48 studies) excluded, with reasons&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="120"/></FLOWCHARTBOX></FLOWCHARTBOX></FLOWCHARTBOX></ALIAS></EXTENSION></EXTENSIONS></COCHRANE_REVIEW>
