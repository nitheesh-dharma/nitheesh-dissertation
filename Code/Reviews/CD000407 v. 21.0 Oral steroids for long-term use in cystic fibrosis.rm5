<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-09-14 09:36:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Cystic fibrosis causes frequent lung infection and the airways become blocked with mucus. This in turn leads to inflammation, which causes more lung damage and more mucus to be produced. Corticosteroids are strong drugs given to treat this inflammation. The review includes three trials; one for 12 weeks and two with four-year follow up. We could not combine any data. Trials showed that oral steroids of 1mg/kg to 2 mg/kg (prednisolone equivalent) given every other day seemed to slow the advance of lung disease. However, there are serious adverse effects such as cataracts and the slowing of growth at the higher dose. These led to one trial stopping early. Follow-up data show that catch-up growth started two years after treatment ceased. Treatment must use the lowest effective dose and the shortest duration of therapy to reduce the risk of a permanent effect on growth. A dose of 1 mg/kg on alternate days might be considered for up to 24 months, but close attention should be paid to adverse effects. We do not expect any further trials of this treatment to be undertaken, so we do not plan to continue to regularly update the review. However, if any new information is published, we will include this when it is available. This is an update of a previously published review.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-09-14 09:36:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>In cystic fibrosis (CF) airway obstruction and recurrent respiratory infection lead to inflammation, long-term lung damage, respiratory failure and death. Anti-inflammatory agents, e.g. oral corticosteroids are used since inflammation occurs early in disease. This is an update of a previously published review.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2011-06-13 11:42:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>To assess the effectiveness of oral corticosteroids in respiratory complications in CF, particularly lung function and adverse events. We examined long-term use (over 30 days) only.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-09-14 09:36:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2011-06-13 11:43:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Randomised trials comparing oral corticosteroids given for more than 30 days with placebo or no additional therapy in people with CF.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-01-19 11:56:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Two authors independently assessed study eligibility and quality.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-06-03 11:13:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Of eleven studies identified, three (354 participants) were included: two with four-year follow up and one with 12-weeks follow up. Data were lacking on predefined outcomes; common outcomes were examined at different time-points and presented differently. Meta-analyses were not possible.</P>
<P>In one study, oral corticosteroids at prednisolone-equivalent dose of 1 mg/kg alternate days slowed progression of lung disease; at two and four years, % predicted FEV<SUB>1</SUB> in the 1 mg/kg group changed significantly more than in the placebo group (P &lt; 0.02). During the first two years, the 2 mg/kg group was not significantly different from the placebo group. Linear growth retardation was observed from six months in the 2 mg/kg alternate days prednisolone group and from 24 months in the 1 mg/kg alternate days prednisolone group.</P>
<P>Adverse events terminated one four-year study early. Year 10 follow up showed catch-up growth started two years after treatment ceased. Alternate-day treatment with oral corticosteroids may have impaired growth until adulthood in boys.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-08-12 10:19:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Oral corticosteroids at prednisolone-equivalent dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg alternate days appear to slow progression of lung disease in CF; benefit should be weighed against occurrence of adverse events. Risk-benefit analysis of low-dose alternate days corticosteroids is important. No further trials of this intervention are anticipated, and hence the review will no longer be regularly updated. However, if any new data are published, these will be incorporate when available.</P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2015-09-14 09:40:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-09-14 09:38:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-11-05 16:33:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>The defective cystic fibrosis (CF) gene is responsible for causing an abnormal airway surface environment, which leads to both airway obstruction by mucus plugging and recurrent respiratory infection. This leads to inflammation and eventually long-term lung damage (bronchiectasis), respiratory failure and death. The persistent presence of pathogenic organisms, including <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I>, <I>Haemophilus influenza</I>, and <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> in the airways is associated with a powerful inflammatory response which is ineffective in clearing the organisms from the lungs (<LINK REF="REF-Balfour_x002d_Lynn-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balfour-Lynn 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>It has been recognised that the inflammatory process itself may contribute to lung injury (<LINK REF="REF-Konstan-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Konstan 1996</LINK>). The most characteristic feature of lung inflammation in CF is the influx of huge numbers of white cells, called neutrophils, into the airways (<LINK REF="REF-Konstan-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Konstan 1993</LINK>). These numerous neutrophils break down and release a number of substances, including deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), which makes the sputum thick and sticky. They also release products which cause direct lung damage. These include oxygen metabolites (oxidants) and elastase, which damages the airway wall and increases mucus secretion, therefore aggravating airway obstruction. Elastase also causes the secretion of a substance called IL-8, a type of cytokine, which attracts more neutrophils into the airways.</P>
<P>Bronchoscopy combined with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), a technique of examining the airways and getting information about the composition of airway fluids, have helped further understanding of inflammation and lung injury in CF. The inflammatory process occurs early in life, a recent study showing showed that lung inflammation can occur in CF infants as young as four weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Khan-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 1995</LINK>). Another study showed that even infants without clinically obvious lung disease still had evidence of airway infection with inflammation predominated by neutrophils (<LINK REF="REF-Armstrong-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armstrong 1995</LINK>). Studies have also shown that the inflammatory response is also detectable in the airways of people with clinically mild disease (<LINK REF="REF-Konstan-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Konstan 1994</LINK>). BAL in people with CF with mild lung disease has been shown to contain large numbers of inflammatory cells, including neutrophils and free elastase (<LINK REF="REF-Konstan-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Konstan 1994</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2008-08-27 16:30:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Current evidence suggests that inflammation in CF occurs early in life and may contribute to lung damage. This is the rationale for the use of anti-inflammatory therapy in CF. Corticosteroids are powerful anti-inflammatory agents which have been used widely in a number of diseases for several decades and have several important effects on neutrophils, such as stopping the neutrophils converting to their active state (<LINK REF="REF-Schleimer-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schleimer 1990</LINK>) and stopping them producing digestive enzymes (<LINK REF="REF-Llewellyn_x002d_Jones-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Llewellyn-Jones 1994</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-09-14 09:38:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>This review aims to determine whether there is clear evidence that one anti-inflammatory treatment, oral corticosteroids, is beneficial in the treatment of lung disease in people with CF. However, the use of corticosteroids is also associated with well-known, significant side effects. Use of high doses, particularly over a prolonged period of time is associated with changes in appearance including a 'moon-face', weight gain, centripetal redistribution of fat, muscle wasting, acne, bruising, thinning of the skin and stretch marks. High doses can also precipitate or exacerbate existing diabetes mellitus. Prolonged use is associated with osteoporosis (thinning of the bones) and cataract formation. Corticosteroids also increase the risk of contracting certain types of infection and reduce the capacity of the body to respond to serious infection. In children, one of the most worrying side effects is suppression of growth.</P>
<P>This is an update of a previously published review (<LINK REF="REF-Cheng-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheng 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cheng-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheng 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cheng-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheng 2013</LINK>).</P>

<P>The objective of this review is to determine the effectiveness of oral corticosteroids in the management of CF. We wished to test the hypotheses that oral corticosteroids:</P>
<OL>
<LI>reduce the number of days of intravenous antibiotics for respiratory exacerbations;</LI>
<LI>reduce the need for hospital admission for respiratory exacerbations;</LI>
<LI>improve or prevent the decline in objective tests of lung function (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<SUB>1</SUB>); forced vital capacity (FVC); and forced expiratory flow 25-75% (FEF<SUB>25-75</SUB>));</LI>
<LI>improve exercise tolerance;</LI>
<LI>improve nutritional status;</LI>
<LI>are associated with adverse effects including changes in appearance including Cushingoid appearance, growth suppression, diabetes mellitus, cataracts, osteoporosis and opportunistic infection;</LI>
<LI>improve quality of life;</LI>
<LI>improve survival.</LI>

<P>We independently attempted to extract data from each randomised controlled trial (RCT) from text, tables and figures.

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2013-06-13 12:24:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>In order to assess the risk of bias in the included studies, we followed the guidance given in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>). We considered such aspects as generation of randomisation sequence and allocation concealment. If we regarded these as adequately performed, then there was a low risk of bias to the study; if we regarded these as inadequately performed, then there was a high risk of bias to the study; and if they were considered unclear then the risk of bias was unclear too. We also considered the degree of blinding and the risk of bias increased as the number of people blinded to the intervention decreased. Finally, we considered whether issues resulting from incomplete outcome data were adequately addressed and whether this led to a low, high or uncertain risk of bias.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2011-04-12 10:20:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>We aimed to calculate a pooled estimate of the treatment effect for each outcome across studies. For binary outcomes, we planned to express this as a pooled odds ratio (OR) (the odds of an outcome among treatment allocated participants to the corresponding odds among controls) and for continuous outcomes, we would express a pooled estimate of the treatment effect by calculating the mean difference (MD).</P>
<P>The data from these studies are essentially longitudinal in nature. The extractions below are the best that can be hoped for given the constraints of extracting summaries from published reports, although we recognise there are potentially issues of multiple end points. We would require individual patient data for a fuller analysis, but the merits of making the necessary investment are best judged after reviewing the available studies on the basis of reports.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>The ages of the participants ranged from 1 year to 19.5 years. In one study, the participants were stated as having mild to moderate lung disease, but an objective measure of lung disease, such as mean per cent predicted FEV<SUB>1</SUB>, was not reported (<LINK REF="STD-Auerbach-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Auerbach 1985</LINK>). In the other two studies the upper or lower limits of severity of lung disease were stated as FEV<SUB>1</SUB> less than 85% predicted in one (<LINK REF="STD-Greally-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Greally 1994</LINK>); and as FEV<SUB>1</SUB> greater than 60% predicted in the other (<LINK REF="STD-Eigen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Eigen 1995</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>Two studies examined alternate-day corticosteroids (<LINK REF="STD-Auerbach-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Auerbach 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eigen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Eigen 1995</LINK>), in the third study corticosteroids were given daily for the first two weeks and then on alternate days for 10 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Greally-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Greally 1994</LINK>). In each study the comparison of treatment was with placebo and in one study two doses were compared with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Eigen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Eigen 1995</LINK>). The dose of prednisolone varied from 1mg/kg day on alternate days (<LINK REF="STD-Eigen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Eigen 1995</LINK>) to 2 mg/kg on alternate days (<LINK REF="STD-Auerbach-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Auerbach 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eigen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Eigen 1995</LINK>) to 2 mg/kg daily for 14 days followed by 1 mg/kg on alternate days for 10 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Greally-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Greally 1994</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>The duration of administration of oral corticosteroids and follow up ranged from 12 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Greally-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Greally 1994</LINK>) to four years (<LINK REF="STD-Auerbach-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Auerbach 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eigen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Eigen 1995</LINK>). Although not strictly a 'short-term' study (less than 30 days), the study by Greally was a short-term one in comparison to the other two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Greally-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Greally 1994</LINK>). It was also primarily explanatory rather than pragmatic; its aim was to explore the biological mechanisms of oral corticosteroids, rather than to give treatment recommendations (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1991</LINK>). The authors had previously demonstrated higher serum concentration of interleukin-1alpha and interleukin-2R in participants with CF compared to controls; and in this study aimed to investigate the effect of oral prednisolone on these interleukins and also immunoglobulin G (IgG). In one of the long-term studies no intermediate outcome data were presented between baseline and four years (<LINK REF="STD-Auerbach-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Auerbach 1985</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>Four outcomes, which we had intended to assess, had not been reported in any of the three RCTs. These were exercise tolerance, number of days of intravenous antibiotics for respiratory exacerbations, quality of life and survival. The two outcomes common to all three studies were lung function and adverse events.</P>
<P>However, data on the lung function primary endpoint were presented in different ways in each study. In the study by Greally, lung function was expressed as mean absolute change in per cent predicted FEV<SUB>1</SUB> at 14 days and 12 weeks, with confidence levels for the change quoted (<LINK REF="STD-Greally-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Greally 1994</LINK>). In the Auerbach study the mean absolute level of per cent predicted FEV<SUB>1</SUB> at baseline and four years were reported, together with standard error (<LINK REF="STD-Auerbach-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Auerbach 1985</LINK>). In the third study graphs of mean change from baseline of FEV<SUB>1</SUB> and FVC were shown but no standard errors or standard deviations were reported (<LINK REF="STD-Eigen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Eigen 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>The adverse events reported were not the same in each study. The Greally study specifically sought the adverse events of raised blood pressure, high blood sodium, low blood potassium, fluid retention and blood glucose abnormalities (<LINK REF="STD-Greally-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Greally 1994</LINK>). The Auerbach study regularly measured height and weight of participants, but other adverse effects did not seem to have been systematically sought (<LINK REF="STD-Auerbach-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Auerbach 1985</LINK>). The Eigen study monitored adverse events at each clinic visit, i.e. three-monthly, specifically looking for raised blood glucose levels, cataracts, liver enzyme abnormalities, or chest infections with unusual organisms (<LINK REF="STD-Eigen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Eigen 1995</LINK>). In the <LINK TAG="INTERVENTION_EFFECTS" TYPE="SECTION">Effects of interventions</LINK> section of this review, the adverse events are described as they have been reported in the published reports. None of the studies reported whether or not Cushingoid appearance or osteoporosis had developed. Two of the three studies reported effect on height (<LINK REF="STD-Auerbach-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Auerbach 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eigen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Eigen 1995</LINK>); although, as the other study was comparatively short, there would not have been sufficient time for an effect on height to have occurred (<LINK REF="STD-Greally-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Greally 1994</LINK>). Two of the three studies reported the development of diabetes or glucose intolerance (<LINK REF="STD-Eigen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Eigen 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greally-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Greally 1994</LINK>). Two studies evaluating different groups of participants reported the development of cataracts; one was a four-year follow-up study (<LINK REF="STD-Eigen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Eigen 1995</LINK>) and the other a 10-year follow up of some of the participants in another four-year study (<LINK REF="STD-Auerbach-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Auerbach 1985</LINK>). Only one study reported the development of opportunistic infection (<LINK REF="STD-Greally-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Greally 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the study by Eigen, due to an excess of adverse events, the high dose prednisolone (2 mg/kg on alternate days) group was discontinued prematurely three years after accrual of participants commenced and the low dose (1mg/kg on alternate days) was also discontinued a year later (<LINK REF="STD-Eigen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Eigen 1995</LINK>). All three treatment groups were analysed using a repeated measures ANOVA for the first 24 months, but a second analysis was done comparing the 1 mg/kg prednisolone group with placebo for 48 months. Participants, who were in the 2 mg/kg on alternate days group, were not included in the latter analysis because some participants in this group had not received the study drug for as long as 24 months. For either treatment group it was not clear from the report exactly how long oral corticosteroids were given, but it appears to have been a variable length of time, depending on when enrolment into the study took place.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2011-06-13 13:07:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Due to the variations in presentation of data and the different time points at which outcomes were examined, no aggregation of data was possible. We have been unsuccessful so far in obtaining raw data from two of the studies; however, we have received the data from the remaining study (<LINK REF="STD-Greally-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Greally 1994</LINK>). We have not been able to contact any of the authors of the study by Auerbach (<LINK REF="STD-Auerbach-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Auerbach 1985</LINK>), but have been assured by the authors of the study by Eigen that they will send us their raw data (<LINK REF="STD-Eigen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Eigen 1995</LINK>). For this review we have summarised the data as presented in the published reports. Hence we currently report P values, rather than actual group data, with the results of each outcome as a mean for each group or percentages together with confidence intervals (CIs). However, with the exception of the study by Greally, this has not been possible because the data were not expressed in this way in the published reports (<LINK REF="STD-Greally-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Greally 1994</LINK>). The authors acknowledge that the reader will have difficulty in assessing whether a statistically significant change is also clinically important.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">a. FEV<SUB>1</SUB>/FVC/FEF<SUB>25-75</SUB> (% predicted) absolute change from baseline</HEADING>
<P>Greally examined lung function at relatively short time points, 14 days and 12 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Greally-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Greally 1994</LINK>). Mean absolute change in percent predicted FEV<SUB>1</SUB> with the 95% CI for the difference between groups were reported at 14 days and 12 weeks. The mean absolute change in percent predicted FEV<SUB>1</SUB> at 14 days was 7.7% in the treatment group compared to -1.0% in the placebo group (95% CI for the difference between groups 15.08 to 2.32) and at 12 weeks was 6.3% in the prednisolone group compared to -1.8% in the placebo group (95% CI 15.75 to 0.45). The improvement observed in the treatment group is likely to be perceived as beneficial by the participant. We assumed that the standard deviation for both treatment and control groups was the same and, using the formulae for calculating the standard error of the difference between two means and the confidence interval of the difference between two means, calculated the standard deviations of the two groups. Data on FEV<SUB>1</SUB> and FVC have been entered into the data tables.</P>
<P>Auerbach reported that at four years the mean per cent predicted FEV<SUB>1</SUB> was significantly higher in the prednisolone group at a dose of 2 mg/kg on alternate days (103%) compared to the placebo group (87%), P &lt; 0.005. At baseline both groups had similar mean per cent predicted FEV<SUB>1</SUB> (<LINK REF="STD-Auerbach-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Auerbach 1985</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the study by Eigen, an excess of adverse events resulted in the high dose prednisolone (2 mg/kg on alternate days) being discontinued prematurely three years after accrual of participants commenced and the low dose was also discontinued a year later (<LINK REF="STD-Eigen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Eigen 1995</LINK>). All three treatment groups were analysed using a repeated measures ANOVA for the first 24 months but a second analysis was done comparing the 1 mg/kg on alternate days prednisolone group with placebo for 48 months. Actual group data were not reported.</P>
<P>Actual group data for FEV<SUB>1</SUB> and FVC were not reported. With regards to FVC, when the three groups were compared for the initial 24 months, the mean change in per cent predicted FVC was higher in the 1 mg/kg group than the placebo group at all six-monthly time points (P &lt; 0.0001); and at all time points the mean change in per cent predicted FVC was greater in the 2 mg/kg group than the placebo group (P &lt; 0.01). When the 1 mg/kg prednisolone group and the placebo group were compared for the first 48 months of the study, the steroid treated group had a greater change in per cent predicted FVC, which was sustained throughout the period (P &lt; 0.0025). At 24 months, 70.4% participants treated with 1 mg/kg prednisolone had an increase in per cent predicted FVC, compared with 54.9% participants treated with 2 mg/kg prednisolone and 41.6% participants treated with placebo. With regards to FEV<SUB>1</SUB>, during the first 24 months, the 1 mg/kg prednisolone group had a significantly greater change from baseline in per cent predicted FEV<SUB>1</SUB> than placebo. There was no significant difference between the 2 mg/kg group and the placebo group. When the 1 mg/kg prednisolone group were compared for the full 48 months of the study, the prednisolone treated group had a better change from baseline in mean per cent predicted FEV<SUB>1</SUB> than the placebo group (P &lt; 0.02), in that there was a decline in mean per cent predicted FEV<SUB>1</SUB> in the placebo group from 79.2% at baseline to 73.4% at 48%, but no decline in the prednisolone treated group.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Height</HEADING>
<P>Height was reported in two studies but presented differently, as mean height and weight in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Auerbach-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Auerbach 1985</LINK>) and as height z scores in the other (<LINK REF="STD-Eigen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Eigen 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Auerbach demonstrated that the mean height of the prednisolone group, (2 mg/kg on alternate days) was higher at four years than the placebo group (<LINK REF="STD-Auerbach-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Auerbach 1985</LINK>). In the publication the P value was stated as P &lt; 0.025, but the actual changes in each group were not reported. However, long-term follow-up data of this study did suggest an adverse effect on linear growth. In the Auerbach study, Donati suggested in the 10-year follow-up data of 30 out of the 34 participants that there was substantial impairment in growth in the participants who received corticosteroids for four years or more (<LINK REF="REF-Donati-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donati 1990</LINK>). Of the 14 participants who were in the original steroid group, nine took corticosteroids for an average (SD) of 9.5 years (1.2 years) and had a mean z score at 10 years of -1.86 (95% CI -2.44 to -1.28), and the five who stopped taking corticosteroids for 4.5 years (0.46 years) had a mean z score of -1.34 (95% CI -2.58 to -0.10). In contrast, of the 16 participants in the placebo group, five never received corticosteroids and five received corticosteroids for 0.6 years (0.3 years) and had a mean z score of -0.70 (95% CI -1.3 to -0.10). The figures for the means and standard deviations were reported in the original paper (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>), the 95% CIs have been calculated from these figures. The authors of this review acknowledge that this was an incomplete follow-up study and that although one of the 30 participants died; we do not know why data on the other three were unavailable.</P>
<P>Eigen also showed that treatment with prednisolone adversely affected growth (<LINK REF="STD-Eigen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Eigen 1995</LINK>). Evidence of this was apparent six months from starting the study in the 2 mg/kg prednisolone group, but not until 24 months in the 1 mg/kg prednisolone group. Linear growth retardation, as defined in this study by a decrease of one z score, occurred statistically significantly more often in the steroid-treated participants at either dose, than those treated with placebo (P &lt; 0.05) in the 1 mg prednisone group OR 2.58 (95% CI 1.18 to 5.63); and for the 2 mg prednisone group OR 3.70 (95% CI 1.73 to 7.92) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>).</P>
<P>Following six months of treatment and after 12, 18 and 24 months, the high-dose group had a significantly greater reduction in height z score than the placebo-treated group (P &lt; 0.001). For the 1 mg/kg group the height z score was significantly lower than that of the placebo group after 24 months of treatment and also at 36 and 48 months (P &lt; 0.001). Confidence intervals or standard errors were not reported. At 24 months the mean change in height z score was 0.02% for the placebo group, -0.1% for the 1 mg/kg prednisolone group and -0.3% for the 2 mg/kg prednisolone group; at 36 months -0.01% for the placebo group, -0.25% for the 1 mg/kg group; and at 48 months -0.05% for the placebo group and -0.5% for the 1 mg/kg group. These values were read off a graph in the published report.</P>
<P>Lai evaluated long-term growth in 224 of the 243 children enrolled in the Eigen study (<LINK REF="REF-Lai-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lai 1999</LINK>). Growth patterns were examined six to seven years after prednisolone was discontinued. At this stage (in 1997) 68% of the participants were 18 years or older. Height z scores among prednisolone-treated participants declined from baseline to three to four years in both genders. Catch-up growth began two years after prednisolone was discontinued.</P>
<P>Among the boys, the z scores for height remained significantly lower after 10 years in those who received prednisolone than in those who received placebo (P = 0. 03). The mean height for boys aged 18 years or older was significantly lower (by 13 percentile points) in the boys who received low-dose prednisolone (P = 0.03); in the 1mg prednisone group, MD -3.90 (95% CI -7.77 to -0.03) and the 2mg prednisone group, MD -4.10 (95% CI -7.82 to -0.38) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). The impact of growth suppression was more pronounced and final adult height was affected if the prednisolone was started before puberty. In girls there was no significant difference in height after 18 years of age in those who received prednisolone compared to those who received placebo (P = 0.87); in the 1 mg prednisone group MD -1.00 (95% CI -4.54 to 2.54) and for the 2 mg prednisone group MD -0.50 (95% CI -4.43 to 3.43) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>). Among the girls, no significant differences in z scores for height were found among prednisolone groups after six years (P = 0.26). In addition, girls who started taking prednisolone at younger ages did not have greater declines in z scores for height than girls who started at older ages. In the follow up of the Eigen study, Lai did not state whether formal tests of interaction were undertaken (<LINK REF="REF-Lai-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lai 1999</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Weight</HEADING>
<P>All three studies presented data on weight (<LINK REF="STD-Auerbach-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Auerbach 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eigen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Eigen 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greally-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Greally 1994</LINK>). However, only data from two studies could be entered in the analysis; one study presented data for change in weight (<LINK REF="STD-Greally-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Greally 1994</LINK>) and the remaining study presented weight in kg (<LINK REF="STD-Eigen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Eigen 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Auerbach demonstrated that the mean height and weight of the prednisolone group, (2 mg/kg on alternate days) was higher at four years than the placebo group (<LINK REF="STD-Auerbach-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Auerbach 1985</LINK>). In the publication the P values were stated as P &lt; 0.025 for height and P &lt; 0.005 for weight, but the actual changes in each group were not reported.</P>
<P>Greally reported the change in weight from baseline; weight gain was higher in the oral steroid group, but the result was not significant, MD 0.34 (95% CI -2.32 to 3.00) (<LINK REF="STD-Greally-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Greally 1994</LINK>) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>).</P>
<P>Eigen presented absolute values for weight at over 18 years of age split for males and females. For the boys, weight was higher in both treatment groups compared to placebo; this was not statistically significant in the 1mg prednisone group MD -4.60 (95% CI -9.69 to 0.49), but was statistically significant in the 2 mg prednisone group MD -6.70 (95 % CI -11.59 to -1.81]) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>). For the girls, weight was higher in the 1 mg prednisone group compared to placebo, MD -2.30 (95% CI -6.74 to 2.14); but lower in the 2 mg prednisone group compared to placebo, MD 1.70 (95% CI -3.37 to 6.77) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>). Neither result was statistically significant for the girls.<BR/>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Occurrence of adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>(e.g. changes in appearance including Cushingoid appearance, cataracts, osteoporosis, obesity, diabetes mellitus requiring regular treatment, occurrence of opportunistic infection categorised as mild (e.g. oral or vaginal thrush, ringworm) or serious (e.g. shingles, herpes virus, life-threatening infection))</P>
<P>We described earlier which of these adverse events were systematically sought during the course of the studies and have described the occurrence of these outcomes as they were reported in the published reports. As stated in the '<LINK TAG="STUDY_DESCRIPTION" TYPE="SECTION">Description of studies</LINK>' section, 95% CIs were not reported. The study by Auerbach was not analysed on an 'intention-to-treat' basis and there was further loss to follow up at 10 years (<LINK REF="STD-Auerbach-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Auerbach 1985</LINK>). Therefore, it was not possible to calculate percentages or rates for any adverse effects. Eigen reported adverse events, but it is not possible to differentiate whether more than one event occurred in the same participant, so again it is not possible to report percentages or rates (<LINK REF="STD-Eigen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Eigen 1995</LINK>). </P>
<P>The development of a Cushingoid appearance was reported in one study and occurred in four of the prednisolone-treated participants (2 mg/kg on alternate days) (<LINK REF="STD-Auerbach-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Auerbach 1985</LINK>).</P>
<P>Development of cataracts was reported in two studies. The 10-year follow-up report of the Auerbach study by Donati reported that two participants had developed cataracts (<LINK REF="REF-Donati-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donati 1990</LINK>). Eigen reported that during the first 24 months, cataracts were seen more often in participants in the 2 mg/kg prednisolone group (11 participants) compared to the 1 mg/kg group (three participants) (<LINK REF="STD-Eigen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Eigen 1995</LINK>). We also noted that seven participants in the placebo group developed cataracts.</P>
<P>Osteoporosis was not specifically noted, but in the follow up to the Auerbach study, Donati reported that two of the prednisolone-treated participants (2mg/kg on alternate days) developed multiple bone fractures (<LINK REF="REF-Donati-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donati 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>Diabetes mellitus requiring regular treatment was not specifically reported in any of the four studies but all four noted varying degrees of glucose intolerance. In the short-term study, Greally reported that one participant developed hyperglycaemia (17 mmol/L) at the end of two weeks of 2 mg/kg prednisolone which settled on the alternate-day regimen (<LINK REF="STD-Greally-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Greally 1994</LINK>). In the follow up to the Auerbach study, Donati reported that glucose intolerance occurred in 2 of the 14 prednisolone-treated participants (2 mg/kg on alternate days) in whom data were available (<LINK REF="REF-Donati-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donati 1990</LINK>). Eigen noted that abnormalities in glucose metabolism (elevated haemoglobin A1c, raised fasting blood glucose concentration or glucose in the urine) were seen more often in the prednisolone 2 mg/kg group than in the 1 mg/kg group (P &lt; 0.05) but there was no difference between the 1 mg/kg and placebo groups (P &lt; 0.05) (<LINK REF="STD-Eigen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Eigen 1995</LINK>). </P>
<P>Interestingly, occurrence of opportunistic infection was reported only in the shorter-term study (<LINK REF="STD-Greally-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Greally 1994</LINK>). No opportunistic infections occurred in the treated group but it was not reported whether any occurred in the control group.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-06-13 12:16:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Oral corticosteroids at a dose of 1 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg (prednisolone equivalent) administered on alternate days over 12 weeks to 4 years appeared to slow the progression of lung disease in CF as supported by FEV<SUB>1</SUB> and FVC values documented longitudinally. However, in the long term this benefit needs to be weighed against the occurrence of adverse effects (glucose abnormalities, cataracts and growth retardation), especially linear growth suppression. At the higher dose of 2 mg/kg on alternate days, the occurrence of adverse events resulted in early termination of one study by a data safety monitoring committee, outweighing any beneficial effects on lung function (<LINK REF="STD-Eigen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Eigen 1995</LINK>). The number of days participants had been taking the dose of 2 mg/kg on alternate days was not stated in the published report. Accrual of participants took place between April 1986 and December 1987. Termination of the high dose was in August 1990. Although adverse events were not reported in the other study which used this dose, this may be due to the smaller sample size used (<LINK REF="STD-Auerbach-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Auerbach 1985</LINK>). It was disappointing that the contrasting results of the two studies using the higher dose, 2 mg/kg on alternate days, could not be aggregated because of differing presentation of data and the lack of any interim data between baseline and four years in one of these studies. We have attempted unsuccessfully to obtain the raw data from these two studies. Even at the lower dose of 1 mg/kg on alternate days, recommendations to terminate the study prematurely were made, due to the occurrence of adverse effects (glucose abnormalities, cataracts and growth retardation) (<LINK REF="STD-Eigen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Eigen 1995</LINK>). Long-term follow up of the Eigen study has shown that the height deficit in boys persisted six to seven years after discontinuation of prolonged alternate-day treatment with prednisolone (<LINK REF="REF-Lai-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lai 2000</LINK>). It is likely that the shorter adult height was due partly to the effect of long-term treatment with prednisolone and not just the underlying CF. This difference was not seen in girls. These long-term data suggest that when oral corticosteroids are used in people with CF, treatment regimens need to be adjusted to find the lowest effective dose and the shortest duration of therapy in order to minimise the risk of permanent growth impairment, especially in boys. It is very important that the benefits in improved lung function are weighed against the risk to long-term growth.</P>
<P>Although the shorter-term study was primarily explanatory, examining the biological effects of corticosteroids on inflammatory markers, lung function was also assessed and showed an improvement in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> at both 14 days and 12 weeks, but in this relatively short time period no adverse effects occurred (<LINK REF="STD-Greally-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Greally 1994</LINK>). </P>
<P>It is disappointing that effects on survival and quality of life measures were not assessed. The development of Cushingoid appearance was reported in only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Auerbach-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Auerbach 1985</LINK>). This is a particularly important outcome to people with CF as the resulting effect on quality of life might not compensate for any improvement in breathlessness.</P>
<P>Although we have not been able to perform a formal meta-analysis for any outcome at any time-point, this review has summarised the best information currently available. It is important to note that of the three studies included in this review only one was assessed to be of good quality (<LINK REF="STD-Eigen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Eigen 1995</LINK>). Information to fully assess the quality of the other two studies was not available (<LINK REF="STD-Auerbach-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Auerbach 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greally-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Greally 1994</LINK>). We have been unable to contact any of the authors of the Auerbach study (<LINK REF="STD-Auerbach-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Auerbach 1985</LINK>), but we have been assured that the data from the Eigen study (<LINK REF="STD-Eigen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Eigen 1995</LINK>), currently on a data tape will be sent to us in due course. We hope to include a quantitative analysis in a future update of this review.</P>
<P>We have identified three abstracts presented at conferences relating to the same RCT by Nyamugunduru (<LINK REF="STD-Nyamugunduru-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Nyamugunduru 1998</LINK>). To our knowledge, this is not yet published. The RCT seems to be eligible for inclusion in the review; however, the information in the abstract is insufficient for assessing methodological quality. The lung function data are not presented in a format which can be aggregated with existing included data. We have written again to the authors for further information.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-08-12 10:20:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Current evidence suggests that oral corticosteroids at a prednisolone equivalent dose of 2 mg/kg on alternate days is effective but should not be used due to the high risk of occurrence of important side effects. A dose of 1 mg/kg on alternate days might be considered for up to 24 months but close attention to the occurrence of adverse effects is warranted.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-08-12 10:20:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Although oral corticosteroids at a dose of 1 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg on alternate days appear to slow the progression of lung disease in CF, this is at the expense of the occurrence of adverse events. The evidence from Eigen's study suggests that growth retardation may appear after 24 months of treatment with prednisolone at 1 mg/kg on alternate days and as early as six months with a dose of 2 mg/kg on alternate days (<LINK REF="STD-Eigen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Eigen 1995</LINK>). Therefore, further RCTs examining the effectiveness and safety of treatment on a long-term basis are not warranted. However, a survival analysis from the 10-year follow-up study (<LINK REF="STD-Auerbach-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Auerbach 1985</LINK>) or indeed from the other long-term study (<LINK REF="STD-Eigen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Eigen 1995</LINK>) would be helpful in determining whether the use of oral corticosteroids has any effect on long-term survival. It would seem prudent to address the effectiveness of alternative anti-inflammatory agents in future RCTs.</P>
<P>We recommend that any future studies should adequately consider adverse effects particularly quality of life measures to assess acceptability to participants. We would urge trialists to recognise that the results of individual RCTs are likely to be included in systematic reviews such as this. They should therefore consider standardising the presentation of outcomes to enable the data to be aggregated. However, despite these recommendations, we do not anticipate any further trials of this intervention, and hence we do not plan to update the review on a regular basis. If we become aware that any new data have been published, we will incorporate these into the review.</P>
