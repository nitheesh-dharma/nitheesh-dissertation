</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Eradication strategies for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are variable. We sought to summarize the evidence for use of antimicrobial agents to eradicate MRSA. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To describe the effects of topical and systemic antimicrobial agents on nasal and extra-nasal MRSA carriage, adverse events, and incidence of subsequent MRSA infections.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group's trials register (August 2003), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Issue 3, 2003), MEDLINE (1966 to 2003), EMBASE (1988 to 2003), handsearched relevant literature, and contacted MRSA experts and the manufacturer of mupirocin. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomized controlled trials of patients colonized with MRSA comparing topical or systemic antimicrobials to placebo or no treatment, and trials comparing various combinations of topical or systemic agents to no treatment, placebo, or to topical or systemic agents. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers independently applied inclusion criteria to potentially relevant trials, assessed trial methodological quality, and extracted data. Primary outcomes included eradication of MRSA, infection due to MRSA, and adverse events.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Six trials (384 participants) met the inclusion criteria. No difference in MRSA eradication was detected in four studies: one that compared mupirocin to placebo, two that compared one systemic agent to no treatment (fusidic acid in one and rifampin or minocycline in the other) and one that compared mupirocin to topical fusidic acid and oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, examining nasal MRSA eradication as an outcome. </P>
<P>One study compared minocycline to rifampin, with rifampicin being more effective in relation to eradication of MRSA from all sites at day 30 (relative risk 0.16; 95% confidence intervals 0.02 to 1.00), but the difference at 90 days was not statistically significant (n = 18). </P>
<P>Two studies (one testing novobiocin and rifampin, the other ciprofloxacin and rifampin, versus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and rifampin) did not demonstrate a difference in eradication of MRSA at all sites (n = 94). </P>
<P>Adverse events with systemic agents occurred in up to 20% of participants, however reporting was sporadic and denominators small. All trials reported development of resistance to antimicrobial agents used. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is insufficient evidence to support use of topical or systemic antimicrobial therapy for eradicating nasal or extra-nasal MRSA. There is no demonstrated superiority of either topical or systemic therapy, or of combinations of these agents. Potentially serious adverse events and development of antimicrobial resistance can result from therapy.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-06-18 11:49:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<I>Staphylococcus aureus</I> is a relatively virulent bacterium that can cause serious infections including skin and soft tissue infections, wound infections, bacteremia, pneumonia, and endocarditis (<LINK REF="REF-Waldvogel-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waldvogel 1995</LINK>). It is commonly found in two main carriage sites, the nose (20%), and to a lesser extent, the perineum (3%) (<LINK REF="REF-Casewell-1986a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casewell 1986a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ayliffe-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ayliffe 1996</LINK>). The skin, including the hands, can be transiently contaminated. Compared to the general population, some groups of people such as healthcare workers, individuals with diabetes, patients on chronic haemodialysis, individuals with skin conditions, and users of illicit intravenous drugs, are more likely to be colonized with <I>S. aureus</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Waldvogel-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waldvogel 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Methicillin-resistant <I>S. aureus</I> (MRSA) refers to strains of <I>S. aureus</I> that have acquired the mecA gene. This gene encodes an altered penicillin binding protein (PBP 2a) that renders MRSA resistant to all beta-lactam antibiotics, including the penicillins (e.g. methicillin and cloxacillin - the penicillinase-resistant penicillins) and cephalosporins (<LINK REF="REF-Livermore-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Livermore 2000</LINK>). Although strains vary in their resistance patterns, MRSA are frequently resistant to many other antibiotics.</P>
<P>Like other strains of <I>S. aureus</I>, MRSA can cause serious infections although there is no evidence that they are more virulent than methicillin-sensitive <I>S. aureus</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Ayliffe-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ayliffe 1974</LINK>). The mortality attributable to MRSA bacteremia was recently estimated to be 22% (<LINK REF="REF-Selvey-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Selvey 2000</LINK>). Generally people who are carriers of MRSA (said to be 'colonized') have no symptoms. They may be at increased risk for developing an infection with MRSA however (<LINK REF="REF-Pujol-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pujol 1996</LINK>). People who spend a lot of time in hospitals are more likely to be colonized with <I>S. aureus</I> and thus are more likely to be colonized with MRSA. In the past three decades, MRSA has become widespread in many hospitals (<LINK REF="REF-Ayliffe-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ayliffe 1996</LINK>). The major form of spread is hand borne transmission, that is, transmission from one patient to another via colonized hands of healthcare workers (<LINK REF="REF-Mulligan-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mulligan 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Hospital infection control staff want to limit the spread of MRSA for several reasons. There have recently been reports of strains of MRSA that have intermediate resistance to vancomycin (<LINK REF="REF-Sieradzki-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sieradzki 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1999</LINK>). This is an important concern since the already limited treatment options for serious MRSA infections (e.g. vancomycin, linezolid, quinupristin-dalfopristin) may become more limited due to the increase in resistance to vancomycin (<LINK REF="REF-Paradisi-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paradisi 2001</LINK>). Limiting the spread of MRSA might reduce the potential for the appearance of these strains. Another concern has been that the spread of MRSA and spread of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), might result in transfer of the vancomycin-resistance gene from VRE to MRSA, rendering this strain of MRSA fully resistant to vancomycin. The first such isolate has recently been detected (<LINK REF="REF-Sievert-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sievert 2002</LINK>). The cost of treating an MRSA infection is another concern because vancomycin, the antibiotic most commonly used to treat MRSA infection, is expensive and can only be administered intravenously.</P>
<P>Various strategies exist for controlling the spread of MRSA within healthcare settings. These include laboratory surveillance and screening for MRSA, promoting careful hand washing, gowning and gloving by staff, isolation of colonized people, and using antibiotic drugs or antiseptics to eradicate MRSA from colonized people (decolonization therapy). Most institutions use a combination of these strategies. There are many institutions that use either topical or systemic agents in an attempt to eradicate MRSA from individuals who are colonized. While eradication strategies within a particular healthcare facility are generally standardized, those between healthcare institutions can be extremely variable even within local communities. In some facilities, topical ointments (such as mupirocin) are routinely used to eradicate MRSA. Washing and daily bathing with antiseptic detergents such as chlorhexidine or triclosan are often done to help eradicate MRSA. Some infection control practitioners treat colonized individuals with systemic antibiotics to eradicate MRSA. In others, there may be no topical or systemic agents used. The ability of topical or systemic therapy to eradicate MRSA may vary depending on the site (e.g. wound) or presence of instrumentation (such as an indwelling urinary catheter). Potential harm associated with the use of eradication therapy includes the development of further antibiotic resistance or the possibility of adverse events.</P>
<P>Although clinical trials of eradication therapy in colonized healthcare workers (healthy adults) exist (<LINK REF="REF-Casewell-1986b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casewell 1986b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scully-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scully 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fernandez-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fernandez 1995</LINK>), in practice healthcare workers are not systematically screened for MRSA and offered eradication therapy. In contrast, many hospital patients are routinely screened and offered antibiotic ointments or drugs if they are found to be colonized. Therefore, this review will be limited to patients and will exclude healthcare workers.</P>
<P>At the level of the individual, the rationale for decolonization therapy is that it may reduce the risk of subsequent MRSA infection. If effective, it may also mean colonized individuals in healthcare institutions can spend less time in isolation. This review will systematically summarize the evidence on the effects of antimicrobial agents for eradicating MRSA.</P>

<P>We attempted to identify all relevant studies regardless of language or publication status (published, unpublished, in press, and in progress). </P>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group's trials register for relevant trials up to August 2003 using the search terms: methicillin, staphylococcus, and MRSA. Full details of the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group's methods and the journals handsearched are published in The Cochrane Library in the section on Collaborative Review Groups. </P>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published in The Cochrane Library (Issue 3, 2003) using the search terms: staphylococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus infection staphylococcal infections, methicillin resistance, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus, and MRSA. </P>
<P>We searched MEDLINE (January 1966 to August 2003) and EMBASE (1988 to August 2003) in combination with the search strategy developed by The Cochrane Collaboration (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2003</LINK>) using the search terms: Staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcal infection, staphylococcal infections, staphylococcal skin infections, methicillin resistance, methicillin resistance ointments, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus, and MRSA. The detailed search strategy is available in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>We handsearched (January 1991 to August 2001) the following journals: American Journal of Infection Control, Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology, and Hospital Infection. </P>
<P>We handsearched the following conference proceedings (January 1991 to August 2001) for relevant abstracts: Annual Society for Health Care Epidemiology of America Meeting, the Interscience Conference on Chemotherapy and Antimicrobial Agents (ICAAC), and the American Practitioners of Infection Control Meeting.</P>
<P>We contacted the manufacturer of mupirocin (SmithKline Beecham) and individual researchers working in the field were contacted for unpublished data, confidential reports, and raw data of published trials. </P>
<P>We checked the citations of existing reviews and of all trials identified by the above methods. </P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">OUTCOMES</HEADING>
<P>Eradication on day 14 post-treatment was the most frequently reported outcome (four of the six studies). One study reported eradication at 180 days (<LINK REF="STD-Peterson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Peterson 1990</LINK>). Studies also reported eradication at other time points (days 12, 19, 21, 26, 30, 90). Only one study reported on infection (<LINK REF="STD-Harbarth-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Harbarth 1999</LINK>). Three studies reported on nasal eradication (<LINK REF="STD-Harbarth-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Harbarth 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Parras-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Parras 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walsh-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 1993</LINK>).

All six studies reported on resistance of the MRSA to the antimicrobial agent(s) being evaluated. Four studies reported on whether MRSA strains were the same or different from pre-treatment isolates.</P>

Similarly, no evidence of a difference was demonstrated in eradication of MRSA from nasal sites alone on day 26 (19 of 43 in the mupirocin group versus 11 of 44 in the placebo group; RR 1.77; 95% CI 0.96 to 3.26).</P>

Follow up was at 30 days and 90 days. Outcomes were eradication of MRSA at all sites. Results of the fusidic acid trial (n = 16) and the combined results of rifampin and minocycline of the second trial (n = 25) showed qualitatively different effects (relative risks of 0.67 (95% CI 0.18 to 2.42) and 8.00 (95% CI 0.53 to 121.59) respectively using 30-day follow up).

<P>Three trials reported resistance of MRSA strains to the eradication agents. In the trial comparing mupirocin ointment to placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Harbarth-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Harbarth 1999</LINK>), no isolates showed intermediate or high level resistance to mupirocin. Strains with low level resistance to mupirocin (minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) 8 to 64 mg/litre) were documented in 23 participants (11 in the mupirocin group and 12 the placebo group). In the trial comparing fusidic acid to no treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Chang-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 2000</LINK>), all pre-treatment MRSA strains obtained from study participants were susceptible to fusidic acid. In two participants who received fusidic acid, MRSA isolates with elevated MICs were noted (one had an MIC &#8805; 256 &#956;g/ml, five had an MIC of 128 &#956;g/ml, and one had an MIC &#8805; 256 &#956;g/ml). Muder and colleagues found increased rifampin MICs in four participants receiving rifampin (in two however the post-treatment strains were different than pre-treatment strains) (<LINK REF="STD-Muder-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Muder 1994</LINK>). They also report that in five participants treated with rifampin or rifampin and minocycline in whom post-therapy MRSA strains with high rifampin MICs were isolated, strains that were different from pre-treatment strains. With one exception, all pre-treatment strains of MRSA were susceptible to rifampin while four strains showed intermediate resistance to minocycline. An increase in minocycline MIC was noted in post-therapy isolates from three participants, two of whom received rifampin and minocycline and one who received rifampin alone.</P>

In the study comparing oral fusidic acid to no treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Chang-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 2000</LINK>), 10 of 16 participants had persistent colonization by the pre-treatment strain while 6 had colonization with a different strain during follow up. Of the two participants with MRSA strains with elevated MICs, the post-treatment pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns were the same as pretreatment isolates. In the study comparing rifampin, minocycline, both these agents, and no treatment (Muder 1994), five participants had strains that were different from pre-treatment strains. These were participants treated with rifampin or rifampin and minocycline in whom post-therapy MRSA strains with high rifampin MICs were isolated.</P>

<P>In the study comparing novobiocin and rifampin to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and rifampin (<LINK REF="STD-Walsh-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 1993</LINK>), restriction endonuclease digestion patterns of plasmid DNA suggest that in 24 of 29 participants, failure of the study drug was related to the pre-treatment strain rather than acquisition of a new strain.

<P>In the study comparing ciprofloxacin and rifampin to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and rifampin (<LINK REF="STD-Peterson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Peterson 1990</LINK>), nine participants had pre-MRSA isolates typed.

</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The methodological quality of the published trials was low. Four studies failed to report generation of allocation sequence, five studies did not report allocation concealment, and three studies were not blinded. Follow up was inadequate in half of the studies. The results were not based on an intention-to-treat basis in any of the studies. </P>
<P>The confidence intervals for the comparison of mupirocin verus placebo for eradicating MRSA from all sites at 26 days were wide and did not rule out a clinically important effect (<LINK REF="STD-Harbarth-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Harbarth 1999</LINK>). About 25% of participants cleared MRSA while receiving placebo. Similarly, confidence intervals comparing a systemic agent alone to no treatment were wide and did not rule out a clinically important effect (<LINK REF="STD-Muder-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Muder 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chang-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 2000</LINK>). </P>
<P>One topical and one systemic agent did not appear to show an advantage over a single topical agent alone (<LINK REF="STD-Parras-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Parras 1995</LINK>). This is based on comparing mupirocin to topical fusidic acid and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and may not be generalization to other agents. Although the effect sizes when two systemic agents (minocycline and rifampin) were compared to no treatment was large &#8722; RR 9.54 at 30 days and RR 3.50 at 90 days &#8722; the differences were not statistically significant. Comparisons of two systemic agents versus one revealed no statistical significant differences. </P>
<P>While the majority of post-treatment strains corresponded to pre-treatment MRSA strains, in three trials there were a substantial percentage of participants with strains identified following treatment that were different from the pre-treatment strains. The most likely explanation for this is that new MRSA were acquired following or during treatment. Another possibility is that some participants were colonized with more than one strain, but only one strain was detected at baseline. This makes interpretation of rates of eradication more difficult. <BR/> <BR/>The development of increased resistance to antimicrobial agents used for eradication was noted in all studies. The frequency of antimicrobial resistance varied depending on the study, for example, 23% low-level resistance to mupirocin in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Harbarth-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Harbarth 1999</LINK>), and not all MRSA strains were systematically tested for resistance to the eradication agent(s) used. </P>
<P>Adverse events were reported in only half the trials and in those trials the reporting appeared to be incomplete. As expected, fewer adverse events due to topical agents were reported. Potentially serious adverse events such as liver function abnormalities and leukopenia were reported with the use of two systemic agents. </P>
<P>The scope of this review was limited to eradication trials of MRSA and not methicillin-sensitive <I>S. aureus</I> (MSSA). Although it is possible that combining MRSA and MSSA eradication trials might have increased power to detect an effect, the results would not necessarily be applicable to individuals with MRSA. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is insufficient evidence to support use of topical or systemic antimicrobial therapy for eradicating MRSA. There is no demonstrated superiority of either topical or systemic therapy, or of combinations of topical and systemic agents. Potentially serious adverse events can arise from use of systemic agents. Topical or systemic agents can lead to the development of resistance to the antimicrobial agent used for eradication. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Larger randomized controlled trials are needed to demonstrate efficacy of either systemic or topical antimicrobial therapy in eradicating MRSA. The comparator arm for such trials should utilize a placebo, either ointment or pill depending on the intervention. These trials should type both pre-treatment and post-treatment strains in order to adequately document efficacy. There should be careful documentation of adverse effects as well as the development of resistance to antimicrobial agents used. </P>
