<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Morphine taken by mouth produced good pain relief for most people with moderate or severe cancer pain.</P>
<P>One person in two or three who gets cancer will suffer from pain that becomes moderate or severe in intensity. The pain tends to get worse as the cancer progresses. Morphine taken by mouth has been used since the 1950s for controlling cancer pain. In 1986 the World Health Organization recommended taking an oral solution of morphine every four hours. Morphine is now available in a number of different formats that release the morphine over various periods of time. Morphine immediate release is rapidly absorbed, and would usually be taken every four hours. Modified release tablets are available that release morphine more slowly, so that they can be taken only twice a day or even only once a day.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>In this updated review we set out to estimate how well morphine worked, how many people had side effects, and how severe those side effects were &#8211; for example, whether they were so severe that participants stopped taking their oral morphine.</P>
<P>We found 62 studies with 4241 participants. The studies were often small, compared many different preparations, and used different study designs. This made it difficult to work out whether any one tablet or preparation of oral morphine was better than any other. There did not seem to be much difference between them.</P>
<P>
<B>Key findings</B>
</P>
<P>More than 9 in 10 participants had pain that went from moderate or severe before taking morphine to pain that was no worse than mild when taking morphine. More than 6 in 10 participants were very satisfied with the morphine treatment, or considered the result to be very good or excellent. Only about 1 person in 20 stopped taking morphine because of side effects. Morphine is associated with some unwanted effects, mainly constipation, and nausea and vomiting.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>At one level these are good results. On another level, the quality of studies is generally poor and we could wish for more consistency in study design, and especially in study reporting, which should include the outcome of pain reduced to tolerable levels &#8211; no worse than mild pain &#8211; so that people with cancer are not bothered by pain.</P>

<P>This is the third updated version of a Cochrane review first published in Issue 4, 2003 of <I>The Cochrane Library </I>and first updated in 2007<I>.</I> Morphine has been used for many years to relieve pain. Oral morphine in either immediate release or modified release form remains the analgesic of choice for moderate or severe cancer pain.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-02-16 10:22:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anna Erskine">
<P>To determine the efficacy of oral morphine in relieving cancer pain, and to assess the incidence and severity of adverse events.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-02-11 12:48:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the following databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 9); MEDLINE (1966 to October 2015); and EMBASE (1974 to October 2015). We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov (1 October 2015).</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-02-11 12:48:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) using placebo or active comparators reporting on the analgesic effect of oral morphine in adults and children with cancer pain. We excluded trials with fewer than 10 participants.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-02-11 12:49:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>One review author extracted data, which were checked by another review author. There were insufficient comparable data for meta-analysis to be undertaken or to produce numbers needed to treat (NNTs) for the analgesic effect. We extracted any available data on the number or proportion of participants with 'no worse than mild pain' or treatment success (very satisfied, or very good or excellent on patient global impression scales).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-02-16 10:22:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anna Erskine">
<P>We identified seven new studies in this update. We excluded six, and one study is ongoing so also not included in this update. This review contains a total of 62 included studies, with 4241 participants. Thirty-six studies used a cross-over design ranging from one to 15 days, with the greatest number (11) for seven days for each arm of the trial. Overall we judged the included studies to be at high risk of bias because the methods of randomisation and allocation concealment were poorly reported. The primary outcomes for this review were participant-reported pain and pain relief.</P>
<P>Fifteen studies compared oral morphine modified release (Mm/r) preparations with morphine immediate release (MIR). Fourteen studies compared Mm/r in different strengths; six of these included 24-hour modified release products. Fifteen studies compared Mm/r with other opioids. Six studies compared MIR with other opioids. Two studies compared oral Mm/r with rectal Mm/r. Three studies compared MIR with MIR by a different route of administration. Two studies compared Mm/r with Mm/r at different times and two compared MIR with MIR given at a different time. One study was found comparing each of the following: Mm/r tablet with Mm/r suspension; Mm/r with non-opioids; MIR with non-opioids; and oral morphine with epidural morphine.</P>
<P>In the previous update, a standard of 'no worse than mild pain' was set, equivalent to a score of 30/100 mm or less on a visual analogue pain intensity scale (VAS), or the equivalent in other pain scales. Eighteen studies achieved this level of pain relief on average, and no study reported that good levels of pain relief were not attained. Where results were reported for individual participants in 17 studies, 'no worse than mild pain' was achieved by 96% of participants (362/377), and an outcome equivalent to treatment success in 63% (400/638).</P>
<P>Morphine is an effective analgesic for cancer pain. Pain relief did not differ between Mm/r and MIR. Modified release versions of morphine were effective for 12- or 24-hour dosing depending on the formulation. Daily doses in studies ranged from 25 mg to 2000 mg with an average of between 100 mg and 250 mg. Dose titration was undertaken with both instant release and modified release products. A small number of participants did not achieve adequate analgesia with morphine. Adverse events were common, predictable, and approximately 6% of participants discontinued treatment with morphine because of intolerable adverse events. </P>
<P>The quality of the evidence is generally poor. Studies are old, often small, and were largely carried out for registration purposes and therefore were only designed to show equivalence between different formulations.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-01-07 10:02:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anna Erskine">
<P>The conclusions have not changed for this update. The effectiveness of oral morphine has stood the test of time, but the randomised trial literature for morphine is small given the importance of this medicine. Most trials recruited fewer than 100 participants and did not provide appropriate data for meta-analysis. Only a few reported how many people had good pain relief, but where it was reported, over 90% had no worse than mild pain within a reasonably short time period. The review demonstrates the wide dose range of morphine used in studies, and that a small percentage of participants are unable to tolerate oral morphine. The review also shows the wide range of study designs, and inconsistency in cross-over designs. Trial design was frequently based on titration of morphine or comparator to achieve adequate analgesia, then crossing participants over in cross-over design studies. It was not clear if these trials were sufficiently powered to detect any clinical differences between formulations or comparator drugs. New studies added to the review for the previous update reinforced the view that it is possible to use modified release morphine to titrate to analgesic effect. There is qualitative evidence that oral morphine has much the same efficacy as other available opioids.</P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2016-02-16 10:22:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anna Erskine">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-02-16 10:22:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anna Erskine">
<P>This review is the third update of a previously published review in <I>The Cochrane Library </I>(Issue 4, 2013) and first updated in 2007, evaluating the analgesic effects of oral morphine for cancer pain.</P>
<P>Trials of morphine have been equivalence studies, which have attempted to show either that one form of release system is as effective as another, or compared a newer opioid with morphine. However, this literature presents a number of methodological challenges as trials may not be sufficiently powered to detect differences in efficacy or to show equivalence. Two systematic reviews of morphine pharmacokinetics have been published (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Faura-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faura 1998</LINK>). No differences in either efficacy or adverse events between morphine modified release (Mm/r) or morphine immediate release (MIR) were discerned in a systematic review using narrow inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Goudas-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goudas 2001</LINK>). The present review will bring together the randomised controlled trial (RCT) literature for oral morphine.</P>
<P>The term 'modified release' replaces the term 'sustained release' used in the first version of this review.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-02-11 12:50:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cancer pain is perhaps one of the most feared symptoms associated with the disease. Pain may be the first symptom that causes someone to seek medical advice that leads to a diagnosis of cancer and some 30% to 50% of all sufferers will experience moderate to severe pain (<LINK REF="REF-Portenoy-1999b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Portenoy 1999b</LINK>). Pain can occur at any time as the disease progresses but the frequency and intensity of pain tends to increase as the cancer advances (<LINK REF="REF-Portenoy-1999b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Portenoy 1999b</LINK>). For those with advanced cancer some 75% to 90% will experience pain that has a major impact on daily living.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-02-16 10:22:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anna Erskine">
<P>Morphine in one form or another has been available for centuries, and appeared in Pliny's <I>Historia Naturalis</I> (AD 77) as opium, the resin derived from poppy sap. Morphine was extracted from opium in 1803 and named as such by Sertürner, a German pharmacist from Einbeck, in 1817 (<LINK REF="REF-Rey-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rey 1993</LINK>). Oral morphine was first recommended in England in the 1950s for the treatment of cancer pain. This was often in the form of the so-called 'Brompton cocktail' containing cocaine and alcohol in addition to morphine or diamorphine. Treatment moved towards oral morphine alone as morphine demonstrated effective pain relief without the side effects linked to the 'cocktail'.</P>
<P>Following the publication of World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines in the mid-1980s, the oral administration of aqueous morphine solution every four hours by the clock became commonplace for moderate to severe cancer pain (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1986</LINK>). Morphine in a modified release tablet was first marketed around the same time, allowing the dosage interval to be extended to 12 hours.</P>
<P>Morphine, usually as the sulphate or hydrochloride salt, is available in four oral formulations: an elixir or solution of morphine in various concentrations; an immediate release tablet; a number of different preparations of modified release tablets or capsules; and modified release suspensions. Modified release tablets are available in both 12-hour and 24-hour release patterns and should be swallowed whole. Modified release capsules contain small coated beads and can be sprinkled over food, etc, if necessary. This review considered all RCTs for all forms of oral morphine for cancer-related pain, defined as "pain of unspecified origin in any patient with cancer or a history of cancer". This review uses the convention as used by the British National Formulary, which uses the abbreviation m/r to describe modified release.</P>
<P>The wide range of formulations and dosages (10 mg to 150 mg) allows great flexibility in the management of severe pain (<LINK REF="REF-Grahame_x002d_Smith-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grahame-Smith 2002</LINK>). Potent opioid analgesics are particularly indicated for the relief of pain in malignant disease and often have the additional very useful actions of relieving anxiety, producing drowsiness, and allowing sleep (<LINK REF="REF-Grahame_x002d_Smith-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grahame-Smith 2002</LINK>). However, all opioid analgesics have the potential to produce adverse events: respiratory depression, nausea and vomiting, constipation, and itching. During chronic opioid therapy, larger doses may be required to sustain the analgesic effect (tolerance) and people can be at risk of opioid withdrawal syndrome upon sudden cessation of the opioid or administration of an antagonist (physiological dependence).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-02-16 10:22:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anna Erskine">
<P>Morphine is known to bind to opioid receptors to produce pain relief (<LINK REF="REF-Mandal-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mandal 2015</LINK>). Three different receptors have been identified.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Mu receptors (subdivided into &#956;1, &#956;2, and &#956;3). These are found in the brainstem and the thalamus. Activation can result in pain relief, sedation, and euphoria, and can also lead to respiratory depression, constipation, and physical dependence.</LI>
<LI>Kappa receptor. This is found in the limbic system, the brain stem, and spinal cord. Activation can result in pain relief, sedation, loss of breath, and dependence.</LI>
<LI>Delta receptor. This is found in the brain, spinal cord, and digestive tract. Activation can result in analgesic as well as antidepressant effects. It can also lead to respiratory depression.</LI>
</UL>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-02-16 10:22:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anna Erskine">
<P>Morphine has long been considered the preferred choice of opioid. It is widely, though still not universally, available across the world, is comparatively cheap, and is effective orally. It is listed in the WHO essential medicines list (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2011</LINK>). The review is important to determine the effectiveness of morphine compared to other interventions used in cancer pain.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2016-02-11 12:52:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For the previous update we continued to assess quality using the Oxford Quality Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996b</LINK>), which allocates points for randomisation, blinding, and the recording of study withdrawals. The maximum possible score (indicating a trial of high methodological quality) is five. We also used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We used the following standard parameters.</P>
<P>We completed a 'Risk of bias' table for each included study, using methods adapted from those described by the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group. Two authors independently assessed risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>), with any disagreements resolved by discussion. We assessed the following for each study:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Random sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias). We assessed the method used to generate the allocation sequence as: low risk of bias (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator); high risk of bias (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number) - we excluded these studies; unclear risk of bias: the trial may or may not be free of bias.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias). We assessed the method used to conceal allocation to interventions prior to assignment to establish whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during, recruitment or changed after assignment. The methods were assessed as: low risk of bias (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed, opaque, envelopes); high risk of bias (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes; alternation; date of birth) - these studies would be excluded; unclear risk of bias - the trial may or may not be free of bias.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Blinding of outcome assessment (checking for possible detection bias). We assessed the methods used to blind study participants and outcome assessors from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We considered studies to be at low risk of bias if they stated that they were blinded and described the method used to achieve blinding (e.g. identical tablets, matched in appearance and smell); or at unknown risk if they stated that they were blinded, but did not provide an adequate description of how it was achieved.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Size (checking for possible biases confounded by small size). Small studies have been shown to overestimate treatment effects, probably due to methodological weaknesses (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-N_x00fc_esch-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nüesch 2010</LINK>). We considered studies to be at low risk of bias if they had 200 or more participants, at unclear risk of they had between 50 and 200 participants, and at high risk if they had fewer than 50 participants.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Selective outcome reporting. We considered studies to be at low risk of bias if all outcomes were pre-defined (for example, in a published protocol) and reported, or all clinically relevant and reasonably expected outcomes were reported; at uncertain risk of bias if it is unclear whether all pre-defined and clinically relevant and reasonably expected outcomes were reported; and at high risk of bias if one or more clinically relevant and reasonably expected outcomes were not reported, and data on these outcomes were likely to have been recorded.</LI>

<P>We planned to calculate NNTs as the reciprocal of the absolute risk reduction (ARR)..

<P>The 62 studies that met the inclusion criteria contained 4241 enrolled participants. Trial size varied from 11 to 699 participants. Three studies used a single dose and the remainder were multi-dose studies, ranging in time from three days to six weeks. The majority compared morphine modified release (Mm/r) with morphine immediate release (MIR), either as tablets or solution. Many of these were cross-over studies over a variety of time periods, listed in Summary table B. Other comparators were noted and described, such as different opioids or morphine by different routes. The range of daily morphine doses across the studies, where reported in sufficient detail to allow calculation, was 15 mg to 2000 mg. The majority of the studies were designed to show equivalence between two morphine products. It was not generally clear if they were sufficiently powered to detect a clinically meaningful difference.</P>
<P>For the first version of the review, responses were received from four pharmaceutical companies and yielded six studies (all published) not retrieved by the electronic search strategy. Attempts to contact researchers listed in <A HREF="http://www.controlledtrials.com">www.controlledtrials.com</A> proved fruitless, and we identified no unpublished studies.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Morphine modified release (Mm/r) compared to morphine immediate release (MIR)</HEADING>
<P>This comparison is arguably the most important as it seeks to establish the efficacy of morphine modified release products, currently the mainstay of pain relief in cancer care. In spite of this importance the literature is small, with 15 studies consisting of 500 participants in total. None of the trials were large, having a median size of 27 participants (range 16 to 73). Eleven of the trials were of cross-over design. The results of these trials show that Mm/r and MIR are equivalent for pain relief. No new studies were found for this comparison in this update, or the previous update (2013).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(a) Studies not utilising a cross-over design</HEADING>
<P>Four studies were parallel design. <LINK REF="STD-Ventafridda-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Ventafridda 1989</LINK> conducted the largest of the trials. Seventy participants who were opioid-naive received either morphine solution or Mm/r. All participants received both oral diclofenac 225 mg and oral haloperidol 20 mg daily. The study duration was 14 days. Using an integrated pain score, greater pain relief was achieved by Mm/r with fewer side effects. This occurred despite the use of a higher mean daily dose of MIR (120 mg) compared to Mm/r (90 mg). <LINK REF="STD-Hoskin-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Hoskin 1989</LINK> randomised 19 participants who were stable on MIR to receive Mm/r with or without an additional dose of MIR. There was no difference in pain scores between those who received the additional dose and those receiving placebo, demonstrating that a loading dose may not be necessary when commencing Mm/r. <LINK REF="STD-Kossman-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Kossman 1983</LINK> compared Mm/r with a morphine cocktail (content and strength not stated) in 20 participants. The study included a pharmacokinetic component but no doses were recorded. <LINK REF="STD-Klepstad-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Klepstad 2003</LINK> compared Mm/r 24-hour release with MIR in 40 participants. Acceptable pain relief was achieved in 2.1 days (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.4 to 2.7) for MIR and 1.7 days (95% CI 1.1 to 2.3) in the Mm/r group; 10/13 in the MIR group and 13/17 in the Mm/r group were satisfied or very satisfied with pain relief.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(b) Cross-over studies</HEADING>
<P>The cross-over studies showed a wide variation in treatment periods, as with the rest of this literature. None of the studies addressed the issue of carry-over of analgesic effect for those who received the Mm/r product. In a study by <LINK REF="STD-Cundiff-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Cundiff 1989</LINK> it was difficult to determine exactly when cross-over occurred; however, as pain was assessed by a nurse and not by the participant the results of this trial are not considered here.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Walsh-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 1992</LINK> took participants who were stable on morphine or on other opioids, which were then converted to morphine. The mean daily dose at trial entry was 109 mg per day. Participants were randomised either to Mm/r or MIR using a double-dummy technique. Cross-over occurred at two days. There was no significant difference detected in mean daily morphine dose, visual analogue score (VAS) pain data, breakthrough pain, or use of rescue analgesia. Equally, scores for adverse events, including nausea, confusion, constipation, and anxiety, were similar. A preference for Mm/r was stated by 22 of the 33 people who entered the study. Only 27 participants were evaluated.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Hanks-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Hanks 1987a</LINK> conducted a similar study although one-third of the 27 participants dropped out early. Both intervention groups experienced adequate pain control but those on Mm/r experienced better quality sleep at night. Another study by <LINK REF="STD-Walsh-1985a" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 1985a</LINK> used cross-overs at day three and again at days five and eight. This study also reported no differences in either pain relief or side effects. The authors stated that they did not detect any carry-over effects. No difference was detected between treatments during five-day cross-overs by <LINK REF="STD-Finn-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Finn 1993</LINK> or by <LINK REF="STD-Thirlwell-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Thirlwell 1989</LINK>. A French study by <LINK REF="STD-Gillette-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gillette 1997</LINK> compared Mm/r as M-Eslon® with MIR solution in opioid-naive participants in a double-dummy study with a pharmacokinetic component. The participants were crossed over at six days. Pain relief was similar in both groups and the kinetic parameters were comparable. Three studies used a seven-day cross-over design. <LINK REF="STD-Knudsen-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Knudsen 1985</LINK>, in a Danish language paper, stated that the design was "consecutively randomised" but there was no explanation of what this meant. The English abstract stated that the study was a randomised, double-blind study and it has been included in the review on that basis. The authors reported no difference in pain relief or adverse events. Similar findings were recorded by <LINK REF="STD-Deschamps-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Deschamps 1992</LINK> and also by <LINK REF="STD-Panich-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Panich 1993</LINK>. In this latter study, over 70% of the participants expressed a preference for morphine solution (MIR). As 60% of them had either neck or face cancers this may have influenced the response in favour of an easy to swallow product.</P>
<P>While 29 people entered the study by <LINK REF="STD-Arkinstall-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Arkinstall 1989</LINK>, only 17 completed it. Again, participants were as well controlled on Mm/r twice a day as on MIR six times a day, with no reported difference in adverse events. A small number of people with non-cancer pain were included in this sample.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Morphine modified release (Mm/r) comparisons - different strengths, formulations, and/or dose intervals</HEADING>
<P>Fifteen studies (1084 participants) compared Mm/r at different strengths or release profiles. Three new studies (112 participants) were added at the previous update.</P>
<P>These studies can be subdivided as follows:</P>

<P>(b) studies of 24-hour release.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(a) Six studies (277 participants) examined different dose strengths or interval combinations of 12-hour release Mm/r</HEADING>
<P>Using a double-blind design, <LINK REF="STD-Mignault-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Mignault 1995</LINK>, in a Canadian study, showed that 12-hourly dosage was as effective as eight-hourly administration. This was a small study of 19 participants; there were no differences in adverse events and the majority of participants felt that the 12-hour regimen had advantages in terms of convenience. The assessment of high-dose tablets of Mm/r was covered by three studies. <LINK REF="STD-Portenoy-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Portenoy 1989</LINK> compared three tablets of Mm/r 30 mg (MS Contin) with one tablet of 100 mg Mm/r. Participants were stabilised on MIR over a one- or two-day period then randomised to either Mm/r 100 mg or Mm/r 90 mg (3 x 30 mg) every 12 hours. Comparison of the pain intensity and rescue analgesic consumption (MIR) showed no significant differences. The reported side effect profiles were also similar. Two studies compared Mm/r 100 mg with Mm/r 200 mg (MS Contin). <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1991</LINK> studied 20 participants who received either dose for three or four days. Doses ranged from 400 mg to 1800 mg per day. Pain assessment and pharmacokinetic monitoring confirmed similar analgesic efficacy and plasma profiles. In another three-day cross-over study consisting of the same formulations, <LINK REF="STD-Hanks-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Hanks 1995</LINK> also showed comparable efficacy in a study of 25 participants. People in this study used doses of 400 mg to 2000 mg per day. A comparative study of two different Mm/r products was undertaken in 45 participants by <LINK REF="STD-Homsi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Homsi 2010</LINK>. This was an open-label study with no cross-over, based on mean pain scores and standard error of the means (SEM); the authors claim that one product was more effective on days three to five of a five-day study. Only the results of day three were statistically significant. The authors claim that this has clinical significance. It should be noted that the sponsors of the study produce the 'more effective' product.</P>
<P>A different brand of modified release capsule was used in a Chinese study by <LINK REF="STD-Xu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 1997</LINK>. M-Eslon® was compared to MS Contin® in 120 participants. Both were designed for 12-hourly dose intervals. The study was conducted at two dose levels: 20 mg every 12 hours and 30 mg every 12 hours. No titration was permitted. Using a range of analgesic assessments there was no significant difference between the two products and adverse events were also similar.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(b) Studies of 24-hour release</HEADING>
<P>Nine studies were found (807 participants) of once-daily morphine tablet or capsule (marketed under a number of trade names including Adprem®, Kadian®, Kapanol®, Morcap® or MXL® capsules).</P>
<P>MXL capsules were shown to be comparable to an equivalent dose of MS Contin in a study of 85 participants by <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Brien-1997" TYPE="STUDY">O'Brien 1997</LINK>. The comparators were MXL 60 mg versus Mm/r 30 mg twice a day. The dose could be multiplied for participants requiring higher doses. While the majority of participants needed 60 mg a day, doses up to 300 mg per day were used. There were no significant differences in pain relief between participants. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Fl_x00f6_ter-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Flöter 1997</LINK> included people with cancer and non-cancer pain such as post-trauma and neuropathic pains. The authors claimed a significant difference in favour of the once-daily product for pain intensity (VAS) when measured immediately prior to the evening dose. Data were not available for a separate analysis of the participants with cancer pain. <LINK REF="STD-Broomhead-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Broomhead 1997a</LINK> conducted a study of 150 people with cancer pain in two separate phases. Phase one contained a placebo arm to demonstrate that the study could differentiate between active treatment and placebo. Rescue medication was available in the form of MIR. Phase two consisted of three arms: Kapanol every 24 hours, Kapanol every 12 hours, and Mm/r every 12 hours. There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of rescue medication requirement. Participants' global assessments of 'good' or 'very good' pain control was 89% for the Kapanol 24-hour group, 76% in the Kapanol 12-hour group, and 68% in the Mm/r group. Adverse events were similar between groups and there was no increase in adverse events associated with the larger unit dose of the once-daily product. <LINK REF="STD-Gourlay-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gourlay 1997</LINK> showed that there were no significant differences between Kapanol once a day and Mm/r twice a day for either analgesic effect or adverse events. The pharmacokinetic profile was much flatter for Kapanol 24-hour, reflecting the designed release profile.</P>
<P>Twenty-nine participants were enrolled in a study comparing MS Contin XL with MS Contin (<LINK REF="STD-Hagen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hagen 2005</LINK>). All participants experienced good pain relief though it was observed that pain scores were more stable through the day on the once daily formulation. One hundred and thirty-four participants were titrated to relief of cancer pain with MIR then randomised to either Mm/r 24-hour (Kadian) or Mm/r 12-hour (MC Contin) formulations (<LINK REF="STD-Kerr-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kerr 2000</LINK>). Only 104 participants entered the efficacy trial, which was a cross-over design. No dose adjustments were allowed but rescue MIR was provided; 57/104 preferred Kadian, 34/104 MS Contin, and 13/104 expressed no preference. One hundred and fifty-three participants entered a study by <LINK REF="STD-Vielvoye_x002d_Kerkmeer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Vielvoye-Kerkmeer 2002</LINK> but only 110 were enrolled after a 14-day run-in period. It was not stated why the 43 participants dropped out. No significant differences were detected between groups in terms of pain intensity, rescue analgesia, or sleep quality. A study of 38 participants compared a new once daily matrix Mm/r with twice daily Mm/r (<LINK REF="STD-Ridgway-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ridgway 2010</LINK>). The study demonstrated therapeutic equivalence and no difference for incidence of breakthrough pain or pain intensity measured for morning and evening.</P>
<P>In a study about timing of the dosing of a 24-hour Mm/r in 45 participants, <LINK REF="STD-Currow-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Currow 2007</LINK> showed that there was no difference in pain control or pain during the day for either morning or evening administration.</P>

All reported adequate analgesia with both agents when doses were titrated. One study reported the relative potency of oxycodone to morphine as 1:1.5 (<LINK REF="STD-Mucci-LoRusso-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mucci LoRusso 1998</LINK>). Another reported a similar relative potency of oxycodone to morphine as 1:1.6 (<LINK REF="STD-Lauretti-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lauretti 2003</LINK>). There do seem to be some minor differences in side effect profiles, for example, no participants experienced hallucinations on oxycodone.</P>
<P>A separate Cochrane review assessing the effectiveness of oxycodone for cancer pain relief has been published (<LINK REF="REF-Schmidt_x002d_Hansen-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmidt-Hansen 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>A study by <LINK REF="STD-Ferrell-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Ferrell 1989</LINK> presented a number of problems. Participants who were already receiving short-acting analgesics (oxycodone, hydromorphone, codeine, or morphine) were randomised either to a 'no change' group or changed to Mm/r. However, no data were presented on the numbers of participants receiving each opioid. There appeared to be an assumption that the short-acting opioids were equally effective. The authors reported that pain intensity was reduced in the Mm/r group.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(b) Mm/r versus hydromorphone</HEADING>
<P>Two studies (300 participants) compared hydromorphone modified release and Mm/r (<LINK REF="STD-Hanna-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hanna 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moriarty-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Moriarty 1999</LINK>). Two hundred participants were recruited to a multi-national multicentre study by Hanna and colleagues. Using a double-dummy design, participants were randomised either to twice daily Mm/r or once daily hydromorphone OROS formulation with a placebo tablet in the evening. The authors claimed a small but statistically significant benefit for hydromorphone. In another randomised cross-over study of two three-day treatment periods (<LINK REF="STD-Moriarty-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Moriarty 1999</LINK>), the primary outcome was the use of rescue medication. Both treatments controlled pain satisfactorily and there was no difference between the number of occasions that rescue medication was used during the last 24 hours of each treatment period. Of a subgroup that expressed a preference, only five out 38 participants preferred hydromorphone; 13 preferred morphine and the remainder had no preference. Hydromorphone is also the subject of a separate Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Quigley-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quigley 2007</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(c) Mm/r versus transdermal fentanyl</HEADING>
<P>Transdermal (TD) fentanyl has gained in popularity over recent years; we found five studies (538 participants) comparing this agent with oral morphine (<LINK REF="STD-Ahmedzai-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ahmedzai 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mercadante-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mercadante 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ozt_x00fc_rk-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Oztürk 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Seventer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Van Seventer 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wong-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 1997</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Ahmedzai-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ahmedzai 1997</LINK> compared 202 participants in a cross-over study (not double-blind) comparing Mm/r with transdermal fentanyl patches. They found a significant carry-over effect so only the first phase of this trial has been analysed. Pain control was assessed by a variety of measures but no significant differences were found between Mm/r and fentanyl patches. More participants required rescue medication in the fentanyl group and the fentanyl dose more often needed to be titrated upwards. Fentanyl appeared to be less sedating than morphine both during the day and at night. Participants on fentanyl were significantly less constipated. Of 136 participants who expressed a preference, 14 had no preference, 73 preferred fentanyl, and 49 preferred morphine. In <LINK REF="STD-Mercadante-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mercadante 2008</LINK>, 108 participants were randomised to receive either Mm/r or fentanyl TD or methadone in an open study. All three were found to be effective and well tolerated. A Turkish study compared Mm/r with fentanyl TD in 50 participants. Again both analgesics were found to be safe and effective but with significantly less constipation experienced in the fentanyl group (<LINK REF="STD-Ozt_x00fc_rk-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Oztürk 2008</LINK>). In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Van-Seventer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Van Seventer 2003</LINK>, 131 participants received either transdermal fentanyl or Mm/r. After dose titration both groups reported good pain relief. Participants reported less troublesome adverse events on fentanyl with a slightly lower incidence in the use of laxatives: 51/67 used laxatives on fentanyl and 47/64 on morphine. Both groups used MIR for breakthrough pain. A study by <LINK REF="STD-Wong-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 1997</LINK> was also randomised and open without cross-over. Participants were converted to MIR for seven days prior to randomisation then assigned either to Mm/r or fentanyl patches. In this smaller study (20 participants per group) both groups reported good pain relief and adverse events were similar. The authors reported problems in using the manufacturer's guidance in converting the dose of morphine into an equivalent fentanyl dose. Transdermal fentanyl is the subject of a separate Cochrane review in preparation (<LINK REF="REF-Hadley-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hadley 2013</LINK>).</P>

Few data were presented so clear conclusions could not be drawn. Pain relief was achieved at lower doses on dextropropoxyphene, possibly with fewer side effects, in this small study of 16 people per group.

The study compared elixirs containing diamorphine and cocaine with a morphine and cocaine elixir. 'Brompton Cocktail' was a generic term for mixtures and elixirs containing diamorphine or morphine and cocaine with or without chlorpromazine. These are now obsolete and should not be used (<LINK REF="REF-Parfitt-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parfitt 1999</LINK>). This study is of historical interest because of the large number of participants. The study did not detect any difference between the groups when the medicines were given in equi-analgesic doses. <LINK REF="STD-Melzack-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Melzack 1979</LINK> compared morphine solution and a Brompton mixture containing a variable amount of morphine, 10 mg of cocaine, and 2.5 ml of 98% ethyl alcohol, in 44 participants. Thirty completed both phases of this cross-over study. There was no significant difference in pain scores or adverse events but it was noted that approximately 15% of participants did not obtain adequate pain relief.

<P>Sixty-six participants were entered into a study of oral morphine versus methadone, in Italy by <LINK REF="STD-Ventafridda-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Ventafridda 1986</LINK>. Only those participants (N = 54) who completed the first 14 days titration were evaluated. All participants received 150 mg diclofenac and haloperidol 20 mg daily by injection. Morphine was given in a dose of 4 mg to 24 mg every four hours and methadone in a dose of 8 mg to 28 mg every six hours for the first three days then every eight hours. Pain control was demonstrated with both treatments. More participants on morphine complained of dry mouth whereas more on methadone complained of headache.

Participants were titrated by patient controlled analgesia (PCA) until free of pain then randomised to use either morphine or oxycodone.

Oxycodone was provided at a concentration of 2.7 mg/ml and morphine at 4 mg/ml to reflect relative potencies. Participants could ask for the dose to be increased if not pain-free, or for it to be reduced if sedated at the end of each four-hour period. Participants were crossed over after 96 hours. The mean oral morphine consumption was 168 mg in group one and 228 mg in group two. The most frequent side effect with both treatments was sedation. Oral morphine caused significantly more nausea. Hallucinations occurred only with morphine. Five participants preferred morphine, five preferred oxycodone, and 10 had no preference.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">5. Morphine modified release (Mm/r) administered rectally</HEADING>
<P>Three studies (83 participants) compared Mm/r tablets with rectal morphine modified release. In one trial this was undertaken using Mm/r tablets administered rectally (<LINK REF="STD-Wilkinson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Wilkinson 1992</LINK>), in another controlled release suppositories were used (<LINK REF="STD-Babul-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Babul 1998</LINK>).

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Wilkinson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Wilkinson 1992</LINK> conducted a small study of 10 participants who were stabilised on morphine and then randomised to receive Mm/r tablets either orally or rectally in a pharmacokinetic and efficacy study which was open and of cross-over design. No significant difference was found in the 'area under the curve' (i.e. that is they had similar pharmacokinetic profiles) for parenteral morphine but fewer metabolites were measured in the rectal group. No significant difference was found between the two routes in terms of pain relief. Participants expressed a preference for the oral route.</P>
<P>Twenty-seven participants were selected for a randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, two-way cross-over study of Mm/r tablets and a commercially available Mm/r suppository (<LINK REF="STD-Babul-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Babul 1998</LINK>). Participants stabilised on morphine were given Mm/r suppositories at the same dose as their oral requirement. Breakthrough pain was treated with approximately 10% of the daily morphine dose given orally as morphine immediate release. No other opioids or rescue medications were allowed but participants were allowed to continue on prior medication, which could include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antidepressants, anticonvulsants, or bisphosphonates. Twenty-two participants completed the study. There were no significant differences between pain scores or rescue medication requirements. There was a small but significant difference between nausea scores in favour of the rectal route. No difference was detected for other adverse events.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Mizuguchi-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Mizuguchi 1990</LINK> (published in Japanese) compared Mm/r as three 10 mg MS Contin tablets with three 20 mg morphine suppositories, each given twice daily for three days in a cross-over study of 46 participants.

<P>In a small study by <LINK REF="STD-Dellemijn-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Dellemijn 1994</LINK> 20 participants with malignant nerve pain were randomised to receive either naproxen 500 mg three times a day or Mm/r 30 mg twice a day with cross-over at seven days for each arm. Doses were fixed, not titrated, and rescue paracetamol up to 4 g per day was allowed. Pain was assessed on a 101-point numerical rating scale. Data from four participants were considered not evaluable so reported differences were based on only 16 participants. The authors stated that there was greater use of paracetamol as rescue medication in the morphine arms of the trial.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">8. Morphine instant release (MIR) compared to non-opioids</HEADING>
<P>A parallel, double-blind study of 121 participants conducted in Spain compared two doses of dipyrone (1 g three times a day or 2 g three times a day) with oral morphine solution at a dose of 10 mg every four hours (<LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez 1994</LINK>). Dipyrone is not available in many countries but is widely used in Spain and South America.

<P>A study by <LINK REF="STD-Vainio-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Vainio 1988</LINK> compared oral morphine (MIR or Mm/r) with two techniques for epidural morphine administration in 30 participants with tumour involvement of the brachial or lumbar nerve plexuses. Epidural morphine was administered either via a conventional tunnelled epidural catheter or an epidural catheter connected to an implanted injection port. Participants were assigned randomly to either oral morphine (MIR or Mm/r) or to one of the two epidural groups. Doses were adjusted according to patient demand, daily during the first week and weekly thereafter. The initial dose of morphine was 46 mg to 150 mg orally or 2 mg to 12 mg epidurally. Treatment was continued for as long as possible, often until the participant died. Pain relief was similarly effective in all groups but those on epidural treatment reported significantly fewer side effects. There were some technical problems in the epidural groups with three dislocated catheters in the tunnelled group and three blocked catheters in the port group. Mean length of treatment was 108 days (+/- 290) in the oral group, 43 days (+/- 13) in the tunnelled group, and 97 days (+/- 23) in the port group.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">12. Morphine instant release (MIR) given at different time points</HEADING>
<P>Two studies (46 participants) examined the effects of different time points of administration of MIR in cross-over design studies. <LINK REF="STD-Dale-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dale 2009</LINK> compared a single evening dose followed by a second dose four hours later with a double evening dose followed by a placebo four hours later. Each dose was for one night in this two-day study. The authors report that the two regimens were clinically equivalent. A similar study by <LINK REF="STD-Todd-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Todd 2002</LINK> provided an evening dose followed by a second dose after four hours and another dose after eight hours. This was compared with a double evening dose followed by a regular dose after eight hours. The study was two days for each phase. The authors claim that more participants on double-dose morphine required breakthrough analgesia than those on four-hourly dosing. The likelihood is that neither of these studies are long enough or large enough to provide a reliable answer.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">No worse than mild pain</HEADING>
<P>For the previous update we examined reports to ascertain whether a pain intensity of 'no worse than mild pain' was achieved based on a visual analogue scale of pain intensity (VASPI) of 30/100 mm or less on a pain intensity VAS, or the equivalent in other pain scales. Eighteen studies reported that average pain scores on morphine were below 30/100 mm, indicating that most treated participants had no worse than mild pain (<LINK REF="STD-Arkinstall-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Arkinstall 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Babul-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Babul 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Broomhead-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Broomhead 1997a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bruera-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bruera 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Finn-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Finn 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heiskanen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Heiskanen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Homsi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Homsi 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoskin-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Hoskin 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Knudsen-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Knudsen 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Melzack-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Melzack 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mercadante-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mercadante 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mercadante-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mercadante 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mucci-LoRusso-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mucci LoRusso 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ridgway-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ridgway 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ventafridda-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Ventafridda 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ventafridda-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Ventafridda 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vielvoye_x002d_Kerkmeer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Vielvoye-Kerkmeer 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walsh-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 1992</LINK>).

<P>Eighteen studies recorded the proportion of participants achieving either no worse than mild pain (<LINK REF="STD-Dale-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dale 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dellemijn-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Dellemijn 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Deschamps-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Deschamps 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gillette-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gillette 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gourlay-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gourlay 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hanks-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Hanks 1987a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kossman-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Kossman 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moriarty-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Moriarty 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Brien-1997" TYPE="STUDY">O'Brien 1997</LINK>), or some global outcome indicating satisfaction or success (<LINK REF="STD-Ahmedzai-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ahmedzai 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Broomhead-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Broomhead 1997a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bruera-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bruera 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Currow-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Currow 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hanna-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hanna 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klepstad-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Klepstad 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mignault-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Mignault 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>The outcome of 'no worse than mild pain' was achieved by 96% of participants (362/377), with consistently high levels of response (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Effectiveness of morphine and dose</HEADING>
<P>The effectiveness of morphine is demonstrated by the literature with titration to effect being common. The more important question concerns dose. The range of doses used in the reported studies was wide, varying from 25 mg/day (<LINK REF="STD-Melzack-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Melzack 1979</LINK>), to 300 mg/day (<LINK REF="STD-Gillette-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gillette 1997</LINK>) for opioid-naive participants. The maximum dose recorded was 2000 mg/day (<LINK REF="STD-Hanks-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Hanks 1995</LINK>). Mean daily doses presented by a number of investigators were from 100 mg/day to 250 mg/day.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Study withdrawals</HEADING>
<P>Withdrawals were common in these studies due to the frail nature of the participants. In spite of this, not every study reported the number of participants and reasons for withdrawals and dropouts. In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Twycross-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Twycross 1977</LINK>, 699 participants were enrolled but only 146 were able to cross over to the second phase of the study after two weeks.</P>
<P>In many cases withdrawal was due to disease progression. Rates for withdrawal due to adverse events are reported below.</P>
<P>Nine studies reported withdrawals due to a lack of analgesic efficacy; all studies titrated participants to satisfactory pain relief and provided rescue medication. A total of 41 out of 544 participants (7%) withdrew. In one study this was linked to unstable pain control after the titration phase (<LINK REF="STD-Kalso-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Kalso 1990</LINK>). Other reasons for withdrawal included death during the study and protocol violations.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Withdrawal due to adverse events</HEADING>
<P>Twenty-six studies reported on participants withdrawing due to adverse events. In two studies, it was not possible to determine how many withdrew while on fentanyl and how many withdrew on morphine (<LINK REF="STD-Ahmedzai-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ahmedzai 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wong-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 1997</LINK>). In the remaining 24 studies, 154 participants out of a total of 2162 participants dropped out. This gives a dropout rate of 7% of participants who suffered adverse events of morphine of sufficient intensity that they could not continue treatment. While every effort has been made to identify all participants in each study, these estimates will be affected by any failures to report this information in the included studies.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2016-02-16 10:22:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anna Erskine">
<P>This is the third update of the original Cochrane review first published in 2003. We identified no new studies for inclusion in this update, and the conclusions remain unchanged.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-02-16 10:22:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anna Erskine">
<P>This review has 62 included studies with 4241 participants. The main results of this review are that oral morphine works well in cancer pain, providing over 90% of participants with no worse than mild pain where this was reported. Over 60% of participants using oral morphine registered outcomes like measures of satisfaction. Oral morphine for routine use at the correct dose for an individual is as effective as other opioids.</P>
<P>This review might not change practice but it provides support for current practice. In particular, new studies included in the previous update confirmed that there is no significant difference in pain relief whether 24-hour morphine modified release (Mm/r) preparations are administered in the morning or evening (<LINK REF="STD-Currow-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Currow 2007</LINK>), nor whether 12-hourly or 24-hourly Mm/r preparations are used (<LINK REF="STD-Ridgway-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ridgway 2010</LINK>). The often-asked clinical question of whether or not a double dose at bedtime improves pain relief remains unanswered. In two new studies included in this review, there was no significant difference in achievement of no worse than mild pain, participant preference (<LINK REF="STD-Dale-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dale 2009</LINK>), or use of breakthrough analgesia (<LINK REF="STD-Todd-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Todd 2002</LINK>), whether the participant had a single or double dose of morphine immediate release (MIR) at bedtime. However, both studies are probably too small to justify a change in practice in either direction. The 2007 update of this review indicated that titrating to analgesic effect with Mm/r was as effective as with MIR, and that there was no difference in achieving no worse than mild pain when Mm/r tablets are compared to Mm/r administered rectally or Mm/r oral suspension. Pain relief was also equally effective with oral morphine or epidural morphine: the latter caused fewer side effects but was associated with more technical problems. Based on the findings of this review, patient preference and other practical factors should continue to guide local practice.</P>
<P>There is also no conclusive evidence that other strong opioids are superior in efficacy to morphine. The new studies included in this review showed that there was no difference in pain intensity whether participants received Mm/r or fentanyl or methadone (<LINK REF="STD-Mercadante-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mercadante 2008</LINK>), or oxycodone (<LINK REF="STD-Mercadante-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mercadante 2010</LINK>). The Cochrane review by <LINK REF="REF-Quigley-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quigley 2007</LINK> concluded that there was little difference between hydromorphone and morphine in terms of analgesic efficacy, adverse effect profile, and patient preference, but one of the new studies included in this review showed a small but statistically significant difference in benefit of hydromorphone over Mm/r (<LINK REF="STD-Hanna-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hanna 2008</LINK>). Fentanyl and oxycodone are both subjects of other Cochrane reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Hadley-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hadley 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schmidt_x002d_Hansen-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmidt-Hansen 2015</LINK>).</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-02-16 10:22:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anna Erskine">
<P>Most of the studies compared different formulations of oral morphine, or oral morphine with other oral opioids, or occasionally oral morphine with opioids using different routes of administration. There was no corpus of evidence for any particular comparison. The evidence would still have been useful if one of the outcomes reported consistently was that of participants obtaining good levels of pain relief, ideally no worse than mild pain, a patient-reported outcome of acknowledged benefit (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2013a</LINK>). Only nine of the 62 included studies reported this, although seven reported other outcomes of value from the patient perspective.</P>
<P>Most reported pain intensity as a mean, often with considerable variability around the mean. It was frequently the case that mean pain intensity scores were low and below (say) 30/100 mm. While average values are of questionable value in pain studies (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2010a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2011</LINK>), average values did support the results in individuals. It was frustrating that reporting was not more appropriate and applicable to individual patients.</P>
<P>Applicability of the evidence was also hindered by a general concentration on studies attempting to discern small differences in effect or harm between formulations or opioids, or both. The concentration was on statistical rather than clinically useful outcomes.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-02-11 12:58:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">General</HEADING>
<P>The quality of reporting of trials in this area continues to be disappointing. Despite this, the review shows that even with very variable descriptions of outcomes, it is possible to discern that a high proportion of patients with cancer pain can obtain good pain relief (or low pain levels) within a sensible time after beginning titration with oral morphine.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Design</HEADING>
<P>Two methodological issues stand out. The quality of reporting of trials continues to be poor and small studies are far too common.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Measurement (endpoints)</HEADING>
<P>Trials need to consider additional endpoints of no worse than mild pain as well as the impact of morphine on symptoms that raise serious concerns such as consciousness, appetite, and thirst.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Other</HEADING>
<P>Given that most of the studies in this review were completed within the last 20 years the obvious implication for research is to instigate a morphine trialists' collaboration in order to undertake retrospective analyses of clinical trial data, using outcomes of clear patient benefit (no worse than mild pain within two weeks of starting morphine titration). Trialist collaborations have proved highly informative, with the Antiplatelet Trialists Collaboration probably the largest example of how retrospective analysis and pooling of clinical trial data can lead to improvements in treatment. With oral morphine in cancer pain, the 62 studies with 4241 participants should provide useful information about outcomes, titration schedules, and formulations to be translated into better results for patients, and a cost-effective approach for healthcare providers.</P>
<P>A second goal would be to extend the collaboration to include other drug interventions, including other oral opioids, and formulations of opioids other than oral.</P>
<P>A third goal of the collaboration would be to set guidelines for future clinical trials and systematic reviews to assess pain and pain relief by means of patient-reported validated scales, and to present data that can be related to individual participants rather than aggregated or mean data.</P>

If appropriate, we will update the review before this date if new evidence likely to change the conclusions is published, or if standards change substantially which necessitate major revisions.</P>

<P>Name: Alison MacRobbie</P>
<P>Email Address: <A HREF="mailto:alison.macrobbie@nhs.net">alison.macrobbie@nhs.net</A>
</P>
<P>Affiliation: NHS Highland</P>
<P>Role: Pharmacist</P>
<P>Comment: &#8220;The term 'modified release' replaces the term 'sustained release' used in the first version of this review&#8221;.</P>
<P>This follows SPCPA guidance developed alongside the Scottish guidelines which aimed to reduce confusion, mirrors the BNF guidance etc (as for example some people abbreviating 'sustained release' to SR when others use the same SR abbreviation to mean 'standard release' although the letters SR are still contained within the names of some branded formulation).</P>
<P>The review article continues by using the abbreviations Mm/r and MIR to distinguish modified release from Immediate release formulations.</P>
<UL>
<LI>there are close similarities between the symbol ' /' and the letter 'I' and if prescribers now start to use these abbreviations in prescriptions this could lead to errors when dispensing.</LI>
<LI>there is also potential for people to start to use the terms and write as MMR (abbreviation for measles mumps and rubella vaccine) or MIR potentially causing further confusion.</LI>
</UL>
<P>This has potential patient safety implications.</P>

<P>
<I>Response prepared by the author Professor Philip Wiffen.</I>
</P>
<P>Thank you for your feedback. We made a decision to move away from sustained release as some of the newer products are described as modified release. We decided to use the BNF notification of m/r so Mm/r referred to Morphine modified release. I accept that there may be potential for confusion with MIR but most readers would see that in the context of the evidence. Having said that, we are happy to amend the review if you can recommend an internationally acceptable shorthand for Mm/r and MIR bearing in mind that Cochrane reviews are used worldwide.</P>
