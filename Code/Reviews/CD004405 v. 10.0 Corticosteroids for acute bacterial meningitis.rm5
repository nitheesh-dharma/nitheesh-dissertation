Bacterial meningitis is fatal in 5% to 40% of children and 20% to 50% of adults despite treatment with adequate antibiotics. It is caused by bacteria that usually spread from an ear or respiratory infection and is treated with antibiotics.</P><P>Corticosteroids are drugs that can reduce the inflammation caused by infection. This inflammation has been shown to aggravate damage to the nervous system in experimental meningitis studies in animals. Research on the use of corticosteroids in addition to antibiotics has had conflicting results.</P><P>We wanted to discover whether use of corticosteroids was better of worse than placebo.</P><P><B>Study characteristics </B></P><P>The evidence is current to February 2015. We identified 25 trials, including 4121 participants with acute bacterial meningitis of which seven were performed in adults (over 16 years old), two included both children and adults and the other were performed in children. In 22 studies the corticosteroid used was dexamethasone, in three others hydrocortisone or prednisone were used. Nine studies were performed in low-income countries and 16 in high-income countries.</P><P><B>Key results </B></P><P>This review found that the corticosteroid dexamethasone did not significantly reduce the death rate (17.8% versus 19.9%). Patients treated with corticosteroids had significantly lower rates of severe hearing loss (6.0% versus 9.3%), any hearing loss (13.8% versus 19.0%) and neurological sequelae (17.9% versus 21.6%).</P><P>An analysis for different bacteria causing meningitis showed that patients with meningitis due to <I>Streptococcus pneumoniae </I>(<I>S. pneumoniae</I>) treated with corticosteroids had a lower death rate (29.9% versus 36.0%), while no effect on mortality was seen in patients with <I>Haemophilus influenzae </I>(<I>H. influenzae</I>) and <I>Neisseria meningitidis </I>(<I>N. meningitidis</I>) meningitis.</P><P>In high-income countries, corticosteroids reduced severe hearing loss, any hearing loss and short-term neurological sequelae. There was no beneficial effect of corticosteroid therapy in low-income countries.</P><P>Corticosteroids decreased the rate of hearing loss in children with meningitis due to <I>H. influenzae </I>(4% versus 12%), but not in children with meningitis due to other bacteria.</P><P>Dexamethasone increased the rate of recurrent fever (28% versus 22%) but was not associated with other adverse events.</P><P><B>Quality of the evidence</B></P><P>Out of 25 studies, four were of high quality, 14 of medium quality and seven of low quality, leading to a moderate overall quality of evidence.</P></SUMMARY_BODY></SUMMARY><ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2015-09-04 23:41:21 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-04-12 13:09:06 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>In experimental studies, the outcome of bacterial meningitis has been related to the severity of inflammation in the subarachnoid space.

New randomised clinical trials were performed in the late 1980s and 1990s (<LINK REF="STD-Lebel-1988a" TYPE="STUDY">Lebel 1988a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lebel-1988b" TYPE="STUDY">Lebel 1988b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lebel-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Lebel 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Odio-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Odio 1991</LINK>), with conflicting results. Two meta-analyses of RCTs were published showing a reduction in bilateral hearing loss in dexamethasone-treated children with <I>Haemophilus influenzae </I>(<I>H. influenzae</I>) meningitis (<LINK REF="REF-Geiman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geiman 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Havens-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Havens 1989</LINK>).</P><P>In the early 1990s the epidemiology of bacterial meningitis changed due to the introduction of the <I>H. influenzae </I>type B conjugate vaccine that resulted in near elimination of this bacterium as cause of meningitis in high-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-Peltola-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peltola 2000</LINK>). New trials were performed in children with bacterial meningitis, most commonly caused by <I>Streptococcus pneumoniae </I>(<I>S. pneumoniae</I>). In 1997, a new meta-analysis was published showing adjunctive corticosteroid therapy to prevent hearing loss in patients with <I>H. influenzae</I> meningitis (<LINK REF="REF-McIntyre-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">McIntyre 1997</LINK>). This meta-analysis also showed a beneficial trend of dexamethasone on neurological sequelae and hearing loss in patients with meningitis due to <I>S. pneumoniae.</I></P><P>In the 2000s, five large randomised clinical trials have been performed. Two trials in children were performed in Malawi and South America and three trials in adults were performed in Europe, Vietnam and Malawi (<LINK REF="STD-de-Gans-2002" TYPE="STUDY">de Gans 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Molyneux-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Molyneux 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nguyen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Nguyen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peltola-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Peltola 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scarborough-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Scarborough 2007</LINK>). The European trial showed a beneficial effect in all patients, with the most apparent effect on mortality and unfavourable outcomes in pneumococcal meningitis (<LINK REF="STD-de-Gans-2002" TYPE="STUDY">de Gans 2002</LINK>). The Vietnamese trial showed a beneficial effect only in patients with proven bacterial meningitis (<LINK REF="STD-Nguyen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Nguyen 2007</LINK>). The other trials did not show a beneficial effect. In 2010 an individual patient data meta-analysis was performed with patients from these five trials to determine in which subgroups of patients adjunctive dexamethasone was effective (<LINK REF="REF-van-de-Beek-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">van de Beek 2010</LINK>). In this meta-analysis no benefit of adjunctive dexamethasone was found in any of the pre-specified subgroups. However, a post hoc analysis did show a reduction in any hearing loss in surviving patients treated with dexamethasone.</P><P>The results of many trials have been inconclusive and most studies have been relatively small. Trials have varied greatly in study population, study design, timing and dosage of corticosteroids. Furthermore, mortality was substantially higher in studies in low-income countries, primarily related to access to care and co-morbidities. This Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis facilitates an interpretation of these varying results and might identify subgroups that benefit from adjunctive corticosteroid therapy.

We analysed any hearing loss and severe hearing loss separately. Neurological sequelae were defined as focal neurological deficits other than hearing loss, epilepsy (not present before meningitis onset), severe ataxia and severe memory or concentration disturbance. We did not count children with isolated speech or language disturbances as having non-hearing deficits if these problems were associated with severe hearing loss. We analysed both short- and long-term neurological sequelae, other than hearing loss.

Overall, corticosteroids significantly reduced the rate of hearing loss (risk ratio (RR) 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63 to 0.87), severe hearing loss (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.88) and short-term neurological sequelae (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.00). The use of adjunctive corticosteroids was associated with a non-significant decrease in mortality (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.01). Use of adjunctive corticosteroids was not associated with a decrease in long-term neurological sequelae (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.10).

In most studies, a four-day regimen of dexamethasone (0.4 or 0.6 mg/kg/day) divided into four daily doses was used. One randomised, prospective study involving 118 children with bacterial meningitis showed a two-day and four-day regimen of dexamethasone to be similarly effective (<LINK REF="STD-Syrogiannopoulos-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Syrogiannopoulos 1994</LINK>). In this study physicians were not blinded to the treatment groups. Long-term neurological sequelae, or moderate hearing impairment (or both), were found in 1.8% and 3.8% of patients treated with dexamethasone for two and four days, respectively. It is unlikely that a randomised controlled trial (RCT) will be performed to answer the question of whether a two-day or four-day regimen should be used in bacterial meningitis; such a clinical trial would need a very large number of patients enrolled to detect significant differences between groups. Since most studies used a four-day regimen (without increase of side effects) we advise the use of the four-day corticosteroid therapy.</P><P>Three studies used hydrocortisone and/or prednisolone; all others used dexamethasone. Clinical efficacy depends on glucocorticoid pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics; of glucocorticoids, dexamethasone has superior penetration in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and a longer half life (<LINK REF="REF-Balis-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balis 1987</LINK>). Therefore, dexamethasone is considered to be the corticosteroid of choice in bacterial meningitis.</P><P>Subgroup analyses for timing of corticosteroids (before or with the first dose of antibiotics versus after the first dose of antibiotic) showed no differences in efficacy of corticosteroids. In previous reports, administration of corticosteroids before or with the first dose of parenteral antibiotics seemed to be more effective than administration after the first dose of antibiotics (<LINK REF="STD-King-1994" TYPE="STUDY">King 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McIntyre-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">McIntyre 1997</LINK>). A RCT involving 301 adults with bacterial meningitis in European countries showed a beneficial effect of the corticosteroid dexamethasone on unfavourable outcome and mortality (<LINK REF="STD-de-Gans-2002" TYPE="STUDY">de Gans 2002</LINK>). In this European study, dexamethasone or placebo was administered before or with the first dose of antibiotic (<LINK REF="STD-de-Gans-2002" TYPE="STUDY">de Gans 2002</LINK>). The beneficial effect of dexamethasone on mortality was most apparent in patients with pneumococcal meningitis. In a post hoc analysis of this study, the beneficial effect of dexamethasone on mortality in patients with pneumococcal meningitis was attributable to a reduction in systemic complications (<LINK REF="REF-van-de-Beek-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">van de Beek 2004a</LINK>). Although speculative and not supported by clinical data, one implication of this finding might be that the effect of dexamethasone is not restricted to the first hours after administration (<LINK REF="REF-van-de-Beek-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">van de Beek 2006b</LINK>).</P><P>A meta-analysis of individual patient data (<LINK REF="REF-van-de-Beek-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">van de Beek 2010</LINK>) was performed with five recent large RCTs on adjunctive dexamethasone therapy in bacterial meningitis (<LINK REF="STD-de-Gans-2002" TYPE="STUDY">de Gans 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Molyneux-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Molyneux 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nguyen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Nguyen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peltola-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Peltola 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scarborough-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Scarborough 2007</LINK>). Data from 2029 patients from five trials were included and the aim of this analysis was to establish whether any subgroups of patients with acute bacterial meningitis might benefit from adjunctive dexamethasone. Extensive exploration of 15 pre-specified subgroups did not show robust evidence that a particular subgroup would benefit; although there was a benefit in adults aged over 55 years (<LINK REF="REF-McIntyre-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">McIntyre 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-de-Beek-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">van de Beek 2010</LINK>). There were no differences in efficacy of adjunctive dexamethasone with regard to the timing of corticosteroids.</P><P>In experimental pneumococcal meningitis, CSF bacterial concentrations appeared to be more important than the timing of dexamethasone therapy in influencing the antibacterial-induced inflammatory response (<LINK REF="REF-Lutsar-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lutsar 2003</LINK>). Hence, there is a time period beyond which corticosteroid loses its effectiveness after the first (parenteral) administration of an antibiotic agent but this time interval has not been clearly defined. On the basis of the available evidence, dexamethasone should be preferably started before or with the first dose of antibiotic therapy.</P><P>A long-term follow-up study on adjunctive dexamethasone treatment in tuberculous meningitis showed the initial beneficial effect of adjunctive dexamethasone was abolished because of delayed mortality within five years (<LINK REF="REF-T_x00f6_r_x00f6_k-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Török 2011</LINK>). To assess the long-term effects of adjunctive corticosteroid treatment in bacterial meningitis and determine whether a similar phenomenon could be identified, a long-term follow-up study was performed in participants included in the European Dexamethasone Study (<LINK REF="STD-de-Gans-2002" TYPE="STUDY">de Gans 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fritz-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fritz 2012</LINK>). The study included 228 of 246 evaluable participants surviving the initial trial period. After a median follow-up of 13 years, mortality in the dexamethasone group was 22% compared to 33% in the placebo group (P value = 0.029) (<LINK REF="REF-Fritz-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fritz 2012</LINK>). The authors conclude that the beneficial effect of dexamethasone that is obtained in the acute phase of the disease remains for years. This provides another reason to administer adjunctive corticosteroids in adult bacterial meningitis patients in high-income countries.</P><P>However, long-term follow-up studies of patients included in other RCTs are needed to confirm the persistence of benefit from adjunctive dexamethasone.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Applicability of evidence</HEADING><P>In children with acute bacterial meningitis, corticosteroids reduced hearing loss from 20.4% to 14.6% and severe hearing loss from 11.2% to 7.3%. A large proportion of included children had meningitis due to <I>H. influenzae </I>type B, which has been virtually eliminated in high-income countries since routine vaccination of children against this bacterium started (<LINK REF="REF-McIntyre-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">McIntyre 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peltola-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peltola 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-de-Beek-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">van de Beek 2006b</LINK>). Nevertheless, subgroup analysis in children in high-income countries showed a protective effect of adjunctive corticosteroids on severe hearing loss overall and a favourable point estimate for severe hearing loss due to non-<I>Haemophilus </I>meningitis. The results of this review support the use of adjunctive corticosteroids in children in high-income countries with meningitis due to all micro-organisms based on the lack of evidence of adverse events (in general and micro-organism specific) of dexamethasone in the corticosteroid-treated group. However, as conclusive evidence is lacking for this subgroup, administration of corticosteroids to children with meningitis due to bacteria other than <I>H. influenzae </I>remains controversial.</P><P>Only one study in this analysis involved children with neonatal meningitis and showed a beneficial effect of corticosteroids on outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Mathur-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Mathur 2013</LINK>). However, the study was relatively small and treatment groups were not well balanced with regards to patient age, culture positivity and causative micro-organisms. Additional RCTs evaluating corticosteroids in neonatal meningitis need to be performed before definitive conclusions can be drawn on the role of dexamethasone treatment in neonatal meningitis.</P><P>On the basis of the benefits of corticosteroid therapy in the adult population in high-income countries, dexamethasone should be commenced in adults with suspected or proven community-acquired bacterial meningitis in high-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-van-de-Beek-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">van de Beek 2006a</LINK>). For adults in low-income countries, the use of corticosteroids is neither beneficial nor harmful.</P><P>The use of steroids was associated with fewer cases of persistent fever and more cases of recurrent fever, but not with serious adverse events. However, definitions of adverse events used in the studies were heterogeneous and most studies had no specified criteria in advance, so under-ascertainment is likely.</P><P>Concerns have been raised over the interference by corticosteroids in CSF eradication of meningeal pathogens by reducing the blood-brain barrier permeability and thereby the penetration of antibiotics in the subarachnoid space. Therapeutic failures have been described in adults treated with standard doses of vancomycin and adjunctive dexamethasone (<LINK REF="REF-Viladrich-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Viladrich 1991</LINK>). However, two studies showed with repeated lumbar punctures that, in both adults and children, treatment with dexamethasone did not reduce vancomycin levels in the CSF (<LINK REF="REF-Klugman-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klugman 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ricard-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ricard 2007</LINK>). Although these results are reassuring, patients with pneumococcal meningitis who are treated with vancomycin and dexamethasone should still be carefully observed throughout therapy (<LINK REF="REF-van-de-Beek-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">van de Beek 2006a</LINK>).</P><P>In adults who survive acute bacterial meningitis, cognitive impairment occurs frequently (<LINK REF="REF-van-de-Beek-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">van de Beek 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-de-Beek-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">van de Beek 2006a</LINK>). As corticosteroids may potentiate ischaemic injury to neurons (<LINK REF="REF-Sapolsky-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sapolsky 1985</LINK>), it is important to know whether corticosteroids have beneficial effects on hearing loss and mortality but worsen cerebral cortical functioning (<LINK REF="REF-van-de-Beek-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">van de Beek 2006b</LINK>). Neuropsychological outcome was evaluated in patients included in the European Dexamethasone Study who survived pneumococcal or meningococcal meningitis (<LINK REF="REF-Weisfelt-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weisfelt 2006</LINK>). In 87 out of 99 eligible patients, 46 (53%) of whom were treated with dexamethasone and 41 (47%) of whom received placebo, no significant differences in outcome were found between patients in the dexamethasone and placebo groups (medium time between meningitis and testing was eight years). In another study on long-term neuropsychological outcomes and dexamethasone in children, children who contracted pneumococcal meningitis and were treated with corticosteroids showed better academic achievements compared with children with pneumococcal meningitis who were not treated with adjunctive corticosteroids (<LINK REF="STD-Ozen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ozen 2006</LINK>).</P></SUBSECTION></APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS><QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-05-01 21:00:46 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley"><P>Of the 25 randomised clinical trials included in the meta-analysis four were of high quality, 14 of medium quality and seven of low quality. Although the number of high-quality studies was low, the number of participants in these studies accounted for 45% of participants included in the meta-analysis. Studies were mostly categorised as medium or low quality due to a lack of addressing missing data or because no intention-to-treat analysis was performed.

The first confounding factor is selection bias. Several studies on childhood meningitis had exceptionally low mortality rates; nine studies had mortality rates of 3% or less. Mortality rates of childhood bacterial meningitis in previous reported studies ranged from 8% to 20% (<LINK REF="REF-Baraff-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baraff 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bohr-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bohr 1983</LINK>). Inclusion of studies in the meta-analysis with less severe illness, as reflected in the very low case-fatality rates, will probably underestimate the protective effect of corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Glasziou-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glasziou 1995</LINK>). Five studies had very high mortality rates (over 25%). For patients admitted in a late state of disease, adjuvant corticosteroids are less protective and might even be harmful (<LINK REF="REF-Prasad-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prasad 1995</LINK>). Inclusion of such patients might again lead to an underestimation of the treatment effect.</P><P>A second bias is introduced when participants are withdrawn (<LINK REF="REF-Prasad-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prasad 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Qazi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Qazi 1996</LINK>). The analysis was based upon per-protocol figures, as intention-to-treat (ITT) figures were only available for six studies (24%). A total of 211 participants were withdrawn after the randomisation process, often for unknown reasons. Reasons for withdrawal include ineligibility according to the trial criteria or inability to complete the treatment protocol (<LINK REF="REF-Prasad-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prasad 1995</LINK>). Withdrawals on the grounds on ineligibility may have been influenced by knowledge of outcome; if so, this would advantage the corticosteroid regimen. Excluding participants because of an inability to complete the course of corticosteroids due to side effects (for example, upper gastrointestinal bleeding) clearly introduces bias in favour of the study medication, whereas withdrawals due to loss to follow-up might favour the placebo group. In the Egyptian study, which was not placebo-controlled and not double-blinded, only three pathogens were cultured from the cerebral spinal fluid of enrolled participants, suggesting withdrawal of participants with other bacteria culture from CSF and those with negative CSF cultures (<LINK REF="STD-Girgis-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Girgis 1989</LINK>).</P><P>A third bias is introduced by competing risks. The comparisons of hearing loss and neurologic sequelae (other than hearing loss) were made excluding all participants who died. Since mortality is possibly a treatment-related outcome, the treatment groups that exclude fatality cases may not be comparable. Competing risks in this analysis will lead to an underestimation of the treatment effect of corticosteroids.</P><P>Finally, the included studies were heterogeneous with respect to the study protocols. The first study was published in 1963 (<LINK REF="STD-Bennett-1963" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 1963</LINK>), the last in 2012 (<LINK REF="STD-Mathur-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Mathur 2013</LINK>). Several different study interventions were used. Therefore, study population effect sizes were calculated as risk ratios.</P></POTENTIAL_BIASES><AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-09-07 17:21:47 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Four meta-analyses on the use of adjunctive dexamethasone in adults were published, two in 2009 (<LINK REF="REF-Assiri-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Assiri 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vardakas-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vardakas 2009</LINK>) and two in 2012 (<LINK REF="REF-Borchorst-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borchorst 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bernardo-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernardo 2012</LINK>). The first meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Vardakas-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vardakas 2009</LINK>) concluded that dexamethasone was associated with a non-significant decrease in mortality, but when the trial from Malawi was left out the decrease in mortality did reach significance. The reasons for excluding the Malawian trial were a HIV-positive population, high mortality, poor general status and low human development index (HDI) (&lt; 0.5). However, other countries that were included had only slightly higher HDIs at the time of inclusion (<LINK REF="STD-Girgis-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Girgis 1989</LINK>, Egypt 0.53; <LINK REF="STD-Bhaumik-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bhaumik 1998</LINK> India 0.53, <LINK REF="STD-Scarborough-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Scarborough 2007</LINK> Malawi 0.49).

The second meta-analysis included four recent trials in adults (<LINK REF="STD-de-Gans-2002" TYPE="STUDY">de Gans 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nguyen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Nguyen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scarborough-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Scarborough 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thomas-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 1999</LINK>) and concluded that dexamethasone reduced mortality in high-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-Assiri-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Assiri 2009</LINK>). The third meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Borchorst-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borchorst 2012</LINK>) included 29 randomised studies and had similar conclusions as the Cochrane 2010 meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Brouwer-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brouwer 2010a</LINK>), which were that adjunctive dexamethasone was beneficial in adults in high-income countries, especially in patients with pneumococcal meningitis. The fourth meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Bernardo-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernardo 2012</LINK>) included only paediatric studies and concluded that adjunctive dexamethasone was not associated with a reduction in mortality, hearing loss or sequelae (<LINK REF="REF-Bernardo-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernardo 2012</LINK>). The reason why seven studies included in the Cochrane 2013 updated meta-analysis were not included in the meta-analysis of paediatric studies was not specified (<LINK REF="REF-Brouwer-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brouwer 2013</LINK>). According to the classification of study quality used, most of these studies were of similar quality to those that were included.</P><P>The difference in efficacy of corticosteroids between high- and low-income countries was mainly driven by two large studies from Malawi (<LINK REF="STD-Molyneux-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Molyneux 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scarborough-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Scarborough 2007</LINK>), together representing 60% of included participants from low-income countries. Participants included in these studies were often HIV-positive, presented late in the disease course or received inappropriate antibiotic therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Molyneux-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Molyneux 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scarborough-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Scarborough 2007</LINK>). There may be several reasons for the difference in efficacy of corticosteroids such as delayed presentation, clinical severity, underlying anaemia, malnutrition, the antibiotics used, HIV infection or other unidentified differences between populations. Recently, genetic factors were suggested to influence the patient's response to corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Brouwer-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brouwer 2012</LINK>). A study compared characteristics of children with culture-positive community-acquired bacterial meningitis in the Children's Unit, Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital, Blantyre, Malawi and in the Royal Liverpool Children's Hospital, UK from time periods before the introduction of vaccines (<LINK REF="REF-Molyneux-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Molyneux 2006</LINK>). Children in Malawi presented later and were more often comatose and malnourished, compared to children in Britain. Mortality from bacterial meningitis in children in Malawi was much higher than in children in Britain (41% versus 7%), even when infected with the same organism. Several studies have shown that a delay in initiation of antibiotic treatment is associated with worse outcome in bacterial meningitis (<LINK REF="REF-McMillan-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">McMillan 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-K_x00f8_ster_x002d_Rasmussen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Køster-Rasmussen 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Proulx-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Proulx 2005</LINK>). A meta-analysis on timing of steroids with respect to initial symptoms could not be performed because outcome data were not specified for patients presenting early or late during clinical course in any of the studies. Nevertheless, we stress the need for early diagnosis and treatment.</P><P>A meta-analysis of individual patient data was performed with five large RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-de-Gans-2002" TYPE="STUDY">de Gans 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Molyneux-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Molyneux 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nguyen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Nguyen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peltola-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Peltola 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scarborough-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Scarborough 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-de-Beek-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">van de Beek 2010</LINK>). Data from 2029 patients from five trials were included in the analysis (833 (41.0%) aged &lt; 15 years). HIV infection was confirmed or likely in 580 (28.6%) patients and bacterial meningitis was confirmed in 1639 (80.8%). Dexamethasone was not associated with a significant reduction in death (270 of 1019 (26.5%) on dexamethasone versus 275 of 1010 (27.2%) on placebo; odds ratio (OR) 0.97, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.19), death or severe neurological sequelae or bilateral severe deafness (42.3% versus 44.3%; OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.11), death or any neurological sequelae or any hearing loss (54.2% versus 57.4%; OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.07), or death or severe bilateral hearing loss (36.4% versus 38.9%; OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.69). However, dexamethasone reduced hearing loss among survivors (24.1% versus 29.5%; OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.99, P value = 0.04). Dexamethasone had no effect in any of the pre-specified subgroups, including specific causative organisms, pre-dexamethasone antibiotic treatment, HIV status or age. The differences between Malawi and the other clinical settings call into question the appropriateness of summary measures that combine the results, even if statistical tests of heterogeneity are deemed acceptable. Mortality rates in the two studies from Malawi were three to five-fold higher than in the studies from Europe, South America and Vietnam (<LINK REF="STD-de-Gans-2002" TYPE="STUDY">de Gans 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Molyneux-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Molyneux 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nguyen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Nguyen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peltola-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Peltola 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scarborough-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Scarborough 2007</LINK>). In subgroups of the individual patient data meta-analysis, there were several instances in which the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic was more than 50%, which indicates at least moderate heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-McIntyre-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">McIntyre 2010</LINK>). This current Cochrane review confirms the beneficial effect of corticosteroids on hearing loss that was found in the subgroups of the individual meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-van-de-Beek-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">van de Beek 2010</LINK>). Treatment with adjunctive corticosteroids was not associated with harm. In order to establish with certainty whether or not dexamethasone has a place in the treatment of bacterial meningitis, a large multinational RCT in that subgroup would be necessary. Such a trial would need to include approximately 13,500 participants to show an odds ratio (OR) of 0.9 with a power of 90% in a population with 27% risk of death in the placebo group, and is therefore unlikely to be performed or finished in the next decade. Meanwhile, results of our analysis support the use of corticosteroids in children and adults with community-acquired bacterial meningitis in high-income countries.</P><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="2">Implementation studies</HEADING><P>Seven studies evaluated the implementation of adjunctive dexamethasone treatment and its effect on the outcome of bacterial meningitis (<LINK REF="REF-Bodilsen-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bodilsen 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brouwer-2010b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brouwer 2010b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Castelblanco-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Castelblanco 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cornelis-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cornelis 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heckenberg-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heckenberg 2012b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koopmans-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koopmans 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peterkovi_x0107_-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peterkovi&#263; 2012</LINK>). Three studies compared the prognosis of adult pneumococcal, meningococcal and <I>Listeria monocytogenes</I> meningitis between two nationwide prospective cohort studies; one was performed before and the other after the implementation of adjunctive dexamethasone (<LINK REF="REF-Brouwer-2010b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brouwer 2010b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heckenberg-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heckenberg 2012b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koopmans-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koopmans 2013</LINK>). The studies showed that after the introduction of adjunctive dexamethasone, 84% of patients with pneumococcal meningitis, 89% of adults with meningococcal meningitis and 53% of <I>L. monocytogenes </I>meningitis received the recommended four-day regimen (40 mg/day in four doses). The mortality from pneumococcal meningitis decreased from 30% to 20% after the introduction of dexamethasone (P value = 0.001) and the rate of hearing loss decreased from 22% to 12% (P value = 0.001) (<LINK REF="REF-Brouwer-2010b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brouwer 2010b</LINK>). Meningococcal disease mortality declined from 7% to 4% and hearing loss from 8% to 3%, but these differences did not reach statistical significance (<LINK REF="REF-Heckenberg-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heckenberg 2012b</LINK>). No evidence of harm from dexamethasone was identified in studies on pneumococcal and meningococcal meningitis. The beneficial effect of dexamethasone on pneumococcal meningitis was similar to that identified in the European Dexamethasone Study (<LINK REF="STD-de-Gans-2002" TYPE="STUDY">de Gans 2002</LINK>). For listerial meningitis, an increase in unfavourable outcome from 27% to 61% was observed between the first and second cohort study (<LINK REF="REF-Koopmans-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koopmans 2013</LINK>). In a multivariate analysis bacterial genotype was found to be the main cause of the poorer prognosis. Dexamethasone was not associated with a change in mortality, hearing loss or sequelae in listerial meningitis. However, as adjunctive dexamethasone treatment was another major change between cohorts, it was suggested to discontinue dexamethasone when <I>L. monocytogenes </I>is identified. A nationwide retrospective study from Denmark showed dexamethasone was administered to 60% of meningitis cases between 2008 and 2012 compared to 37% between 2003 and 2007 (<LINK REF="REF-Bodilsen-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bodilsen 2014</LINK>). Dexamethasone treatment was associated with a significant decrease in the risk of an unfavourable outcome (33% versus 53%) and mortality (15% versus 24%). The implementation studies provide additional (class III) evidence that adjunctive dexamethasone is beneficial in adults with bacterial meningitis in high-income countries.</P><P>In a population-based observational study from the USA, incidence and mortality of bacterial meningitis due to the five most common pathogens between 1997 and 2010 were studied in a network database (<LINK REF="REF-Castelblanco-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Castelblanco 2014</LINK>). The study showed that over time mortality declined. This was attributed to the publication of the IDSA guideline of 2004, which advised adjunctive dexamethasone for all suspected bacterial meningitis cases (<LINK REF="REF-Castelblanco-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Castelblanco 2014</LINK>). However, data on dexamethasone use were not available and therefore a causal relation could not be established.</P><P>Retrospective studies in Belgium and Croatia evaluated whether the use of dexamethasone improved prognosis in adults (<LINK REF="REF-Peterkovi_x0107_-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peterkovi&#263; 2012</LINK>), or both adults and children (<LINK REF="REF-Cornelis-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cornelis 2011</LINK>). Both studies showed no effect of dexamethasone. However, in both studies the rationale to give or withhold dexamethasone was unclear and therefore confounding by indication (patients with severe sickness get more medication, i.e. dexamethasone, but still have a worse prognosis) is a major problem in these studies, as is the retrospective design.</P></SUBSECTION></AGREEMENT></DISCUSSION><CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-06-29 23:45:34 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-07-27 18:35:08 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>In summary, the consistency and degree of benefit identified in this analysis merits the use of corticosteroids in adults and children with acute bacterial meningitis in high-income countries, although the strength of the evidence is not optimal.

14:38:36 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley"><P>We have read with interest the updated Review on Corticosteroids for acute bacterial meningitis. We would specifically like to comment on the subject of &#8216;any hearing loss in adults&#8217;.<BR/><BR/>The figure for Analysis 3.2 contains some typographical errors. The figures quoted for the Scarborough (2007) paper for any hearing loss in adults (21/180 on corticosteroids and 37/177 on placebo) are in fact from the paper by Nguyen (2007). The figures quoted for the Thomas (1999) paper (30/96 on corticosteroids and 36/99 on placebo) are in fact the figures from the paper by Scarborough (2007). These errors are not present in other figures for the quoted papers. The Thomas (1999) paper is misplaced in Analysis 3.2.<BR/><BR/>Analysis 5.10 regroups four studies on any hearing loss in adults according to country income, be it high or low-income. The Scarborough (2007) paper is from Malawi and correctly categorised as from a low income country. The Bhaumik (1998) paper is categorised as from a high income country, but is in fact from India. The earlier text and all other analyses all place the Bhaumik paper in a low income country category. The Nguyen (2007) paper is categorised as from a high income country, but is in fact from Viet Nam. The World Bank defines Viet Nam as a low middle income country. In fact the World Bank now defines India as a low middle income country. The only study clearly from high income countries is that by de Gans (2002) from Europe.<BR/><BR/>The study which appears to demonstrate the greatest benefit from steroids on any hearing loss in adults is that by Nguyen (2007) in Viet Nam. In that paper the authors comment on the high proportion of cases of meningitis due to Streptococcus suis, and in Asia this is a recognised cause of deafness. However S.suis is not a cause of meningitis in high income countries. This is another reason why placing the Nguyen study in the high income category is inappropriate. The distinction between adults and children varies by study and the Nguyen paper included individuals over 14 years of age. There is clear evidence for benefit from steroids in reducing deafness from Haemophilus influenzae meningitis in children (Analysis 4.3), but in high income countries the incidence of H.influenzae infection has declined considerably with immunisation (Okike et al, 2014).</P><P>Reference<BR/>Okike IO et al.

We feel that the results of this systematic review and meta-analysis require further context.<BR/><BR/>Our assessment of trials included in the review that reported mortality and were deemed to be free of bias reveals an issue that we would like to highlight. Pooling the data for effect of corticosteroids on mortality resulted in a non-statistically significant difference (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.80, 1.01). A surprising inclusion in the meta-analysis was the trial by Scarborough et al., since the population in the trial were primarily patients who were HIV positive (89.7%) with a mean CD4 count of 102/mm3 (IQR 51 to 169).2 The inclusion of this trial adds significant clinical heterogeneity, since HIV positive patients would be expected to respond in a manner different from their immunocompetent counterparts. A sensitivity analysis that excludes the Scarborough et al. trial from the pooled data results in a statistically significant difference in mortality (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72, 0.97). While one may argue that the upper bound of the confidence interval is close to the line of no difference, it is important to present the data this way as it is more reflective of the results of a pooling of less heterogeneous data and suggests that there may be benefit in an immunocompetent population.<BR/><BR/>Four trials included in this review and meta-analysis were deemed to be free of bias (Scarborough 2007, Molyneux 2002, de Gans 2002, Nguyen 2007).2-5 Our assessment is that bias is present in all of these studies that would affect interpretation of the final results. In all four trials, selective outcome reporting is present. Specifically, none of the trials reported all adverse events (AE). In addition, serious adverse events (SAE) data was not included in any of the trials. In two trials, AE were reported only if they were deemed by the investigator to be due to the study drug: the Scarborough et al. trial reported that, &#8220;[n]ineteen patients had adverse events that were more likely to be due to antibiotics than corticosteroids&#8221;, while the Molyneux et al. trial reported, &#8220;[w]e recorded no deleterious side-effects attributable to use of dexamethasone.&#8221;.2,3 Another issue with AE reporting in all four trials is the absence of details on how AE were recorded, specifically whether all AE were recorded or if only the first AE reported was recorded. The selective reporting present in these trials impacts the interpretation of the results of the meta-analysis, since a lack of AE data prevents clinicians from determining the net clinical benefit of adjunctive corticosteroids in acute bacterial meningitis.<BR/><BR/>We respectfully suggest the authors of this review revisit the inclusion of the Scarborough et al. trial in the pooling of mortality data and provide context for interpretation of subsequent results. In addition, a revision of the risk of bias table should be considered to provide readers with appropriate context with which to interpret the results, namely that AE were likely underreported in trials.<BR/><BR/>References:<BR/>1.

On this measure Analysis 4.1 clearly shows that there is statistical significance in the effect of corticosteroids in reducing mortality in pneumococcal meningitis. On this basis numerous guidelines around the world advocate the use of corticosteroids for meningitis in adults, particularly with <I>St. pneumoniae</I>. We need to appreciate more about what underpins this calculation and I would make four points.</P><P>1) The study by Girgis <I>et al</I> (1999) is regarded as having a high risk of selection bias. Exclusion of this single study results in loss of statistical significance.</P><P>2) The study de Gans <I>et al</I> (2002) on the other hand was an excellent individual study. The overall P value being &lt;0.05 is dependent on this study as its exclusion results in loss of statistical significance. This study included patients with suspected meningitis and any of three features : cloudy CSF, CSF leucocyte counts &gt; 1,000 / ml and Gram stain positive CSF.</P><P>3) A further analysis of patients in the latter study by de Beek <I>et al</I> (2004) reviewed deaths within 14 days and found no difference between corticosteroid and placebo groups in those who suffered a neurological death (including brain herniation, cerebrovascular complications and withdrawal of care because of poor neurological process). However there was a difference, with benefit in the corticosteroid group, in those who had a &#8216;systemic cause&#8217; of death (due to septic shock, respiratory failure, multiple-organ dysfunction and cardiac ischaemia).</P><P>4) From data in Analysis 4.1 I calculate the relative risk of mortality between the corticosteroid group (168 deaths / 561) vs placebo (203 deaths / 571) as 0.8423 (95%CI 0.7121 &#8211; 0.9964) with P = 0.0453.</P><P>Having only one less death in the placebo group (202 / 571) changes the relative risk to 0.8465 (95% CI 0.7154-1.0016) with P = 0.0522, or only one more death in the corticosteroid group (169/561) changes the relative risk to 0.8474 (95% CI 0.7166-1.0019) with P = 0.0527.</P><P>Thus is there sufficient power to reach a clinically significant conclusion and do corticosteroids benefit the brain or protect against systemic complications?</P><P>We need to be aware that corticosteroids used to be used after head injuries to reduce intra-cerebral inflammation on the basis of a number of small studies, until the large MRC CRASH study actually showed that corticosteroids increased mortality (Edwards <I>et al</I>, 2005).</P><P><U>References</U> <BR/>de Beek D, de Gans J.
