<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-03-31 13:12:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The role of interventions for preventing depression after stroke is unclear. Depression is a common and important complication of stroke that is often missed or poorly managed. Little is known about whether treatment started early after stroke will reduce the risk of depression and improve recovery. This review of 14 trials, involving 1515 participants, found no evidence that antidepressant drugs prevent depression or improve physical recovery after stroke. Two trials showed that psychological therapy could improve patients' mood and prevent depression, but did not improve other outcomes. The generalisability of these findings to all stroke survivors is limited due to the small proportion of survivors who are eligible to participate in these clinical trials. More well-designed clinical trials are needed that test practical interventions for preventing depression across all stroke survivors.</P>

<P>We searched the Trials Registers of the Cochrane Stroke Group (October 2007) and the Cochrane Depression Anxiety and Neurosis Group (February 2008). In addition, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (<I>The Cochrane Library</I>, Issue 1, 2008), MEDLINE (1966 to May 2006), EMBASE (1980 to May 2006), CINAHL (1982 to May 2006), PsycINFO (1967 to May 2006), Applied Science and Technology Plus (1986 to May 2006), Arts and Humanities Index (1991 to September 2002), Biological Abstracts (1969 to September 2002), BIOSIS Previews (2002 to May 2006), General Science Plus (1994 to September 2002), Science Citation Index (1992 to May 2006), Social Sciences Citation Index (1991 to May 2006), SocioFile (1974 to May 2006) ISI Web of Science (2002 to February 2008), reference lists, trial registers, conference proceedings and dissertation abstracts, and contacted authors, researchers and pharmaceutical companies.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-03-31 13:11:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Two review authors independently selected trials, extracted data and assessed trial quality. Primary analyses were the proportion of patients who met the standard diagnostic criteria for depression applied in the trials at the end of follow up. Secondary outcomes included depression scores on standard scales, physical function, death, recurrent stroke and adverse effects.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Fourteen trials involving 1515 participants were included. Data were available for 10 pharmaceutical trials (12 comparisons) and four psychotherapy trials. The time from stroke to entry ranged from a few hours to seven months, but most patients were recruited within one month of acute stroke. The duration of treatment ranged from two weeks to one year. There was no clear effect of pharmacological therapy on the prevention of depression or other endpoints. A significant improvement in mood and the prevention of depression was evident for psychotherapy, but the treatment effects were small.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-05-08 14:11:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-03-31 13:12:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Depressive and anxiety disorders are important sequelae of stroke, occurring in at least one third of patients in the first year after onset, although estimates differ between studies due to varying definitions, populations, exclusion criteria and the timing of assessments (<LINK REF="REF-Hackett-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hackett 2005a</LINK>). Although there is much controversy surrounding stroke-associated depression as a specific type of depressive syndrome, the condition may impede rehabilitation (<LINK REF="REF-Parikh-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parikh 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sinyor-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sinyor 1986</LINK>) by impairing physical and cognitive function (<LINK REF="REF-Robinson-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 1986</LINK>), and contributing to stress on carers (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 1995</LINK>). Furthermore, depression following stroke may also be associated with an increased risk of death (<LINK REF="REF-House-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">House 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morris-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 1993</LINK>) including death by suicide (<LINK REF="REF-Stenager-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stenager 1998</LINK>). Depressive illness among older people, in general, is associated with greater morbidity and dependency, higher use of drugs and alcohol, increased use of health care resources, and poor compliance with treatment of co-morbid conditions (<LINK REF="REF-Katona-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katona 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although depression may influence recovery and outcome following stroke, many, perhaps most, patients do not receive effective treatment because their mood disorder is undiagnosed or inadequately treated (<LINK REF="REF-Ebrahim-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ebrahim 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hackett-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hackett 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-House-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">House 1989</LINK>). This is due in part to the problems with the diagnosis of a significant mood state among older people with disability. Even in otherwise healthy individuals, the assessment of abnormal mood is fraught with difficulty. Information from the general population suggests that, despite the severity and possible complications, only half of those with depression will seek professional help (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2000</LINK>). This may be due to the stigma associated with a diagnosis, people not realising they are unwell or feeling their condition is beyond help, as a natural part of ageing or a consequence of stroke. Given the problems inherent with diagnosis, that patients are at high risk of developing depression, and the uncertainty of the balance of benefit and risk of treatment, there is interest in therapies commenced early after the onset of stroke that prevent abnormal mood and improve outcome. We undertook a systematic review of all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of pharmaceutical agents and psychological therapies for the prevention of depression associated with stroke.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2008-03-18 14:51:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>To determine if pharmaceutical or psychological interventions reduce the incidence of depressive disorder in patients with stroke. The secondary objectives were to determine if pharmaceutical or psychological interventions improve mood scores, physical functioning, dependency and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients or principal caregivers. We also aimed to determine the safety of, and adherence to, the interventions.</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES MODIFIED="2008-03-31 13:12:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The review was restricted to all relevant RCTs in patients with a clinical diagnosis of stroke, where a pharmaceutical agent or psychological therapy used for the prevention of depression was compared with placebo or standard care. We excluded trials using a cross-over design, or where two or more of the interventions were compared against each other rather than a placebo, or standard care group. We included identified trials in all languages. There was no restriction on the eligibility of RCTs on the basis of sample size or duration of follow up. We considered unpublished reports, abstracts, brief and preliminary reports for inclusion on the same basis as published reports.</P>
<P>When we found studies meeting all the criteria for inclusion but not presenting any outcome data, and such data were not available from the authors, then the study could not contribute to any pooled estimate of effect. We regarded these studies as drop-outs rather than ineligible, and we have listed them in an additional table to indicate that they have not been overlooked (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2008-03-18 15:00:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We included all participants with a confirmed history of stroke where there was an explicit intention to provide an intervention to prevent depression associated with stroke. Stroke was defined according to clinical criteria. The criteria included cerebral infarction, intracerebral haemorrhage, and uncertain pathological subtypes but excluded studies of subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) only, which has a different natural history and management strategy to other stroke subtypes. We included studies with small numbers of SAH patients. We excluded trials that included mixed populations (such as stroke and head injury or other central nervous system disorders) unless separate results for patients with stroke were identified. We excluded patients with a diagnosed depressive disorder or a mood score above the standard cut-off score for depressive disorder at baseline, but included them in a review of interventions for treating depression after stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Hackett-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hackett 2003</LINK>). We excluded patients if they were treated primarily for a stroke-associated pain syndrome or other physical disorder, even if depression was measured as a secondary outcome.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2008-03-31 13:12:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We included any trial that attempted to evaluate the following comparisons.<BR/>
<BR/>(1) A comparison between a pharmacological agent and placebo for the prevention of depression following stroke. Specific pharmacological agents included tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. nortriptyline, imipramine and clomipramine), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (e.g. fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, sertraline and paroxetine), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) (e.g. moclobemide) and other antidepressant medications. We included psychostimulants (e.g. methylphenidate), mood stabilisers (e.g. lithium), benzodiazepines and combined preparations but analysed these separately. We excluded trials of an agent that was being evaluated for other reasons (e.g. neuroprotection or to facilitate neuro-regeneration) with a mood endpoint.</P>
<P>(2) A comparison between a psychological therapy and standard care (or attention control) for the prevention of depression associated with stroke. We included any psychological therapy that involved direct patient-professional interaction. The content of the interaction could vary from counselling to specific psychotherapy, provided it was directed at helping patients develop their social problem-solving skills and adjustment to the emotional impact of stroke. All interventions had to have a psychological component, such as talking, listening, support, advice; be based on a theory of talking therapy; be structured and timetabled as a talking therapy; and be delivered by somebody with some explicitly stated training and supervision in therapies. We excluded interventions where the sole content was educational or information giving, occupational therapy (including leisure therapy and other rehabilitation services), and visits from stroke support workers unless there was a clearly defined psychological component to the intervention.</P>

<P>We searched the Trials Registers of the Cochrane Stroke Group (last searched by the Review Group Co-ordinator in October 2007) and the Cochrane Depression Anxiety and Neurosis Group (last searched February 2008). In addition, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I>, Issue 1, 2008), MEDLINE (1966 to May 2006) (<LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>), EMBASE (1980 to May 2006), CINAHL (1982 to May 2006), PsycINFO (1967 to May 2006), Applied Science and Technology Plus (1986 to May 2006), Arts and Humanities Index (1991 to September 2002), Biological Abstracts (1969 to September 2002), BIOSIS Previews (2002 to May 2006), General Science Plus (1994 to September 2002), Science Citation Index (1992 to May 2006), Social Sciences Citation Index (1991 to May 2006), SocioFile (1974 to May 2006) and ISI Web of Science (2002 to February 2008). Biological Abstracts has now been superseded by BIOSIS Previews and ISI Web of knowledge includes the Arts and Humanities Index. We have not updated the searches on General Science Plus as this electronic database is not available for the current authors.</P>
<P>We also carried out the following searches.<BR/>(1) We searched Dissertations and Theses (previously called Digital Dissertations), a database of abstracts from doctoral theses from within the United States, Canada, Scandinavia and the United Kingdom (1980 to August 2007).<BR/>(2) We searched the proceedings of the European Stroke Conferences (2000 to 2007) and the Stroke Society of Australasia Annual Scientific Meetings (1999 to 2007).<BR/>(3) In 2002 we contacted by letter several of the researchers active the area of stroke-associated mood disorders in the previous 10 years. We identified these researchers by scanning author lists of the relevant published trials, reviews and conference proceedings. We asked them to verify that all relevant trials had been identified and also if they had knowledge of any other relevant published or unpublished trials. We have not contacted them for this review update.<BR/>(4) In 2002 we contacted major pharmaceutical companies by letter and asked if they knew of any relevant unpublished trials. We did not contact them for this update. However, we searched the online Clinical Trial Results and Clinical Trial Registries for Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly, Forest, GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis, Organon, Pfizer, Roche, and Wyeth (to August 2007).<BR/>(5) We searched the online clinical trials and research registers www.strokecenter.org/trials, www.ClinicalTrials.gov, www.Clinicalstudyresults.org and www.anzctr.org.au (to August 2007). The compulsory registration of clinical trial protocols on these sites before recruitment of the first patient enabled us to elect not to contact researchers and pharmaceutical companies.<BR/>(6) We reviewed chapters in books on the treatment of depression and management of stroke, including but not limited to, reviews of the management of stroke, books specifically directed at the treatment or prevention of depression, and those on stroke and old age.<BR/>

<UL>
<LI>the report: author, year and source of publication;</LI>
<LI>the study: sample characteristics, social demography, definition and criteria used for depression;</LI>
<LI>the participants: stroke sequence (first ever versus recurrent), social situation, time since stroke onset, prior history of psychiatric illness, current neurological status, current treatment for depression and history of coronary artery disease;</LI>
<LI>the research design and features: sampling mechanism, treatment assignment mechanism, adherence, non-response and length of follow up;</LI>
<LI>the intervention: type, duration, dose, timing and mode of delivery;</LI>
<LI>the effect size: sample size, nature of outcome, estimate and standard error.</LI>
</UL>
<P>To allow for intention-to-treat analysis, we sought the data irrespective of adherence, whether or not the participants were subsequently deemed ineligible, or were otherwise excluded from treatment or follow up.</P>
<P>We checked all of the extracted data for agreement between review authors. We obtained missing information from the primary investigators if possible. To avoid introducing bias, we obtained this unpublished information in writing, on forms designed for the purpose, and entered it into RevMan 4.2.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Study characteristics</HEADING>
<P>Although there are a number of scales devised for assessing the quality of RCTs, there is no convincing evidence that complex and time-consuming scales are more effective than simple scales (<LINK REF="REF-Verhagen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verhagen 2001</LINK>). As we extracted data we documented specific details about the following five points.<BR/>(1) Generation of the randomisation sequence: the method used; was the study described as randomised, and a genuine randomisation process described; was this adequate, inadequate, or unknown. If the randomisation was blocked, was the size of the blocks known to those entering participants. Adequate randomisation = 1, inadequate/unknown randomisation = 0.<BR/>(2) Concealment of the random sequence from those entering participants into the trial: the method used; was it one that ensured tamper-free concealment of allocation; was it adequate, inadequate or unknown. Concealed randomisation = A, not concealed/unknown = B, and insecure = C.<BR/>(3) Who was blinded and how successful blinding was: were the participant, health worker treating the participant, or the follow-up raters blinded; and were attempts made to check blinding was successful. Rater blinded = 1, rater not blinded/unknown = 0.<BR/>(4) How many participants in each treatment group who were initially randomised were not included in the analysis: whether an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis was possible on all participants from the published data (that is, whether there were any exclusions from the trial after randomisation). ITT = 1, per protocol/other/unknown = 0.<BR/>(5) How many participants were withdrawn from the trial, crossed over treatment groups, or were lost to follow up (including when the proportion of participants who were lost to follow up was less than 20%). Less than 20% = 1, 20% or more = 0.</P>
<P>Two review authors (MH and CA) independently assessed the methodological characteristics of each trial using the above checklist. We then met for a consensus meeting. We resolved any disagreements by discussion, and a third review author (AH) resolved any persisting differences. For each included trial we described features that influenced the degree of bias, as well as differences in baseline prognostic variables that might invalidate the results. One or more of these variables could be used to undertake sensitivity analyses in subsequent reviews.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Statistical analysis</HEADING>
<P>The main outcome of interest was the proportion of participants who met the diagnostic, or scoring, categories for depression at the end of follow up. For all dichotomous outcomes, we calculated odds ratios (OR), with 95% confidence intervals (CI) if appropriate.</P>
<P>For continuous outcomes, if ordinal scale data appeared to be approximately normally distributed or if the analysis suggested parametric tests were appropriate, we treated the outcome measures as continuous variables. If there were at least two studies that reported the same outcomes, we reviewed the data for appropriateness of pooling. If there was definite evidence of heterogeneity (I-squared (I<SUP>2</SUP>) more than 50%), we explored potential reasons for the differences by performing subgroup or sensitivity analyses. If the heterogeneity could not be explained, we combined the studies using random-effects analyses with cautious interpretation, or did not combine them at all.</P>
<P>We used RevMan 4.2 if possible; Excel and SAS statistics software were used for other analyses.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup and sensitivity analyses</HEADING>
<P>If numbers permitted, we performed subgroup analyses to examine the impact of treatment type and duration, and stroke severity. We planned to undertake sensitivity analyses to explore the influence of date of publication, sample size, method of diagnosing depression, duration of follow up, high (more than 20%) number of drop-outs, and blinded versus unblinded outcome assessors. We planned to explore the sensitivity of the combined estimate to individual studies by leaving one study out, calculating the combined effect of the remaining studies, and comparing the results with the combined effect based on all the studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Additional requested data</HEADING>
<P>We wrote to the authors of all newly included, ongoing and drop-out studies requesting data that were unavailable, or ambiguous in the published articles. We received responses with additional data from the authors of both new studies (<LINK REF="STD-Almeida-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Almeida 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Watkins-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Watkins 2007</LINK>). We made contact with one author of one of the drop-out studies (<LINK REF="STD-Leathley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Leathley 2003</LINK>) and we hope to include these data in the next version of this review. In the 2004 review we received responses with data from the ongoing study (<LINK REF="STD-Sitzer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sitzer 2002</LINK>). We received responses with additional data from six authors (<LINK REF="STD-Downes-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Downes 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Forster-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Forster 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Friedland-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Friedland 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-House-2000" TYPE="STUDY">House 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reding-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Reding 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robinson-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 2000a</LINK>).

We require more information on another seven trials before we decide on inclusion or not. Two trials compared two active treatments with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Dam-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Dam 1996a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robinson-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 2000a</LINK>). We compared data from both treatment arms in these trials with data from half the number of participants in the control groups, and presented the results as two separate studies. One trial included an attention control (where the time participants in the treatment group spent with a trained therapist was controlled for by attention control participants spending equal time with an untrained volunteer) as well as a control (standard care) group (<LINK REF="STD-House-2000" TYPE="STUDY">House 2000</LINK>).

These trials are considered 'drop-outs' and more detailed information is provided in an Additional Table (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Four further trials (<LINK REF="STD-Lund-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lund 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robinson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sitzer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sitzer 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whyte-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Whyte 2004</LINK>) are currently ongoing.</P>
<P>Ninety-four trials were excluded. In 46 trials the intervention did not meet the review criteria and neither placebo (pharmaceutical trials) nor usual care (psychotherapy trials) comparisons were available in 34 trials.

The proportion of participants meeting the study criteria for depression were lower in antidepressant-treated participants, but we did not carry out meta-analysis in view of the variety of study methods and endpoints measured. When we considered between-group differences in continuous scores on depression scales, there was no evidence of benefit of pharmacotherapy for mean scores at the end of treatment or change in mean scores from baseline. There was no evidence of benefit of pharmacotherapy improving cognitive function or activities of daily living (ADL), or reducing disability, as demonstrated by the heterogeneous results and wide 95% CIs around the estimates, both in favour of treatment and in favour of control.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-03-31 13:34:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Only two new trials meeting our review criteria, one of pharmacotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Almeida-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Almeida 2006</LINK>) and one of psychotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Watkins-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Watkins 2007</LINK>), have been published since this review was first published in 2004. The addition of the motivational interviewing trial (<LINK REF="STD-Watkins-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Watkins 2007</LINK>) strengthened the findings of the previous review that psychotherapy improves mood and provided new evidence that psychotherapy may prevent the development of depression. Addition of the new pharmacotherapy trial did not alter the results of the previous review that the evidence does not indicate that pharmacotherapy is effective in preventing depression after stroke.</P>
<P>This review explored the effectiveness of pharmacological and psychological treatments to prevent depression and improve outcome from stroke. Given the difficulties with recognition and uncertainties over the effectiveness of treatments, it is reasonable to consider approaches to the prevention of mood disorders following stroke whereby treatments are applied broadly to patients soon after onset to improve mood, cognition and behaviour, and possibly also physical function. Among the potential therapeutic mechanisms of action of such therapies are effects on neuronal plasticity and neurotransmitters. However, although it was evident from the large number of publications identified in the searches that mood disorders are well recognised as an important consequence of stroke, the evidence on which to guide therapy in this area is limited.</P>
<P>A major but not unexpected finding was the considerable heterogeneity in design, analysis and reporting of clinical trials in this area of stroke medicine. To begin with, the trials included participants whose time from the onset of stroke to randomisation ranged from several days to seven months. It is difficult to consider studies including participants six months after their stroke as true prevention studies. It is also likely that the aetiology of depression and response to treatment will vary across the different stages of recovery from stroke. For example, patients in the acute phase of stroke are likely to be adjusting to experiencing a potentially life-threatening event as well as rapidly evolving effects of cerebral ischaemia. On the other hand, those patients who survive long-term are adjusting to any fixed neurological deficits and residual disability, with varying impact on their social and financial situation. In a similar manner, the effects of treatment are likely to vary according to whether they are administered for short (several weeks) or long (several months) time periods.</P>
<P>Another aspect of heterogeneity was the inclusion criteria across trials. Ideally, participants should be homogeneous with regard to stroke diagnosis, which requires the use of standard diagnostic criteria and neuroimaging in a high proportion of cases. Several of the pharmacotherapy trials and only one of the psychotherapy trials reported the method used to diagnose stroke, and while most did not provide details regarding stroke subtype, four included participants with subarachnoid haemorrhage. Given differences in the natural history, management and potentially also aetiological factors for depression in the setting of subarachnoid haemorrhage, it could be argued that this form of stroke should be examined separately to atherosclerotic stroke.</P>
<P>With regard to other entry criteria, many trials excluded patients with communication problems, cognitive impairment and previous psychiatric illness. This may be appropriate for trials of psychotherapy, as participants are required to engage actively in talking therapies. However, use of a large list of exclusions in trials of pharmacotherapy means that the results are likely to be applicable only to a small proportion of survivors of stroke who have a narrow range of co-morbidity and other characteristics. This reinforces a common criticism of depression research in the general population that the trial participants are not representative of those requiring treatment in the 'real world' (<LINK REF="REF-Zimmerman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zimmerman 2002</LINK>). It would appear that this criticism is also applicable to trials to prevent depression after stroke, where up to half of survivors may be excluded using such criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Turner_x002d_Stokes-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner-Stokes 2003</LINK>). Given the high age of most patients with stroke, and the frequent presence of neurological impairments, aphasia and co-morbid medical conditions, the fact that up to half of survivors are excluded from these trials limits the external validity of the results.<BR/>
<BR/>While it is relatively easy to diagnose major vascular disease endpoints in clinical trials, defining depression as an outcome can be problematic. Disturbances of language and cognition are common after stroke, and physical and other behavioural cues, such as slowness, reduced appetite and loss of facial expression, may be misleading in the diagnosis of abnormal mood. Although gold-standard diagnostic definitions are available for major depression, dysthymia and other mood disorders (for example, <LINK REF="REF-APA-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1987</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-ICD-10-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICD 10 1992</LINK>), these require modification to use among patients with stroke. Clearly, there is the need to accept stroke as the concomitant medical condition, but also the presence of symptoms for less than the two years required for a diagnosis of dysthymia. In this situation minor depression (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK>), which is characterised by the presence of two to four depressive symptoms during a two-week period, and requires one of these symptoms to be either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure, may be more appropriate. In clinical practice, a trained health professional establishes the presence of abnormal mood by interviewing a patient. Given the practical difficulties and high cost of conducting detailed psychiatric interviews on participants in clinical trials, we considered it appropriate to adopt a pragmatic approach and determine a case of depression on the basis of a psychiatric interview or use of a validated mood questionnaire. However, there are several problems associated with this approach. First, some studies included participants whose baseline mood scores were within the range for abnormal mood or depression. As we consider it inappropriate to undertake a study of the prevention of depression when it may already be present, we have elected to exclude these participants in these studies until data are available from the researchers. Second, the multiple approaches and scales used to assess mood across studies, and the variation in reporting of data within and between studies, made the pooling of data inappropriate in most cases. Finally, since primary a priori endpoints were seldom reported for the multiple measures used, it was difficult to assess whether the data presented were truly the intended primary outcomes in many studies, particularly given the high number of studies with selective reporting of outcomes.</P>
<P>Another important aspect of trial design is the sample size required to detect a clinically meaningful effect; that is, how much of a difference between groups is considered reasonable to expect. While the continuous measures offered by various mood scales are appealing, as only 50 to a few hundred participants may be required in trials, the clinical significance of a few points difference between group means on follow up is not so clear cut. Transformation of scores according to particular cut-off values, or the assessment of patients using standardised clinical diagnostic criteria to provide a categorical disease endpoint is more meaningful, but may require several thousand participants. In addition, participants in clinical trials are likely to be more biologically robust and may potentially receive a treatment effect by virtue of their participation alone.</P>
<P>Finally, it is difficult to interpret the significance of outcomes when there is inadequate concealment of randomisation and high numbers of drop-outs in several of the studies. Few trials systematically recorded and reported adverse events, making it impossible to undertake a reliable assessment of the benefits and risks of therapy. There was inconsistency in the methods of analysis and reporting of results, with most studies presenting per protocol analyses. For trials with high drop-outs (more than 20%), ITT analysis becomes very important. Should ITT (with missing data for the best possible and worst possible outcome) and per protocol analyses indicate similar trends, then the findings are likely to be interpreted as clinically robust. It is not too surprising that we were unable to detect an effect of any of the pharmacological therapies.</P>
<P>In summary, the lack of evidence of an effect of pharmacological therapy and the limited evidence for psychological therapy on preventing depression after stroke can be readily attributed to the limited numbers of studies, many of which are limited by poor study design, analysis and reporting, as much as to the possible lack of efficacy of the interventions.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-03-19 14:33:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>There is inadequate evidence at present to support the routine use of antidepressants, psychostimulants, or other drugs to prevent depression and improve recovery after stroke. The small positive benefit of psychological strategies probably endorses the use of more structured approaches to the delivery of education and advice targeting emotional recovery and adjustment to the effects of stroke. However, the amount of evidence to support the routine use of psychological approaches in stroke rehabilitation is limited, as is the generalisability of these findings to all stroke survivors due to the narrow inclusion and exclusion criteria for participants in these trials.<BR/>

<P>One reason for uncertainty in this area is that previous trials have been of inadequate design. There is a need for further research using more rigorous methods.

<UL>
<LI>The trial should be of adequate power to detect modest but clinically important effects on a binary endpoint of significantly abnormal mood state, defined either by structured psychiatric interview or a validated mood scale.</LI>
<LI>Participants should be recruited early (within four to six weeks) after the onset of stroke and the treatment continued for at least six months (the high risk period), to allow the maximum effect on the natural history of the disorder and evaluation of a treatment regime that could be relatively easily adopted into clinical practice.</LI>
<LI>Standard clinical criteria for stroke should be used, and patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage and those depressed at baseline excluded from participation.</LI>
<LI>Exclusion criteria should be kept to a minimum without forgoing patient safety to allow trial results to be generalisable to most stroke survivors.</LI>
