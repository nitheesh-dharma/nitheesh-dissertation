<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Anticholinergic drugs in patients with overactive bladder syndrome.</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>An overactive bladder is a condition in which bladder contracts suddenly without any control, resulting in feeling to urinate and or leakage of urine. This is a common condition in adults and is also called as 'irritable' bladder or detrusor instability, urge or urgency-frequency syndrome. Overactive bladder becomes more common with advancing age. Anticholinergic drugs mainly by their muscle relaxant action can help adults with symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency and urge incontinence. </P>
<P>The review of trials found that on average people taking anticholinergic medication had about five less trips to the toilet and four less leakage episodes every week, with modest improvements in quality of life. About one in three people taking the drugs reported a dry mouth.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Around 16% of adults have symptoms of overactive bladder (urgency with frequency and/or urge incontinence). The prevalence increases with age. Anticholinergic drugs are commonly used to treat this condition. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the effects of anticholinergic drugs for the treatment of overactive bladder syndrome.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Trials Register (searched 14 June 2005) and the reference lists of relevant articles.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised or quasi-randomised trials in adults with overactive bladder syndrome that compared an anticholinergic drug with placebo treatment or no treatment.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewer authors independently assessed eligibility, trial quality and extracted data. Data were processed as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2005).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Sixty -one trials, 42 with parallel-group designs and 19 crossover trials were included (11,956 adults). Most trials were described as double-blind but were variable in other aspects of quality. The crossover trials did not present data in a way that allowed inclusion in the meta-analysis. Nine medications were tested: darifenacin; emepronium bromide or carrageenate; oxybutynin; propiverine; propantheline; tolterodine; trospium chloride; and solifenacin. One trial included the newer, slow release formulation of tolterodine.</P>
<P>At the end of the treatment period, cure or improvement (relative risk (RR) 1.39, 95%CI 1.28 to 1.51), difference in leakage episodes in 24 hours (weighted mean difference (WMD) -0.54; 95% CI -0.67 to -0.41) and difference in number of voids in 24 hours (WMD -0.69; 95%CI -0.84 to -0.54) were statistically significant favouring medication. Statistically significant but modest sized improvements in quality of life scores were reported in recently completed trials. There was three times the rate of dry mouth in the medication group (RR 3.00 95% CI 2.70 to 3.34) but no statistically significant difference in withdrawal (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.36). Sensitivity analysis, while limited by small numbers of trials, showed little likelihood that the effects were modified by age, sex, diagnosis, or choice of drug. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The use of anticholinergic drugs by people with overactive bladder syndrome results in statistically significant improvements in symptoms. Recent trials suggest that this is associated with modest improvement in quality of life. Dry mouth is a common side effect of therapy but did not seem to have an effect on the numbers of withdrawals. It is not clear whether any benefits are sustained during long-term treatment or after treatment stops.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-15 13:43:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-10-15 13:43:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>According to the International Continence Society (ICS) "urgency, with or without urge incontinence, usually with frequency and nocturia, can be described as overactive bladder (OAB) syndrome, urge syndrome or urgency-frequency syndrome. These terms can be used if there is no proven infection or obvious pathology" (<LINK REF="REF-Abrams-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abrams 2002</LINK>). The symptom complex do not represent and is not specific to a single disease, hence ICS definition can be debatable. Nevertheless, this term (OAB) has been commonly used in the literature.</P>
<P>People with overactive bladder syndrome report urgency (with or without urge incontinence), usually in combination with frequency and or nocturia. To be called overactive bladder syndrome these symptoms should not be caused by metabolic problems such as diabetes, or problems with the urinary tract such as urinary tract infection. However, people with neurological causes of overactive bladder symptoms are not excluded from the diagnosis. Overactive bladder syndrome may also be called urge syndrome or urgency-frequency syndrome.</P>
<P>Urgency is the sudden and compelling desire to pass urine, which is difficult to defer. Sometimes there is involuntary leakage of urine with the feeling of urgency, and this is called urge urinary incontinence. Urgency and urge urinary incontinence usually result from an involuntary increase in bladder pressure due to detrusor (bladder smooth muscle) over-activity. If further investigation of urgency/urge incontinence with urodynamics demonstrates spontaneous or provoked detrusor muscle contraction in the filling phase of the test then detrusor overactivity is diagnosed. If there is no defined cause for the overactivity this is called idiopathic (no known cause) detrusor overactivity but if there is a relevant neurological condition then the term neurogenic detrusor overactivity or detrusor hyperreflexia is used.</P>
<P>Frequency is the complaint of needing to void often during the day or at night. In clinical practice a person who voids more than eight times in 24 hours is considered to have frequency. If a person wakes more than once at night from sleep to void this is called nocturia.</P>
<P>Frequency, urgency, urge urinary incontinence, or the combination of these symptoms, are a common problem amongst adults living in the community. In a survey (telephone or face to face interviews) of 16,776 randomly selected adults aged 40 years or more, in six European countries, 16.6% reported overactive bladder symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Milsom-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Milsom 2001</LINK>). Similarly a telephone survey of 5204 people aged 18 years and over in the USA found that the prevalence of self reported overactive bladder symptoms was 16.6% (<LINK REF="REF-Stewart-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 2001</LINK>). In a sample of 2369 adults from 11 Asian countries the prevalence of overactive bladder was 44.9% (<LINK REF="REF-Moothy-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moothy 2001</LINK>). A survey of 2005 adults in Korea found a prevalence of overactive bladder of 30.5% (<LINK REF="REF-Choo-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Choo 2001</LINK>). In a telephone survey of 819 Hong Kong Chinese aged 10-90 years, 19% reported frequency and 15% complained of urge and/or urge incontinence (<LINK REF="REF-Brieger-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brieger 1996</LINK>). It is not clear why there are such marked differences in prevalence between some of the Asian studies and those from the USA or Europe. The differences may be real or due to different definitions. Several large population studies have reported that the prevalence of overactive bladder symptoms increases with age in men and women (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Milsom-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Milsom 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moller-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moller 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stewart-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ueda-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ueda 2000</LINK>). In people with neurological conditions such as multiple sclerosis, urinary dysfunction appears to be more common than in the neurologically unimpaired population: the most frequently reported problems are frequency and/or urgency (<LINK REF="REF-Hennessey-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hennessey 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Research on the amount of bother caused by overactive bladder syndrome, and the effect on quality of life, is now underway. It seems that frequency and/or urgency might can be just as bothersome as actual leakage (<LINK REF="REF-Milsom-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Milsom 2001</LINK>), and overall the effects of overactive bladder symptoms on quality of life are marked (<LINK REF="REF-Jackson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jackson 1997</LINK>). It also seems clear that many of the people affected by overactive bladder symptoms do not seek help from health care professionals (<LINK REF="REF-Milsom-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Milsom 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ueda-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ueda 2000</LINK>).</P>
<UL>
<LI>Treatment of overactive bladder syndrome</LI>
</UL>
<P>The two main treatment options for overactive bladder syndrome are conservative management (for example bladder training, electrical stimulation) and pharmacotherapy or a combination of both. A separate Cochrane review on bladder training is available (<LINK REF="REF-Wallace-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wallace 2004</LINK>) and the scope of the current review is confined to drug treatment.</P>
<P>While the pathophysiology of the overactive bladder remains to be fully elucidated, the involvement of the autonomic nervous system in detrusor function is recognised (<LINK REF="REF-de-Groat-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Groat 1997</LINK>). The motor nerve supply to the bladder is via the parasympathetic nervous system (via sacral nerves: S2,3,4) (<LINK REF="REF-Abrams-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abrams 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ouslander-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ouslander 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ouslander-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ouslander 1986</LINK>) which effects detrusor muscle contraction. This is mediated by acetylcholine acting on muscarinic receptors at the level of the bladder. Muscarinic receptors are found in other parts of the body too, for example in the gut, salivary glands and tear ducts. Pharmacotherapy relies on the use of drugs with anticholinergic properties. The rationale for using anticholinergic drugs in the treatment of overactive bladder syndrome is to block the parasympathetic acetylcholine pathway and thus abolish or reduce the intensity of detrusor muscle contraction. Unfortunately, none of the anticholinergic drugs that are available to date are specific to the muscarinic receptors in the bladder. As a result, the drugs can cause side effects by acting in other parts of the body too; these include dry mouth or eyes, constipation or nausea.</P>
<P>For the purpose of this review the term 'anticholinergic medications' refers to all medications with primary anticholinergic properties that are given specifically for bladder symptoms. Medications with secondary anticholinergic effects, for example tricyclic antidepressants have been excluded.</P>
<P>The number of anticholinergic drugs available on the market is increasing and various studies, observational and randomised controlled trials exist which evaluate effectiveness (for example <LINK REF="STD-Thuroff-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Thuroff 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VanKerrebroeck-1998" TYPE="STUDY">VanKerrebroeck 1998</LINK>). However, uncertainty still exists as to whether anticholinergic drugs are effective and, if so, which ones and by what route of administration. There is also uncertainty about the role of anticholinergic drugs in different patient groups (for example the elderly, male and female). Despite these uncertainties, anticholinergics are increasingly being used in primary and secondary care settings for the treatment of overactive bladder syndrome, and this has considerable resource implications (<LINK REF="REF-Kobelt-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kobelt 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are many studies of the effects of anticholinergic drugs and four Cochrane reviews will consider them. This review compares anticholinergic drugs with no treatment or placebo treatment. Three other reviews consider: 1) whether different anticholinergic drugs have different effects (<LINK REF="REF-Hay_x002d_Smith-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hay-Smith 2005</LINK>); 2) whether anticholinergic drugs are better than other active non-drug therapies (<LINK REF="REF-Alhasso-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alhasso 2006</LINK>); and 3) whether anticholinergic drugs are better than other drug treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Dublin-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dublin 2004</LINK>). Two meta-analyses of an anticholinergic drug (tolterodine) versus placebo have been published (<LINK REF="STD-Appell-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Appell 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Larsson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Larsson 1999</LINK>). However, neither of these publications provides an adequate systematic review of the available trials comparing anticholinergic drugs with placebo or no treatment. Neither publication reports the objectives of the systematic review, a search strategy, inclusion and exclusion criteria for trials or the methods of data extraction and analysis. It appears that these meta-analyses combine the results of pharmaceutical company funded phase II (<LINK REF="STD-Larsson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Larsson 1999</LINK>) and phase III (<LINK REF="STD-Appell-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Appell 1997</LINK>) trials of tolterodine versus placebo. A recent systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Chapple-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chapple 2005b</LINK>) assessed the variation in the effects of different anticholinergic drugs. This second-level question has been addressed in a separate Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Hay_x002d_Smith-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hay-Smith 2005</LINK>) that focused on the safety and effectiveness of anticholinergics as a generic group.</P>

<P>At least one arm of the study had to use an anticholinergic drug and one other was a placebo or no treatment arm. To be included, the drug had to be a muscarinic anticholinergic antagonist given for the purpose of decreasing symptoms of overactive bladder. The group of drugs included: emepronium bromide or carrageenate, darifenacin, dicyclomine chloride, oxybutynin chloride, propantheline bromide, propiverine, tolterodine, and trospium chloride. Terodiline, an anticholinergic drug previously used in the treatment of overactive bladder, was excluded because it has been withdrawn from the market. Trials with intravesical anticholinergic medication administration were excluded in this updated version of the review. </P>
<P>Other drugs with less direct anticholinergic effects were also excluded, (for example smooth muscle relaxants, flavoxate hydrochloride, calcium channel blockers, potassium channel openers, beta-adrenoceptor agonists, alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists, prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors, and tricyclic antidepressants).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Screening for eligibility</HEADING>
<P>Trials under consideration for inclusion in the review were assessed independently for their appropriateness by two review authors without prior consideration of their results. Any disagreements that were unresolved by discussion were considered by a third person. Excluded studies were listed with reasons for their exclusion.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of methodological quality</HEADING>
<P>The review authors independently made an assessment of methodological quality using the Incontinence Group's quality assessment tool, which includes evaluation of quality of random allocation and concealment, description of dropouts and withdrawals, analysis by intention to treat, and masking during treatment and at outcome assessment. Disagreements were resolved by discussion with a third person.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction</HEADING>
<P>Data were independently abstracted by at least two review authors and cross-checked. Where data were collected but were not reported, or were reported in a form not suitable for inclusion in the formal analysis, further clarification was sought from the trialists. In trials where different doses of the same drug were compared against placebo we used what is considered to be the therapeutic dose (for example solifenacin 5mg, tolterodine 2mg twice a day or 4mg once per day). When two different types of anticholinergics (for example tolterodine and solifenacin) were compared against placebo, the results from the two arms of anticholinergics were recalculated as a weighted average.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data analysis</HEADING>
<P>In trials with two or more active (anticholinergic drug) treatment arms, the data from the active treatments were combined, where possible for comparison with placebo. Included trial data were processed as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>We intended, where possible, to calculate standardised effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals (CI): weighted mean differences (WMD) where outcomes were continuous variables and relative risks (RR) where they were binary. A fixed-effect model was used to calculate the pooled estimates and the 95% CIs. The weighted mean differences were weighted by the inverse of the variance.</P>
<P>We combined data on number of episodes at the end of the treatment period with change from baseline scores for both leakage and micturition outcomes.</P>
<P>Cross-over trials: in order to use the data from crossover trials in a meta-analysis ideally it should be presented as the mean and standard deviation of the difference between two treatments for continuous data, or a two-by-two table for binary data, as the correlation between measurements on the same individual may be important. We did not attempt to include cross-over trials in the meta-analysis using the generic inverse variance method as there were large amounts of data available from the parallel-group trials. The results from cross-over trials were discussed narratively.</P>
<P>A priori sensitivity analyses were planned to investigate the effects of age, sex, severity of symptoms, cause of overactive bladder symptoms (that is idiopathic versus neurogenic) and type of medication.</P>
<P>Differences between trials were to be further investigated when it appeared obvious from visual inspection of the results, or statistically significant heterogeneity was found at the 10% probability level using the chi-squared test or by assessment of the I-squared statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2005</LINK>). If a reason was found then a judgement was to be made as to whether it was reasonable to combine the results. If there was no obvious reason for the heterogeneity, a random-effects model could have been used. However, in the event this was not necessary.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>Overall, there was a lack of consistency in the types of outcome measures reported by trialists, and a lack of consistency in the way data were reported. Seven trials reported outcomes of interest but without useable data (<LINK REF="STD-Chaliha-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chaliha 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Di-Stasi-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Di Stasi 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Malone_x002d_Lee-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Malone-Lee 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosario-1995b" TYPE="STUDY">Rosario 1995b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stohrer-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Stohrer 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tago-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Tago 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wein-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Wein 1978</LINK>). Due to deficiencies in data reporting (for example point estimates without any measure of variation), many trials contributed only limited data to the review. The lack of similarity in measures reduced the possibilities for combining results from individual trials.</P>
<P>The primary outcomes of interest in the review were the patient observations (for example perception of cure or improvement) and quantification of symptoms (such as number of leakage episodes). Patient observations were rarely reported and in reading trial reports it does not appear that these data were often collected. Micturition diaries were commonly used to record numbers of leakage episodes and numbers of micturitions over varying lengths of time. In order to combine these data in a meta-analysis, the number of leakage episodes and number of micturitions in 24 hours were calculated.</P>
<P>Urodynamic measures and adverse events were the two most commonly reported secondary outcomes of interest. A wide range of urodynamic measures were reported. In view of the lack of correlation between urodynamic measures and clinical outcome the data were not abstracted for this review.</P>
<P>Measures of quality of life were reported in seven trials (<LINK REF="STD-Chapple-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Chapple 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dorschner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dorschner 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dmochowski-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dmochowski 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Homma-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Homma 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khullar-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Khullar 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VanKerrebroeck-2001" TYPE="STUDY">VanKerrebroeck 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zinner-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zinner 2004</LINK>).

Chapple (<LINK REF="STD-Chapple-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Chapple 2004a</LINK>) also reported on quality life using the Contilife score. `</P>
<P>In order to use the data from crossover trials in a meta-analysis it must be presented as the mean and standard deviation of the difference between two treatments for continuous data, or a two-by-two table for binary data, as the correlation between measurements on the same individual may be important. Only two of the 19 crossover trials presented data in this way (<LINK REF="STD-Kramer-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kramer 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Riva-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Riva 1984</LINK>) and then only for one outcome each, so the data could not be used in this way. The data were, therefore, discussed narratively and this is reported in the Results section after the analyses of the parallel-arm trials. In studies, where medians were reported (<LINK REF="STD-Landis-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Landis 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zinner-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zinner 2004</LINK>), data could not be used in the meta-analysis and were reported in separate data tables.</P>

<P>The methodological quality of the published studies was assessed by looking at the methods of generation of random allocation, concealment of allocation, blinding of the trial participants and investigators, completeness of treatment, withdrawals and dropouts and loss to follow up.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Randomisation, allocation concealment and blinding</HEADING>
<P>The method of group allocation was rarely described. Double blinding should adequately conceal group allocation but this is not guaranteed. For the purposes of the review, trials that stated group allocation was 'double-blind' were coded as having adequate concealment. All trials but two (<LINK REF="STD-Wehnert-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Wehnert 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wehnert-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Wehnert 1992</LINK>) were double blind and therefore considered to have adequate allocation concealment.</P>
<P>Few trials specifically stated that outcome assessors were blind to group allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Burgio-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Burgio 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goode-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Goode 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Homma-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Homma 2003</LINK>). Some trials stated the code was broken at the completion of the study and in some it was specified as after the analysis. This would imply that the final measurement was done blinded. A recent study by DuBeau et al suggests that double-blind designs might not be adequate to blind participants to anticholinergic versus placebo allocation, emphasising the importance of blinded outcome assessors (<LINK REF="REF-DuBeau-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">DuBeau 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Baseline comparability of the groups was not mentioned in seven of the parallel-group trials (<LINK REF="STD-Chaliha-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chaliha 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goode-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Goode 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Halaska-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Halaska 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Homma-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Homma 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Junemann-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Junemann 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Junemann-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Junemann 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wein-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Wein 1978</LINK>).

Very few parallel design trials included any follow up beyond the initial assessment of outcome. In those trials that did follow up participants this was for short periods of time, that is one week (<LINK REF="STD-VanKerrebroeck-2001" TYPE="STUDY">VanKerrebroeck 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zinner-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zinner 2002</LINK>) or two weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Abrams-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Abrams 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Drutz-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Drutz 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jacquetin-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Jacquetin 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Malone_x002d_Lee-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Malone-Lee 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rentzhog-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Rentzhog 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ulshofer-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ulshofer 2001</LINK>). Some trials did follow up participants longer term but this was not blinded and by this stage everyone had been offered active treatment. Long term follow up is not relevant for crossover trials: by the nature of their design crossover trials can only address short-term effects during treatment.</P>
<P>The primary or only reference for nine of the 60 included trials was a conference abstract (<LINK REF="STD-Abrams-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Abrams 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Abrams-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Abrams 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chaliha-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chaliha 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Junemann-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Junemann 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Junemann-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Junemann 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Murray-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Murray 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosario-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Rosario 1995a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosario-1995b" TYPE="STUDY">Rosario 1995b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tago-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Tago 1990</LINK>) and all of these trials were complete at the time of reporting. Full publications were not found for any of these trials with subsequent searching. All abstracts reported limited details of methods, and few results.</P>
<P>Some of the large multi-centre and multinational trials were reported in multiple publications. These publications usually presented subsets of the main trial results (for example data from one country) and subsequent publications rarely provided further methodological detail. The most notable example is VanKerrebroeck (<LINK REF="STD-VanKerrebroeck-2001" TYPE="STUDY">VanKerrebroeck 2001</LINK>); 14 separate reports were identified. Where there were multiple publications of the same trial a primary reference was selected and has been cited throughout the review for simplicity.</P>

<P>Three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Burgio-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Burgio 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chapple-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Chapple 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dmochowski-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dmochowski 2003</LINK>) reported the number of leakage episodes in 24 hours after treatment. Chapple and Dmochowski also reported change data but this data was not entered in the analysis, only data for average number of leakage episodes in 24 hours after treatment was used. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Zinner-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zinner 2002</LINK>) reported number of leakage episodes per week and this was converted to data for 24 hours and combined with the other three trials. Those in the anticholinergic drug groups had approximately 0.38 leakage episodes less per 24 hours than those taking placebo medication (WMD for leakage episodes in 24 hours -0.38, 95% CI -0.63 to -0.13, P=0.003, outcome 01.02).</P>

When the two subgroups are combined (number of leakage episodes in 24 hours and change in leakage episodes) the result (WMD -0.51; 95% CI -0.66 to -0.37) shows on average a reduction in leakage episodes of around three to five per week.

Due to the fact that multiple domains in quality of life are reported we have chosen to report 99% confidence intervals. Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Dmochowski-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dmochowski 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zinner-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zinner 2004</LINK>) used the IIQ questionnaire, when combined they showed a statistically significant difference for 'travel', favouring anticholinergics (WMD -7.27, 95% CI -11.07 to -3.48). Zinner found statistically significant differences for social life and emotional health, favouring anticholinergics. Dmochowski found a statistically significant difference for global health assessment of disease state, also favouring medication.</P>

The drug dose in the two former trials was 20 mg trospium twice daily, while the latter used 15 mg three times a day; otherwise the trials were very similar with regard to method and study population.

<P>This review is the first of a series of Cochrane reviews of drug therapy for overactive bladder syndrome and it should be viewed in that context. Other reviews have considered or will consider: (1) whether different anticholinergic drugs have different effects (<LINK REF="REF-Hay_x002d_Smith-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hay-Smith 2005</LINK>); (2) whether anticholinergic drugs are better than other active (non-drug) therapies (<LINK REF="REF-Alhasso-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alhasso 2006</LINK>); and (3) whether anticholinergic drugs are better than other drug treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Dublin-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dublin 2004</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Principal findings </HEADING>
<P>In contrast to many other treatments for lower urinary tract dysfunction, there are a relatively large number of trials comparing anticholinergic drugs with placebo medication. Adults with overactive bladder were more likely to report cure or improvement when taking active anticholinergic treatment. However, it appears that treatment has a large placebo response with 41% of people in the placebo groups reporting cure or improvement in symptoms. The additional benefit of active treatment was about 15% more improved or cured (equivalent to a number needed to treat of seven). The difference between the groups in micturitions and leakage episodes after treatment is statistically significant. All the trials included in the formal analysis showed a reduction in micturitions and leakage episodes in both active treatment and placebo groups. The difference in improvement between anticholinergic and placebo medication groups was on average about four less leakage episodes and five less voids per week in favour of anticholinergics. While the difference between the groups in micturitions and leakage episodes after treatment is statistically significant (the confidence intervals are tight), the issue is their clinical significance.</P>
<P>Although the data are still limited, this update contains more information about quality of life (for example <LINK REF="STD-Chapple-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Chapple 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khullar-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Khullar 2004</LINK>). Where data are available, they favour the medication group and are highly statistically significant. The key issue, then, is whether the differences are clinically important and useful to patients. Pleil and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Pleil-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pleil 2005</LINK>) related changes in the King's Health Questionnaire to patients perceptions of benefit: firstly if they perceived a benefit from treatment and if so, secondly, whether they perceived it as 'a little' or 'much' benefit. Generally speaking, our estimates lie somewhat below the change scores of patients who described their benefit as 'a little' but with overlapping confidence intervals. This suggests that the changes observed in leakage episodes and voiding frequency do have a broader impact to improve health, but on average the benefits are modest.</P>
<P>The drugs do, however, have adverse effects. While there was no significant difference in the number of people withdrawing from the active and placebo treatment arms due to adverse events the confidence interval is compatible with up to a third withdrawing due to medication (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.36). Dry mouth was a side effect reported by many trial participants. This was not surprising as dry mouth is the most widely experienced side effect of anticholinergic therapy. The risk of dry mouth in the active treatment groups increased three fold, depending on the type of medication. Two trials in elderly populations, both comparing oxybutynin chloride with placebo, seemed to report high rates of dry mouth compared with trials in other populations. Elderly people are often taking a number of medications and the higher rates of dry mouth in both active treatment and placebo groups might be related to other concurrent therapy. Aside from this, there were no obvious differences in the outcomes for elderly patients.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Limitations</HEADING>
<P>In general, the reported methods of the trials were of moderate to high quality. Overall the reporting of many trials was poor with many not even reporting the age, sex or concurrent medications of the participants. This may be important as age and polypharmacy are independent predictors of dry mouth, the main adverse side effect of anticholinergics. However, the methods of group allocation were rarely given in sufficient detail to be sure that group allocation was adequately concealed. Only one trial blinded outcome assessors. The reporting of group allocation of dropouts and/or reasons for withdrawal was adequate in less than half the trials. Crossover trials were usually poorly reported. In order to be included in a meta-analysis the results from crossover trials for continuous variables must be reported as a difference in means together with either the standard deviation, standard error or 95% confidence interval of that difference. This does coincide with what is of clinical interest, but can become complex when there are more than two treatments. Dichotomous outcomes should be reported so that it is clear whether the events on each treatment occurred in the same or different people. Only two of the nineteen crossover trials reported outcomes in this manner, but they were not consistent in the outcomes that were reported.</P>
<P>In view of the substantial number of trials it is disappointing that it was not possible to combine more data. There was considerable variation in outcomes chosen to be reported, and also variation in how the same outcome was measured and reported. Relatively few trials sought the patient's opinion on satisfaction with, and acceptability of, treatment and these are important factors in the choice of management. Only seven relatively recent trials addressed quality of life, and none reported socioeconomic outcomes. These areas need to be addressed in future research. In view of the lack of validated 'normal' values and the lack of correlation between urodynamic findings and clinical outcome, the emphasis on urodynamic measures should be re-evaluated, and we have chosen to remove these data from this update.</P>
<P>None of the included trials reported results for those with frequency and/or urgency alone separately from those with urge incontinence. A number of trials included men and women, but did not report outcome separately by sex so it was difficult to investigate possible differences in effects between the sexes.</P>
<P>We decided to combine the data from all the active anticholinergic treatment arms in trials where there was more than one drug or more than one dose of the same drug being compared. It is possible that some medications are more effective than others but that this was not seen in the formal comparisons. However, direct comparisons of different anticholinergic therapies, and comparisons of different doses of the same therapy, will be investigated in a separate review (<LINK REF="REF-Hay_x002d_Smith-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hay-Smith 2005</LINK>).<BR/>
<B>
<I>
<BR/>
</I>
</B>One of the limitations of the review is that many trials do not contribute to the meta-analyses. Those that do may or may not be a biased selection of the population of primary trials. In addition, despite comprehensive searching not all trials may have been located. Data were combined from primary trials recruiting on different criteria or using different drugs in various doses. These factors may influence the estimates of effect in this review. Examination of the graphs shows, however, that the effects are generally consistent across the included trials that did contribute. It proved difficult to explore the reasons on the few occasions where heterogeneity was observed. The best way to address these concerns would be to perform an individual patient data meta-analysis. Many more trials would then contribute to the analysis. In addition the effect of confounders (such as age, cause of overactive bladder) could be investigated.</P>
<P>In general, many of the included trials had the characteristics of explanatory rather than pragmatic trials. Explanatory trials, also known as efficacy trials, address the question 'can this therapy work?'. Efficacy studies tend to have strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, a comparison of therapy versus placebo, short-term outcomes, measure surrogate rather than patient centred outcomes (for example urodynamics rather than quality of life) and take place in centres of clinical excellence. Their results are commonly used to support applications for drug regulatory approval. In contrast, pragmatic trials, also known as effectiveness trials, address the question 'does this therapy work?'. Effectiveness studies are characterised by large, more heterogeneous samples, comparisons with standard care, less restrictive inclusion/exclusion criteria, and long-term patient-centred outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Roland-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roland 1998</LINK>). Their results inform the choice of management in everyday clinical settings.</P>
<P>All the included trials were of short duration and measured outcome at the end of treatment. Therefore outcome was measured when the effects of treatment were likely to be at their maximum. Anticholinergics are unlikely to cure overactive bladder syndrome, so the long term effects of treatment are of most clinical interest. Some trials have continued with open-label follow up. The interpretation of these is difficult, not only because of the use of active treatment by those originally allocated placebo but also because of the number of overlapping pooled analyses published, based on different numbers of primary studies. In a follow up of a single study, it was found that 71% of patients completed 12 months of open label follow up on extended release tolterodine (<LINK REF="REF-van-Kerrebroeck-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Kerrebroeck 2001</LINK>). In contrast, Lawrence et al (2000) audited a pharmaceutical database in the USA and reported that less than a third of people continued to fill out prescriptions for either immediate release tolterodine or immediate release oxybutynin six months after the first prescription, although the use of oxybutynin was discontinued faster than tolterodine (<LINK REF="REF-Lawrence-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawrence 2000</LINK>). This may represent the differences between people prescribed anticholinergics in a trial versus a more typical care setting.</P>
<P>Pharmaceutical companies are continuing to develop anticholinergic drugs. Some drugs are no longer in widespread clinical use (for example emepronium ) and others have been withdrawn from the market (for example terodiline). Alternative delivery systems (such as transdermal, slow-release preparations) and new drugs (for example darifenacin) are becoming available, which may be more effective or have fewer side effects, or both due to adverse effects.</P>
<P>It is worth noting that 21 of the 61 trials declared pharmaceutical company support (<LINK REF="STD-Abrams-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Abrams 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bagger-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Bagger 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cardozo-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Cardozo 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chapple-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Chapple 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coombes-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Coombes 1996</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Davila-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Davila 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dorschner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dorschner 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Drutz-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Drutz 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Homma-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Homma 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jacquetin-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Jacquetin 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meyhoff-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Meyhoff 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moisey-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Moisey 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moore-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rentzhog-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Rentzhog 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Szonyi-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Szonyi 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tapp-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Tapp 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thuroff-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Thuroff 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ulshofer-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ulshofer 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VanKerrebroeck-1998" TYPE="STUDY">VanKerrebroeck 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VanKerrebroeck-2001" TYPE="STUDY">VanKerrebroeck 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walter-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Walter 1982</LINK>). This support ranged from the supply of active and placebo tablets (in blinded packaging) through to full funding and data analysis. None of the remaining trials made any statement about the absence or presence of company involvement. Two trials were funded by grants from health research bodies (<LINK REF="STD-Burgio-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Burgio 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zorzitto-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Zorzitto 1989</LINK>). In other settings, meta-analyses comparing findings from drug company funded studies with non-drug company funded trials have found that the outcomes of company funded studies are more favourable to the new treatment, although this is not always the case. In general, in this review, the trials supported by companies were well reported and appeared to be of better methodological quality. Their limitations are that, for understandable reasons, they addressed issues of efficacy and safety rather than clinical and cost effectiveness.</P>
<P>This review provides clear evidence of efficacy and of the likelihood of adverse effects, particularly dry mouth. Newer trials suggest that the positive effects are translated into improved quality of life while medication continues, at least on average. However, there is very little evidence about the long-term effects of medication. This applies to fixed length courses of treatment and to continued treatment for an indefinite period of time, both during treatment and after it has stopped. Addressing these issues requires a shift in the research agenda to more pragmatic trial designs.</P>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The administration of anticholinergic drugs for overactive bladder syndrome results in statistically significant differences compared to placebo medication. Those receiving anticholinergic therapy were more likely to report cure or improvement of symptoms, and a reduction in leakage episodes (about four per week) and voids (about five per week). Evidence from more recently reported trials indicates modestly improved quality of life too. There was a marked placebo response, however. When counseling those with overactive bladder syndrome, these benefits need to be balanced with the risk of side effects, notably dry mouth. Depending on the type of medication being offered, the risk of dry mouth is increased by three times.</P>
<P>The only long-term follow up comes from open-label studies, with anticholinergic therapy offered to all trial participants regardless of their original allocation to active or placebo treatment. The short duration of most trials and the lack of long-term follow up gives little information about the long-term effects and acceptability of anticholinergic therapy. </P>
<P>Cost-effectiveness was also not addressed. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>To allow the results of trials to be considered together most usefully, future research in overactive bladder syndrome should incorporate standardised, validated outcome and quality of life measures that are relevant to those with an overactive bladder. Particular attention needs to be paid to the patient perception of change and satisfaction with outcome, quality of life, and economic outcomes. The current emphasis on urodynamic measures needs to be redressed. Reporting of the methods of group allocation and the description of dropouts needs to be improved; outcome assessors should be masked to group allocation. The reporting of crossover trials needs to be dramatically improved if they are to add anything to the body of knowledge about these drugs.</P>
<P>As anticholinergic drugs are unlikely to be curative, sustained success is likely to depend on people continuing to take them. Trials are needed to assess the long-term usefulness of these drugs.</P>
<P>Both oxybutynin and tolterodine have been compared with placebo in a number of trials. For these drugs it seems that priority should be given to research in subgroups that might benefit most, or who have previously been excluded from trials. In addition, all drugs need to be tested in large pragmatic trials. Nearly all the included trials used oral administration of medication. Further research would also be useful to investigate whether the magnitude of effect changes with different delivery systems (for example skin patches or slow-release preparations) would also be useful. Another Cochrane review comparing anticholinergics with each other will address these questions (<LINK REF="REF-Hay_x002d_Smith-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hay-Smith 2005</LINK>). Intravesical administration has potential as it delivers the drug directly to the desired site of action, thus eliminating some troublesome anticholinergic side effects but would only be clinically useful if intravesical administration could be made easier. In our view, placebo-controlled trials should be confined to testing the short-term efficacy and safety of new anticholinergic therapies.</P>
<P>The reliability and hence value of this review would be greatly enhanced if data from more trials could be incorporated in an individual patient data meta-analysis. </P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<P>Dear Authors<BR/>&gt;<BR/>&gt; With regards to the above reference, we believe that the study <BR/>&gt; characteristics quoted on pages 27?28 do not appear to correlate to <BR/>&gt; those in the published paper. Whereas the study cited in the review <BR/>&gt; investigated only solifenacin, with tolterodine as a comparator, the <BR/>&gt; characteristics quoted include details about another anticholinergic <BR/>&gt; compound, darifenacin, implying that this compound was included for <BR/>&gt; comparison in the study.<BR/>&gt; It<BR/>&gt; seems possible that a second paper by Chapple et al, reporting on the <BR/>&gt; efficacy of darifenacin, has been included in the description of the <BR/>&gt; study characteristics by mistake (this second paper, entitled ?A <BR/>&gt; pooled analysis of three phase III studies to investigate the <BR/>&gt; efficacy, tolerability and safety of darifenacin, a muscarinic M3 <BR/>&gt; selective receptor antagonist, in the treatment of overactive bladder? <BR/>&gt; (BJU 2005;95(7):993-1001), discusses two doses of darifenacin (7.5 mg, <BR/>&gt; n=337 and 15 mg, n=334) versus placebo (n=388)).<BR/>&gt;<BR/>&gt; We would therefore like to request a review of the text on pages 27 ?<BR/>&gt; 28,<BR/>&gt; and a potential amendment to the study characteristics as necessary.<BR/>&gt; In addition, as quality of life (QoL) data is not discussed in either <BR/>&gt; of the above papers by Chapple et al, statements such as ?QoL data <BR/>&gt; reported favours solifenacin? in the table of study characteristics <BR/>&gt; are potentially misleading to the reader.<BR/>&gt; We look forward to your review of the text and modification of the <BR/>&gt; study characteristics table.</P>
