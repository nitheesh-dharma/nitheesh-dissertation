<P>
<B>What is tuberculous meningitis and how might corticosteroids work?</B>
</P>
<P>Tuberculous meningitis is a serious form of tuberculosis that affects the meninges that cover the brain and spinal cord, causing headache, coma and death. The clinical outcome is often poor even when people with tuberculous meningitis are treated with antituberculous drugs.</P>
<P>Corticosteroids are commonly used in addition to antituberculous drugs for treating people with the condition. These drugs help reduce inflammation of the surface of the brain and associated blood vessels, and are thought to decrease pressure inside the brain, and thus reduce the risk of death. Some clinicians are concerned that corticosteroids may improve survival, but result in more severely disabled survivors.</P>
<P>
<B>What the evidence shows</B>
</P>
<P>We examined the evidence published up to 18 March 2016 and included nine trials with 1337 people that evaluated either dexamethasone, methylprednisolone, or prednisolone given in addition to antituberculous drugs; one trial was of high quality, while the other trials had uncertainties over study quality due to incomplete reporting.</P>
<P>The analysis shows that corticosteroids reduce the risk of death by a quarter at two months to two years after treatment was started (<I>high quality evidence</I>). Corticosteroids make little or no difference to the number of people who survive TB meningitis with brain damage causing disability (<I>low quality evidence</I>); because this event is uncommon, even taking the most pessimistic estimate from the analysis of a slight increased risk with corticosteroids means this would not be quantitatively important when compared to the reduction in deaths.</P>
<P>One trial followed up participants for five years, by which time there was no difference in the effect on death between the two groups, although the reason for this change over time is unknown.</P>
<P>Only one trial evaluated the effects of corticosteroids in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive people but the number is small so we are not sure if the benefits in terms of fewer deaths are preserved in this group of patients.</P>

<P>We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register up to the 18 March 2016; CENTRAL; MEDLINE; EMBASE; LILACS; and Current Controlled Trials. We also contacted researchers and organizations working in the field, and checked reference lists.</P>

<P>Randomized controlled trials that compared corticosteroid plus antituberculous treatment with antituberculous treatment alone in people with clinically diagnosed tuberculous meningitis and included death or disability as outcome measures.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-04-06 10:18:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We independently assessed search results and methodological quality, and extracted data from the included trials. We analysed the data using risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and used a fixed-effect model. We performed an intention-to-treat analysis, where we included all participants randomized to treatment in the denominator. This analysis assumes that all participants who were lost to follow-up have good outcomes. We carried out a sensitivity analysis to explore the impact of the missing data.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-04-06 10:19:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nine trials that included 1337 participants (with 469 deaths) met the inclusion criteria.</P>
<P>At follow-up from three to 18 months, steroids reduce deaths by almost one quarter (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.87; nine trials, 1337 participants, <I>high quality evidence</I>). Disabling neurological deficit is not common in survivors, and steroids may have little or no effect on this outcome (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.20; eight trials, 1314 participants, <I>low quality evidence</I>). There was no difference between groups in the incidence of adverse events, which included gastrointestinal bleeding, invasive bacterial infections, hyperglycaemia, and liver dysfunction.</P>
<P>One trial followed up participants for five years. The effect on death was no longer apparent at this time-point (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.12; one trial, 545 participants, <I>moderate quality evidence); </I>and there was no difference in disabling neurological deficit detected (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.69; one trial, 545 participants, <I>low quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>One trial included human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive people. The stratified analysis by HIV status in this trial showed no heterogeneity, with point estimates for death (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.20; one trial, 98 participants) and disability (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.08 to 19.07; one trial, 98 participants) similar to HIV-negative participants in the same trial.</P>

<P>Corticosteroids reduce mortality from tuberculous meningitis, at least in the short term.</P>
<P>Corticosteroids may have no effect on the number of people who survive tuberculous meningitis with disabling neurological deficit, but this outcome is less common than death, and the CI for the relative effect includes possible harm. However, this small possible harm is unlikely to be quantitatively important when compared to the reduction in mortality.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-03-29 13:10:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Tuberculous meningitis is an inflammation of the meninges, which are membranes that envelope a person's brain and the spinal cord. It is caused by infection with one of several mycobacterial species that belong to the <I>Mycobacterium tuberculosis </I>complex, which are responsible for tuberculosis (TB) disease. Tuberculous meningitis is a severe form of TB and accounts for many deaths (<LINK REF="REF-Tandon-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tandon 1988</LINK>). It is a form of extrapulmonary TB (that is, TB that occurs outside the lungs). The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that 0.8 million of the 5.4 million new TB cases reported worldwide in 2013 were extrapulmonary cases (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2014</LINK>). There is an association between extrapulmonary TB and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, particularly in people with low CD4 cell counts (<LINK REF="REF-Naing-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naing 2013</LINK>). It appears that the higher risk of TB infection in HIV-positive people means that tuberculous meningitis is also more common in this group (<LINK REF="REF-Berenguer-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berenguer 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Berger-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berger 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>People with tuberculous meningitis usually present with headache, fever, vomiting, altered conscious level, and sometimes convulsions. It is diagnosed clinically, with confirmation by microscopy and culture of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) or a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. The low sensitivity of the diagnostic tests currently available presents a particular challenge for clinicians, especially when treating children and HIV-positive people. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment are the main determinants of a good outcome in people with tuberculous meningitis (<LINK REF="REF-Thwaites-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thwaites 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>The causes of death and disability in tuberculous meningitis are multifactorial. The main pathological mechanisms are persistent or progressive raised intracranial pressure with or without hydrocephalus, involvement of the optic nerves or optic chiasm leading to visual deficit, cranial neuropathies, arachnoiditis, and vasculitis of the cerebral blood vessels leading to stroke. Neurological disability related to antituberculous treatment may occur due to optic neuritis related to ethambutol or isoniazid, which sometimes causes permanent loss of vision, or isoniazid-related peripheral neuropathy.</P>
<P>Tuberculous meningitis can be classified according to its severity. The British Medical Research Council (MRC) staging system categorizes patients into three stages (<LINK REF="REF-MRC-1948" TYPE="REFERENCE">MRC 1948</LINK>): stage I (mild cases) for those without altered consciousness or focal neurological signs; stage II (moderately advanced cases) for those with altered consciousness who are not comatose and those with moderate neurological deficits (for example, single cranial nerve palsies, paraparesis, and hemiparesis); and stage III (severe cases) for comatose patients and those with multiple cranial nerve palsies, and hemiplegia or paraplegia, or both.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-04-06 10:20:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Without anti-tuberculous treatment, people with tuberculous meningitis die (<LINK REF="REF-Tandon-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tandon 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thwaites-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thwaites 2002</LINK>). Streptomycin, one of the earliest antituberculous drugs to be introduced, reportedly reduced the case-fatality rate to 63% (<LINK REF="REF-Parsons-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parsons 1988</LINK>). Newer antituberculous drugs &#8722; isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol &#8722; are associated with better survival, but mortality remains comparatively high. Reports of mortality rates vary from 20% to 32%, and permanent neurological deficits in an additional 5% to 40% of people who survive tuberculous meningitis (<LINK REF="REF-Ramchandran-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramchandran 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Alarc_x00f3_n-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alarcón 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jacobs-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobs 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jacobs-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobs 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Indirect evidence from animal studies provides a biological basis for how corticosteroids could be effective (<LINK REF="REF-Feldman-1958" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feldman 1958</LINK>). They may decrease inflammation, especially in the subarachnoid space; reduce cerebral and spinal cord oedema, and intracranial pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Feldman-1958" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feldman 1958</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parsons-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parsons 1988</LINK>); and reduce inflammation of small blood vessels, and damage due to blood flow slowing to the underlying brain tissue. However, corticosteroids could also cause harm by suppressing the person's immune system. They may suppress the symptoms of TB infection but promote an unchecked growth of the bacteria and an increased bacterial load, and reduce inflammation of the meninges, which will then reduce the ability of drugs to cross the blood-brain barrier and enter the subarachnoid space. Other adverse effects of corticosteroids include gastrointestinal haemorrhage, electrolyte imbalance, hyperglycaemia, hypertension, and increased risk of infections from other pathogens (<LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Arcy_x002d_Hart-1950" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Arcy-Hart 1950</LINK>).</P>
<P>The use of adjunctive corticosteroids is not known to result in disability in tuberculous meningitis, especially when used for short periods of time as is the case in most clinical trials of this intervention. However, there is concern that although corticosteroids may save the lives of some people who have severe tuberculous meningitis, they may not necessarily improve their quality of life, as some people may survive but be left with a severe disability, rendering them bed-bound and highly dependent. In other words, if corticosteroids increase the survival rate but not disability-free survival, then corticosteroids might actually increase a person's suffering.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-03-29 13:11:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been conducted on the effect of corticosteroids in managing people with tuberculous meningitis. The conclusions from these trials, seen individually, appear inconsistent. One trial, <LINK REF="STD-Thwaites-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Thwaites 2004</LINK>, showed that dexamethasone increases survival rate. However, it also raised two questions: do people who survive because of dexamethasone therapy tend to be left with severe disability, and are there differential effects among subgroups of people with different degrees of disease severity? The editorial that accompanied the trial, <LINK REF="STD-Quagliarello-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Quagliarello 2004</LINK>, and several letters to the editor in response to this trial (<LINK REF="STD-Marras-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Marras 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seligman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Seligman 2005</LINK>) commented that the trial did not have sufficient statistical power to answer these questions. We have prepared a meta-analysis that synthesizes the results from all available RCTs to try and provide the necessary power to address these questions.</P>

<P>For death, we assessed all included trials as at low risk of bias, apart from <LINK REF="STD-Girgis-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Girgis 1991</LINK>. We considered that all-cause death was unlikely to be affected by risk of bias relating to outcome assessment, and therefore we assessed included trials as at low risk of bias regardless of blinding of outcome assessors for this outcome. We assessed <LINK REF="STD-Girgis-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Girgis 1991</LINK> as having unclear risk of bias because this trial reported death as a case fatality rate, meaning that death was attributed specifically to tuberculous meningitis.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcome at five years</HEADING>
<P>Only one recently published trial, <LINK REF="STD-Thwaites-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Thwaites 2004</LINK>, reported the long-term outcome of people with tuberculous meningitis randomized to receive either dexamethasone or placebo. The primary long-term outcome was survival during the five years follow-up, while secondary outcomes were status of disability and TB relapse. Fifty participants (9.4%) were lost to follow-up by the end of the follow-up period. The participants in the dexamethasone arm fared better on two-year survival rate (0.63 versus 0.55; risk difference 0.8, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.16; P = 0.07), but this advantage was lost at five years (0.54 versus 0.51; risk difference 0.03, 95% CI &#8722;0.06 to 0.12; P = 0.51). Analysis of hazard ratios by stage of disease at presentation suggested that benefit of dexamethasone in MRC stage I disease tended to persist longer with five-year probability of survival being 0.69 versus 0.55 (risk difference 0.14, 95% CI &#8722;0.01 to 0.29; P = 0.07). However, the test of interaction between disease severity and effect size was not statistically significant (P = 0.46 for zero to three months and P = 0.18 after three months). For disability, the follow-up study reported similar numbers with severe persistent neurological disability in both the steroid and non-steroid groups.</P>

<P>We explored whether heterogeneity was explained within two main pre-specified subgroups.</P>
<P>For severity of illness, we stratified the results on death by the severity of illness (MRC stages I, II, and III) in <LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK>. The effect of corticosteroids appeared to be consistent across all stages of the disease although the analysis is relatively underpowered (stage I RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.85; six trials, 305 participants); stage II (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.93; seven trials, 581 participants); and stage III (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.88; eight trials, 651 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>For HIV status, one trial specifically mentioned that 98 of the included participants were HIV-positive (<LINK REF="STD-Thwaites-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Thwaites 2004</LINK>). Analyses stratifying the outcomes of death and disabling neurological deficit did not detect any large differences, and so showed no apparent effect of HIV status on the effect estimates, but the analysis is underpowered (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-08" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 8</LINK>).</P>

We performed a worst case scenario analysis, assuming that all participants lost to follow-up in the corticosteroid group died while those in the control group survived (<LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>). Under this extreme assumption, there was still a reduction in deaths with corticosteroids (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.96), and the estimate was similar to the available case analysis (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.86).

For five trials where the outcomes were not clearly specified in the methods section, we assessed the risk of reporting bias as unclear. We assessed three trials as at low risk of reporting bias as all outcomes specified in the protocol or methods were reported (<LINK REF="STD-Schoeman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Schoeman 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thwaites-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Thwaites 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Malhotra-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Malhotra 2009</LINK>). We assessed one trial as at high risk of bias, as outcome definitions were changed in the reported data (unpublished), and adverse events were not reported (<LINK REF="STD-Prasad-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Prasad 2006</LINK>).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-04-06 10:25:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>See 'Summary of findings' table 1 (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Nine trials met the inclusion criteria. At follow-up from 2 to 24 months, steroids reduce deaths by one quarter. Disabling neurological deficit is less common in survivors, and steroids may have little or no effect on this outcome; even taking the upper confidence limit of 20% increased risk, this is probably not quantitatively important when compared to the reduced mortality. There was no difference between groups in the incidence of adverse events, which included gastrointestinal bleeding, invasive bacterial infections, hyperglycaemia and hepatitis, although adverse events were not reported in all studies.</P>
<P>One trial followed up participants for five years. The effect on death and was no longer apparent at this time-point, and there was no difference in disabling neurological deficit detected.</P>
<P>One trial included human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive people. The stratified analysis by HIV status in this trial showed no heterogeneity, with point estimates for death similar to HIV-negative participants in the same trial.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-04-06 10:25:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The trials included male and female children and adults, most of whom were HIV-negative. <LINK REF="STD-Thwaites-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Thwaites 2004</LINK> reported that they included 98 HIV-positive participants, but they did not stratify the randomization for this subgroup; therefore the results for this subgroup should be interpreted with caution. The effect of corticosteroids was not significantly different between HIV-positive and HIV-negative participants, but the trial lacked the power to detect such a difference if one did exist due to the low number of HIV-positive participants.</P>
<P>Though the included trials varied in their use of bacteriological confirmation of diagnosis, there is reasonable evidence to suggest that the trial participants had tuberculous meningitis. Moreover, the intention-to-treat analysis in clinically diagnosed participants provides assurance that use of corticosteroids on the basis of clinical diagnosis does more good than harm. This is important because the decision to use corticosteroids is usually taken on a purely clinical basis when culture reports are unavailable and it is the balance of benefit and risk of such a decision that needs to be determined to set a clinical policy. The proportion of confirmed cases is mentioned only to provide confidence in the clinical diagnosis made by the investigators. Separate analysis of culture-positive cases is probably less relevant for clinical decision making.</P>
<P>All included trials were conducted in high TB burden settings, in specialist referral hospitals.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-04-06 10:26:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence for the two primary outcomes at two to 24 months follow-up, and at five years follow-up (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>We graded the quality of the estimate of effect for the outcome death at two to 24 months follow-up as high. We assessed the estimate of effect as being at low risk of bias, as while there are some included trials that did not clearly report on the randomization method or allocation concealment, or both, the two largest included trials had few concerns and showed a consistent effect. The trials provided evidence of benefit for all age groups. Although only one trial reported on outcomes for people living with HIV, there was no obvious qualitative heterogeneity. We did not find any serious imprecision. We graded the estimate of effect for death at five years follow-up as moderate, and downgraded by one for indirectness as the data came from a single trial conducted in a high quality healthcare unit in a setting with high levels of endemic infectious diseases and poverty.</P>
<P>We assessed the quality of the estimate of effect for the outcome disabling neurological deficit as low quality. The lack of blinding of outcome assessors of disabling neurological deficit in four of the eight trials reporting this outcome led us to downgrade the quality of evidence by one for risk of bias. There was imprecision of this estimate relating to the small number of events, which led us to downgrade by one. We graded the estimate of effect for disabling neurological deficit at five years follow-up as very low quality, and downgraded by one for indirectness as the data was from a single trial (as for the outcome death, see above) and by two for imprecision as there were few events and the CI ranged from substantive harms to substantive benefits of corticosteroids.</P>

<P>We have attempted to limit bias in the review process. The Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Information Specialist conducted the literature search, and it is unlikely that these searches missed any major trials; however, we cannot rule out the possibility that we missed some small unpublished trials. The funnel plot did not assist with this because there were too few included trials. To limit bias in the trial selection process and data extraction, we independently examined the search results, determined study selection, and extracted data.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-03-29 13:11:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Several TB guidelines recommend the use of corticosteroids as an adjunct to treatment of TB meningitis internationally (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-BSI-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">BSI 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-SNHS-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">SNHS 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Questions remain about the mechanism by which corticosteroids improve clinical outcomes, and advances in understanding of these mechanisms have led to a suggestion that some people may benefit from corticosteroids while others do not, and some may even be adversely affected by steroids (<LINK REF="REF-Thwaites-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thwaites 2013</LINK>). Leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of mycobacterial infection through its effect on the equilibrium between pro- and anti-inflammatory eicosanoids. Tobin et al. showed that both low- and high-LTA4H expression zebrafish morphants show increased mycobacterial bacterial burden compared with wildtype controls (<LINK REF="REF-Tobin-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tobin 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tobin-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tobin 2012</LINK>). Low-LTA4H expression led to increased lipoxin A4 production and dampening of the early tissue necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#945;) response, and high-LTA4H morphants showed increased macrophage lysis despite early control of intracellular mycobacterial replication by TNF-&#945;, with subsequent extracellular mycobacterial growth. Both of these states led to uncontrolled mycobacterial replication. Thus, hypersusceptibility to mycobacterial infection is associated with both inadequate and excessive inflammatory responses.</P>
<P>The use of dexamethasone in the zebrafish morphants rescued high-LTA4H animals but led to increased susceptibility in low-LTA4H animals (<LINK REF="REF-Tobin-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tobin 2012</LINK>). In people, the LTA4H transcription level is regulated by a polymorphism in the gene promoter at SNP rs17525495, with rs17525495 TT associated with high LTA4H protein expression, rs17525495 CC associated with low expression, and rs17525495 CT intermediate expression. Genotyping performed on 182 participants from a series of clinical studies in Vietnam demonstrated that people with the TT genotype (high LTA4H, hyperinflammatory) had the highest mortality amongst participants who did not receive dexamethasone, but the lowest in the dexamethasone group; the people with the CC genotype (low LTA4H, hypoinflammatory) had the highest mortality in the dexamethasone group (<LINK REF="REF-Tobin-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tobin 2012</LINK>). These results suggest that LTA4H genotype may have an important influence on whether or not steroids are effective in tuberculous meningitis, at least in this population.</P>
<P>Further investigation into the relationship between LTA4H expression in people, dexamethasone use, and outcomes in people with TB meningitis is needed to determine whether dexamethasone use is associated with harm in the subset of people with LTA4H deficiency, and whether genotyping people for LTA4H at diagnosis is useful to guide treatment with corticosteroids. Other drugs that target parts of this inflammatory pathway, such as thalidomide, adulimumab and infliximab, have been used as rescue therapy in people with severe inflammatory complications of TB meningitis, but few clinical trials have been conducted on the use of these agents, and all these potent immunosuppressive drugs have the potential to cause harm as well as benefit (<LINK REF="REF-Schoeman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schoeman 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schoeman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schoeman 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schoeman-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schoeman 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jorge-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jorge 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lee-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Molton-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Molton 2015</LINK>).</P>

<P>There is high quality evidence of the benefit of corticosteroids in preventing death in people with tuberculous meningitis. This effect is probably attenuated over time, as five-year follow-up data from one trial suggests this, but there may be confounding factors leading to this observation. Corticosteroids appear to reduce mortality in people with TB meningitis, regardless of the British Medical Research Council (MRC) stage at presentation. Corticosteroids may have no effect on rates of disabling neurological deficit in people who survive TB meningitis, but the confidence interval around this estimate includes increased risk of this outcome. However, given the benefit associated with reduced risk of death, this is unlikely to be quantitatively important when considering whether or not to use corticosteroids in patients with TB meningitis. There is uncertainty about whether or not corticosteroids are beneficial for HIV-positive people with TB meningitis due to the lack of direct evidence in this group. Corticosteroids may not be associated with increased risk of adverse events, but there is uncertainty related to the limited reporting of adverse events in the included trials.</P>

<P>Further research is unlikely to add to certainty about the effect of corticosteroids in people with tuberculous meningitis who are HIV-negative in preventing death.</P>
<P>In people that are immunosuppressed, such as people living with HIV, it is unclear whether corticosteroids are of benefit. As corticosteroids could lead to greater risk of harm in these people, further research would be useful to provide clear guidance for treatment.</P>
<P>Another question that remains unanswered is the optimum choice of corticosteroid drug and dosing regimen. Given the fact that use of corticosteroids carries the risk of adverse events, and that many of these are dose-dependent, further research examining this question would be beneficial.</P>

<FOOTNOTES>
<P>
<SUP>1</SUP>Not downgraded for risk of bias. There are few uncertainties regarding allocation concealment or sequence generation in one of the two largest studies, but the largest trial was high quality and effects between these two trials were consistent.<BR/>
<SUP>2</SUP>Not downgraded for inconsistency: low statistical heterogeneity, and the forest plot shows a consistent benefit.<BR/>
<SUP>3</SUP>Not downgraded for indirectness in relation to age: all the participants in <LINK REF="STD-Schoeman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Schoeman 1997</LINK> and 59% of the participants in <LINK REF="STD-Girgis-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Girgis 1991</LINK> were children, and the effect is consistent with the other large trial, <LINK REF="STD-Thwaites-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Thwaites 2004</LINK>, which included participants aged 14 and over.<BR/>
<SUP>4</SUP>Not downgraded for indirectness for HIV status: one trial included 98 HIV-positive participants, with no obvious qualitative heterogeneity when compared to HIV-negative participants (<LINK REF="STD-Thwaites-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Thwaites 2004</LINK>). If making recommendations for HIV-positive participants only, a guidelines panel may wish to downgrade on indirectness.<BR/>
<SUP>5</SUP>Not downgraded for serious imprecision: the overall meta-analysis is adequately powered to detect this effect, but is only adequately powered when the trials at unclear or high risk of bias are included. The effect is clinically important.<BR/>
<SUP>6</SUP>Downgraded by one for risk of bias: four of the eight trials were at high risk of bias due to lack of blinding of outcome assessors, which could impact on the interpretation of assessments of disability.<BR/>
<SUP>7</SUP>Not downgraded for indirectness: trials included children, adults, some HIV-positive people, and people from different continents.<BR/>
<SUP>8</SUP>Downgraded by one for imprecision: effects range from clinically important benefits of 29% reduction to 20% increase in disability.<BR/>
<SUP>9</SUP>Not downgraded on risk of bias or imprecision: number of participants followed up was high: 91% at five years.<BR/>
<SUP>10</SUP>Downgraded by one for indirectness. This was a single trial conducted in a high quality health care unit in a population with high levels of infectious diseases endemicity and poverty. The attenuation of the effect may be less marked in populations with lower exposure to infectious diseases and other causes of reduced life expectancy associated with poverty. The authors were not able to establish the cause of death in most of the people who died after 9 months follow-up, and so it is not possible to assess whether these deaths were related to tuberculous meningitis or to other causes.<BR/>
<SUP>11</SUP>Not downgraded on risk of bias. Although the assessors were not blind to the allocation, and some assessments were conducted by telephone, the numbers of disabled participants in the two groups were the same, and it is unlikely that systematic bias in the observers is present.<BR/>
<SUP>12</SUP>Downgraded by two for imprecision. There were few events, and the confidence interval ranges from substantive harms to substantive benefits.<BR/>
