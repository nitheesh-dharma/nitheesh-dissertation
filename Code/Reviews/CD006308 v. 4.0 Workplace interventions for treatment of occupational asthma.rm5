<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-04-12 11:50:04 +0300" MODIFIED_BY="Jani H Ruotsalainen">
<P>Occupational asthma is the most frequently reported work-related respiratory disease in many countries. It is defined as asthma that is caused by a specific workplace exposure to certain substances and not to factors outside the workplace. In a recent review the population attributable risk for adult onset asthma being caused by occupational exposures was 17.6%. Occupational asthma can lead to decreased quality of life, sickness absence and increased costs for the patient, the employer and society. Early removal from exposure has been reported to be important in the prognosis of occupational asthma in a number of papers and reviews, but is not universally accepted as an important part of management.</P>
<P>Twenty-one articles were included in this review, reporting on 29 studies of three different interventions with 1447 participants. Fifteen studies compared workers that were removed from exposure to those who continued to be exposed. In another six studies, reduction of exposure was compared to continued exposure and in again another eight studies workers who were removed from exposure were compared to those for whom exposure was reduced. Outcomes were asthma symptoms and lung function at follow up. The overall quality of the studies was very low. Both removal from and reduction of exposure reduced asthma symptoms significantly but removal did better. Lung function improved significantly after removal but not after reduction of exposure. However, removal from exposure came at the cost of a much higher risk of unemployment and a greater decrease of income. Therefore, it remains uncertain how much better removal of exposure is compared to reduction of exposure and the benefit of symptom improvement should be balanced against the much higher risk of job loss and income decrease.</P>
<P>Further randomised controlled trials are needed to find out which interventions most effectively reduce the impact of occupational asthma.</P>

<P>We included 21 controlled before and after studies with 1447 participants that reported on 29 comparisons.</P>
<P>In 15 studies, removal from exposure was compared with continued exposure. Removal increased the likelihood of reporting absence of symptoms (risk ratio (RR) 21.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 7.20 to 63.77), improved forced expiratory volume (FEV1 %) (mean difference (MD) 5.52 percentage points, 95% CI 2.99 to 8.06) and decreased non-specific bronchial hyper-reactivity (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.67, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.21).</P>
<P>In six studies, reduction of exposure was compared with continued exposure. Reduction increased the likelihood of reporting absence of symptoms (RR 5.35, 95% CI 1.40 to 20.48) but did not affect FEV1 % (MD 1.18 percentage points, 95% CI -2.96 to 5.32).</P>
<P>In eight studies, removal from exposure was compared with reduction of exposure. Removal increased the likelihood of reporting absence of symptoms (RR 39.16, 95% CI 7.21 to 212.83) but did not affect FEV1 % (MD 1.16 percentage points, 95% CI -7.51 to 9.84).</P>
<P>Two studies reported that the risk of unemployment after removal from exposure was increased compared with reduction of exposure (RR 14.3, 95% CI 2.06 to 99.16). Three studies reported loss of income of about 25% after removal from exposure.</P>
<P>Overall the quality of the evidence was very low.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-04-12 11:43:07 +0300" MODIFIED_BY="Jani H Ruotsalainen">
<P>There is very low-quality evidence that removal from exposure improves asthma symptoms and lung function compared with continued exposure.</P>
<P>Reducing exposure also improves symptoms, but seems not as effective as complete removal.</P>
<P>However, removal from exposure is associated with an increased risk of unemployment, whereas reduction of exposure is not. The clinical benefit of removal from exposure or exposure reduction should be balanced against the increased risk of unemployment. We need better studies to identify which interventions intended to reduce exposure give most benefit.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-04-04 14:19:41 +0300" MODIFIED_BY="Jani H Ruotsalainen">
<P>Occupational asthma is the most frequently reported work-related respiratory disease in most countries where there are reporting schemes (<LINK REF="REF-Meredith-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meredith 1996</LINK>). One commonly-used definition is asthma that is caused by a specific workplace exposure to certain substances and not to factors outside the workplace (<LINK REF="REF-Bernstein-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernstein 1999</LINK>). In a recent review the population attributable risk (PAR) for adult onset asthma being caused by occupational exposures was 17.6% (<LINK REF="REF-Toren-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toren 2009</LINK>). Another study reported that 21% of all working asthma patients experience an aggravation of their symptoms due to work exposure at least weekly (<LINK REF="REF-Saarinen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saarinen 2003</LINK>). Data from surveillance schemes also suggest that there may be significant underreporting of occupational asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Cherry-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cherry 2009</LINK>). It has few specific features making it difficult to recognise; patients with occupational asthma do not always visit an occupational physician or chest physician, and those that do are not always diagnosed (<LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2000</LINK>). Occupational asthma can lead to decreased quality of life, sickness absence and increased costs for the patient, the employer and society.</P>
<P>Common causes of occupational asthma include exposure to high molecular weight (HMW) agents such as wheat, latex and animal proteins, or low molecular weight (LMW) agents such as diisocyanates, acid anhydrides, platinum salts and plicatic acid. Two types of occupational asthma are generally recognised: 1) irritant-induced (with no latency period and symptoms and signs most often reported as starting within 24 hours of a spill or other very high exposure to a respiratory irritant, for example, chlorine) and 2) sensitiser-induced (often caused by an allergen such as wheat or animal proteins with a latent period ranging from a few weeks to years) (<LINK REF="REF-Nicholson-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicholson 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Effective management of workers suspected to have occupational asthma requires the identification and investigation of symptoms suggestive of asthma soon after they occur (<LINK REF="REF-Nicholson-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicholson 2010</LINK>). A clear diagnosis usually requires a combination of investigations. (<LINK REF="REF-Beach-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beach 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>A number of interventions have been studied as a way of effectively managing individuals with occupational asthma, including removal from exposure by relocating to another workplace, or providing personal protective equipment (<LINK REF="REF-Ameille-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ameille 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Malo-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malo 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paggiaro-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paggiaro 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vigo-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vigo 2005</LINK>). A number of reports have suggested that it is important to stop further exposure to the causal agent once the diagnosis has been established, as this can influence the prognosis (<LINK REF="REF-Tarlo-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tarlo 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tarlo-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tarlo 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tarlo-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tarlo 2008</LINK>). There have also been several reviews on the management of occupational asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Beach-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beach 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chan_x002d_Yeung-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan-Yeung 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kogevinas-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kogevinas 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nicholson-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicholson 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rachiotis-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rachiotis 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tarlo-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tarlo 2008</LINK>). Some authors from these earlier reviews found it difficult to draw conclusions about optimal management due, in part, to the heterogeneity of findings in the research available (<LINK REF="REF-Beach-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beach 2005</LINK>).</P>

For locating randomised controlled trials we used the search strategy recommended by <LINK REF="REF-Lefebrve-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lefebrve 2008</LINK>. For locating non-randomised intervention studies we used the search strategy reported by <LINK REF="REF-Verbeek-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verbeek 2005</LINK> (<LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>).<BR/>

<P>Two review authors performed data extraction independently. One author (GG) acted as one data extractor for all the papers. The remaining authors each acted as a second data extractor for a proportion of the papers. We used a consensus method to reconcile differences in extracted information between authors where these occurred. A third author was asked to re-extract the data if differences could not be reconciled in this way. Where relevant information was thought to be missing from an included paper, but it was thought it might have been collected as a part of the study, we contacted the original authors of the paper to ask if they could provide additional information.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2011-04-04 14:18:33 +0300" MODIFIED_BY="Jani H Ruotsalainen">
<P>We intended to assess risk of bias for randomised trials using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool, but no such trials were found. A number of non-randomised trials were included therefore we performed an additional evaluation of the quality of the studies using the checklist developed by Downs and Black (<LINK REF="REF-Downs-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Downs 1998</LINK>). For risk of bias assessment for these studies we used the 'Internal Validity' section of the Downs and Black assessment. We omitted question 18 on appropriate statistical tests as it was felt it could not be meaningfully interpreted and hence it did not add any value to the assessment of methodological quality. We interpreted a score of less than 50% for any study as 'high risk of bias'. For time series data we intended to use the quality checklist developed by the Cochrane EPOC group (<LINK REF="REF-EPOC" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPOC</LINK>) but no such studies were identified.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2011-04-04 14:18:33 +0300" MODIFIED_BY="Jani H Ruotsalainen">
<P>For controlled before and after studies (CBAs), we plotted the results of each trial as risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and means and standard deviations (SD) for continuous outcomes. When the results could not be plotted, such as for income loss, we described them in the table of <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>, or entered the data into 'other data tables'. For outcomes utilising continuous measures, we gave preference to analysing those results for which a mean difference (MD) between groups could be estimated. This was not possible for the results of the NSBH tests where the outcomes were measured on different scales. For these we used standardised mean differences (SMD) or effect sizes.</P>
<P>Asthma symptoms were reported in various ways. Some authors reported numbers of symptomatic and asymptomatic at follow up; others described numbers of subjects with improvement of symptoms, or symptoms were classified into groups with an indication of presence, severity or both. In each case, we analysed the data as a dichotomous outcome comparison and reported the risk ratio (RR) for both, absence of symptoms and for improvement (but no absence) of symptoms.</P>
<P>The most widely used parameter of lung function in the included papers was FEV1. FEV1 was reported in various ways but most commonly as a percentage of a predicted or reference value (FEV1 %) and this was used for comparison in these analyses. In order to minimise the influence of baseline differences, we used the mean difference in change in FEV1 % between baseline and follow up for the intervention group and the control group as the main measure of treatment effect. We also reported the baseline values and the values at follow up for completeness.</P>
<P>For measuring NSBH two different bronchoconstrictors were commonly used: methacholine and histamine. Results were most often presented as PC20, PC15 or PD20 and PD15. Some articles reported subjects with 'abnormal' values and other articles reported a continuous outcome in dose or concentration. The studies had used different test methods, therefore we used a standardised mean difference (SMD). The SMD is a measure used to combine study results when studies have used different instruments to measure the same construct. The SMD expresses the effect of the intervention in standard units rather than the original units of measurement. The SMD is the difference in mean effects in the experimental and control groups divided by the pooled standard deviation of participants' outcomes. We made the calculations as recommended in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> Chapter 9, section 9.2.3.2 and Chapter 12, section 12.6.4 and 16.4.6.2 (<LINK REF="REF-Handbook-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handbook 2009</LINK>). We interpreted the SMDs in the following way: &lt; 0.40 = small, 0.40 to 0.70 = moderate and &gt; 0.70 = large.</P>

<P>It had been assumed that a number of studies might have used a cluster-randomised design without an allowance for the possible effect of this clustering, and we had intended to utilise a strategy which had previously been developed to deal with this (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>).

<P>Where a paper was felt to be missing information that was needed for the meta-analysis we contacted the original authors to see if this information might be available. Where important statistical information was missing, for example the standard deviation or a correlation coefficient, we calculated this from other available statistics such as P values, using the methods described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Handbook-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handbook 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Some papers did not report whether the value used to describe the scatter of FEV1 % values was a standard deviation (SD) or a standard error (SE) (Chan-Yeung 1987; Lin 1996; Paggiora 1984). It was assumed that higher values indicated a SD, whereas lower values indicated a SE. For example below 5 we classified as low and above 20 as high.</P>
<P>Where the standard deviation could not be calculated for the change we estimated it from the correlation coefficient as recommended in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> Chapter 16.1.3.2.</P>
<P>In instances where the SE and no SD was provided, we calculated a SD so as to be able to enter the data into the meta-analysis. We used the method recommended in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> Chapter 7.7.3.2.</P>
<P>Two articles reported data as a median and inter-quartile range. As the distribution of the values seemed to be relatively normally distributed we assumed that the median value was equal to the mean and calculated the SD by dividing the interquartile range by 1.35 as recommended in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> Chapter 7.7.3.5 (<LINK REF="STD-Moscato-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Moscato 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vandenplas-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Vandenplas 2002</LINK>).</P>

<P>We defined clinical homogeneity as having similar interventions or exposure to the same kind of agent(s). Outcomes had to be measured at baseline and at follow up. We tested for statistical heterogeneity by means of the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic in the meta-analyses graphs. We used a cut-off of <U>&gt;</U> 50% to indicate significant heterogeneity, as suggested in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Handbook-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handbook 2009</LINK>).</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2011-04-04 14:18:33 +0300" MODIFIED_BY="Jani H Ruotsalainen">
<P>We pooled studies only when they included sufficient data, and were judged to be clinically homogeneous, using RevMan 5.1 software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>). When studies were statistically heterogeneous (I<SUP>2 </SUP>&gt; 50%) we used a random-effects model, otherwise we used a fixed-effect model. The outcomes 'improvement of symptoms' and 'absence of symptoms' yielded such statistically different results that these could not be combined. Therefore, we decided to consider these as different outcomes and classified asthma symptoms as either absence of symptoms or as improvement of symptoms. For the outcome improvement of symptoms we counted only those that improved and not those that had no symptoms any more.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Quality of evidence</HEADING>
<P>We assessed the quality of evidence for each outcome by using the GRADE approach (GRADE working group). The ratings of quality of evidence were based on five factors: limitations of studies, inconsistency of results, indirectness of evidence, imprecision and publication bias.</P>
<P>These factors are defined as follows.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Limitations of a study refers to a high risk of bias as assessed using the risk of bias checklist.</LI>
<LI>Inconsistency refers to any unexplained heterogeneity of results.</LI>
<LI>Indirectness refers to the situation in which there are no direct comparisons between groups but the effect of an intervention is inferred from two different comparisons.</LI>
<LI>Imprecision refers to the results of studies which include relatively few patients and few events and consequently have wide confidence intervals around the estimate of the effect.</LI>
<LI>Publication bias refers to the systematic underestimation or overestimation of the underlying beneficial or harmful effect due to selective publication of studies (<LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>).</LI>

<P>We intended to analyse subgroups of studies that included workers with different levels of exposure to see if this changed the effect of the intervention.

<P>The total search including the update in February 2011 yielded 12,709 references. From a combined search of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and Nioshtic-2 we identified 9141 references, from CISDOC and HSELINE up to January 2009 we identified 1186, and we identified 276 from the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Airways Group up to April 2010. An additional search of the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Airways Group in April 2010 identified one additional reference. Review of the references cited by speakers at the fourth Jack Pepys Workshop of experts on occupational asthma in May 2010 identified another two articles (<LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="APP-04" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 4</LINK>; <LINK REF="APP-05" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 5</LINK>).</P>
<P>The screening of titles and subsequently abstracts of all references identified resulted in 161 articles for full-text evaluation. Full-text evaluation identified that, of these, 21 articles ultimately fulfilled our inclusion criteria.</P>
<P>Four of the 21 studies described two different interventions and a control group, so three comparisons were made for these studies (intervention 1 versus control; intervention 2 versus control; intervention 1 versus intervention 2). This resulted in a total of 29 comparisons. All included articles described occupational asthma due to exposure to sensitisers, except for one study of workers with pot room asthma (<LINK REF="STD-Soyseth-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Soyseth 1995</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Design</HEADING>
<P>We did not identify any randomised studies nor interrupted time series. All comparisons were therefore based on a controlled before and after design.</P>
<P>In some of the controlled before and after (CBA) studies, it was apparent that the intervention and control group at baseline did not have the same severity of occupational asthma. It was not clear in 19 studies how patients were allocated to the intervention group or the control group. Only two studies were intentionally designed as an intervention study (<LINK REF="STD-Dressel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Dressel 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soyseth-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Soyseth 1995</LINK>). All the other studies were prospective or retrospective follow-up studies. The difference in severity of occupational asthma between intervention and control group might be due to the fact that the studies were not intentionally designed as an intervention study but were more reflections on experience.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>The interventions identified in the included studies were as follows.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Removal from exposure</HEADING>
<P>&#8216;Removal from exposure&#8217; comprised interventions where the workers were completely removed from further exposure. This comprised relocation to another job and work area within the same companyor to another company where there was no exposure to the causal agent, or cessation of paid work. No studies were identified where the suspected causal agent was substituted with a different non-asthma causing alternative.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Reduction of exposure</HEADING>
<P>&#8216;Reduction of exposure&#8217; comprised situations where personal protective equipment was introduced or enhanced, a worker was relocated to another job and work area with less exposure to the causal agent within the same companyor to another company, or an educational or training programme intended to reduce exposure was implemented. Change to the availability of personal protective equipment was identified as a method of reducing exposure in three of the included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bernstein-2003-reduction" TYPE="STUDY">Bernstein 2003 reduction</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosenberg-1987-reduction" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenberg 1987 reduction</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vandenplas-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Vandenplas 2002</LINK>). Reduction of exposure achieved by transferring workers to a different area (but the same or a similar job) within the same or another company or by assigning the worker to different tasks in the same general work area was the intervention in 10 of the included articles.</P>
<P>&#8216;An educational or training programme to reduce exposure&#8217; was identified as the intervention in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Dressel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Dressel 2007</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Continued exposure</HEADING>
<P>'Continued exposure' comprised those groups where no intervention in the workplace was made.</P>
<P>All interventions in the included studies were classified into one of these three categories: removal from exposure, reduction of exposure and continued exposure. Three direct comparisons could then be made:</P>
<UL>
<LI>removal from exposure versus continued exposure;</LI>
<LI>reduction of exposure versus continued exposure; and</LI>
<LI>removal from exposure versus reduction of exposure.</LI>
</UL>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Moscato-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Moscato 1999</LINK>) reported on an intervention group who ceased exposure and a control group who continued working with the same exposure. From the details published it appeared that the intervention group consisted of five workers who continued to be exposed, albeit intermittently or at lower levels of exposure, and seven who continued working with the same exposure. These 12 workers were included in the analysis as a single group with ongoing exposure, because the majority had ongoing exposure (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>

<P>We compared asthma symptoms before and after the intervention in two separate ways: 1) for the number of subjects reporting an absence of symptoms; and 2) for the number of subjects reporting improvement of symptoms.</P>
<P>Authors obtained information about asthma symptoms using a number of different methods. Nine studies used interviews (<LINK REF="STD-Chan_x002d_Yeung-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Chan-Yeung 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chan_x002d_Yeung-1987-reduction" TYPE="STUDY">Chan-Yeung 1987 reduction</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mapp-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Mapp 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marabini-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Marabini 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moscato-1993-reduction" TYPE="STUDY">Moscato 1993 reduction</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moscato-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Moscato 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Munoz-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Munoz 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Padoan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Padoan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paggiaro-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Paggiaro 1984</LINK>). Others used questionnaires. Only minimal information about the content of interviews was given in those studies in which they were used. A number of different questionnaires were used. Results were reported in a number of different ways. Some authors reported numbers of symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals (<LINK REF="STD-Chan_x002d_Yeung-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Chan-Yeung 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chan_x002d_Yeung-1987-reduction" TYPE="STUDY">Chan-Yeung 1987 reduction</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Innocenti-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Innocenti 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lin-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mapp-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Mapp 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marabini-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Marabini 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Padoan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Padoan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paggiaro-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Paggiaro 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Visentin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Visentin 2003</LINK>).

<P>Most studies were carried out at a university clinic or a hospital department specialising in occupational medicine or pulmonary medicine. Only one study was undertaken within a business or workplace setting (<LINK REF="STD-Soyseth-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Soyseth 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>A source of funding was stated in only two articles. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Dressel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Dressel 2007</LINK>) was supported by two German statutory accident insurance institutions for agricultural workers. Another study (<LINK REF="STD-Vandenplas-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Vandenplas 2002</LINK>) was supported by the Services Federaux des Affaires Scientifiques et Culturelles. We felt it unlikely that source of funding introduced a significant conflict of interest in any of these instances.</P>
<P>Studies were carried out in Europe (Italy 10, Belgium one, France one, Germany one, Great Britain one, Norway one, Spain one), Canada (British Columbia four) and the USA (Ohio one)</P>
<P>The included articles were published between 1984 and 2008, with 14 published prior to 2000.</P>
<P>All the included articles were written in English (17) or Italian (four).<I> </I>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Participants</HEADING>
<P>All participants were workers in accordance with inclusion criteria. All the participants had acquired occupational asthma and were exposed to an agent with potential to cause asthma. Two articles (<LINK REF="STD-Bernstein-2003-removal" TYPE="STUDY">Bernstein 2003 removal</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vandenplas-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Vandenplas 2002</LINK>) reported results for workers exposed to latex. In these articles some workers with pre-existing asthma were included, although no separation into occupational asthma and work-aggravated asthma was attempted in the results. One additional study included a single worker with probable work-aggravated asthma (<LINK REF="STD-Rosenberg-1987-removal" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenberg 1987 removal</LINK>).</P>
<P>The diagnosis of occupational asthma was based on specific inhalation challenge (SIC) with the suspected causative agent in 17 studies (although results were not always available for all subjects), or based on history and questionnaires, lung function and immunological testing in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bernstein-2003-removal" TYPE="STUDY">Bernstein 2003 removal</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Visentin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Visentin 2003</LINK>). In two studies the methods of diagnosis were not reported (<LINK REF="STD-Dressel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Dressel 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soyseth-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Soyseth 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>The sex ratio differed between the studies from 100% male to 100% female. It appeared that this was probably due to differences in the workforces from which participants were identified. For example, in the studies of western red cedar workers (<LINK REF="STD-Chan_x002d_Yeung-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Chan-Yeung 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chan_x002d_Yeung-1987-removal" TYPE="STUDY">Chan-Yeung 1987 removal</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chan_x002d_Yeung-1987-reduction" TYPE="STUDY">Chan-Yeung 1987 reduction</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lin-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marabini-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Marabini 1993</LINK>), far more males were included, whereas females predominated in the studies of healthcare workers, hairdressers or cosmetic workers.</P>

<P>We excluded six studies. In three studies the control groups did not have occupational asthma. Two studies did not include a control group. One article (<LINK REF="STD-Dressel-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dressel 2009</LINK>) appeared to report results for the same subjects as had been described in a previous article two years before. The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide in exhaled breath (FeNO). We chose to exclude this article because individuals who smoked or suffered a respiratory tract infection were excluded from this paper because of the potential for these to affect FeNO. A similar exclusion was not made in any of the other included studies and consequently we felt it was difficult to compare this subject group with those from other included studies.</P>

<P>We evaluated the internal validity of the included studies using the Downs and Black checklist (<LINK REF="REF-Downs-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Downs 1998</LINK>) and this generally showed low methodological quality. In none of the studies were the participants or those measuring the outcomes blinded. Only some studies adjusted for length of follow up. Compliance with the intervention was often unknown and there was frequently no information on why or how participants were allocated to either the intervention group or control group. Most studies described the population the participants were recruited from. Most studies described the time period during which participants were recruited. None of the studies randomised participants to the different interventions. Only a few studies had adequate adjustment for confounders. Only a few studies had tried to take into account participants who were lost to follow up. The total score for included studies ranged from zero to seven out of 12 with a mean of 3.1 and SD 2.0 (<LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-08" TYPE="TABLE">Table 8</LINK>).</P>
<P>All studies were observational studies therefore we made an initial assessment that the evidence was of moderate quality. In addition, all studies had a high risk of bias which we considered an additional serious limitation. For this reason we downgraded the quality of evidence for all comparisons to 'very low'. Consequently, there was no need to use the other qualifiers to grade the quality of evidence, such as indirectness of evidence or publication bias (<LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Explanation of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>There was considerable heterogeneity in <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK> of the effect of removal versus continued exposure on improvement of asthma symptoms (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 65%). This was almost fully explained by the inclusion of <LINK REF="STD-Munoz-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Munoz 2008</LINK> in which there was no additional effect of the intervention on asthma symptoms. Improvement of symptoms occurred in almost 100% of the individuals in both the removal from exposure group and the continued exposure group. It is unclear why the group with continued exposure behaved so differently to similar groups in other studies. An important feature of this study was that the duration of exposure since diagnosis was on average four years in the continued exposure group compared to three months for the removal group.</P>
<P>There was considerable heterogeneity in <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK> of the effect of removal versus continued exposure on FEV1%. This was fully explained by the difference between HMW and LMW studies, which were analysed in separate subgroups.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK> of the effect of removal versus continued exposure on NSBH, much of the heterogeneity could be explained by the difference in effect between the HMW and LMW studies but for unclear reasons the study by <LINK REF="STD-Chan_x002d_Yeung-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Chan-Yeung 1982</LINK> also contributed substantially to the heterogeneity.</P>
<P>There was considerable heterogeneity in the comparison of removal from exposure versus reduction of exposure for the outcome improvement of asthma symptoms, which was explained by the greater effect in LMW studies than in HMW studies (<LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>).</P>
<P>For the <LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK> of the effect of removal from exposure versus reduction of exposure on the outcome change in FEV1 %, the heterogeneity was due to the study <LINK REF="STD-Valentino-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Valentino 2002</LINK> that had an effect in favour of removal while the other studies favoured reduction.

<P>Three comparisons of interventions were reported: removal from exposure versus continued exposure (15 studies); reduction of exposure versus continued exposure (six studies) and removal from exposure versus reduction of exposure (eight studies).</P>
<P>Asthma symptoms, measured either as absence of symptoms or improvement of symptoms, improved significantly more after removal from exposure and after reduction of exposure when compared to continued exposure. Forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1 %) improved significantly more following removal from exposure than with continued exposure, but not after reduction of exposure, although it is notable that there were fewer studies for the second comparison. Non-specific bronchial hyper-reactivity (NSBH) improved with removal from exposure when compared with continuing exposure, but this outcome was not available for the other comparisons.</P>
<P>Total removal from exposure resulted in absence of asthma symptoms significantly more often than reduction of exposure, but there was no significant difference for improvement of symptoms or change in FEV1 % between these two interventions. The outcome NSBH was not available for this comparison.</P>
<P>Total removal from exposure led significantly more often to job loss or an appreciable loss of income than reduction of exposure.</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence for all outcomes was assessed as very low.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-04-04 14:18:33 +0300" MODIFIED_BY="Jani H Ruotsalainen">
<P>Even though there are many reviews of management of occupational asthma, this review is, to our knowledge, the first to focus especially on different workplace interventions in comparison to a control group. Previous reviews have included case series which provided some evidence that removal from exposure resulted in symptom reduction. However, from these studies it was not possible to make a comparison of the relative magnitude of each intervention, such as the effect of removal from exposure versus reduction of exposure. While occupational asthma has traditionally provided fertile ground for research and publication, as was shown by the more than 10,000 hits in our initial literature search, considerably less work has been published on the role of workplace interventions in managing occupational asthma. We included just 21 articles published over a timeframe of 27 years, from 1981 to 2008, with 14 published prior to 2000.</P>
<P>All studies were observational in nature. In only two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dressel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Dressel 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soyseth-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Soyseth 1995</LINK>) the intervention was planned and allocated in a standardised way. The authors of these two studies described the criteria used for allocation to one group or the other. In all other studies it was unclear why subjects were allocated to either the intervention group or the control group and who initiated the intervention.</P>
<P>Reduction of exposure was generally achieved in a number of different ways. In the majority of studies the subjects were transferred to an area of the workplace with less, although still some, exposure to the agent causing occupational asthma. No measurements of exposure levels were reported in the articles. In some studies the reduction was achieved by a change in personal protective equipment (introduction of new equipment, or an improvement in existing equipment) (<LINK REF="STD-Bernstein-2003-reduction" TYPE="STUDY">Bernstein 2003 reduction</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosenberg-1987-reduction" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenberg 1987 reduction</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vandenplas-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Vandenplas 2002</LINK>). In one study the reduction of exposure was achieved by an education and training programme (<LINK REF="STD-Dressel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Dressel 2007</LINK>). These studies were small, with largely non-significant outcomes, and yielded a significant outcome only for the absence of asthma symptoms in a pooled effect estimate.</P>
<P>It should be noted that most data were available for low molecular weight (LMW) agents and that studies for high molecular weight (HMW) agents were considerably more sparse. The causal agent was LMW in 14 studies, HMW in four studies, both HMW and LMW in two studies and pot room gases in one study. It is, therefore, difficult to draw conclusions for all groups of agents, and it is sensible to interpret these results with considerable caution when considering HMW agents. All articles, except possibly the one on pot room gases, reported on sensitiser-induced occupational asthma. No studies with irritant-induced occupational asthma (unless pot room gases are considered as irritants) were included and there were only four studies of the most commonly reported HMW causes of asthma, such as flour dust, animal proteins (<LINK REF="STD-Dressel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Dressel 2007</LINK>) and latex (<LINK REF="STD-Bernstein-2003-removal" TYPE="STUDY">Bernstein 2003 removal</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vandenplas-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Vandenplas 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Visentin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Visentin 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Not all studies reported all important outcomes and some of the studies presented results in a way that could not be used for meta-analysis. For asthma symptoms it is also important to note that in some studies symptoms were reported only as present or absent. An improvement in symptoms in these studies would not have been identified if some symptoms remained, and this may have led to some improvement not being reported.</P>
<P>It is notable that 10 of the 21 included studies came from Italy. One explanation for this might be, as suggested by <LINK REF="STD-Moscato-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Moscato 1999</LINK>, that for example in Italy financial compensation for patients with occupational asthma was not guaranteed and the socioeconomic condition made it difficult to find another job. Probably as a result, many participants with occupational asthma continued to be exposed to the causative agent in their jobs, and could be followed up by their physicians.</P>
<P>All four studies about western red cedar workers came from the same research group at the University of British Columbia, Canada (<LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>).</P>
<P>Follow-up time, duration of exposure prior to diagnosis and duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis showed a wide variation if reported at all. This, together with the often small number of participants in a study, made it unrealistic to perform subgroup analyses.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2011-04-04 14:18:33 +0300" MODIFIED_BY="Jani H Ruotsalainen">
<P>Overall, the quality of the available studies according to the GRADE approach was very low because nearly all the studies were observational studies and the risk of bias was considered high in all studies. No randomised controlled trials were found. There was no blinding and the overall evaluation of the included studies using the Downs and Black checklist was low, defined as a score less than 50%. The intervention and control groups in the same study were often hard to compare, because the FEV1 % predicted and the NSBH values at baseline often differed between groups. We tried to adjust for these baseline differences by using change values. It was not always clear when individual participants started the intervention; there was a wide variation in exposure times and in follow-up times. The methods to diagnose occupational asthma were not always specified and in two studies patients with work-aggravated asthma were also included. Selection of participants was not described in most of the articles and information on losses during follow up was also sparse.</P>

<P>We prevented language bias by including articles in all languages and translating foreign language articles using competent translators (usually natives of the relevant country). We avoided duplicate publication bias by using study data only once if they had been reported in more than one article. We tried to make our search as sensitive as possible which resulted in a fairly low specificity, with initially more than 10,000 hits. It is difficult to say categorically whether we might have missed some articles due to using insufficiently sensitive search terms, or missed publications in journals not included in the databases used. For example, due to time limitations we could not go through conference proceedings. However, we feel that it is highly unlikely that we would have missed important evidence from high-quality studies that would have altered the current results. It was not always possible to obtain missing data because authors often no longer had access to the original data. Some studies were supported by a company or insurance institution which could potentially give rise to a conflict of interest should they have a preference for a specific result, but we judged such conflicts of interests likely to be only minor if present at all.</P>

<LINK REF="REF-Nicholson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicholson 2005</LINK> et al reviewed 223 studies to produce evidence-based guidelines for the prevention, identification and management of occupational asthma. Although the objectives of that review differed from this review, and therefore a greater number of studies were included, these authors concluded similarly to this review, that complete avoidance of further exposure offered the best chance of recovery. <LINK REF="REF-Nicholson-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicholson 2010</LINK> is an update of <LINK REF="REF-Nicholson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicholson 2005</LINK> incorporating an additional 90 studies.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Rachiotis-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rachiotis 2007</LINK> performed a systematic review of case series of the outcome of occupational asthma after cessation of exposure. However, studies where patients had been relocated to low-exposure positions were excluded. The outcome measures comprised complete symptomatic recovery from asthma and improvement in NSBH. No assessment of study quality was applied. Only one-third of the patients with occupational asthma recovered fully from their disease despite avoidance of exposure to the initiating agent. The pooled prevalence of persistent NSBH at follow up was 73%. As in this review, these authors identified more studies of individuals with occupational asthma due to LMW (25) agents than HMW (14).</P>
<P>The review by <LINK REF="REF-Tarlo-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tarlo 2008</LINK> constituted a report of an American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) expert panel and was a consensus document (to an extent based on a systematic review by <LINK REF="REF-Beach-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beach 2005</LINK>) on the diagnosis and management of work-related asthma. These authors reported that removal of workers with sensitiser-induced occupational asthma from further exposure to the causative agent resulted in a better outcome.</P>
<P>All reviews to date appear in agreement that, once diagnosed, removal from exposure appears important to the outcome of occupational asthma, and that consequently periodic medical surveillance for workers in environments with possible exposure to sensitisers offers a number of potential advantages. Periodic surveillance leads to early detection and removal from exposure and this should increase the chances of complete reversal of symptoms. However, we did not find any studies that have evaluated this procedure in a controlled design.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-04-12 11:50:04 +0300" MODIFIED_BY="Jani H Ruotsalainen">
<P>Removal of individuals with occupational asthma from exposure is associated with a beneficial effect on asthma symptoms and lung function including both forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) and non-specific bronchial hyper-reactivity (NSBH) when compared to continued exposure. This is especially apparent for occupational asthma due to low molecular weight agents.</P>
<P>Reduction of exposure is also associated with beneficial effects on symptoms but there was no significant effect on lung function when compared to continued exposure.</P>
<P>Removal from exposure improved asthma symptoms more than reduction of exposure but there was no significant difference in terms of effect on improvement of asthma symptoms, or on lung function.</P>
<P>However, one unintended consequence of removal from exposure is a much higher risk of loss of work and income than reduction of exposure.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-04-04 14:18:33 +0300" MODIFIED_BY="Jani H Ruotsalainen">
<P>The low quality of the evidence identified in the course of this review highlights the need for better quality research data in this area. Future studies should ideally be based on clear, possibly random, allocation of participants to either an intervention or a control group as these are likely to avoid bias in allocation of individuals to intervention groups. Future studies should include greater numbers of participants and collect better information on exposure, duration of symptoms before diagnosis, duration of symptoms before the intervention and report more fully on asthma symptoms, FEV1 and NSBH before, during and after the intervention. Studies are needed to fully evaluate the effect of reduction of exposure, through either personal protective equipment or education of workers after exposure is minimised, as far as reasonably achievable. Given the uncertainty of the effect of reduction of exposure and the beneficial effects of continued employment on health, these studies should randomise participants to reduction of exposure or removal from exposure. The effect of interventions can probably be increased if workers with occupational asthma are diagnosed at an earlier stage. Health surveillance or regular periodic health examinations would enable such an early diagnosis. The effect of interventions after health surveillance should be studied with a controlled and preferably randomised controlled design.</P>
<P>Further studies are also needed to identify whether exposure reduction, through changes in the working process and additionally the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), is effective in participants with a diagnosis of occupational asthma. Preferably these should be randomised studies and they would ideally compare PPE with the removal from exposure, the current best available workplace intervention.</P>

<P>We initially intended to include before and after studies that did not use a specific control group. We identified more than 50 such articles but found it was not possible to include them in our analyses. It would have required additional analyses to include these articles. As such analyses were performed quite recently by <LINK REF="REF-Rachiotis-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rachiotis 2007</LINK> we decided to concentrate on articles with an intervention group and a control group.</P>
<P>Intervention: we included studies where the intervention comprised transferring the worker to a different area within the same or another company, or assigning the worker to different tasks as a reduction of exposure. This was the intervention in 10 of the included articles.</P>
<P>We considered employment outcomes as an adverse effect of the interventions.</P>

Because of the delay with compensations, along with the current Italian socioeconomic condition that makes it difficult to find a job, a number of our patients who resigned after the diagnosis of OA remained without any financial support for a long period of time, with serious socioeconomic consequences</P>

<P>Burge 1982</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Only 2 of the 20 affected workers who left their original factories were symptom-free on follow up and most had a considerable reduction in their quality of life by continuing asthma. Lung function testing at presentation and follow up show no significant differences for any group. Histamine reactivity had returned to normal in half of the workers who had left their original factories, but in only one worker who had moved within her original factory. This suggested that the non-specific bronchial reactivity to histamine was the result rather than the cause of the OA, and that indirect exposure at work was sufficient to delay recovery of histamine reactivity.</P>

<P>Chan-Yeung 1987</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>This study emphasises the importance of early diagnosis and early removal from exposure in patients with occupational asthma. The removal from exposure should be complete because partial removal did not prevent the deterioration of function of those who were continuously exposed. Early diagnosis and early removal are important for prognosis.</P>

<P>The data suggest that TDI induces chronic and irreversible damage even if the exposure is discontinued and support the view that FVC is more impaired than FEV1.</P>

<TD>
<P>Lin 1996</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Patients with red cedar asthma who continued to be exposed to cedar dust had a greater decline in FEV1. Patients with RCA who avoided the exposure after the diagnosis showed a similar rate of decline in FEV1 compared with sawmill workers.</P>

<TD>
<P>Mapp 1988</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Conclusion: respiratory symptoms, isocyanate sensitisation and airway hyper-responsiveness to methacholine may persist after removal from occupational exposure to TDI.</P>
<P>30/35 stopped exposure: 8 lost SIC to response to TDI, 5 had normal airway hyper-responsiveness to methacholine. TDI reactors on the follow-up challenge had persistent respiratory symptoms and airway hyper-responsiveness to methacholine</P>
<P>At follow up significant difference with regard to FEV1: non-reactors showed improvement, reactors showed a deterioration. Methacholine PD20 was higher among the group of 8 non-reactors than in the group of reactors removed from exposure and in the group of the 5 reactors exposed to TDI.</P>

<TD>
<P>Marabini 1993</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>The results suggest that the severity of asthma is not the main determinant of working status. It was found that the persistence of exposure resulted in a deterioration in the asthma despite the use of more medication. Participants who were working were younger and had a larger number of dependents than subjects who were not working at the time of the follow-up examination. They conclude that the socioeconomic factors are important in determining the working status of subjects with red cedar asthma. To prevent severe impairment and disability, there should be more economic incentives for these subjects to choose other jobs.</P>

<TD>
<P>Marabini 1994</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Despite removal from TDI exposure, OA can lead to permanent disability with important socio-economic consequences, and late response to SBPT may be a negative prognostic factor in TDI asthma.</P>

<TD>
<P>Moscato 1993</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Patients with OA can recover completely if the diagnosis is made at an earlier stage of the disease and the patient is removed from exposure.</P>
<P>The data show that the complete cessation of exposure without loss of work occurs in only a proportion of patients and that in Italy the system for compensation acts slowly.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Moscato 1999</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>In OA, cessation of exposure to the offending agent results in a decrease in asthma severity and in pharmaceutical expenses, but is associated with a deterioration of the individual's socioeconomic status (professional downgrading and loss of work-derived income).</P>

<P>Munoz 2008</P>

<P>Observations seem to indicate that the clinical and functional course for these patients will be favourable if they avoid exposure.</P>

<TD>
<P>Padoan 2003</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>The long-term follow up revealed that both asthmatic symptoms and airway hyper-responsiveness to methacholine persisted or improved slowly in subjects removed from exposure to TDI for &gt; 10 years. A more favourable outcome was associated with a better lung function, a lower degree of airway hyporesponsiveness to methacholine and a longer interval from cessation of exposure.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Paggiaro 1984</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>The study suggest that stopping occupational exposure to TDI frequently did not produce an improvement of the TDI bronchial asthma, and persistence of the occupational exposure causes a more rapid decline in the respiratory function.</P>

<P>Pisati 1994</P>

<P>OA cobalt: early diagnosis and early removal from exposure after the onset of asthma are important factors for a favourable evolution of the disease and that specific and non-specific bronchial hyper-responsiveness can persist even in asymptomatic subjects no longer exposed to the cobalt.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Rosenberg 1987</P>
</TD>

<P>Confirms and extends previous results about the evaluation of OA. Respiratory symptoms often persist despite removal from exposure. Bronchial hyperreactivitylasts more than 4 years after cessation of exposure.</P>

<TD>
<P>Soyseth 1995</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>No improvement in lung function was found in the index group compared with the reference group. 49% of the improvement in bronchial responsiveness could be explained by removal from exposure.</P>

<TD>
<P>Valentino 2002</P>

<TD>
<P>The present study confirms that early diagnosis and immediate removal from exposure are crucial, though not always sufficient, for a favourable evolution of the disease.</P>

<P>Vandenplas 2002</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>In participants who reduced their exposure to latex, the improvement in asthma and rhinitis symptoms, as well as in the level of nonspecific bronchial hyper-responsiviness, was similar to what was observed in the participants who avoided exposure to latex. However, removal from exposure was associated with more pronounced work disability, income loss and perceived impairment of professional and social activities. When compensation benefits are taken into account, the final income loss did not differ between those who avoided exposure and those who reduced exposure. <I>(Different for other countries).</I>

<P>Visentin 2003</P>

<P>The study shows that latex-induced occupational asthma improves after a follow up of 5 +/- 3 years, but a complete recovery occurs in a minority of subjects and is associated with cessation of exposure.</P>
