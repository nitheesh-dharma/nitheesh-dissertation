<P>There is not enough evidence to show whether or not multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation programs are helpful for people with neck and shoulder pain.</P>
<P>Prolonged neck and shoulder pain can lead to a combination of physical, psychological and social difficulties. For that reason, physical rehabilitation can also include psychological, behavioural and educational interventions. This kind of "multidisciplinary rehabilitation" is available in some pain clinics, and rehabilitation centres and clinics. The review of trials found there was not enough good evidence to show whether or not multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation is beneficial to adults of working age with neck and shoulder pain.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation programs for neck and shoulder pain require substantial staff and financial resources. Despite questionable scientific evidence of their effectiveness, they are widely used.</P>
<P>Neck and shoulder complaints are common among working age adults and they are often associated with physical work load and stress. Pain in the neck and shoulder area cause biopsychosocial difficulties for the patient, especially if disability due to pain is prolonged. To help patients with biopsychosocial problems, or to prevent their development, multidisciplinary biopsychosocial programs are used for rehabilitation for patients with neck and shoulder pain. Nevertheless, multidisciplinary treatment programmes are often laborious and rather long processes and require good collaboration between the patient, the rehabilitation team and the work place. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this systematic review was to determine the effectiveness of multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation for neck and shoulder pain among working age adults.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The reviewed studies for this review were electronically identified from MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycLIT, CENTRAL, Medic, the Science Citation Index, reference checking and consulting experts in the rehabilitation field. The original search was planned and performed for more broad area of musculoskeletal disorders. Trials on neck and shoulder pain were separated afterwards. The literature search was updated in November 2002 by electronically searching MEDLINE and EMBASE. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>From all references identified in our original search, we selected randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized controlled clinical trials (CCTs). Trials had to assess the effectiveness of biopsychosocial rehabilitation for working age adults suffering from neck and shoulder pain. The rehabilitation program was required to be multidisciplinary, i.e., it had to consist of a physician's consultation plus either a psychological, social or vocational intervention, or a combination of these.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Four authors blinded to journal and author selected the trials that met the specified inclusion criteria. Two experts in the field of rehabilitation evaluated the clinical relevance and applicability of the findings of the selected studies for actual clinical use. Two other authors blinded to journal and author extracted the data and assessed the main results and the methodological quality of the studies, using standardized forms. Finally, a qualitative analysis was performed to evaluate the level of scientific evidence for the effectiveness of multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>After screening 1808 abstracts, and the references of 65 reviews, we found only two relevant studies that satisfied our criteria. No more studies were found for this update. One of the studies was considered to be a methodologically low quality RCT and the other one was a methodologically low quality CCT. The clinical relevance of included studies was satisfactory. There was limited scientific evidence for the effectiveness of multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation for neck and shoulder pain.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>We conclude that there appears to be little scientific evidence for the effectiveness of multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation compared with other rehabilitation facilities for neck and shoulder pain. Multidisciplinary rehabilitation is a commonly used intervention for chronic neck and shoulder complaints, therefore we see an urgent need for high quality trials in this field.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-06-19 15:12:35 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Nonmalignant musculoskeletal pain is an increasing problem in western countries (<LINK REF="REF-Heli_x00f6_vaara-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heliövaara 1993</LINK>). It is one of the leading reasons for consulting primary health care practitioners and often leads to absenteeism from work, with consequent monetary losses for society. The cause is often stated as a non-specific pain syndrome with pain in the back, neck and shoulder regions (<LINK REF="STD-Jensen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Many pharmacological, physical and other therapies (such as assistive devices, hypnosis, relaxation, stress management, therapeutic massage or hydrotherapy), have been widely used, although scientific evidence of their effectiveness is still lacking. The benefits of these treatments are often temporary. Prolonged pain tends to develop into a combination of physical, psychological and social disabilities. For that reason, the physical rehabilitation for musculoskeletal disorders has been combined with psychological, behavioural and educational interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Allegrante-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allegrante 1996</LINK>). The conceptual basis for this kind of rehabilitation is found in the biopsychosocial model of illness. Multidisciplinary treatment is practiced in pain clinics or rehabilitation centres, which have rapidly increased in numbers over the last decades (<LINK REF="REF-Flor-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flor 1992</LINK>). The biopsychosocial model is also practiced in outpatient rehabilitation facilities.</P>
<P>Multidisciplinary treatment programs require substantial staff and financial resources from the heath care system. The indirect costs burden the employers, insurance companies and patients as well. The value of the multidisciplinary treatment has often been questioned because of lack of data of its efficacy and cost-effectiveness. Three meta-analyses on the efficacy of multidisciplinary pain treatment on chronic pain have been published (<LINK REF="REF-Flor-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flor 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Cutler-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cutler 1994</LINK>,<LINK REF="REF-Turk-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turk 1998</LINK>), and one recent systematic review analysed the evidence of cognitive behavioural therapy for chronic pain in adults (<LINK REF="REF-Morley-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morley 1999</LINK>), but they all lack specific information on neck and shoulder pain. In a review by <LINK REF="REF-Kjellman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjellman 1999</LINK>, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on neck pain were analysed, but the review focused on physiotherapy and chiropractic treatments. </P>
<P>This review is separated from a larger systematic review on the effectiveness of multidisciplinary rehabilitation on common musculoskeletal disorders among working age adults.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this systematic review was to determine the effectiveness of multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation for neck and shoulder pain among working age adults. We investigated the following parameters: pain, global improvement, disorder specific functional status, generic functional status, ability to work, cost-effectiveness, cost-benefit and satisfaction with treatment.</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS MODIFIED="2008-06-19 15:12:35 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Only RCTs and non-randomized controlled clinical trials (CCTs) on multidisciplinary rehabilitation were considered. However, if there were three or more RCTs, only RCTs were included. Studies reported in English, Dutch, Finnish, Swedish, Norwegian, German, French or Spanish were included.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Originally, RCTs assessing the effectiveness of multidisciplinary rehabilitation for patients suffering from fibromyalgia, multilocational musculoskeletal pain, subacute low back pain, neck and shoulder pain, repetitive strain injuries, osteoarthritis or headache were included. Studies dealing with neck and shoulder pain were separated later for this particular Cochrane review.</P>
<P>Patients in the trials were required to be working age adults (18 to 65 years) whose back pain was not related to: acute trauma, neoplasms, and inflammatory or neurologic diseases. Studies dealing with postoperative pain and with osteoporosis were excluded, the latter because the association of osteoporosis with pain is uncertain, except following fractures.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>The inpatient or outpatient rehabilitation program was required to be multidisciplinary, i.e., it had to consist of a physician's consultation plus either a psychological, social or vocational intervention, or a combination of these. Thus RCTs in which rehabilitation was exclusively or predominantly medical were excluded. For example, a program consisting solely of medical treatment and physiotherapy was not included. Trials on neck schools are being studied in another Cochrane review and were therefore excluded from this review.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>We looked for the following types of outcome in the selected studies:</P>
<P>1. Pain intensity (e.g., visual analogue scale, ordinal scale)<BR/>2. Global status (e.g., overall improvement)<BR/>3. Disorder specific functional status (e.g., neck disability index, shoulder disability questionnaire)<BR/>4. Generic functional status or quality of life (e.g., SF36, 15-D, Sickness Impact Profile, Health Assessment Questionnaire)<BR/>5. Ability to work (e.g., sickness absence, return to work, number of days off work)<BR/>6. Health care consumption and costs (e.g., physician's consultations, psychologist's or social worker's consultations, physiotherapy, intake of analgesics)<BR/>7. Satisfaction with treatment</P>

<SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2008-06-19 15:11:10 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched MEDLINE from 1966 for relevant studies, PsycLIT from 1967 and EMBASE from 1988 to April 1998. The Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) Issue 1, 1998 was also searched for recent studies. The references of identified articles and reviews were checked to widen the net. In addition, we screened studies published in Finland from 1978 to 1998 using the Finnish medical database Medic, and performed a Science Citation Index search. We also consulted 24 experts in the field of rehabilitation to identify potentially relevant studies we might have missed. In May 2001 the same strategy was used to identify more studies to update the review. At this time experts were not consulted. In November 2002, using OVID, the search strategy was run again in MEDLINE and EMBASE. See <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>.</P>

<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-06-19 15:12:35 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The methods for the systematic review are based on current recommendations (<LINK REF="REF-University-of-York-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">University of York 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Mulrow-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mulrow 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 1997</LINK>). The clinical relevance of the trials was assessed using a set of criteria based on the recommendations for critical reading of clinical literature by Shekelle (<LINK REF="REF-Shekelle-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shekelle 1994</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Study selection</HEADING>
<P>Four authors (KK, AM, RR, HH) independently selected the trials for the systematic review. We used the Latin square method; whereby each of the four authors selected the studies from among half of the papers so that the assessments of each author overlapped with other's assessments. The authors were blinded to the journal and study authors. From the title, keywords and abstract they assessed if the study met the inclusion criteria regarding design, subjects and intervention. Disagreements were discussed in consensus meetings, and if these were unresolved, or if it was unclear whether the article should be included, the full article was retrieved for final assessment. The same authors, still blinded to authors and journal, then assessed the full text article to make the final decision on whether the study met the inclusion criteria. The disagreements were again discussed in a consensus meeting.</P>
<P>For the 2002 update, two authors (MvT, KK) screened the titles, keywords and abstracts of the articles identified through the electronic searches.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction</HEADING>
<P>Two authors (MvT, BK) extracted the data (using a standardized form) independently and blinded to authors, journal and institution or origin. The following types of outcomes were considered: pain, global improvement, functional status (disorder specific and generic), ability to work, health care consumption and costs, and satisfaction with treatment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Evaluation of effectiveness of individual studies</HEADING>
<P>We considered a study to have a positive outcome if multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation showed improvement in at least one of these outcome measures, and negative if it was less effective than the reference intervention(s). A study was considered neutral if the multidisciplinary biopsychosocial intervention was considered ineffective compared to the reference interventions. If there was enough data presented, it was analysed with MetaView 3.1, using a fixed effect model and weighted mean differences (WMD). Mean differences and 95 per cent confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated, comparing interventions on predefined outcomes. Otherwise, the effectiveness was assessed using the data obtained from the papers.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Clinical relevance assessment</HEADING>
<P>Two experts in the field of rehabilitation (AM, HH) assessed the clinical relevance of the extracted studies by evaluating whether the patients, health care setting and interventions were described precisely enough to allow inferences about the clinical applicability of the results and clinical relevance of the measured outcome. On this basis, they then decided whether the evidence was sufficient for clinical recommendations to be made on the indication in question.</P>
<P>Three questions were used to assess the clinical relevance:<BR/>1. Are the patient characteristics and treatment settings described well enough to decide whether they are comparable to those you see in your own practice?</P>
<P>2. Are all the intervention(s) described well enough to allow you to provide the same to your own patients?</P>
<P>3. Were clinically relevant outcomes measured?</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Methodological quality assessment</HEADING>
<P>The two authors who extracted the data then independently assessed the methodological quality of the trials. A consensus method was used to resolve disagreements.</P>
<P>We used items from van Tulder's criteria list (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 1999</LINK>) that reflect the internal quality, which were scored as positive, negative or unclear (if the data was not available in an article).</P>
<P>Method of randomization was scored positive if a random (unpredictable) assignment sequence was used. Examples of adequate concealment procedures were some form of centralized randomizations scheme, numbered or coded containers, an on-site computer system providing allocations in a locked, unreadable file that could be assessed only after inputting the characteristics of an enrolled participant, and sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes. Clearly inadequate were procedures such as alternation, or reference to case record numbers, dates of birth, day of the week or any such other approach. If the concealment of treatment allocation was described only as random or randomized it was considered unclear.</P>
<P>Concealment of treatment allocation was scored positive if an independent person not responsible for determining the eligibility of the patients generated the assignment.</P>
<P>Blinding of patients and therapists were scored positive if they were blinded regarding treatment allocation and the method of blinding was appropriate. If blinding of patients or therapists was not feasible or if the trial was pragmatic, the credibility of the treatment modalities (interventions) should have been evaluated and the treatment modalities should have been equally credible and acceptable to patients and therapists.</P>
<P>Blinding of observers was scored positive if the observers were blinded regarding treatment allocation and the blinding was evaluated and adequate. It was scored negative if only self-reported (questionnaire) outcomes were used and there were no observer-reported outcomes.</P>
<P>Similarity of baseline characteristics was scored positive if, according to the authors, the study groups were comparable at baseline.</P>
<P>Co-interventions avoided or equal were scored positive if co-interventions were avoided in the design of the study or were equally divided among the intervention groups.</P>
<P>Compliance was scored positive if, according to the author, compliance was measured and satisfactory in all study groups.</P>
<P>Withdrawal rate was scored positive, if the number of randomized patients minus the number of patients at the main moment of effect measurement divided by all randomized patients and multiplied by 100, was less than 20 per cent.</P>
<P>Intention-to-treat analysis (ITT) was scored positive if all patients randomised to the intervention group were included in the analysis, regardless of non-compliance and co-interventions. If loss to follow-up was substantial (20 per cent or more), an ITT analysis as well as an alternative analysis, which accounts for missing values (e.g., a worst-case analysis), should have been performed.</P>
<P>Each criterion was given equal weight, for a maximum score of 10. An RCT was considered to be of high methodological quality if at least five out of 10 items were scored positive and of low methodological quality if less than five items were scored positive and the study had no fatal flaws. Any fatal flaws in the study design or execution meant that the study was considered inadequate and was excluded from the analysis. Examples of fatal flaws are withdrawals by more than 40 per cent of patients, total or nearly total non-adherence to the protocol, or very poor, non-adjusted comparability of the base-line criteria.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Qualitative analysis </HEADING>
<P>Qualitative analysis for each diagnosis on the effectiveness of multidisciplinary rehabilitation used a rating system with four levels of scientific evidence (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 1997</LINK>). Results were considered contradictory if the overall conclusion on effectiveness from different studies on the same indication were contradictory or inconsistent.</P>
<P>Level A: Strong research-based evidence: generally consistent findings in multiple high-quality RCTs<BR/>Level B: Moderate research-based evidence: generally consistent findings in one high-quality RCT and in one or more low quality RCTs, or generally consistent findings in multiple low-quality RCTs<BR/>Level C: Limited research-based evidence: one RCT (either high or low quality) or inconsistent or contradictory evidence in multiple RCTs<BR/>Level D: No research-based evidence: No RCTs</P>

<P>Two relevant studies were found on neck and shoulder pain: <LINK REF="STD-Ekberg-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Ekberg 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Jensen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 1995</LINK>.</P>
<P>Ekberg's study (n=107) was not randomized. The study population was 18 to 59 year-old females and males who were working and consulted a physician about a neck or shoulder disorder. The trial compared the effectives of an active multidisciplinary rehabilitation to traditional care, looking at sick leaves, pain, health-related behaviour and working conditions in a two year follow-up.</P>
<P>In Jensen's study, the population was 20 to 55 year-old patients with chronic neck and shoulder pain. The role of the psychologist in multidisciplinary treatments was explored. Both intervention and control groups participated in multidisciplinary rehabilitation. In the intervention group, the psychologist administrated the behavioural components of the multimodal approach directly to the patients whereas in the control group, the clinical psychologist participated in the multidisciplinary team as a supervisor. Main outcomes were: cost of the rehabilitation, pain intensity and disorder-specific functional status at six months follow-up, and ability to work (days off in six moths) at 12-month and at 18-month follow-ups.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Clinical relevance of the included studies</HEADING>
<P>The clinical relevance of included studies was assessed to assist with making clinical decisions. Each of the following relevance question was scored as positive if the methodological criterion was fulfilled, negative if the criterion was not fulfilled, and unsure if data were not available or sufficient.</P>
<P>1. Are the patients described well enough to decide whether they are comparable to those you see in your own practice? a) Setting b) Patient characteristics. 2. Is the intervention described well enough to allow you to provide the same to your own patients? a) In intervention group(s) b) In control group(s). 3. Were clinically relevant outcomes measured?</P>
<P>In the two papers on neck and shoulder pain, the populations and interventions were described rather well and the outcome measures were relevant, except that in Jensen's study the description of patient characteristics was considered inadequate.</P>
<P>The scoring of clinical relevance items is presented in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>

</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>The results of the quality assessment are presented in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>.</P>
<P>Overall, the methodological quality was poor, with neither of the studies scored as a high quality study (at least five positive items out of 10). Ekberg's non-randomized trial scored two and Jensen's study scored three. (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). </P>
<P>In Jensen's study, the method of randomizations was not described. Both studies reported blinding of patients, but blinding of therapists was not described. In both studies, similarity of baseline characteristics was not satisfactory and co-interventions were not avoided. Patients were followed successfully in both studies. Intention-to-treat analysis was not used. Studies did not have fatal methodological flaws, although information on some methodological quality items was missing from both of the articles.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Study selection</HEADING>
<P>Our extensive literature search on common musculoskeletal disorders identified 1808 citations that we screened against our inclusion and exclusion criteria. We retrieved 311 of these articles for further assessment and study selection. Ultimately just four articles were deemed to fulfil our inclusion criteria for neck and shoulder pain. However, two papers were later excluded. <LINK REF="STD-Kay-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kay 1992</LINK> was excluded due to lack of a biomedical component in the rehabilitation scheme. In further assessment, it turned out that the intervention in <LINK REF="STD-Toivanen-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Toivanen 1993</LINK> study was not multidisciplinary. Finally, only two trials on neck and shoulder pain were included. For the 2001 update, two trials <LINK REF="STD-Randlov-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Randlov 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taimela-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Taimela 2000</LINK> were initially considered to meet the inclusion criteria, however, when they were more closely scrutinised, they did not fulfil the criteria of biopsychosocial multidisciplinary rehabilitation. There were no studies identified in the November 2002 update.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Grading of scientific evidence</HEADING>
<P>Because of the heterogeneity of the studies with respect to populations, interventions and outcome measures, we refrained from statistical pooling and graded the scientific evidence using a 'best evidence' synthesis..</P>
<P>There was limited research-based scientific evidence about the effectiveness of multidisciplinary rehabilitation for neck and shoulder pain. Thus, based on one low quality RCT, there is limited support for the role of a psychologist as an advisor to the other health professionals of a multidisciplinary team, compared with the psychologist giving direct care to the patient.<BR/>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-06-19 15:03:43 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Results</HEADING>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Ekberg-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Ekberg 1994</LINK> CCT did not show any effectiveness for the active multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation when compared to traditional rehabilitation. Patients in the study were recruited from a primary health care unit for the control group and from industrial health care units for the biopsychosocial multidisciplinary intervention group. The only significant difference between the groups at baseline was the number of blue-collar workers and employees in services and health care. In the multidisciplinary intervention group, 91 per cent of patients were blue-collar workers and nine per cent were employees in services and health care, whereas in the traditional care group 55 per cent of patients were blue-collar workers and 43 per cent were employees in services and health care. Even if the intensity of pain and symptom rate were equal between the groups, the load of blue-collar worker might have influenced the results.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Jensen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 1995</LINK> study, both groups improved after comparison, but there was no statistically significant difference in clinical outcomes between the groups. In regard to costs and the input of healthcare professionals, it is valuable to have even this limited evidence that it is more cost-effective to use a clinical psychologist as a supervisor of the multidisciplinary healthcare team rather than having the clinical psychologist execute behavioural treatments him/herself.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">The definition of multidisciplinary rehabilitation</HEADING>
<P>In this review, we required each intervention to be executed by a professional of that discipline. Psychologist should be involved with psychological or behavioural treatment, while a social worker, an occupational nurse or an occupational physiotherapist could perform the social intervention. An occupational nurse or physiotherapist specializing in the field of occupational health could provide the vocational intervention.</P>
<P>Multidisciplinary treatment is emphasized as a biopsychosocial treatment. We considered that a doctor needed to be part of the procedure, because he/she is the one who makes the diagnosis. Furthermore, we considered treatment provided by physical therapists or nurses as relevant from the viewpoint of biomedical rehabilitation. As a biopsychosocial multidisciplinary rehabilitation, it contained at least two components of the biopsychosocial area. Therefore, programmes that included physician's intervention and traditional physiotherapy were not included. Trials were not excluded if a psychological, a social or a vocational intervention was used in addition to physiotherapy.</P>
<P>In several studies, the role of the physician as a representative of the biomedical component of multidisciplinary rehabilitation was unclear, because it was not explicitly stated whether the patients were recruited from physicians' offices or directly from some other sources, such as patient associations. This was a problem with the programmes were physician consultation was not a part of the rehabilitation programme and patients were recruited from sources other than physicians' offices. An explicit diagnosis and need for rehabilitation were uncertain in these cases.</P>
<P>EMG-biofeedback as a psychological treatment is considered controversial. For this review we excluded studies where EMG-biofeedback was the only component of psychological rehabilitation.</P>
<P>Behavioural treatments are widely used for musculoskeletal disorders and several studies have assessed their effectiveness within the psychological intervention. Some rehabilitation programs comprised a behavioural component and we included these studies because the behavioural approach is a fundamental feature of multidisciplinary rehabilitation for musculoskeletal disorders.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">The validity of the review</HEADING>
<P>The most difficult part in conducting a systematic review is finding the relevant papers. Our aim was to cover the area of multidisciplinary rehabilitation for various musculoskeletal disorders as comprehensively as possible, which was crucial for the validity of the review. Although we separated this review later from a broader review, it is likely that we found more relevant papers on neck and shoulder pain for this review than we would have found with a more specific search strategy.</P>
<P>When piloting the search strategy, we ended up with a long and complicated one, which, we believe, found most of the existing relevant papers. We searched six different databases using our search strategy, which was based on the UK Cochrane Centre search strategy, and is highly sensitive to identifying RCTs in EMBASE and MEDLINE (<LINK REF="REF-Dickersin-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickersin 1994</LINK>). We also screened the references of all obtained reviews and all included papers, and performed a Science Citation Index forward search. Most of the papers were obtained through the electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycLIT and CENTRAL. Reference checking, citation tracking and consultation of experts proved to be of little additional value (but required considerable effort), which probably indicates the comprehensiveness of the prior search. As CENTRAL covered the same area as the MEDLINE and EMBASE searches, it might be prioritised in the future. CENTRAL includes RCTs from MEDLINE, EMBASE and other databases, but also includes the results of a worldwide hand search of biomedical journals.</P>
<P>The study selection was performed by two independent authors and primarily was based on abstracts. To ensure that every relevant study was selected, the full article was retrieved for further assessment if there was any doubt about the study fulfilling the inclusion criteria. Retrieving all articles would have been extremely time consuming and expensive. Furthermore, the electronic database search found many articles irrelevant to us, such as case-reports and letters.</P>
<P>To avoid bias, we blinded the authors to authors, institute of origin, journal and acknowledgements during the study selection, the data extraction, and the methodological and clinical quality assessment. At least two authors selected the papers, while two others extracted the data, and at each stage, consensus meetings were arranged to resolve any disagreements. At the study selection stage, blinding demanded much work but may have reduced selection bias. At the data extraction and clinical relevance assessment stages blinding played a less important role.</P>
<P>When assessing the internal validity, i.e., the methodological quality, of the individual studies, we included the items considered the most important in previous reviews (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Koes-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koes 1991</LINK>). We did not quantify the importance of each validity item, as these weights can be considered arbitrary.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Clinical relevance of the included studies</HEADING>
<P>All studies reviewed were intervention studies and intended to be applicable in clinical practice. Assessment of the applicability of the results demands that patient characteristics and interventions are described precisely enough for clear inferences to be made about which patients may be treated, where, and how. Pertinent outcome measurements are important for clinical relevance, too.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Methodological quality of the studies</HEADING>
<P>In general, the methodological quality of the two trials on multidisciplinary rehabilitation for neck and shoulder pain among working age adults appeared to be low.</P>
<P>One of these two trials was randomized. It was not deemed to be a methodologically high-quality RCT and the method of randomizations was not described. Other methodological defects included lack of blinding of therapist and observers, similarity of baseline characteristics and co-interventions. Blinding of patients and therapists in RCTs on rehabilitation is usually not possible, but a feasible alternative is to evaluate expectations for the rehabilitation response in both the intervention and control groups in advance, among both patients and therapists. Intention-to-treat analysis is an essential feature of an RCT but was not used in these two studies.</P>
<P>The information reported in the articles was insufficient for scoring in six out of 20 (30 per cent) methodological quality items, according to the criteria used. The quality of reporting of RCTs may hopefully improve in the future, now that many journals have accepted the CONSORT-statement on enhancing the quality of reporting of randomized controlled trials (<LINK REF="REF-Begg--1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begg 1996</LINK>)</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Level of the scientific evidence for the effectiveness of the interventions </HEADING>
<P>In this review, our aim was to determine the effectiveness of multidisciplinary rehabilitation in the treatment of neck and shoulder pain. We found limited research-based evidence on multidisciplinary rehabilitation in neck and shoulder pain. However, in comparison with traditional treatment, multidisciplinary rehabilitation did not show any difference in Ekberg's non-randomized study. In Jensen's study, the effectiveness of multidisciplinary rehabilitation when the psychologist was executing a psychological intervention or was a tutor of multidisciplinary team was similar, but the latter intervention was less costly. Therefore, we concluded that there is limited evidence that it is as effective, but more expensive, to use a psychologist as a therapist rather than as a tutor in multidisciplinary rehabilitation team.</P>
<P>Methods for structured systematic reviews are constantly evolving. Using different methods for grading the evidence would lead to different conclusions. We originally planned to use a modified version of the rating system used in the U.S. Clinical Practice Guideline for Acute Low Back Problems in Adults (<LINK REF="REF-Bigos-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bigos 1994</LINK>). As the Cochrane Collaboration Back Review Group for Spinal Disorders published method guidelines for systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 1997</LINK>) at the time we started to conduct our review, we decided to use these recommendations.</P>
<P>Drawing clinical conclusions about the magnitude and duration of the effectiveness of interventions for this indication was hampered by the lack of high-quality studies that compared multidisciplinary rehabilitation to control interventions. We feel that there is insufficient evidence for clinical recommendations to be made.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Despite an extensive primary search and update, we were able to select only two relevant trials to include in this systematic review of multidisciplinary rehabilitation for neck and shoulder pain among working age adults. The methodological quality of the selected studies was low. Based on these trials, it could not be shown that multidisciplinary rehabilitation is better than usual care. It showed that using a clinical psychologist as a supervisor for the multidisciplinary team is more cost-effective than the psychologist giving behavioural treatment individually to the patients. The level of scientific evidence regarding multidisciplinary rehabilitation for working age neck and shoulder patients is limited. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There is still an urgent need for high quality randomised controlled trials, which would assess the effectiveness of multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation and it's components.</P>
