<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Many people are killed or injured by house fires each year. Fires detected with smoke alarms are associated with lower death rates. This review found that programmes to promote smoke alarms increased smoke alarm ownership and function modestly, if at all, and have not demonstrated a beneficial effect on fires or fire-related injuries. Counselling by health care workers, as part of child health care, may increase ownership and use of smoke alarms in homes but effects on injuries have not been examined. There is little evidence to support community-wide mass media or educational programmes or programmes to give away free smoke alarms as effective methods to promote smoke alarms or reduce injuries from fire. More research is needed to examine community-wide smoke alarm installation programmes.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2009-12-14 15:36:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Globally, fire-related burns and smoke inhalation accounted for 238,000 deaths in 2000, a rate of 3.9 deaths/100,000, with children and young persons aged less than 44 years accounting for the highest proportion of deaths. Smoke alarm ownership has been associated with a reduced risk of residential fire death.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>We evaluated interventions to promote residential smoke alarms, to assess their effect on the prevalence of owned and working smoke alarms, and the incidence of fires and burns and other fire-related injuries.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-08-08 15:27:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Karen Blackhall">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group's specialised register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ERIC, Dissertation Abstracts, IBSS, ISTP, FIREDOC, LRC, conference proceedings, published case studies, and bibliographies, and contacted investigators and relevant organisations to identify trials. Most of the searches were last updated in September 2007.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised or non-randomised controlled trials completed or published after 1969 evaluating interventions to promote residential smoke alarms.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. We performed meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials to combine odds ratios (OR) between intervention and control groups, using a random effects model. A chi-square test for heterogeneity used a significance level of 10%. Non-randomised trial results are described narratively.<BR/>
</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-12-14 15:36:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>We identified 26 completed trials, of which 17 were randomised. Overall, counselling and educational interventions, with or without provision of free or discounted smoke alarms, modestly increased the likelihood of owning an alarm (OR = 1.21; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.64) and having an installed, functional alarm (OR = 1.33; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.80). Whether or not the intervention programme provided free or discounted smoke alarms in addition to education did not influence these results. The results were sensitive to trial quality, however. Counselling as part of primary care child health surveillance had somewhat greater effects on alarm ownership (OR = 1.96; 95% CI 1.03 to 3.72) and function (OR = 1.46; 95% CI 1.15 to 1.85), results that were generally supported by non-randomised trials evaluating similar interventions. Injury outcomes were reported in only one randomised controlled trial, which found no effect of a smoke alarm give-away programme on total injuries (rate ratio 1.3; 95% CI 0.9 to 1.9) or on hospitalizations and deaths (rate ratio 1.3; 95% CI 0.7 to 2.3), in contrast to the substantial reduction in serious injuries reported in a non-randomised trial that evaluated a similar give-away programme. Neither trial showed a beneficial effect on fires. Mass media and community education showed little benefit in multiple non-randomised trials. Two trials, one of which was randomised, showed that smoke alarm installation programmes increase the likelihood of having a working smoke alarm, and the non-randomised trial reported reductions in fire-related injuries.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>This review found that programmes to promote smoke alarms have at most modest beneficial effects on smoke alarm ownership and function, and no demonstrated beneficial effect on fires or fire-related injuries. Counselling as part of child health surveillance has a somewhat greater effect on smoke alarm ownership and function, but its effects on injuries are unevaluated. Community smoke alarm give-away programmes have not been demonstrated to increase smoke alarm prevalence or to reduce fires or fire-related injuries. Community-based education programmes have not been shown to reduce burns or fire-related injuries. Community smoke alarm installation programmes may increase the prevalence of working alarms and reduce fire-related injuries, but these results require confirmation, and the cost-effectiveness of such programmes has not been evaluated. Efforts to promote smoke alarms through installation programmes should be evaluated by adequately designed randomised controlled trials measuring injury outcomes and cost-effectiveness.</P>

<P>Eleven completed trials collected data on smoke alarm ownership. We were unable to obtain these data from one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Williams-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1988</LINK>), which reported "no significant difference" in alarm ownership between study groups. Combining the other ten trials, smoke alarm ownership at follow-up appeared slightly more likely with intervention, a difference that may have been due to chance (OR = 1.21; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.64). A somewhat larger positive effect on new acquisitions of smoke alarms, with a wide confidence interval, was found among the five trials reporting this outcome (OR = 1.63; 95% CI 0.72 to 3.67).</P>
<P>Eleven trials collected data on prevalence of working smoke alarms, and information on whether working alarms were acquired during the trial was available for five of these. Among the ten trials comparing intervention subjects to no intervention controls, there was evidence of a modestly increased likelihood of having installed, functioning alarms with intervention (OR = 1.33; 0.98 to 1.80), possibly due to chance. There was significant heterogeneity (P = 0.09; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 40%), with several trials reporting no benefit or a reduction in ownership with intervention. Similar results were reported for acquisition of functioning alarms, an effect which may have been due to chance (OR = 1.42; 95% CI 0.99 to 2.03).</P>
<P>The randomised trial by <LINK REF="STD-Harvey-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Harvey 2004</LINK> compared installation of free smoke alarms to provision of vouchers for free alarms. This study reported a significantly greater likelihood of having an installed, functioning smoke alarm when the intervention included installation (OR = 4.82; 95% CI 3.97 to 5.85) compared to provision of vouchers. Re-analysis of these data accounting for cluster randomisation did not substantially change these results.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Subgroup analysis of randomised controlled trials</HEADING>
<P>Seven of eight completed trials that evaluated provision of advice promoting smoke alarms as part of routine child health surveillance showed positive effects on smoke alarm ownership, function and acquisition (<LINK REF="STD-Barone-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Barone 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Clamp-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Clamp 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gielen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Gielen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kelly-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kelly 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kendrick-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kendrick 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thomas-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Watson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 2005</LINK>). Overall, intervention families were significantly more likely than control families to own an alarm (OR = 1.96; 1.03 to 3.72) and to have a functioning alarm (OR = 1.46; 1.15 to 1.85). There were also positive effects on acquiring an alarm (with significant heterogeneity) and acquiring a functioning alarm, but these results were based on only two trials.</P>
<P>Seven trial interventions combined discounted or free smoke alarms with education (<LINK REF="STD-Clamp-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Clamp 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DiGuiseppi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">DiGuiseppi 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hendrickson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrickson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kendrick-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kendrick 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-King-2001" TYPE="STUDY">King 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thomas-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Watson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 2005</LINK>). For all four outcomes, offering discounted/free alarms and education resulted in modest, beneficial effects compared to no intervention, results possibly due to chance alone. There was significant heterogeneity among the trials reporting smoke alarm ownership (P = 0.03; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 63.4%) and functioning smoke alarms (P = 0.02; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 63.7%), however, with several of these trials reporting little or no benefit from intervention (<LINK REF="STD-DiGuiseppi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">DiGuiseppi 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kendrick-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kendrick 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-King-2001" TYPE="STUDY">King 2001</LINK>). Compared to providing education alone, offering discounted/free alarms showed slightly greater positive effects on smoke alarm acquisition and ownership, although all confidence intervals overlapped. For ownership and acquisition of functioning alarms, results for trials education alone were based on data from only one trial, with wide confidence intervals, making comparisons between the two types of interventions for these outcomes problematic.</P>
<P>Among five trials with inadequate or unspecified allocation concealment (<LINK REF="STD-Barone-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Barone 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davis-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kelly-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kelly 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mathews-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Mathews 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thomas-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 1984</LINK>), the combined effect of intervention on smoke alarm ownership (OR = 1.33; 95% CI 0.97 to 1.82) was somewhat higher than that in the five trials with adequate concealment (<LINK REF="STD-Clamp-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Clamp 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DiGuiseppi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">DiGuiseppi 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kendrick-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kendrick 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-King-2001" TYPE="STUDY">King 2001</LINK>) (OR = 1.12; 95% CI 0.65 to 1.94, with significant heterogeneity, P = 0.05). For functioning smoke alarms, four studies with inadequate or unclear concealment (<LINK REF="STD-Barone-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Barone 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gielen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gielen 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hendrickson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrickson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mathews-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Mathews 1988</LINK>) showed a larger positive effect on functioning smoke alarms than did six studies with adequate concealment (<LINK REF="STD-Clamp-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Clamp 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DiGuiseppi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">DiGuiseppi 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gielen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Gielen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kendrick-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kendrick 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-King-2001" TYPE="STUDY">King 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Watson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 2005</LINK>) but the number of trials was small and all differences may have been due to chance.</P>
<P>There were seven trials with unblinded (or unspecified) outcomes assessment that compared intervention and control groups and reported outcomes. Effects of intervention were substantially stronger for all outcomes among these trials than were the effects seen among eight trials with blinded outcomes assessment. For example, for smoke alarm ownership, OR = 2.13 (95% CI 0.94 to 4.82) among trials with unblinded outcomes assessment, versus OR = 1.03 (95% CI 0.75 to 1.42) for trials with blinded outcomes assessment. Trials with unblinded assessment showed a much larger positive effect on functioning smoke alarms (OR = 2.25; 95% CI 0.78 to 6.51) than did trials with blinded assessment (OR = 1.27; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.59). For both smoke alarm ownership and functioning smoke alarms, there was more heterogeneity among trials with unblinded (or unspecified) outcomes assessment than among trials with blinded outcomes assessment.</P>

Both showed modest beneficial effects of intervention consistent with randomised trials in similar settings. <LINK REF="STD-LeBailly-1990" TYPE="STUDY">LeBailly 1990</LINK> did not see any effect in the group offered injury prevention counselling alone, but the study did not control for significant differences among groups in home ownership, education, and income, all of which are associated with alarm ownership (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1996</LINK>). In addition, ownership was greater than 90% in all groups after intervention.</P>
<P>A trial offering education and free smoke alarms in the home (<LINK REF="STD-Johnston-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Johnston 2000</LINK>) showed a modest increase in functioning alarms with intervention (100% versus 95%; adjusted RR = 1.06; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.12). A greater effect was seen on acquisition of functioning alarms (6.0% versus 2.1%; RR = 2.37; 95% CI 0.52 to 10.86) although this effect may have been due to chance. Results were not inconsistent with the widely varying results of home interventions reported among randomised trials.</P>

In contrast, a randomised controlled trial that evaluated a door-to-door smoke alarm give-away programme found no evidence of a reduction in fire-related injuries, either total injuries (rate ratio 1.3; 95% CI 0.9 to 1.9) or serious injuries (that is, hospitalization or death) alone (rate ratio 1.3; 95% CI 0.7 to 2.3) (<LINK REF="STD-DiGuiseppi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">DiGuiseppi 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Community injury prevention education produced a modest, non-significant effect on burn injuries (<LINK REF="STD-SCIPP-1989" TYPE="STUDY">SCIPP 1989</LINK>) and there was no apparent benefit from community burn prevention education (<LINK REF="STD-Project-Burn-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Project Burn 1979</LINK>). Because these trials assessed all types of burns, but excluded smoke inhalation, results are not directly comparable to those from the trials of alarm give-away programmes, which specifically assessed fire-related injuries, including smoke inhalation.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-08-06 23:28:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Principal findings</HEADING>
<P>Evidence from randomised and non-randomised controlled trials indicates that existing interventions to promote smoke alarms are likely to have at most a modest effect, if any, on smoke alarm ownership, function, or acquisition. The results were sensitive to type of intervention and study quality. In particular, trials with blinded outcome assessment showed little or no apparent effect from such interventions, suggesting that lack of blinding may have positively biased results in some studies. Few trials have evaluated the effect of interventions promoting smoke alarms on fires or fire-related injuries, and these have yielded inconsistent results.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Clinical counselling and education in the context of routine child health surveillance</HEADING>
<P>Modest, statistically significant beneficial effects on smoke alarm outcomes were seen among trials evaluating counselling and education in the context of routine child health surveillance. Based on our results, the estimated number of families that clinicians would have to counsel to influence one additional family to have an installed, working smoke alarm varies with baseline prevalence in the clinical practice: 14 families if 20% have working alarms, 10 families if 50% have working alarms, and 32 families if 90% own alarms. It should be noted that about half of the trials involving smoke alarm promotion in the context of child health surveillance did not report blinded outcomes assessment, which may have positively biased their results. Although observational studies support a substantial beneficial effect of smoke alarm ownership on fire-related injuries (<LINK REF="REF-DiGuiseppi-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">DiGuiseppi 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marshall-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Runyan-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Runyan 1992</LINK>), there were no data from randomised controlled trials on the effects of counselling or education in the clinical setting on fire-related injuries. Because fire-related injuries are a leading cause of injury death in childhood, the net benefit of educational or counselling interventions in the clinical setting may be important. However, its effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in relation to fire injuries prevented has not been adequately evaluated.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Home, school, and community-based education</HEADING>
<P>Results from randomised controlled trials do not support a strong beneficial effect of home- or school-based education on smoke alarm outcomes, and there were no data from these trials on the effects of education at home or in school on fire-related injuries. One non-randomised trial found a beneficial effect on fires of mandatory tenant education on fire safety (<LINK REF="STD-McConnell-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McConnell 1996</LINK>), but this result has not been confirmed in other studies.</P>
<P>No randomised trials have evaluated the effect of mass media and community-based injury prevention education programmes on smoke alarms or fire-related injuries, and non-randomised trials do not support a beneficial effect of such programmes on either smoke alarm ownership or burn incidence. One study author attributed this to attenuation in the numbers who hear, then understand, then act on such information (<LINK REF="STD-Project-Burn-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Project Burn 1979</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Distribution of free or discounted smoke alarms</HEADING>
<P>Providing free or discounted smoke alarms did appear to have a modestly greater effect on smoke alarm ownership and functioning alarms than did education alone, but differences were small and may have been due to chance. Although one might expect that giving an alarm to the family would increase owned and functioning alarms, the lack of an effect might be expected if families or households who are given an alarm lacked interest in or awareness of the value of having a working alarm, or lacked the skills, capacity or tools required to install and maintain it.</P>
<P>Effects of the door-to-door distribution of free smoke alarms on fire-related injuries were examined in two community trials (<LINK REF="STD-DiGuiseppi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">DiGuiseppi 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mallonee-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mallonee 1996</LINK>). The trial by <LINK REF="STD-Mallonee-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mallonee 1996</LINK>, which showed a strong beneficial effect on injuries, was not randomised, so selection bias or regression to the mean may have exaggerated its effects. In contrast, in a randomised controlled trial, <LINK REF="STD-DiGuiseppi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">DiGuiseppi 2002</LINK> found no evidence of a beneficial effect on fire-related injuries. In addition, neither trial demonstrated a reduction in fires. <LINK REF="STD-Mallonee-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mallonee 1996</LINK> did not evaluate smoke alarm outcomes in the control population, and <LINK REF="STD-DiGuiseppi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">DiGuiseppi 2002</LINK> found no increase in installed and working alarms after intervention.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Installation of free smoke alarms</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Harvey-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Harvey 2004</LINK> demonstrated a substantially greater beneficial effect on having a working smoke alarm when free alarms were installed compared to providing vouchers for free alarms, suggesting this may be a more effective intervention. <LINK REF="STD-Schwarz-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Schwarz 1993</LINK> also demonstrated a strong beneficial effect on the prevalence of working smoke alarms when free alarms were installed in the homes. This study reported significant reductions in the incidence of fire-related injuries in the intervention areas. However, <LINK REF="STD-Schwarz-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Schwarz 1993</LINK> was not a randomised trial, hence selection bias or regression to the mean may have exaggerated its effects. In addition, the cost-effectiveness of installation programmes has not been evaluated.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Exploring heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>There was statistically significant heterogeneity in the main analysis regarding smoke alarm ownership. Subgroup analyses suggest that some of this heterogeneity may be accounted for by differences in setting, intervention, and study quality. For example, there was no heterogeneity when analyses were restricted to smoke alarm promotion as part of routine child health surveillance, programmes involving education alone, or trials with blinded outcomes assessment. There was little evidence of heterogeneity in analyses involving other outcomes, in particular prevalence of working smoke alarms, suggesting such outcomes may be more consistently measured or more consistently affected by alarm promotion programmes.</P>
<P>Post hoc examination of results suggests that variations in other factors may also influence results. In the only two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-King-2001" TYPE="STUDY">King 2001</LINK>) involving families of injured children, ownership and acquisition were equally high in control and intervention families, so there was no apparent effect of intervention. Having an injured child may lead to safety behaviour changes so large that they obscure any safety education effects. Exclusion of these two trials results in stronger intervention effects on alarm ownership (OR = 1.35; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.74), functioning smoke alarms (OR = 1.42; 95% CI 1.00 to 2.02), and other alarm outcomes, with reduced heterogeneity.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-King-2001" TYPE="STUDY">King 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-DiGuiseppi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">DiGuiseppi 2002</LINK> were the only randomised trials in which the intervention was delivered by research assistants rather than a health professional, teacher, community worker, or other trained professional. When these trials are excluded, there is a stronger positive effect of intervention on smoke alarm ownership (OR = 1.37; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.84), functioning smoke alarms (OR=1.53; 95% CI 1.05 to 2.23), and other alarm outcomes, with reduced heterogeneity. The relationship established between the family and their doctor, nurse, teacher or community worker may be an important aspect of effective intervention, a hypothesis supported by the subgroup analysis of routine child health surveillance.</P>
<P>Finally, in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kendrick-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kendrick 1999</LINK>) the response rate was notably poor and there was systematic response bias, in that control responders were more likely than intervention responders to live in rental accommodation, have lower socioeconomic status and live in deprived areas (written communication, D Kendrick, University of Nottingham, 2 September 1999). Because these factors are associated with reduced smoke alarm ownership (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1996</LINK>), the estimate of the effect of the intervention might have been biased upward. However, results were not materially affected by exclusion of this trial, except that a stronger effect was seen on acquisition of alarms, which may have been due to chance.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Limitations</HEADING>
<P>Publication bias, which threatens the validity of systematic reviews, may arise if research is unpublished or if outcome data are selectively omitted from published reports, which often occurs because the results fail to reach statistical significance (<LINK REF="REF-Dickersin-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickersin 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Easterbrook-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Easterbrook 1991</LINK>). To minimise this, we searched for unpublished trials and wrote to the authors of any trials in which the methods and intervention were eligible to ask if relevant outcomes were measured. Eight trials were identified after author and organisational contacts, including seven completed trials (<LINK REF="STD-Gielen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Gielen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harvey-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Harvey 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kendrick-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kendrick 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-King-2001" TYPE="STUDY">King 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-LeBailly-1990" TYPE="STUDY">LeBailly 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ploeg-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Ploeg 1994</LINK>). Many investigators also provided unpublished data on smoke alarm or injury outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Clamp-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Clamp 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hendrickson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrickson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kendrick-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kendrick 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-King-2001" TYPE="STUDY">King 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ploeg-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Ploeg 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schwarz-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Schwarz 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-SCIPP-1989" TYPE="STUDY">SCIPP 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smithson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Smithson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Watson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The authors of three potentially eligible trials did not respond, so we were unable to determine their eligibility. We could not locate the text or authors for two further citations. Four of these were known to be non-randomised, and the fifth (Botruff 1992), as a community intervention, was probably not randomised. Hence, their omission is unlikely to have biased our meta-analyses.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Our review suggests that at best, only modest increases in the prevalence of working smoke alarms result from educational interventions promoting smoke alarms, whether or not free or discounted smoke alarms are also provided. Smoke alarm promotion delivered as part of child health surveillance appears to be effective in increasing the prevalence of owned and functioning smoke alarms, although several studies on which these conclusions are based suffered from methodological weaknesses, and injury outcomes have not been evaluated in these settings. Nevertheless, such interventions may be considered, particularly among high risk populations with a low prevalence of smoke alarms. Existing evidence does not support the implementation of community-based programmes, including smoke alarm give-away programmes, mass media, or injury prevention education, to increase the prevalence of installed and functioning smoke alarms or reduce the incidence of fires or fire-related injuries. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>While community programmes that provide and install smoke alarms appear to increase the prevalence of working alarms and reduce fire-related injuries, the quality of that evidence is limited and such interventions are likely to be costly. The evidence in support of smoke alarm promotion delivered as part of routine child health surveillance has methodological limitations, and injury outcomes have not been evaluated in these settings. Further trials to evaluate community smoke alarm installation programmes or smoke alarm promotion as part of child health surveillance in primary care should assess their impact on fire-related injuries, using randomisation, adequate allocation concealment and blinded outcomes assessment, and should incorporate cost-effectiveness analyses.</P>
