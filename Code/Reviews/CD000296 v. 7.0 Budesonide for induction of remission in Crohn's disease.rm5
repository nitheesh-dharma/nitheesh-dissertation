<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-05-29 14:19:23 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>
<B>What is Crohn's disease?</B> <BR/>Crohn's disease is a debilitating long-term (chronic) inflammatory bowel disease that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus. Symptoms include abdominal pain, non-bloody diarrhea and weight loss. The most common initial treatment of the Crohn's disease is oral steroid therapy. Unfortunately, traditional steroids are usually absorbed into the body and cause significant unwanted side effects. These may include but are not limited to weight gain, diabetes, growth retardation, acne, mood instability, and high blood pressure. When people with Crohn's disease are experiencing symptoms of the disease it is said to be &#8216;active&#8217;; periods when the symptoms stop are called &#8216;remission&#8217;.</P>
<P>
<B>What is budesonide?</B> <BR/>Budesonide is a steroid that is quickly metabolized by the liver thereby reducing corticosteroid-related side effects.</P>
<P>
<B>What did the researchers investigate?</B> <BR/>The researchers investigated whether budesonide produces remission in people with active Crohn's disease; and whether these medications cause any harms (side effects). The researchers searched the medical literature up to June 12, 2014.</P>
<P>
<B>What did the researchers find?</B> <BR/>The researchers identified 14 studies that included a total of 1805 participants. Nine studies (779 participants) compared budesonide to conventional corticosteroids, three studies (535 participants) compared budesonide to a placebo (e.g. a sugar pill), and two studies (491 participants) compared budesonide to mesalamine (an anti-inflammatory drug composed of 5-aminosalicylic acid). Ten studies were judged to be of high quality. Four studies were judged to be of low quality. </P>
<P>Budesonide was superior to placebo for induction of remission. An increase in side effects was not seen with budesonide compared to placebo. Withdrawals due to disease worsening were similar in budesonide and placebo groups. Budesonide patients were more likely than placebo patients to experience adrenal suppression a condition in which the adrenal glands do not produce adequate amounts of steroid hormones. </P>
<P>Budesonide was significantly less effective than conventional steroids for induction of remission in people with Crohn's disease. However, fewer side effects occurred in those treated with budesonide compared to conventional steroids and budesonide was better than conventional steroids in preserving adrenal function.</P>
<P>One study (n = 182) found budesonide to be superior to mesalamine for induction of remission in patients with Crohn's disease whereas another study found no difference in remission rates. </P>
<P>The current evidence does not allow for a firm conclusion on the relative efficacy of budesonide compared to 5-aminosalicylic products. Budesonide is more effective than placebo for induction of remission in Crohn's disease. Although budesonide is less effective than conventional steroids for induction of remission the likelihood of side effects and adrenal suppression is lower than with conventional steroids. </P>

<P>Two independent investigators reviewed studies for eligibility, extracted the data and assessed study quality. Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool The overall quality of the evidence supporting the outcomes was evaluated using the GRADE criteria. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3.5 software. The primary outcome was induction of remission (defined by a Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) &lt; 150) by week 8 to 16 of treatment. Secondary outcomes included: time to remission, mean change in CDAI, clinical, histological or endoscopic improvement, improvement in quality of life, adverse events and early withdrawal. We calculated the relative risk (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each dichotomous outcome and the mean difference and corresponding 95% CI for each continuous outcome. Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. A random-effects model was used for the pooled analyses. The overall quality of the evidence supporting the primary outcomes and selected secondary outcomes was evaluated using the GRADE criteria.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-05-29 14:33:42 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Fourteen studies (1805 patients) were included: Nine (779 patients) compared budesonide to conventional corticosteroids, three (535 patients) were placebo-controlled, and two (491 patients) compared budesonide to mesalamine. Ten studies were judged to be at low risk of bias. Three studies were judged to be at high risk of bias due to open label design. One study was judged to be at high risk of bias due to selective reporting. After eight weeks of treatment, 9 mg budesonide was significantly more effective than placebo for induction of clinical remission. Forty-seven per cent (115/246) of budesonide patients achieved remission at 8 weeks compared to 22% (29/133) of placebo patients (RR 1.93, 95% CI 1.37 to 2.73; 3 studies, 379 patients). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence for this outcome was moderate due to sparse data (144 events). Budesonide was significantly less effective than conventional steroids for induction of remission at eight weeks. Fifty-two per cent of budesonide patients achieved remission at week 8 compared to 61% of patients who received conventional steroids (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.97; 8 studies, 750 patients). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence for this outcome was moderate due to risk of bias. Budesonide was significantly less effective than conventional steroids among patients with severe disease (CDAI &gt; 300) (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.95). Studies comparing budesonide to mesalamine were not pooled due to heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 81%). One study (n = 182) found budesonide to be superior to mesalamine for induction of remission at 8 weeks. Sixty-eight per cent (63/93) of budesonide patients were in remission at 8 weeks compared to 42% (37/89) of mesalamine patients (RR 1.63, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.16). The other study found no statistically significant difference in remission rates at eight weeks. Sixty-nine per cent (107/154) of budesonide patients were in remission at 8 weeks compared to 62% (132/242) of mesalamine patients (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.32). Fewer adverse events occurred in those treated with budesonide compared to conventional steroids (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.76) and budesonide was better than conventional steroids in preserving adrenal function (RR for abnormal ACTH test 0.65, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.78). </P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-05-29 14:18:35 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Budesonide is more effective than placebo for induction of remission in Crohn's disease. Although short-term efficacy with budesonide is less than with conventional steroids, particularly in those with severe disease or more extensive colonic involvement, the likelihood of adverse events and adrenal suppression with budesonide is lower. The current evidence does not allow for a firm conclusion on the relative efficacy of budesonide compared to 5-ASA products.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-04-11 20:23:32 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Crohn's disease (CD) is characterized by transmural inflammation that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract. It is a chronic condition with a relapsing and remitting course for which there is no cure. Medications are designed to suppress the inflammatory response. A variety of therapeutic agents have been used to treat Crohn's disease, including corticosteroids, 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) products (e.g. sulfasalazine or mesalamine), Immunosuppressants (e.g. azathioprine and methotrexate) and more recently biologic agents, such as antibodies against tumour necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNF-&#945;) (<LINK REF="REF-Baumgart-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baumgart 2007</LINK>) and &#945;<SUB>4</SUB>&#946;<SUB>7</SUB> integrin (<LINK REF="REF-Sandborn-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandborn 2013</LINK>). Since the 1950s, corticosteroids have been widely used for the treatment of CD and they have been demonstrated to be more effective than placebo or 5-ASA products (<LINK REF="REF-Truelove-1954" TYPE="REFERENCE">Truelove 1954</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Singleton-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singleton 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Summers-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Summers 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Winship-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winship 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Malchow-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malchow 1984</LINK>) for treating acute flares of CD in adults and children. While the introduction of newer biologic agents including infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab and vedolizumab (<LINK REF="REF-Targan-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Targan 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hanauer-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanauer 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sandborn-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandborn 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sandborn-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandborn 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hazlewood-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hazlewood 2015</LINK>) are starting to change treatment paradigms, they are not as readily available and are far most costly than corticosteroids.</P>
<P>Corticosteroids inhibit protein synthesis and transcription, and ultimately downregulate the production of NF- &#409;B and inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 2005</LINK>). Unfortunately, systemically-administered corticosteroids are associated with multiple adverse events ranging from cosmetic disturbances such as moon facies, hirsutism and acne; to more serious disturbances, such as growth failure in children; to potentially life threatening complications such as infection, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, and glaucoma (<LINK REF="REF-Baumgart-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baumgart 2007</LINK>). Newer agents such as budesonide, a glucocorticoid with anti-inflammatory properties and limited systemic bioavailability due to extensive (90%) first pass hepatic metabolism by cytochrome p-450 enzymes, may limit adverse effects and may be a promising option if shown to be efficacious and safe.</P>
<P>The use of an oral controlled release preparation of budesonide, designed to deliver the drug to the distal small intestine, was first described in pilot studies in the early 1990's (<LINK REF="STD-Lofberg-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lofberg 1993</LINK>). There are two formulations of budesonide used for the treatment of CD; controlled-ileal release (Entocort® - Astra Zeneca or Astra Draco, Lund Sweden; Entocir®, Sofar S.p.A, Trezzano Rosa [MI], Italy) and pH-dependent release budesonide (Budenofalk® or Budeson® - Dr. Falk Pharma). The controlled-ileal release (CIR) formulation uses a gelatin capsule containing acid-stable microgranules composed of an inner sugar core surrounded by a layer of budesonide in ethylcellulose and an outer acrylic-based resin coating (Eudragit L100-55) that dissolves at a pH of 5.5 or higher. Absorption of this formulation in the ileocecal region is approximately 69 percent. The pH-dependent release formulations are available as capsules which contain 400 pellets with a diameter of 1 mm, coated with Eudragit resistant to a pH &lt; 6.0 (<LINK REF="REF-Fedorak-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fedorak 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Importance of this review</B>
<BR/>Standard medical therapeutic options for CD vary in efficacy and toxicity. Alternative treatments are continually being evaluated. There are a number of systematic reviews and meta-analyses examining the efficacy of budesonide for the induction of remission in CD (<LINK REF="REF-Papi-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papi 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nos-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nos 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kane-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kane 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ford-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ford 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Otley-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Otley 2005</LINK>); however, these studies did not include the most recent trials that assessed the efficacy and safety of budesonide (<LINK REF="STD-Tromm-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Tromm 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Suzuki-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Suzuki 2013</LINK>). This review provides a comprehensive update with an expanded search strategy, and includes a number of additional studies in which efficacy or safety were not listed as the primary outcome. This update also evaluates the efficacy and safety of different doses of budesonide compared to placebo. Due to the widespread use of traditional corticosteroids in CD and considering their significant adverse event profile, it is important to carefully examine the efficacy and safety of budesonide in order to provide an evidence-based approach to the risk/benefit profile of this medication.</P>

<P>
<B>Study selection</B>
<BR/>All the article abstracts identified by the above search strategies were reviewed for eligibility. The full text articles of potentially relevant studies were reviewed independently by AR and MEK for inclusion in the review. Review articles were also retrieved and reference lists were manually searched. Disagreements were resolved by consensus with CHS and EIB. Trials published in abstract form were only included if full details of the protocol and results could be obtained from the authors.</P>
<P>
<B>Data collection</B>
<BR/>The eligible articles were independently reviewed by two authors (AR, MEK) and the results of the trials were abstracted onto specially designed data extraction forms. The following information was recorded:<BR/>1. General article information (study title, first author, and year of publication);<BR/>2. Study design (randomisation process, allocation concealment, and blinding);<BR/>3. Patient cohort (countries in which the study was performed, years patients were entered into the study, total number of patients screened and randomised, inclusion/exclusion criteria, baseline characteristics including demographics, disease extent, disease severity);<BR/>4. Intervention (budesonide formulation, route of administration, dose and dosing schedule);<BR/>5. Control (placebo, or details of co-intervention);<BR/>6. Primary outcome (proportion of patients achieving remission defined as CDAI <U>&lt;</U> 150 by 8 to 16 weeks of therapy in the intervention and control groups; and<BR/>7. Secondary outcomes (time to remission; mean change in the disease activity index score; clinical, histologic or endoscopic improvement; improvement in quality of life; adverse events and withdrawal of participants from either the intervention or control group).</P>
<P>
<B>Assessment of methodological quality of included studies</B>
<BR/>
</P>
<P>We used the Cochrane risk of bias tool to assess the methodological quality of the included studies (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). The following study characteristics were assessed:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Randomization sequence generation;</LI>
<LI>Allocation concealment;</LI>
<LI>Blinding of participants, outcome assessors and investigators;</LI>
<LI>Incomplete outcome reporting (i.e. there was an acceptable method of dealing with attrition);</LI>
<LI>Selective outcome reporting (i.e. all outcomes described in the methods were included in the analysis); and</LI>
<LI>Other potential sources of bias.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Based on these characteristics, studies were judged to have a high, low or unclear risk of bias.</P>
<P>We used the GRADE approach to assess the overall quality of evidence for the primary outcome and selected secondary outcomes of interest. Outcomes from pooling of randomised trials start as high quality evidence, but may be downgraded due to: (1) risk of bias, (2) indirectness of evidence, (3) inconsistency (unexplained heterogeneity), (4) imprecision (sparse data), and (5) reporting bias (publication bias). The overall quality of evidence for each outcome was determined after considering each of these elements, and categorized as high quality (i.e. further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect); moderate quality (i.e. further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate); low quality (i.e. further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate); or very low quality (i.e. we are very uncertain about the estimate) (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?document=554E6DC782E26AA20113126E80F706E4&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Guyatt-2008">Guyatt 2008</A>; <A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?document=554E6DC782E26AA20113126E80F706E4&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2011">Schünemann 2011</A>).</P>
<P>
<B>Statistical analysis</B>
<BR/>Measures of treatment effect<BR/>Data were extracted from the original studies and converted into individual 2 x 2 tables (e.g. remission versus no remission x budesonide versus control) for each study. The proportion of patients who entered remission was calculated and reported as a relative risk (RR) and 95% CI. For continuous variables, the results were presented as the weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% CI or the standardised mean difference (SMD) when the outcomes were not comparable. Where available, individual 2 x 2 tables for strata within studies were also abstracted.</P>
<P>Meta-analysis<BR/>Random-effects models were utilised throughout to take account of the between-study variance in our findings (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>). Variability is to be expected among studies which assess CD given the underlying differences in disease phenotype and patient-related variables which are not reported in detail.</P>
<P>Assessment of heterogeneity<BR/>The studies were independently assessed for clinical or methodological heterogeneity. The <I>I<SUP>2</SUP>
</I> measure was calculated to quantify inconsistency and aided in the decision of whether to pool studies. This measure describes the percentage of total variation across studies due to heterogeneity rather than chance, and was interpreted as follows: low heterogeneity (25%), moderate heterogeneity (50%), high heterogeneity (75%) (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). The Cochrane chi-square test (Q test) was also calculated. Being a relatively insensitive test for the presence of heterogeneity, a <I>p</I> value of &lt; 0.10 was considered to be statistically significant.</P>
<P>Subgroup analysis<BR/>A priori subgroup analyses were planned for the different doses, different durations of treatment, disease severity, disease location and age of the study subjects (paediatric versus adult).</P>
<P>Sensitivity analysis<BR/>A sensitivity analysis was performed excluding poor quality studies. There were no included studies that were published in abstract form only. A separate sensitivity analysis for abstract studies was not required.</P>
<P>Analyses were performed using Review Manager software (RevMan 5.3.5, Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2014).</P>

<P>The literature search conducted on 12 June 2014 identified a total of 2744 records. After duplicates were removed, a total of 2167 studies remained for review of titles and abstracts. Forty-nine studies were selected for full text review (see <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). Thirty-three studies were excluded (See <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>). Sixteen reports of 14 studies (1805 patients) were eligible for inclusion. All patients had CD involving the ileum or the right colon or both. Agreement among reviewers regarding the eligibility of the included studies was 100%. Budesonide was compared with traditional corticosteroids (i.e. prednisone, prednisolone, or 6-methylprednisolone) in nine studies with a total of 779 patients (<LINK REF="STD-Bar_x002d_Meir-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bar-Meir 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Campieri-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Campieri 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Haens-1998" TYPE="STUDY">D'Haens 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Escher-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Escher 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gross-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gross 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Levine-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Levine 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rutgeerts-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Rutgeerts 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tursi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tursi 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Ierssel-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Van Ierssel 1995</LINK>). Three studies (535 patients) compared budesonide to placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Greenberg-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Greenberg 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tremaine-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tremaine 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Suzuki-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Suzuki 2013</LINK>). Two studies (491 patients) compared budesonide to 5-ASA (Thomsen 2002; <LINK REF="STD-Tromm-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Tromm 2011</LINK>). Adult patients were included in twelve studies while two trials included paediatric patients (<LINK REF="STD-Escher-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Escher 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Levine-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Levine 2003</LINK>). With regards to different formulations of budesonide, budesonide CIR was used in ten studies (<LINK REF="STD-Campieri-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Campieri 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Haens-1998" TYPE="STUDY">D'Haens 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Escher-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Escher 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greenberg-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Greenberg 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rutgeerts-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Rutgeerts 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thomsen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Thomsen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tremaine-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tremaine 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tursi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tursi 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Ierssel-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Van Ierssel 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Suzuki-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Suzuki 2013</LINK>), and four studies used a pH-dependent formulation (<LINK REF="STD-Bar_x002d_Meir-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bar-Meir 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gross-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gross 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Levine-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Levine 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tromm-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Tromm 2011</LINK>). Active disease was defined by a CDAI of 150 or greater and most studies used a minimum value of 200. A single study used the PCDAI (minimum value 12.5) for defining active disease in paediatric patients (<LINK REF="STD-Levine-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Levine 2003</LINK>). The <LINK REF="STD-Thomsen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Thomsen 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Tromm-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Tromm 2011</LINK> studies specified a maximum allowable CDAI of 400 and one study allowed a maximum CDAI of 450 (<LINK REF="STD-Tremaine-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tremaine 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>All studies using the CIR formulation included patients with Crohn's disease limited to the ileum and or the ascending colon. The four studies utilizing the pH-dependent formulation of budesonide included patients with more extensive colonic involvement. The use of concomitant therapies such as 5-ASA preparations, antibiotics, or total enteral or parenteral nutrition were permitted in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Escher-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Escher 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Suzuki-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Suzuki 2013</LINK>). In the <LINK REF="STD-Escher-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Escher 2004</LINK> study, participants were eligible if the dose of 5-ASA or antibiotics was stable for more than 30 days before study entry and for the duration of the study. In <LINK REF="STD-Suzuki-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Suzuki 2013</LINK> study, concomitant therapy with sulfasalazine, 5-ASA, or enteral nutritional therapy (900 kcal/day was allowed if a constant dose was maintained throughout the trial.</P>
<P>Adverse events were recorded for all studies. However, there was lack of uniformity in the definitions of corticosteroid-related adverse events. While tests of adrenal suppression were employed, some studies measured raw cortisol values, whilst others measured ACTH stimulated values. Five studies included quality of life assessments as a secondary outcome measure. The Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) was used in five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bar_x002d_Meir-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bar-Meir 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greenberg-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Greenberg 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tremaine-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tremaine 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tursi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tursi 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Suzuki-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Suzuki 2013</LINK>).

<B>BUDESONIDE VERSUS PLACEBO </B>
<BR/>There were three large multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, controlled trials comparing budesonide to placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Greenberg-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Greenberg 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tremaine-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tremaine 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Suzuki-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Suzuki 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Greenberg-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Greenberg 1994</LINK>
<BR/>This was a large multi-centre, randomised, double-blind trial comparing budesonide to placebo. This trial was conducted in 27 Canadian centres and recruited 258 patients with active CD (CDAI &gt; 200). Patients were centrally randomised into four study groups: budesonide 3 mg (n = 67), budesonide 9 mg (n = 61), budesonide 15 mg (n = 64) or placebo (n = 66). Patients were stratified by treatment centre and whether they received corticosteroid treatment for longer than two weeks in the preceding year. The primary outcome measure was clinical remission (CDAI <U>&lt;</U> 150) assessed at eight weeks, at which point the study medications were tapered. The total treatment duration was 10 weeks. Criteria for withdrawal included the need for additional therapy (excluding anti-diarrheal agents), disease worsening, or lack of improvement. This was defined as a CDAI &#8805; 400, an increase from baseline by 100 points at week 2, or a CDAI &#8805; 300 which had not decreased by 100 points by week 4 or thereafter. A total of 119 of 258 patients (46%) withdrew prematurely, with 96 (81%) withdrawing as a result of insufficient therapeutic effect. More premature withdrawals occurred in the 3 mg budesonide (45%) and placebo (48%) groups compared with the 9 mg (26%) and 15 mg (28%) budesonide groups. The incidence of adverse events leading to study withdrawal was no greater in patients receiving budesonide compared to placebo (5.2% versus 4.5%). At 8 weeks, the proportion achieving remission with 9 mg budesonide (51%) and budesonide 15 mg (43%) was significantly higher than that in the placebo group (20%; P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.009 respectively) or the 3 mg budesonide group (33% P = 0.03). Patients treated with 9 mg budesonide achieved a significantly larger decrease in CDAI when compared to those receiving 3 mg budesonide or placebo (P &lt; 0.001). Improved health related quality of life (HRQOL), as measured by the IBDQ, was demonstrated in those receiving 9 mg or 15 mg of budesonide versus placebo (P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.012 respectively). More detailed information on HRQOL is reported in a secondary publication (Irvine 2000). Patients treated with 9 mg of budesonide had significantly better bowel, systemic, social and emotional subscores. Furthermore, improved HRQOL scores correlated well with decreased CDAI scores. Adrenal suppression (as measured by plasma cortisol levels and the corticotropin stimulation test) was more pronounced in the 9 and 15 mg budesonide groups compared to baseline values and placebo (P &lt; 0.001). The authors concluded that the 9 mg dose of budesonide was the lowest effective dose for inducing remission in patients with active Crohn's disease.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Tremaine-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tremaine 2002</LINK>
<BR/>In the <LINK REF="STD-Tremaine-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tremaine 2002</LINK> study, 200 participants with active CD (CDAI 200 to 400) were centrally randomised into three study groups. Patients were recruited across 24 American centres. Two budesonide groups received a daily dose of 9 mg budesonide, either once daily (n = 80) or 4.5 mg twice daily (n = 79). The third group received placebo (n = 41). The primary outcome measure clinical remission (CDAI &lt; 150) was assessed at eight weeks, at which point the study medications were tapered. The total treatment duration was 10 weeks. Criteria for withdrawal from the study included: worsening disease defined by an increase in the CDAI of greater than 100 points from baseline or a CDAI exceeding 450; symptoms requiring additional medications, hospitalisation or surgery; or noncompliance. This trial used an unbalanced randomisation schedule of 2:2:1 (budesonide once daily; budesonide twice daily; versus placebo). The withdrawal rate was 20% (39/200), and 15 participants withdrew because of worsening disease. There was no statistically significant difference in the number of patients withdrawing from the three study groups. An intention-to-treat analysis at 8 weeks showed no statistically significant difference in the proportion achieving remission in the placebo group (31.7%, 13/41) compared to once daily (46.2%, 37/80) or twice daily budesonide (51.9%, 41/79). Post hoc analysis revealed a statistically significant difference in the median time to remission between budesonide (27 days) and placebo (66 days). There were no statistically significant differences in HRQOL (budesonide versus placebo, P = 0.13). Placebo treated patients were more likely to maintain normal adrenal function (83%) compared to those receiving budesonide (53%; P &lt; 0.01). There was no difference in the ability to respond to adrenal stimulation between the groups. There was no difference in the proportion of participants experiencing adverse events.</P>

</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Suzuki-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Suzuki 2013</LINK> study, 77 patients with active CD (CDAI &gt; 200) were centrally randomised to placebo (n = 26), 9 mg once daily budesonide (n = 26) or 15 mg once daily budesonide (n = 25). This study enrolled patients from 21 Japanese centres. The primary outcome measure clinical remission (CDAI &#8804; 150) was assessed at 8 weeks, at which point the study medications were tapered. The total treatment duration was 10 weeks. Criteria for withdrawal from the study included: disease worsening, fistula or abscess formation, hospitalisation and obstructive symptoms. Demographics and baseline characteristics of the treatment groups were similar. A total of 14 patients (18.2%) withdrew from the study. There was no statistically significant difference in the number of patients withdrawing from the three study groups. An intention-to-treat analysis at week 8 showed higher remission rates in the budesonide arms compared to those treated with placebo (23.1% (6/26), 28.0% (7/25), and 11.5% (3/26) for budesonide 9 mg, 15 mg, and placebo, respectively); however, these differences were not reach statistically significant. There was no significant difference in remission rates between the budesonide 9 mg and 15 mg arms (p = 0.14). Similarly, clinical improvement (defined as a &#8805;100 decrease in CDAI score from baseline) was not significantly different among the groups (23.1% (6/26), 36.0% (9/25), and 15.4% (426) for budesonide 9 mg, 15 mg, and placebo, respectively). Mean IBDQ scores improved in all the study arms without any statistically significant difference (10.8±33.6, 23.2±24.6, and 6.5±29.4 points for budesonide 9 mg, budesonide 15 mg and placebo, respectively). While no steroid-related adverse effects were observed in the placebo arm, some of the patients in the budesonide arms experience these adverse events (9 mg: acne [n=1; 3.8%]; 15 mg: acne [n=2; 8.0%], acne flare [n=1; 2.0%], and moon facies [n=1; 2.0%]). None of these adverse events led to withdrawal from the study. Two adverse events leading to withdrawal occurred in each arm, none of these adverse events were considered to be related to budesonide.<BR/>

<LINK REF="STD-Thomsen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Thomsen 1998</LINK>
<BR/>This randomised, double-blind, double dummy study compared budesonide (CIR formulation) 9 mg once daily to mesalamine 2 g twice daily for induction of remission in active Crohn's disease. A total of 182 patients from Europe and Australia were randomised in permuted blocks of four at each of the 25 centres. This study was conducted over a 16 week period. No other medications, apart from anti-diarrheals, were allowed during the study period. Criteria for withdrawal were not defined. The study groups were well matched with respect to baseline characteristics. A larger proportion of the mesalamine group withdrew from the study prematurely (44%) compared to the budesonide (17%; <I>P </I>&lt; 0.001). The main reason for withdrawal was 'worsening Crohn&#8217;s disease' (61%) and 'adverse events' (18%). At 8 weeks, a significantly greater proportion of patients in the budesonide group (68%, 63/93) achieved remission compared to the mesalamine group (42%, 37/89; P = 0.001). This difference remained statistically significant at 16 weeks (62% and 36% in the budesonide and mesalamine groups respectively; P &lt; 0.001). Patients achieved remission more quickly in the budesonide group (28 days) compared to mesalamine (58 days; P = 0.12). Remission rates were lower in those with more severe disease (CDAI &gt; 300) or in those with colonic involvement. There was a significantly greater improvement in HRQOL in the budesonide compared to mesalamine (Psychological General Well Being index; P = 0.05). The incidence of adverse reactions did not differ between the two groups. Patients treated with mesalamine were more likely to have a normal increment in cortisol in response to cosyntropin (100% versus 90% in the mesalamine and budesonide groups respectively).</P>

</P>
<P>Tromm et al. compared the efficacy and safety of budesonide to mesalamine in a multi-centre, double-dummy, double-blind randomised trial. Originally designed to evaluate superiority of budesonide over mesalamine, this study was switched to a non-inferiority design because of higher than expected remission rates in the mesalamine arm. A total of 309 patients with active inflammatory ileal, ileocolonic or ascending colon CD (CDAI 200 to 400) were centrally randomised in a 2:1:1 fashion to mesalamine (4.5 g daily, n = 153), budesonide 9 mg once daily (n = 76) or budesonide 3 mg three times daily (n = 78). Two patients randomised to budesonide were excluded from the intention-to-treat analysis because their baseline CDAI was less than 150. The study was conducted in 46 centres in 7 countries including Croatia, Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Israel and Slovakia. The primary outcome of interest (i.e. clinical remission defined as CDAI &#8804; 150) was assessed at week 8. Secondary end points included clinical response (defined as a reduction of &#8805;70 or &#8805;100 in CDAI score compared to baseline), time to clinical remission; change in CDAI score, and therapeutic success or therapeutic benefit on the Physician&#8217;s Global Assessment scale. The only allowable concomitant therapy for CD was 6-mercaptopurine or azathioprine at a stable dose for at least three months prior to randomisation. Only 3.3% (5/154) of mesalamine patients and 3.2% (5/153) of budesonide patients were on concomitant therapy at study entry. Criteria for withdrawal were not defined. An intention-to-treat analysis at week 8 showed that a similar number of patients were in remission in the mesalamine (62%, 95/153) and budesonide (69%, 107/154) arms (<I>P</I> = 0.001 for a priori non-inferiority margin of 10%). Clinical response rates were similar in both treatment arms. No other efficacy end points differed significantly between the treatment arms. A larger proportion of mesalamine patients withdrew from the study prematurely (22.2%) compared to those in the budesonide group (13.0%; P = 0.03). The main reason for premature withdrawal from the study was 'lack of efficacy' (42%) and 'adverse events' (22%). There were no clinically relevant differences in adverse events between the groups.The proportion of patients with a shift from normal morning cortisol levels at baseline to a below-normal level at week 8, was 29% (31/106) in the budesonide arm compared to 3% (3/107 ) of patients in the mesalamine group.</P>

<BR/>This randomised, double-blind, double dummy study compared budesonide CIR formulation with prednisolone for induction of remission in ileal or ileocaecal Crohn's disease. One hundred and seventy-six patients at 11 centres in 6 European countries participated in the study. Patients were randomised in permuted blocks of four at each centre. The intervention was delivered over 10 weeks. Patients receiving budesonide were provided 9 mg once daily for 8 weeks, then 6 mg daily for the last two weeks. Those randomised to prednisolone received 40 mg daily for two weeks, 30 mg for two weeks, and 25 mg for two weeks. The daily dose of prednisolone was then tapered by 5 mg per week for the last four weeks. No other Crohn's disease therapy was allowed, except for anti-diarrheals. There were no statistically significant differences in the baseline characteristics between the two groups. <LINK REF="STD-Rutgeerts-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Rutgeerts 1994</LINK> reported 16 withdrawals from the budesonide group, compared to 15 in the prednisolone group. However, there were an additional two patients in each group who withdrew before week two and these patients were not included in the efficacy analysis. At 8 weeks, the authors reported per-protocol remission rates of 52% and 65% for the budesonide and prednisolone groups respectively (P = 0.12). An intention-to-treat analysis showed remission rates of 51% and 64% respectively. A rapid therapeutic effect was noted, with a substantial decrease in CDAI scores after two weeks of treatment. There was a greater decrease in the mean CDAI value over the 10 week study in the prednisolone group compared with the budesonide group. Glucocorticosteroid-associated adverse events were greater in the prednisolone group (55%) compared with budesonide (33%; P = 0.003). Plasma cortisol levels were significantly suppressed in the prednisolone treated group at all measured time points except for the final 10 week assessment (P = 0.07). At 10 weeks the prednisolone dose was 5 mg/day, while the budesonide dose was 6 mg/day. Prednisolone patients had lower un-stimulated cortisol levels than budesonide patients at all time points.</P>

<BR/>This randomised, double-blind, double dummy, multicentre trial compared a pH-modified release formulation of budesonide with prednisone over an eighty week study period. Falk Pharma provided details on the randomisation process (computer generated sequences, 1:1 ratio, permuted blocks of 4). Budesonide treated patients received 3 mg three times a day while prednisone patients received 40 mg once daily for two weeks, 30 mg of prednisone daily for the third week, then beginning in the fourth week the prednisone dose was tapered by 5 mg per week until the end of the study. No concurrent Crohn's disease therapy was allowed, apart from anti-diarrheals. A total of 201 patients were enrolled in the study. Thirty patients were excluded (16 in the budesonide group, 14 in the prednisone group) as a result of protocol violations leaving 171 patients for the per-protocol analysis. Response was defined as a reduction of the CDAI below 150 with a reduction of <U>&gt;</U> 60 points for patients with a baseline CDAI of &#8804;210 points. Remission was defined as a reduction of the CDAI to &#8804; 150 irrespective of the baseline CDAI (Personal communication with Falk Pharma). There were no statistically significant differences in baseline characteristics between the treatment groups. The study was terminated in 46 patients, 23 in each group due to lack of efficacy, adverse effects, and noncompliance. Intention-to-treat analysis showed a 51% overall response rate in the budesonide group compared to 52.5% in the prednisone group (per-protocol analysis 56% and 55% respectively). At week 8, remission was achieved in 51% (51/100) of the budesonide group compared to 55.4% (56/101) of the prednisone group (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.19). Subgroup analysis showed similar efficacy of budesonide or prednisone for treating disease localized to the terminal ileum, cecum or ascending colon. However, when the disease involved the distal colon and rectum, budesonide was less effective than prednisone (44% versus 62.5%). In a small group of patients (n = 27) with exclusive colonic involvement, 58.8% in the prednisone group responded compared to 20% of the budesonide group. In patients with more severe disease (CDAI &#8805; 300), 44.8% of budesonide patients responded compared to 42.4% of prednisone patients. The authors concluded that both drugs were less effective in patients with more active disease. There was a similar decrease in CDAI in patients treated with budesonide (127.3 points) or prednisone (129.5 points). Improvement in HRQOL was observed in both treatment groups as measured by generic (SF-36) and disease-specific (IBDQ) tools. <LINK REF="STD-Bar_x002d_Meir-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bar-Meir 1998</LINK> concluded that budesonide was as effective as prednisone for the treatment of active Crohn's disease involving the right colon and terminal ileum, with significantly fewer steroid-related adverse events.<BR/>

<BR/>This European multicentre, randomised, double-blind, double dummy study compared an oral pH-modified release formulation of budesonide to 6-methylprednisolone over an eight week study period. The budesonide group received 9 mg once daily (3 X 3 mg) while the control group received a tapering dose schedule of methylprednisolone (48 mg methylprednisolone during week 1, 32 mg during week 2, 24 mg during week 3, 20 mg during week 4, 16 mg during week 5, 12 mg during week 6, and 8 mg in week 7 and 8). The primary outcome was the 'response' rate at eight weeks. Response was defined by a CDAI of &lt; 150 points and a minimum CDAI decrease of 60 points in patients with a baseline CDAI of &lt; 210 points. Of 69 patients randomised, 67 patients who had a CDAI &gt; 150 points at study entry and received at least one daily dose of study medication were included in the analysis. Although the authors reported that the groups were comparable at baseline, a few differences were apparent. Women made up 71% of the budesonide study group compared to 45% of the 6-methylprednisolone group. At study entry the mean duration of Crohn's disease exacerbation in patients treated with budesonide was twice that of 6-methylprednisolone group (104 ± 302 days versus 50 ± 49 days, respectively). There was no significant difference in response at eight weeks between budesonide (56%, 19/34) and 6-methylprednisolone group (73%, 24/33; RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.11). <LINK REF="STD-Gross-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gross 1996</LINK> found comparable response rates for budesonide and 6-methylprednisolone on subgroup analysis of disease location. The response rate for patients with disease distal to the transverse colon was not different between the budesonide and 6-methylprednisolone groups (15/25, 60% versus 14/20, 70%, respectively). Corticosteroid-related adverse events were more common in the 6-methylprednisolone group (23 of 33, 69.7%) than in the budesonide group (10 of 34, 28.6%, P = 0.0015). Most of these corticosteroid-related adverse events were dermatological, such as moon faces and acne. The authors concluded that budesonide is effective for the treatment of acute ileocolonic Crohn's disease.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Campieri-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Campieri 1997</LINK>
<BR/>This 26 centre, multinational, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy study compared budesonide (CIR formulation) with prednisolone over a 12 week study period. A total of 178 participants were randomised to one of three treatment groups: budesonide 9 mg once daily, budesonide 4.5 mg twice daily or prednisolone 40 mg once daily. The study used a dose tapering regimen, with budesonide decreased to 6 mg after eight weeks and to 3 mg after a further two weeks. Prednisolone was decreased to 30 mg after two weeks and then was continually tapered to a final dose of 5 mg at week nine. This 5 mg dose was sustained until study completion at week 12. The study authors described the groups as well-matched with respect to baseline demographic characteristics and disease history. However, the disease duration appeared to differ between groups, with patients in the prednisolone group having a mean disease duration of 6.7 years compared to 8.3 years in the budesonide once daily group. The mean duration of the current exacerbation was shorter at 4.0 months in the budesonide once daily group compared to 7.6 months in the budesonide twice daily group. Thirty-six patients withdrew from the study. Worsening disease was the main reason for withdrawal (15%). At the 8-week comparison point, remission rates in the budesonide once daily and prednisolone groups were both 60%, compared to 42% in the budesonide twice daily group (P = 0.062). Remission rates were lower in patients with greater disease severity, (i.e. a CDAI &#8805; 300 compared to a CDAI &lt; 300; P = 0.0007). However, the number of patients in each group were relatively small; 13, 18 and 13 respectively. There were no statistically significant differences in glucocorticosteroid-associated adverse events which occurred in 50% of the budesonide once daily group compared to 44% of the budesonide twice daily group, and 59% of the prednisolone group. There was evidence of reduced adrenal function in all three groups at the conclusion of the study, with the maximum reduction occurring in the prednisolone group. The investigators concluded that once daily budesonide at a dose of 9 mg was as equally effective as prednisolone for inducing remission, with budesonide providing the extra advantage of fewer glucocorticosteroid-associated adverse events.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Escher-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Escher 2004</LINK>
<BR/>This randomised, double-blind, double dummy study assessed the efficacy of budesonide and prednisolone in children with Crohn's disease. This trial was conducted at 36 European centres, with a planned sample size of 120 patients. The study was terminated prematurely due to low enrolment numbers, with 56 patients enrolled at 22 centres. Participants were randomised by country and stratified by pubertal stage to receive 9 mg of budesonide daily for eight weeks, followed by 6 mg for 4 weeks or to receive a weight adjusted dose of prednisolone (1 mg/kg for 4 weeks, then tapering over 8 weeks to a dose of 2.5 mg/day). The duration of treatment was 12 weeks. The primary outcome measure was clinical remission after eight weeks of treatment. The CDAI was minimally modified for use in paediatric patients: hematocrit cut-off was set at 41%, and standard weight was replaced by ideal (50% percentile) weight for actual height as determined from standard growth charts. Disease activity was assessed using both the CDAI and PCDAI. The patients were well matched at baseline. Per-protocol results were reported in the paper. An intention-to-treat analysis showed that 17 of 26 patients in the prednisolone group (65.4%) achieved remission at 8 weeks compared to 12 of 22 (54.5%) in the budesonide group (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.34). The mean CDAI values were higher at all time points in patients treated with budesonide compared to the prednisolone group. Half of the patients receiving budesonide compared to 76.9% of those receiving prednisolone experienced at least one glucocorticosteroid-related adverse event (P = 0.03). Seven patients treated with prednisolone withdrew due to serious adverse events compared to one patient in the budesonide group. One patient in the prednisolone group withdrew due to disease worsening compared with three patients in the budesonide group. Prednisolone had a greater detrimental effect on adrenal suppression than budesonide, with 29% in the prednisolone group and 58% in the budesonide group demonstrating a normal cortisol level at 8 weeks (P = 0.052). Eleven per cent of prednisolone patients had a normal ACTH test result compared with 38% of the budesonide group (P = 0.07). The authors concluded that while there was a trend for prednisolone to be more effective for inducing remission in children with active Crohn's disease, the remission rates were not significantly different between the two groups. However there were significantly fewer adverse effects in those treated with budesonide.</P>

<BR/>This small randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, single centre trial performed in the Netherlands compared a controlled ileal release (CIR) formulation of budesonide to a tapering course of prednisolone. No information was provided on the method used to generate the randomisation sequence, the method of double blinding or a description of withdrawals and dropouts. A total of 18 adult patients (9 in each group) ranging in age from 20 to 60 years with active Crohn's disease as defined by CDAI &#8805; 200, affecting the ileocaecal region were eligible for this 10 week study. Patients in the budesonide group received 9 mg once a day for the first 8 weeks, then 6 mg a day for the subsequent 2 weeks. The dose of prednisolone was 40 mg/day for the first 2 weeks, 30 mg/day for weeks 3 and 4, 25 mg/day for weeks 5 and 6, 20 mg/day for week 7, 15 mg/day for week 8, 10 mg/day for week 9 and 5 mg/day for the last week of the study. Noconcurrent therapy was permitted during the two weeks prior to entry, or during the study. The effect on peripheral blood natural killer (NK) cell activity was assessed among the patients. Data on remission (defined as a CDAI &#8804; 150) were also reported. At 8 weeks, 56% (5/9) of patients in the budesonide study achieved remission, compared to 89% (8/9) of the prednisolone group (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.17). The mean CDAI and standard error of the mean (SEM) were provided at multiple time points. Patients in the budesonide group entered the study with a lower CDAI (243 ± 18; CDAI, SEM) compared to patients in the prednisolone group (264 ± 21), and completed the study with a higher CDAI (139 ± 25 versus 100 ± 21 in the prednisolone group). These values were estimated from a bar histogram (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Ierssel-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Van Ierssel 1995</LINK>). The authors reported that while the prednisolone treated group showed a lower CDAI score after treatment compared to budesonide, this result was not statistically significant.</P>

<BR/>This randomised, non-blinded, multi-centre trial was conducted in Italy and compared budesonide to beclomethasone dipropionate. The method of randomisation was not reported. Thirty adult patients who had newly diagnosed mild-to-moderately active, non-fistulizing, non-obstructive Crohn's disease (CDAI 150 to 250) with disease of the terminal ileum or the caecum, ascending or transverse colon were recruited. There were 15 patients allocated to each treatment group. Four patients in the beclomethasone group and three patients in the budesonide group had colonic disease. Budesonide (pH dependent formulation) was provided at 9 mg a day for 8 weeks while the control group received beclomethasone dipropionate 10 mg a day for 8 weeks. On intention-to-treat analysis, 67% (10/15) of budesonide patients achieved symptomatic remission based on a clinical evaluation and a reduction in CDAI to &#8804;150 compared to 53% (8/15) of beclomethasone dipropionate patients (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.69 to 2.26). Clinical response was defined by an improvement in symptoms and a decrease in the CDAI by at least 50 points, and was achieved by 87% of the budesonide group compared to 67% of the beclomethasone dipropionate group (P &lt; 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in the time taken to achieve symptomatic remission. There was a greater improvement in HRQOL as measured by the IBDQ in the budesonide group compared to the beclomethasone dipropionate group (P &lt; 0.05). Adverse effects were reported in 13% of the budesonide treated patients, and 20% of the beclomethasone treated patients. The authors concluded that budesonide was more effective than beclomethasone dipropionate for the treatment of mild-to-moderate Crohn's disease.</P>

<BR/>This randomised, single-centre trial compared budesonide to methylprednisolone. The method of randomisation was not reported. The study recruited 29 patients (both male and female) with active Crohn's disease of the ileum or right colon or both with a CDAI &gt; 200. Patients were assigned to budesonide CIR 9 mg once a day or a tapering regimen of methylprednisolone for 10 weeks. The methylprednisolone dosage was 32 mg/week for the first 3 weeks and was tapered by 4 mg per week thereafter. A dose of 32 mg of methylprednisolone is equivalent to 40 mg of prednisone. The primary outcome variables were parameters of osteoblast and osteoclast function. Response and remission were not rigidly defined. It appears that response was defined by those who continued treatment and were not in the 'insufficient improvement' or 'worsening symptoms' categories, since "patients who did not respond at 4 weeks, or in whom the disease worsened, dropped out from the study" and were considered to be 'non-responders'. Given the ambiguity over the definition, these data were not meta-analysed. Thirty-one per cent of the budesonide group dropped out of the study compared to 38% of the methylprednisolone group. There was a greater reduction in CDAI in the methylprednisolone group, with a baseline of 238 ± 33 (CDAI ± SEM), and a value of 107 ± 30 at 10 weeks; compared to 231 ± 17 and 157 ± 22 in the budesonide group. The authors did not make any conclusions regarding the efficacy of methylprednisolone or budesonide for the treatment of Crohn's disease. <LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Haens-1998" TYPE="STUDY">D'Haens 1998</LINK> concluded that budesonide did not result in a significant depression of bone formation compared to methylprednisolone.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Levine-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Levine 2003</LINK>
<BR/>This randomised, open label trial compared a pH modified release formulation to prednisone in 13 paediatric gastroenterology clinics in Israel. The method of random number generation was not reported. This study enrolled a total of 35 patients with active Crohn's disease defined by a PCDAI between 12.5 and 40 points. One patient from each group was excluded due to inclusion or exclusion criteria violations. The study was terminated early due to difficulties with subject enrolment. Patients were allocated to budesonide 3 mg three times daily or tapering doses of prednisone for 10 weeks. Prednisone patients received 40 mg/day for 2 weeks, 30 mg/day during week 3, 25 mg/day during week 4, 20 mg/day during week 5, 15 mg/day during week 5, 10 mg/day during weeks 7 and 8, and 10 mg on alternate days for weeks 9 and 10. Disease remission was defined by a PCDAI &#8804; 10 points after twelve weeks. On intention-to-treat analysis, the proportion of patients achieving remission in the prednisone group was 43% (6/14), compared to 42% (8/19) in the budesonide group (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.19). There was a slightly larger decrease in PCDAI in the prednisone compared to those treated with budesonide (-13.4 ± 10.6 versus -9.3 ± 14.8; PCDAI ± SD). In the final two weeks prior to outcome assessment (weeks 11 and 12), neither corticosteroid was prescribed, and instead patients received 3 to 4 g/d of mesalamine. Adverse events were more prevalent in the prednisone group at 71.4% compared to 31.6% in the budesonide group (P &lt; 0.05). The authors felt these adverse events were related to the study medications. The authors concluded that remission rates with budesonide and prednisone were similar in paediatric patients with Crohn's disease and those treated with budesonide experienced significantly fewer adverse events.</P>

<P>Only one RCT assessed the efficacy of budesonide 3 mg to placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Greenberg-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Greenberg 1994</LINK>). There was no statistically significant difference in clinical remission rates between budesonide and placebo weeks two (RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.30 to 2.38), four (RR 1.52; 95% CI 0.77 to 3.00) or eight (RR 1.67; 95% CI 0.92 to 3.02).

<P>Three trials with a combined number of 379 patients compared the efficacy of budesonide 9 mg to placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Greenberg-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Greenberg 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tremaine-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tremaine 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Suzuki-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Suzuki 2013</LINK>). Comparisons were made at three time points; two, four and eight weeks. It was not necessary to perform subgroup analyses because the trials were clinically and statistically homogenous (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%). Equivalent doses were compared for this pooled analysis, hence only the 9 mg per day budesonide groups of <LINK REF="STD-Greenberg-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Greenberg 1994</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Suzuki-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Suzuki 2013</LINK> trials were used for comparison with the <LINK REF="STD-Tremaine-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tremaine 2002</LINK> study cohort.</P>
<P>At all three time points, budesonide was significantly superior to placebo for induction of remission in active Crohn's disease.

<P>Conventional corticosteroids, including prednisone and 6-methylprednisolone have been a mainstay of therapy for induction of remission in patients with Crohn's disease. However, they are less than optimal therapeutic options due to significant adverse effects in both adult and paediatric patients. Given the relapsing and remitting course of Crohn's disease and the potential need for repeated courses of steroids to treat recurrent flares, there was a need to develop a new corticosteroid formulation that would have the therapeutic effect of corticosteroids, but without its inherent adverse effects. It was hoped that budesonide, with its delayed release formulation, location specific delivery (terminal ileum and ascending colon), and 85% first pass metabolism in the liver, may achieve such a goal.</P>
<P>Budesonide is clearly superior to placebo for induction of remission in Crohn's disease. After eight weeks treatment with budesonide 9 mg daily, patients were almost twice as likely to enter remission as compared to placebo (RR 1.93, 95% CI 1.37 to 2.73; NNT=5). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was moderate. Compared to placebo, budesonide did not cause more steroid-related adverse effects or adverse events leading to withdrawal from the study. However, patients receiving budesonide were more than twice as likely to have an abnormal ACTH test (hazard ratio 2.15; 95% CI 1.41 to 3.29; number needed to harm=3) than placebo patients, related to the minimal systemic bioavailability of budesonide. In this report, we further evaluated the efficacy and safety of various doses of budesonide. Only one study assessed budesonide 3 mg daily (<LINK REF="STD-Greenberg-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Greenberg 1994</LINK>), which showed that the low dose budesonide had no superiority over placebo. However, 3 mg budesonide was no more harmful than placebo. At a dose of 15 mg daily budesonide showed clinically similar efficacy and a similar safety profile to budesonide 9 mg daily (<LINK REF="STD-Greenberg-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Greenberg 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Suzuki-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Suzuki 2013</LINK>). These findings reinforce the current standard dosing of 9 mg daily for budesonide.</P>
<P>Budesonide exhibited inferior efficacy when compared to conventional corticosteroids. Patients treated with conventional steroids have 15% higher chance of achieving remission at week 8 compared to budesonide (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.97). These results are in agreement with previous meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Papi-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papi 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kane-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kane 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Otley-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Otley 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nos-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nos 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ford-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ford 2011</LINK>). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was moderate.</P>
<P>The study design of the eight conventional corticosteroid comparison trials differed from usual clinical practice and may have overestimated the efficacy of budesonide. Budesonide was given at 'full' dose (9 mg) for the first eight weeks of the studies (the primary outcome evaluation time point for most of the trials), and then decreased, but not discontinued at the final study evaluation, whilst conventional corticosteroids were given at full dose for two weeks, and then tapered, such that at the conclusion of most studies, patients were weaned off steroids. Expectedly, conventional steroids were associated with statistically and clinically more steroid-related adverse effects, abnormal ACTH tests and lower plasma cortisol levels compared to budesonide.</P>
<P>Budesonide CIR was inferior to conventional corticosteroids in a subgroup analysis of budesonide formulation. These patients had Crohn's disease limited to the terminal ileum and right colon. While the budesonide <I>pH</I> dependent formulation appeared to be of equal efficacy to conventional corticosteroids, these studies included patients with a lower CDAI (150 versus <U>&gt;</U> 200 for the CIR studies; <LINK REF="STD-Bar_x002d_Meir-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bar-Meir 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gross-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gross 1996</LINK>), which may be more responsive to budesonide. This is an important observation, as a subsequent subgroup analysis focusing on patients with severe Crohn's disease (CDAI&gt;300) clearly demonstrated that budesonide was less effective than conventional corticosteroids for induction of remission. Given the potential confounders of disease location and severity, it is difficult to directly compare the efficacy of the two formulations of budesonide in the absence of a head-to-head trial. Further analysis was performed by disease location, which suggested that budesonide may be inferior to conventional corticosteroids for induction of remission in patients with terminal ileal or ileo-colonic disease, not extending beyond the hepatic flexure (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.00; P = 0.06).</P>
<P>Only two studies compared budesonide to 5-ASA products (<LINK REF="STD-Thomsen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Thomsen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tromm-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Tromm 2011</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Thomsen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Thomsen 1998</LINK> showed that budesonide was superior to mesalamine (2 g twice daily) at week eight. Remission rates were 69% in the budesonide group compared to 45% in the mesalamine group. <LINK REF="STD-Tromm-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Tromm 2011</LINK> showed that mesalamine (4.5 g daily) was non-inferior to budesonide at week eight. While remission rates with budesonide in <LINK REF="STD-Tromm-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Tromm 2011</LINK> were identical to <LINK REF="STD-Thomsen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Thomsen 1998</LINK> (i.e. 69%); a larger proportion of patients treated with mesalamine entered remission in the <LINK REF="STD-Tromm-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Tromm 2011</LINK> study (i.e. 62% compared to 45% in <LINK REF="STD-Thomsen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Thomsen 1998</LINK>). This explains the high heterogeneity between the two studies (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 81%), impairing our ability to pool the results. The higher than expected remission rates in the <LINK REF="STD-Tromm-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Tromm 2011</LINK> study have been a source of debate (<LINK REF="REF-Levesque-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levesque 2011</LINK>). Non-inferiority of mesalamine to budesonide in this study is concerning because 5-ASA products are not currently recommended for the management of Crohn's disease as they have been shown to be no more effective than placebo for induction of remission (<LINK REF="REF-Lim-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lim 2010</LINK>). More than half of the study subjects had mild disease with minimal elevation of inflammatory markers which may have diluted the true effect of budesonide. The current evidence does not allow for a firm conclusion on the relative efficacy of budesonide compared to 5-ASA products. A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was moderate due to sparse data. The existence of a truly mesalamine-responsive phenotype of Crohn's disease may need to be evaluated in future studies. Patients treated with budesonide had a statistically larger reduction in the CDAI scores compared to mesalamine (&#916; CDAI -28.2, 95% CI -50.25 to -6.1). However, a change of 28 points in CDAI score may not be clinically meaningful. Interestingly, both studies observed significantly more patients withdrawing from the mesalamine arms than the budesonide arms.</P>
<P>There were insufficient data to determine if budesonide improved the time to remission compared to placebo, conventional corticosteroids or mesalamine. In the short term, improvement of quality of life indices were similar between budesonide and other active drugs or placebo; however, a longer follow-up may be needed to assess the changes in health-related quality of life specially in relation to long-term adverse events associated with corticosteroids. This data may be obtained from maintenance studies of budesonide in CD.<BR/>
</P>
<P>In conclusion, budesonide 9 mg daily remains the optimal dosing regime and is superior to placebo for induction of remission in active Crohn's disease. Although, the efficacy of budesonide is inferior to conventional steroids for inducing remission, a significantly better adverse effect profile makes it a suitable alternative in patients with less severe disease and without extensive colonic involvement. Current evidence does not support superiority of budesonide over high dose mesalamine.</P>

<P>Budesonide is more effective than placebo for induction of remission in active Crohn's disease. Although short-term efficacy with budesonide is less than with conventional steroids, particularly in patients with severe disease or more extensive colonic involvement, the likelihood of adverse events and adrenal suppression with budesonide is lower. The current evidence does not allow for a firm conclusion on the relative efficacy of budesonide compared to 5-ASA products.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-05-29 14:24:06 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>While it appears that budesonide is less efficacious than conventional corticosteroids, one must remain cognizant that the study design of the conventional corticosteroid comparison trials may have overestimated the efficacy of budesonide due to full dose budesonide being compared to a tapering dose of conventional corticosteroids. Head-to-head trials of CIR budesonide compared to pH dependant formulations will provide useful information on the choice of therapy in management of active CD. While budesonide appears to be less toxic than conventional corticosteroids in short-term trials, it does suppress adrenal function to a degree. The long-term effects of budesonide on bone metabolism are especially important to consider in paediatric patients in whom there is the potential for corticosteroid-related growth suppression. Further research is required to evaluate the long-term adverse event profile of budesonide, and this may more likely be gleaned from studies where budesonide is used for the maintenance of remission of CD.</P>
