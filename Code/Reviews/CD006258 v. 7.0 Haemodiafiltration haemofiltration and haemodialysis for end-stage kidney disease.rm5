<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-04-10 15:40:39 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>People who have severe loss of kidney function are treated with dialysis or a kidney transplant to remove toxins and fluid. Dialysis removes waste products and fluid by filtering these across a membrane in the dialysis machine (for haemodialysis) or within the body (for peritoneal dialysis). Toxins that build-up in the body when the kidneys fail vary in size and larger molecules are removed less well by standard haemodialysis. Newer dialysis types 'push' water across the dialysis membrane which allows the removal of unwanted molecules more efficiently. Larger molecules are removed better and the dialysis fluid has fewer impurities, leading to the potential for convective dialysis to improve the ways patients feel and survive on dialysis. The three types of convective dialysis therapy are haemodiafiltration, haemofiltration, and acetate-free biofiltration. Use of convective therapy for dialysis is higher in Europe and lower in the USA. Given the difference between regions for uptake of this treatment and the potential benefits on patient outcomes, we have updated this Cochrane review to new additional studies available in 2015.</P>
<P>We identified 40 studies enrolling 4137 adult participants. Of these, 35 studies in 4039 adults compared convective dialysis with standard haemodialysis. Overall the evidence in the studies was low or very low quality due to limitations in the methods used in the research leading to low confidence in the results. Overall, there was no evidence convective dialysis lowered risk of death from any cause but may reduce death due to heart or vascular disease. Overall treating 1000 men and women who have end-stage kidney disease with convective dialysis rather than standard haemodialysis may prevent 25 dying from heart disease. Convective therapy may reduce blood pressure falls during dialysis but there was no evidence that convective dialysis influenced chances of hospital admission or other side-effects, or improved quality of life.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-05-14 15:10:34 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Convective dialysis modalities (haemofiltration (HF), haemodiafiltration (HDF), and acetate-free biofiltration (AFB)) removed excess body fluid across the dialysis membrane with positive pressure and accumulated middle- and larger-size accumulated solutes more efficiently than haemodialysis (HD). This increased larger solute removal combined with use of ultra-pure dialysis fluid in convective dialysis is hypothesised to reduce the frequency and severity of symptoms during dialysis as well as improve clinical outcomes. Convective dialysis therapies (HDF and HF) are associated with lower mortality compared to diffusive therapy (HD) in observational studies. This is an update of a review first published in 2006.</P>

<P>We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register (to 18 February 2015) through contact with a Trials' Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-04-08 17:29:23 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Two independent authors identified studies, extracted data and assessed study risk of bias. We summarised treatment effects using the random effects model. We reported results as a risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous data together with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed for heterogeneity using the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test and explored the amount of variation in treatment estimates beyond that expected by chance using the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-05-13 21:12:20 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Twenty studies comprising 667 participants were included in the 2006 review. In that review, there was insufficient evidence of treatment effects on major clinical outcomes to draw clinically meaningful conclusions. Searching to February 2015 identified 40 eligible studies comprising 3483 participants overall. In total, 35 studies (4039 participants) compared HF, HDF or AFB with HD, three studies (54 participants) compared AFB with HDF, and three studies (129 participants) compared HDF with HF.</P>
<P>Risks of bias in all studies were generally high resulting in low confidence in estimated treatment effects. Convective dialysis had no significant effect on all-cause mortality (11 studies, 3396 participants: RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.05; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 34%), but significantly reduced cardiovascular mortality (6 studies, 2889 participants: RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.92; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%). One study reported no significant effect on rates of nonfatal cardiovascular events (714 participants: RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.50) and two studies showed no significant difference in hospitalisation (2 studies, 1688 participants: RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.63; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%). One study reported rates of hypotension during dialysis were significantly reduced with convective therapy (906 participants: RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.80). Adverse events were not systematically evaluated in most studies and data for health-related quality of life were sparse. Convective therapies significantly reduced predialysis levels of B<SUB>2</SUB> microglobulin (12 studies, 1813 participants: MD -5.55 mg/dL, 95% CI -9.11 to -1.98; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 94%) and increased dialysis dose (Kt/V urea) (14 studies, 2022 participants: MD 0.07, 95% CI -0.00 to 0.14; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 90%) compared to diffusive therapy, but results across studies were very heterogeneous. Sensitivity analyses limited to studies comparing HDF with HD showed very similar results. Directly comparative data for differing types of convective dialysis were insufficient to draw conclusions.</P>
<P>Studies had important risks of bias leading to low confidence in the summary estimates and were generally limited to patients who had adequate dialysis vascular access.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-04-08 17:29:26 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Convective dialysis may reduce cardiovascular but not all-cause mortality and effects on nonfatal cardiovascular events and hospitalisation are inconclusive. However, any treatment benefits of convective dialysis on all patient outcomes including cardiovascular death are unreliable due to limitations in study methods and reporting. Future studies which assess treatment effects of convection dose on patient outcomes including mortality and cardiovascular events would be informative.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2015-05-14 15:10:34 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-04-10 16:44:44 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-04-08 18:00:55 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Dialysis, kidney transplantation or supportive care are available treatment options for end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Dialysis therapies include peritoneal dialysis as well as standard haemodialysis (HD) or convective dialysis (haemofiltration (HF), haemodiafiltration (HDF), and acetate-free biofiltration (AFB)) to remove accumulated fluid and metabolites from the blood when kidney function is severely impaired. Despite effective removal of solutes and water by standard HD to avoid life-threatening complications, long-term dialysis patients reported markedly impaired quality of life, sleep disturbance, nausea, depressive symptoms, anxiety, thirst, and pain (<LINK REF="REF-Murtagh-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murtagh 2007</LINK>). In addition, survival remains poor; 10 to 20% of men and women treated with long-term dialysis die each year (<LINK REF="REF-USRDS-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">USRDS 2011</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-04-10 16:15:51 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Standard HD removes accumulated metabolites and fluid from the patient's blood by diffusion across a semi-permeable membrane into the dialysate fluid for removal into the dialysis waste. Convective dialysis (HDF, HF and AFB) clears water (convection) using positive pressure across the dialysis membrane for removal. Accumulated solutes follow the movement of water in a phenomenon known as 'solvent drag' (<LINK REF="REF-Henderson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson 2004</LINK>). Water and electrolytes are replaced as required into the blood circulation. The replacement fluid can be added to the patient's blood before the membrane filter ("pre-dilution") or after the dialysis filter along with the blood returning into the patient's blood circulation ("post-dilution").</P>
<P>Accumulated metabolites have different molecular weights and are cleared differently depending on the type of molecular transport used in dialysis (diffusive versus convective). HF may remove higher molecular weight molecules whereas standard HD may be more effective at removing smaller solutes such as urea (<LINK REF="REF-Locatelli-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Locatelli 2000</LINK>). A hybrid system that includes both convection and diffusion, known as HDF combines convection with diffusion (<LINK REF="REF-Schmidt-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmidt 1986</LINK>). In HD and HDF, the dialysate contains acetate, which buffers circulating acids which cannot be buffered sufficiently by kidney function. Acetate depresses myocardial contractility and may cause haemodynamic instability during dialysis (<LINK REF="REF-Daugirdas-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daugirdas 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sztajzel-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sztajzel 1993</LINK>). AFB, a HDF technique, uses a hypertonic sodium bicarbonate solution in place of acetate to manage acidosis (<LINK REF="REF-Zucchelli-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zucchelli 1990</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-04-10 16:17:22 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>While standard HD clears smaller, water-soluble metabolites efficiently by diffusion, poor clinical outcomes might be explained in part by inadequate removal of middle- and larger-sized waste products of metabolism which are implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and dialysis-related amyloidosis (<LINK REF="REF-Guerin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guerin 2000</LINK>). In uncontrolled studies, convective dialysis therapies are associated with lower mortality (<LINK REF="STD-Locatelli-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Locatelli 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vilar-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vilar 2009</LINK>) and lower circulating levels of middle-size molecules such as vitamin B12 or B<SUB>2</SUB> microglobulin in dialysis patients are associated with reduced cardiovascular and infection-related mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Liabeuf-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liabeuf 2012</LINK>). In addition, HDF is associated with less frequent hypotension during dialysis (<LINK REF="REF-Vilar-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vilar 2009</LINK>) and the enhanced biocompatibility of ultrapure dialysate fluids used in convective technologies may reduce inflammation, oxidative stress and infection.(<LINK REF="REF-Arizono-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arizono 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Calo-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Calo 2007</LINK>) Removal of larger metabolites by newer convective dialysis strategies is therefore a potential strategy to improve dialysis outcomes and greater convection volumes during HDF might be a principal determinant of clinical effectiveness with HDF because of greater clearances of middle and large uraemic solutes during treatment.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-04-10 16:44:44 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>In our previous meta-analysis, published in 2006, that included 17 randomised studies (600 participants) comparing convective with diffusive dialysis (<LINK REF="REF-Rabindranath-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rabindranath 2006</LINK>), convective modalities had uncertain effects on mortality in low-quality evidence and data for adverse events were sparse. Since 2006, 18 additional studies (3439 participants) comparing convection with diffusion modalities have been published, but results have been inconsistent, and consequently there has been variable uptake of HDF into clinical practice; in 2010 the proportion of incident dialysis patients treated with HDF in Europe varied between 0.7% in Finland and 18.9% in the Catalonian region of Spain (<LINK REF="REF-ERA_x002d_EDTA-Registry-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">ERA-EDTA Registry 2010</LINK>). In Australia and New Zealand, the proportion of dialysis patients treated with HDF in 2011 was 21.5% and 10.9%, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-ANZDATA-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">ANZDATA 2012</LINK>). The European Best Practice Guidelines that were published in 2007 suggest that HDF is a suitable treatment strategy to delay complications of ESKD and exchange volumes should be as high as possible (<LINK REF="REF-EBPG-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">EBPG 2007</LINK>).</P>

<P>Of the six studies comparing convection with another convective strategy, five reported convection methods using fluid generated on-line. Two studies used high-flux (33%) membranes for HD, one reported low-flux membranes (17%), and in the remainder the HD flux was unclear. Convection strategies were highly heterogeneous and no study randomised participants to specific targeted convection volumes. In four (66%) studies, adequate vascular access for high volume dialysis was required. Most studies included patients who were anuric or had minimal renal function.</P>
<P>One study had a parallel study design (<LINK REF="STD-Bolasco-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bolasco 2003</LINK>) and the remainder were cross-over studies. Follow-up duration ranged between two and 24 months (median six months) with only one study reporting follow-up for 12 months or more. Study sample sizes were small (12 to 76 participants; median 21).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2015-04-10 16:31:02 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-04-08 18:14:33 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Thirty-five studies in 4039 dialysis patients compared convective dialysis treatment (HDF, HF or AFB) with HD and six studies (174 participants) compared convective therapy directly with another convective therapy. Convective dialysis modalities had little or no effect on all-cause mortality, may reduce cardiovascular death and hypotension during dialysis, but had uncertain effects on rates of nonfatal cardiovascular events and hospitalisation and serious limitations in study methodology markedly reduced our confidence in any treatment benefits of HDF. There was no difference in risks of changing dialysis modality between convective and diffusive modalities and treatment effects on clearances of urea and B<SUB>2</SUB> microglobulin were markedly inconsistent between studies.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-04-10 16:31:02 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>First, while there were statistical reductions in cardiovascular mortality and rates of hypotension with HDF treatment, serious limitations in study methodologies reduced confidence in the conclusions that might be drawn from the available evidence for convective and diffusive dialysis modalities. Allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessment, complete reporting of patient-relevant outcomes and inclusion of patients in outcome analyses was inadequate in most studies, and therefore the evidence quality for clinical outcomes was downgraded to low or very low. Data for adverse events and quality of life were insufficient to draw clinically meaningful conclusions. Due to the limitations of existing data, the confidence in estimated effects of convective dialysis is low and the true effects of treatment might be substantially different from those summarized from existing studies.</P>
<P>Second, higher achieved convection volumes for HDF were associated with lower mortality in post-hoc non-randomised analyses within <LINK REF="STD-CONTRAST-_x0028_Dutch_x0029_-Study-2005" TYPE="STUDY">CONTRAST (Dutch) Study 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-TURKISH-HDF-2013" TYPE="STUDY">TURKISH HDF 2013</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-ESHOL-Study-2011" TYPE="STUDY">ESHOL Study 2011</LINK>. However, caution is needed before concluding this is evidence for the need to deliver high convection volumes to reduce all-cause mortality with HDF. Convection volumes were not randomised treatment targets in any study (in other words, patients at randomisation were not equally likely to be assigned to specific convection volume targets) and as such the relationship observed between convection volume and mortality is also likely to be strongly confounded in important ways. Participants with insufficient vascular access and those with lower achieved blood flows (both known to be linked to poorer outcomes) would have been less likely to achieve higher convection volumes and those with longer treatment times would have been more likely to achieve convection targets. It is known that these specific patient and treatment characteristics independently predict mortality and may, as such, offer more viable and alternative explanations for the association between convection volume and risk of death.</P>
<P>Third, there was considerable heterogeneity in the dialysis interventions across studies including differences in flux, vascular access requirements, blood flows, and treatment times as well as convection volumes, resulting in uncertainty about which specific aspects of the convection process might be responsible for lower cardiovascular mortality. Future standardisation of therapy patterns might improve our understanding of the features of convective dialysis care that might lead to improved outcomes and patient acceptability.</P>
<P>Fourth, data for adverse events were sparse and no studies evaluated serious adverse events according to international definitions. Understanding hazards of treatment are essential to balancing desirable and undesirable outcomes when considering new therapies and questions about potential harms from convection therapy cannot be answered with confidence using the existing randomised study evidence.</P>
<P>Finally, the generalisability of the findings from RCTs to wider dialysis populations, including those in regions other than Europe might be limited. The absolute treatment benefits of convection on cardiovascular mortality might not be applicable to many dialysis patients, as data were frequently limited to participants who had vascular access sufficient to sustain high convection volumes.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-04-08 17:20:47 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>The strengths of this review include the searching of conference proceedings and inclusions of additional unpublished data to provide a comprehensive analysis of all available evidence and the rigorous assessment of quality which has been incorporated into review conclusions using the methods of the GRADE guidelines. The limitations in this review are largely due to the reporting adequacy of the primary included studies.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-04-10 16:30:05 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>This is an update of a review reported in 2006, which found insufficient evidence to provide robust recommendations for convective therapy to improve clinical outcomes for men and women who have ESKD (<LINK REF="REF-Rabindranath-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rabindranath 2006</LINK>). Despite the addition of 20 new studies including 3483 participants between 2006 and 2015, evidence for the benefits and harms of convective dialysis therapy remains low or very low quality.</P>
<P>The European Best Practice Guidelines on Haemodialysis (<LINK REF="REF-EBPG-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">EBPG 2007</LINK>) suggest on-line HDF or HF should be considered to delay long-term complications of dialysis therapy and that exchange volumes should be as high as possible. Current utilisation of HDF varies widely. Prevalence of HDF ranges between 0.3 and 232 per million of population within countries and regions of Europe (<LINK REF="REF-ERA_x002d_EDTA-Registry-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">ERA-EDTA Registry 2010</LINK>) and the proportion of HDF as the treatment modality for patients in Australasia ranges between 0.8% and 23% (<LINK REF="REF-ANZDATA-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">ANZDATA 2012</LINK>). This review suggests the benefits of HDF or HF from contemporaneous RCTs are limited to reducing cardiovascular mortality and hypotension during dialysis and that evidence limitations lead to low confidence in these treatment benefits. None of the available studies randomised participants treated with HDF to different targeted convection volumes and accordingly robust evidence supportive of higher convection volumes to improve dialysis outcomes is not available.</P>
<P>This review draws similar conclusions to a recent systematic review and meta-analysis that compared convective dialysis therapies (including high-flux HD, HF, or HDF) with low-flux HD alone (<LINK REF="REF-Susantitaphong-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Susantitaphong 2013</LINK>). In that review which included 36 parallel arm studies showed that convective therapies had little or no effect on all-cause mortality (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.02), and reduced risks of cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.84, 95% 0.71 to 0.98) and hypotension (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.87). Unlike the present review, the quality of the available evidence was not incorporated into the review conclusions.</P>
<P>This review diverges from the conclusions of the largest HDF study to date (<LINK REF="STD-ESHOL-Study-2011" TYPE="STUDY">ESHOL Study 2011</LINK>). This review finds no treatment effects of HDF in mortality, compared to a 30% relative reduction in risk of death from any causes during 36 months of follow-up in the <LINK REF="STD-ESHOL-Study-2011" TYPE="STUDY">ESHOL Study 2011</LINK>. We suggest that the consistent findings across all studies in the meta-analysis for mortality in this review (variation in the estimates was not beyond that expected by chance) indicate the overall summary estimate is robust even accounting for the findings of the <LINK REF="STD-ESHOL-Study-2011" TYPE="STUDY">ESHOL Study 2011</LINK>. Notably in that study, patients were withdrawn and not included in analyses if they did not receive the allocated treatment modality for two months or more, including those who did not achieve the minimum requested replacement volume (18L/session). As it is probable these participants might have had poorer outcomes (such as poorer vascular access due to other comorbidities including vascular disease or diabetes) and may have been preferentially excluded from follow-up, the <LINK REF="STD-ESHOL-Study-2011" TYPE="STUDY">ESHOL Study 2011</LINK> might unreliably estimate mortality risk. It would be informative to re-evaluate mortality data from <LINK REF="STD-ESHOL-Study-2011" TYPE="STUDY">ESHOL Study 2011</LINK> using intention-to-treat analyses that include mortality outcome data for all randomised patients according to their original treatment assignment.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-04-08 18:05:20 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>While there is increasing but variable uptake of HDF in Europe, the current body of evidence provides low or very-low quality evidence suggesting confidence in estimated treatment effects of convective dialysis therapies is limited or very limited. Convective dialysis may reduce cardiovascular events or rates of hypotension during dialysis but effects on mortality, nonfatal cardiovascular events and hospitalisation in addition to quality of life and adverse events are inconclusive and the overall confidence in these results is low or very low. Until there are additional robust studies, widespread uptake of convective therapies including HDF is not warranted and targeting higher convection volumes to improve outcomes is not supported by high-quality evidence.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-04-08 18:05:21 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>A significant number of studies have now been conducted to assess the effectiveness of convective dialysis therapies to improve clinical outcomes in people treated with HD. However, given the methodological limitations in the available studies, additional studies that are powered to evaluate treatment effects of HDF on mortality, major cardiovascular events, and adverse treatment effects are needed before widespread uptake of HDF is warranted. In addition, given the hypothesis that higher convection volumes might improve clinical outcomes from convective therapy, future studies targeting specific convection volumes and using intention-to-treat analysis that show benefit for clinical outcomes are required before higher convection volumes can be recommended.</P>

<P>The study, 9 months long, is aimed to verify the treatment tolerance of insulin requiring diabetic patients, by using standard bicarbonate dialysis (BD), or acetate free biofiltration (AFB) and/or a blood volume control (BVC). The study is divided in three phases: the first one, three months long, is the baseline in standard bicarbonate dialysis, then all the patients are shifted to AFB with BVC, for other three months, while the last three months long phase, after a randomisation, has the aim to identify the relative contribution of each factor (absence of acetate in the bath or BVC) in the treatment tolerance improvement (if any). The treatment tolerance will be evaluated considering the frequency of intradialytic hypotensive events.</P>
