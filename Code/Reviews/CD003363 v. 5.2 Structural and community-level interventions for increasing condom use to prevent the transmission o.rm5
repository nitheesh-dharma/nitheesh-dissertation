<B>Bakground </B>
</P>
<P>Since the advent of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the 1980s, condom promotion has become one of the most widely used interventions to prevent transmission of HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). However, despite widespread promotion of condom use globally, new cases of HIV and other STIs either remain high or continue to rise in some particular regions and settings across the world. It is believed that by modifying the environment in which people live, it is possible to improve access and use of condoms on a large scale so that the transmission of HIV and other STIs decreases. This review aimed to assess if this theory was correct.</P>
<P>
<B>Methods</B>
</P>
<P>We screened all relevant literature from January 1980 to April 2014. Two independent authors selected and assessed the trials.</P>
<P>
<B>Results</B>
</P>
<P>We obtained nine studies, involving 75,891 participants and with a duration raging from one to nine years. Seven of these studies were conducted in Sub-Saharan Africa, one in Peru, and one in a multi-country location. Condom promotion was implemented in all the studies. Our results did not provide clear evidence that condom promotion in these specific contexts led to a decrease in the transmission of HIV and other STIs. However, knowledge about HIV and other STIs increased, as did reported condom use. A likely reason for the negative results in this review is that sexual behaviors are difficult to change. For example, we found no difference in the number of sexual partners after the intervention was implemented. Also, if there is not consistent condom use the risk of transmission remains for HIV and other STIs. The quality of the evidence was deemed to be moderate.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusions</B>
</P>
<P>Our findings should be interpreted with caution since most of the studies in the present review were carried out in Sub-Saharan Africa, region that is very diverse, and whose social and cultural characteristics are different from those in other developing nations. Thus, our results present a limited generalizability.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-06-20 07:24:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Community interventions to promote condom use are considered to be a valuable tool to reduce the transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). In particular, special emphasis has been placed on implementing such interventions through structural changes, a concept that implies public health actions that aim to improve society's health through modifications in the context wherein health-related risk behavior takes place. This strategy attempts to increase condom use and in turn lower the transmission of HIV and other STIs.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-06-21 10:15:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess the effects of structural and community-level interventions for increasing condom use in both general and high-risk populations to reduce the incidence of HIV and STI transmission by comparing alternative strategies, or by assessing the effects of a strategy compared with a control.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-06-26 09:17:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library, from </I>2007,<I> </I>Issue 1), as well as MEDLINE, EMBASE, AEGIS and ClinicalTrials.gov, from January 1980 to April 2014. We also handsearched proceedings of international acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) conferences, as well as major behavioral studies conferences focusing on HIV/AIDS and STIs.</P>

<P>Randomized control trials (RCTs) featuring all of the following.</P>
<P>1. Community interventions ('community' defined as a geographical entity, such as cities, counties, villages).</P>
<P>2. One or more structural interventions whose objective was to promote condom use. These type of interventions can be defined as those actions improving accessibility, availability and acceptability of any given health program/technology.</P>
<P>3. Trials that confirmed biological outcomes using laboratory testing.</P>

<P>Two authors independently screened and selected relevant studies, and conducted further risk of bias assessment. We assessed the effect of treatment by pooling trials with comparable characteristics and quantified its effect size using risk ratio. The effect of clustering at the community level was addressed through intra-cluster correlation coefficients (ICCs), and sensitivity analysis was carried out with different design effect values.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-07-16 07:27:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included nine trials (plus one study that was a subanalysis) for quantitative assessment. The studies were conducted in Tanzania, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Uganda, Kenya, Peru, China, India and Russia, comprising 75,891 participants, mostly including the general population (not the high-risk population). The main intervention was condom promotion, or distribution, or both. In general, control groups did not receive any active intervention. The main risk of bias was incomplete outcome data.</P>
<P>In the meta-analysis, there was no clear evidence that the intervention had an effect on either HIV seroprevalence or HIV seroincidence when compared to controls:<I> </I>HIV incidence (risk ratio (RR) 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69 to 1.19) and HIV prevalence (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.32). The estimated effect of the intervention on other outcomes was similarly uncertain: Herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) incidence (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.04); HSV-2 prevalence (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.20); syphilis prevalence (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.17); gonorrhoea prevalence (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.02); chlamydia prevalence (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.18); and trichomonas prevalence (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.30). Reported condom use increased in the experimental arm<I> </I>(RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.40). In the intervention groups, the number of people reporting two or more sexual partners in the past year did not show a clear decrease when compared with control groups<I> </I>(RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.04), but knowledge about HIV and other STIs improved (RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.28, and RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.41, respectively). The quality of the evidence was deemed to be moderate for nearly all key outcomes.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-06-20 07:24:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is no clear evidence that structural interventions at the community level to increase condom use prevent the transmission of HIV and other STIs. However, this conclusion should be interpreted with caution since our results have wide confidence intervals and the results for prevalence may be affected by attrition bias. In addition, it was not possible to find RCTs in which extended changes to policies were conducted and the results only apply to general populations in developing nations, particularly to Sub-Saharan Africa, a region which in turn is widely diverse.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-07-29 09:39:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-07-29 09:39:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>HIV is a virus that attacks the immune system, weakening it progressively and leading some years later to the onset of opportunistic infections, a stage that is known as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). If not treated, the natural progression of this syndrome winds up in death (<LINK REF="REF-Weiss-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weiss 1993</LINK>). HIV's routes of transmission are sexual intercourse through contact of mucosae with semen or vaginal fluids, exchange of intravenous syringes, blood transfusion, hemodialysis, and mother-to-child transmission via blood transfer and breastfeeding.</P>
<P>In 2012 the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) estimated that globally 2.3 million people were newly infected with HIV, 35.3 million people were already living with the virus, and 1.6 million people died from AIDS-related causes (<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2013</LINK>). Moreover, the HIV/AIDS pandemic affects disproportionally low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), with several regions in Sub-Saharan Africa facing the highest burden of the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Ortblad-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ortblad 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Since the onset of the pandemic, condoms have been considered one of the most effective biological mechanisms for reducing the transmission of HIV (<LINK REF="REF-Holmes-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holmes 2004</LINK>). Laboratory and epidemiological studies have demonstrated that condoms are effective against a number of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), such as gonorrhoea, non-gonococcal urethritis, trichomoniasis, genital herpes (<LINK REF="REF-da-Silveira-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">da Silveira 2005</LINK>), and HIV (<LINK REF="REF-Weller-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weller 2002</LINK>). Of the many strategies to reduce infection, promotion of condom use continues to be the keystone of HIV and STI prevention worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Matson-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matson 2010</LINK>). However, the positive impact of condoms may be limited by their inconsistent or low use (<LINK REF="REF-Hearst-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hearst 2004</LINK>). Several factors are known to be associated with condom non-use during sexual intercourse, including perception of reduced pleasure (<LINK REF="REF-Sarkar-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sarkar 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sunmola-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sunmola 2005</LINK>), discomfort (<LINK REF="REF-Crosby-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crosby 2005</LINK>), partner trust (<LINK REF="REF-Abdullah-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abdullah 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jadack-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadack 1997</LINK>), use of other contraceptives (<LINK REF="REF-Abdullah-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abdullah 2002</LINK>), fear of revealing HIV status to partners (<LINK REF="REF-Medley-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Medley 2004</LINK>), and religious beliefs (<LINK REF="REF-Thomsen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomsen 2004</LINK>). It has also been suggested that the spread of information about highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) reducing the infectiousness of HIV may be a potential hindrance to condom use (<LINK REF="REF-Akinyemi-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akinyemi 2010</LINK>); nonetheless, evidence supporting this theory is mixed (<LINK REF="REF-Berhan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berhan 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Crepaz-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crepaz 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The availability of and accessibility to condoms is often a major obstacle to condom use. In most low- and middle-income countries cost is a barrier to purchase condoms among the poor (<LINK REF="REF-Essien-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Essien 2005</LINK>). Even when cost is not an issue, non-availability of condoms often results in unprotected sexual practices (<LINK REF="REF-Kumar-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumar 2006</LINK>). This problem affects not only LMICs, but also high-income countries such as the United States, where many African-Americans are unable to purchase condoms due to financial barriers (<LINK REF="REF-Essien-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Essien 2005</LINK>). Other authors have also mentioned that in certain societies, the setting in which condoms are provided, commercialized and purchased may hinder their acquisition from possible buyers/consumers (e.g. buying them in a public place (<LINK REF="REF-Roth-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roth 2001</LINK>)). Also, in many societies moral values and ethnic and religious factors play an important role in health behaviors and health promotion policies (<LINK REF="REF-Koenig-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koenig 2012</LINK>). For example, the Catholic Church considers any contraceptive method as a transgression of divine law (<LINK REF="REF-HUMANAE-VITAE-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">HUMANAE VITAE 1968</LINK>), a mandate that some devout Catholics observe (<LINK REF="REF-Lefkowitz-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lefkowitz 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Moreover, lack of condom usage is also a consequence of limited knowledge about HIV prevention and a low level of education (<LINK REF="REF-Dandona-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dandona 2005</LINK>). Other social determinants such as women's lack of empowerment, scarce dialogue within couples, domestic violence, and prejudice related to condom use could increase the risk of unsafe sexual practices (<LINK REF="REF-Sarkar-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sarkar 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Among female sex workers (FSW), limited knowledge about HIV transmission, a client's refusal to use condoms, or coercion and control by pimps or brothel owners act as barriers to condom use (<LINK REF="REF-Xia-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xia 2005</LINK>). For men who have sex with men (MSM), negative community attitudes towards homosexuality combined with legal restrictions on their sexual behavior and official relationships contribute to the marginalization and stigmatization of this community and drive their relationships underground, hindering an easy acquisition of condoms and resulting in risky sexual behavior (<LINK REF="REF-Adimora-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adimora 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is also important to mention that depending on the local context, prevalence of condom use tends to differ between different sex-risk-behavior groups. Several studies have described a tendency of high-risk groups such as individuals with multiple sexual partners and frequent casual sexual encounters (<LINK REF="REF-Maticka_x002d_Tyndale-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maticka-Tyndale 2012</LINK>), MSM (<LINK REF="REF-Adam-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adam 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lau-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lau 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reece-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reece 2010</LINK>) and FSWs (<LINK REF="REF-Maticka_x002d_Tyndale-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maticka-Tyndale 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rojanapithayakorn-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rojanapithayakorn 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Suleman-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suleman 2012</LINK>) to report higher condom use figures than non-high-risk groups (<LINK REF="REF-Abdullah-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abdullah 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jones-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reece-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reece 2010</LINK>). The general population tends to present a lower condom use prevalence for reasons such as use of other contraceptive methods (<LINK REF="REF-Abdullah-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abdullah 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jones-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2012</LINK>) and a negative perception of condoms, which symbolize promiscuity and unfaithfulness (<LINK REF="REF-Maticka_x002d_Tyndale-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maticka-Tyndale 2012</LINK>). Consequently, condom promotion interventions may also have a different impact on each of these populations.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-06-20 07:24:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is widely understood in the field of public health that social determinants of health, or the circumstances in which individuals are born, live, work and age, play an important role in their health (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2012</LINK>). Those contexts are shaped by structural determinants such as physical, social, cultural, legal, and organizational factors, and several other aspects of the environment that hinder or promote HIV prevention (<LINK REF="REF-Gupta-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sumartojo-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sumartojo 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>A structural intervention is defined as any public health intervention that aims to improve society's health status by modifying the context in which health-related risk behavior takes place (<LINK REF="REF-Blankenship-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blankenship 2000</LINK>). When addressing condom use through structural interventions, there are three key concepts to consider (<LINK REF="REF-Blankenship-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blankenship 2000</LINK>). The first one is availability, which focuses on the attitudes, materials, or settings that are essential to reduce exposure to a specific health problem (<LINK REF="REF-Blankenship-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blankenship 2000</LINK>). For example, community campaigns may install condom machines in public places, or implement a policy of 100% condom use in brothels (<LINK REF="REF-Blankenship-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blankenship 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Charania-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Charania 2011</LINK>). The second factor is acceptability, which sets out to modify the preconceptions in a society, allowing people to consider and accept new ideas (<LINK REF="REF-Blankenship-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blankenship 2000</LINK>) mainly through social learning theory (<LINK REF="REF-Bandura-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bandura 1986</LINK>). Programs to prevent the stigmatization of prostitution, sexual education, and marketing of condoms are examples (<LINK REF="REF-Blankenship-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blankenship 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Charania-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Charania 2011</LINK>). The last factor is accessibility, which aims to improve access to interventions, services and goods in health for those who face unfavourable social or economic conditions (<LINK REF="REF-Blankenship-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blankenship 2000</LINK>). Examples of this concept include distribution of free or low-cost condoms and the creation of female controlled prevention strategies, such as female condom use (<LINK REF="REF-Blankenship-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blankenship 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Charania-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Charania 2011</LINK>). Therefore, structural interventions usually include changes to policies, environment, or social beliefs, and in many cases also involve the empowerment of minorities and other disenfranchised groups (<LINK REF="REF-Adimora-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adimora 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Structural interventions can be implemented at three levels: individual, group, and community (<LINK REF="REF-Charania-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Charania 2011</LINK>). Individual and group level interventions target knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors associated with the condom use of the participant in one-on-one settings and in existing (e.g. a couple) or recently created groups, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Charania-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Charania 2011</LINK>). Community-level interventions have typically been conceptualized as geographic units (e.g. cities, counties, villages), although alternative conceptualizations of smaller units also exist (e.g. workplaces and schools) (<LINK REF="REF-Atienza-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atienza 2002</LINK>); the present review was developed based on the former concept. Interventions at a community level directly and indirectly concentrate on knowledge, attitudes and behaviors in relation to the entire community and strongly address the alteration of social norms (<LINK REF="REF-Charania-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Charania 2011</LINK>). This strategy might have the capacity to modify social determinants of health at all levels in which it is implemented (<LINK REF="REF-Swerissen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swerissen 2004</LINK>).</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-06-20 07:24:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Previous research on HIV and STI prevention strategies shows that structural interventions have the capacity to initiate significant change in behaviors and attitudes.</P>
<P>For example, Thailand's renowned 100% Condom Program modified availability and accessibility of condoms by empowering sex workers to consistently engage in safe sexual practices via government policies that enforced mandatory condom use (<LINK REF="REF-Rojanapithayakorn-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rojanapithayakorn 1996</LINK>). Likewise, in the Dominican Republic two non-governmental organizations (NGOs) investigated in 1995 the adoption of Thailand's initiative into the Dominican setting (<LINK REF="STD-Kerrigan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kerrigan 2006</LINK>). This intervention addressed the three different components of structural interventions at a group and community level. Assessment of this program revealed that condom use did increase after the introduction of this intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Kerrigan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kerrigan 2006</LINK>). Another program, the Sonagachi project in India, focused on community mobilization, aiming to reduce discrimination and stigma against FSWs (<LINK REF="STD-Basu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Basu 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Dealing with inequitable gender norms, especially those that define masculinity, was an important component of HIV prevention strategies in Brazil (<LINK REF="REF-Pulerwitz-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pulerwitz 2006</LINK>). In this intervention, the aim was to modify acceptability at a community level. In South Africa an HIV prevention strategy was implemented to modify both accessibility through a local micro-finance program addressed at women and acceptability by initiating community activism in opposition to women mistreatment (<LINK REF="REF-Gupta-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 2008</LINK>). Such interventions aim to empower women, decrease domestic violence and enable women to negotiate safe sex (<LINK REF="REF-Gupta-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Finally, media campaigns promoting condom use also have the potential to influence norms and change values, expectations, and behaviors by modifying acceptability at a community level (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>In spite of the cost, financial analyses demonstrate that structural interventions may have the most impact in HIV prevention, and may also generate other social advantages, such as stimulating the economy and making gains in human rights (<LINK REF="REF-Hecht-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hecht 2009</LINK>). Given the large amount of resources required for individual-based interventions to be successfully implemented on a broader scale, it has been hypothesized that structural interventions might be an adequate solution since they are more ample in their scope (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 2006</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-06-20 07:24:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite the implementation of extensive HIV prevention programs over the past decades, the number of people newly infected with HIV continues to rise in some regions across the globe (<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2013</LINK>). Some studies argue that one of the reasons for this phenomenon is the excessive attention to individual behaviors at the expense of changes to the context in which those behaviors occur (<LINK REF="REF-Barnett-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnett 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The consensus in recent years that social factors affect HIV transmission as well as risky sexual behaviors has prompted an increasing attention on structural interventions for HIV and other STIs (<LINK REF="REF-Gupta-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 2008</LINK>). However, few strategies to prevent HIV transmission have implemented structural interventions, mainly due to a lack of clear definition, a poor understanding of technical implementation, and insufficient data to support the effectiveness of such interventions in the context of people living with HIV (<LINK REF="REF-Gupta-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Behavioral interventions that aim to encourage a change in individual attitudes toward safer sexual practices such as condom use or reduction of sexual partners play an important role in overall HIV prevention efforts. However, these interventions alone may be inadequate to produce substantial and long-term reductions in HIV transmission (<LINK REF="REF-Coates-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coates 2008</LINK>). As a result, taking into account the limitations of these strategies, structural interventions offer a potentially powerful shift in the manner HIV prevention is implemented (<LINK REF="REF-Blankenship-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blankenship 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite a growing interest in the topic, there is little evidence on structural interventions at a community level that aim to increase condom use to prevent HIV and other STIs. Policy makers require high quality quantitative information in order to develop and implement prevention programes, as well as to set priorities in research and funding (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2008</LINK>). Determining if structural interventions for promoting condom use are effective in halting HIV transmission at a community level is central to the current strategies against HIV, given the number of people whose lives may be improved by this policy. In addition,deciding what the most effective approaches to reducing HIV transmission are will allow wise investment in public health resources.</P>

<P>We anticipated substantial heterogeneity across studies, and thus we undertook meta-analysis of these studies with caution. For studies that were homogenous with respect to types of study populations, interventions and outcome measures, overall risk ratios were calculated and translated into risk ratio reductions. When there was no statistically significant heterogeneity (P &lt; 0.10) in the results, we used a fixed-effect model (Mantel-Haenszel). When there was statistically significant heterogeneity we identified possible explanations and used a random-effects model (DerSimonian and Laird method); this was compared with the corresponding results of the fixed-effect model. The following factors were considered as possible explanations for significant heterogeneity: study quality, patient gender or age, or both, study setting (low- and middle-income or high-income countries), and type of intervention. To test for robustness of results, we performed sensitivity analyses.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Correction for cluster effect in RCTs: <I>intra-cluster correlation coefficient (</I>ICC)</HEADING>
<P>As community-level interventions were the objective of the present analysis, we only included cluster-RCTs in this review. Therefore, calculation of design effects (DEs) was necessary to estimate effective sample sizes. In order to calculate these figures (DE), intra-cluster correlation coefficients (ICCs) were required (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2000</LINK>). Since the majority of studies did not report on ICCs, we attempted to contact the authors (via email) to obtain those figures. Unfortunately, we often failed to receive any response, or the answer did not provide the information we needed (e.g. the study was conducted a long time ago, and those data were not available). We therefore decided to screen other trials with similar populations in order to infer the ICCs. It proved difficult to obtain studies in which the cluster size matched studies in this review. Furthermore, when correcting for ICCs it is preferable to assign an individual ICC value to each outcome instead of using one single ICC for all outcomes in one trial (<LINK REF="REF-Taljaard-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taljaard 2008</LINK>). Given these obstacles, we decided to employ a regression model to generate an estimated ICC value for every single outcome in each trial. We ran a model with natural logarithm of ICC as the dependent variable, and both average cluster size and outcome prevalence as the independent variables. We hypothesized that this specific set of variables would predict the value of any given ICC. The required data to build the model was obtained from studies that reported both the covariates and an individual ICC value for each outcome. Five studies were included in the final model (<LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Amico-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Amico 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feldblum-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Feldblum 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Garcia-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Majoko-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Majoko 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taljaard-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taljaard 2008</LINK>). After running the linear regression model, we found that the hypothesized independent variables (average cluster size and outcome prevalence) were significant and in agreement with other studies (<LINK REF="REF-Killip-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Killip 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taljaard-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taljaard 2008</LINK>). The model explained 45% of variation in ICCs (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). Residuals were calculated and displayed no evident pattern, indicating ordinary least squares regression was appropriate for this data. Finally, the model was used to estimate the ICC for a given prevalence and average cluster size for each outcome.</P>
<P>Then the DE was calculated using the standard formula: 1+ ((average cluster size -1) * ICC) (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>, Section 16.3.4). Once the DE was estimated, effective sample sizes for each individual outcome were calculated by dividing the original sample size by the DE. Finally, these effective sample sizes were the figures used in the meta-analysis. We set an upper limit of 40 to the design effect, which corresponds to ICCs higher than 0.1 for the cluster sizes in the selected studies. This limit was chosen based on the trend reported by Taljaard and Donner (<LINK REF="REF-Taljaard-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taljaard 2008</LINK>) in which design effects rarely surpass this value.</P>
<P>Since outcomes may vary based on ICC fluctuation, sensitivity analysis was carried out with an ICC of 0 (i.e. original sample size with no correction), 0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.05 and 0.1 for every outcome in which a meta-analysis was possible.</P>

<P>Due to the nature of the intervention, blinding was not feasible. Since the primary outcomes were biological, it is unlikely that lack of blinding influenced those results. Therefore, all studies were considered to be at low risk of bias for the primary outcomes. It is also unlikely that lack of blinding biased the measurement of knowledge since this outcome was measured through standardized questionnaires. On the other hand, results including self reported behaviors may be prone to bias when individuals know they have taken part in an intervention. Thus, significant changes for this type of outcome (i.e. condom use during last sexual intercourse and two or more sexual partners in the last year) should be interpreted with caution.</P>

Three studies were considered to be at unclear risk of bias: <LINK REF="STD-Garcia-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia 2012</LINK> was cross-sectional, therefore there was no mention of attrition bias; <LINK REF="STD-Feldblum-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Feldblum 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-NIMH-2010" TYPE="STUDY">NIMH 2010</LINK> had attrition bias below 30% (the threshold point chosen for this systematic review), but the specific reasons for loss to follow-up were not clearly stated.

<P>Different individual recruitment, loss of clusters, early trial termination and inadequate statistical analysis were not detected. Although only four studies conducted pair-matched randomisation/block randomisation (<LINK REF="STD-Feldblum-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Feldblum 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Garcia-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jewkes-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Jewkes 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ross-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ross 2007</LINK>), no study was found to present baseline characteristic imbalance. Thus, all nine studies were deemed as at low risk of bias from these other sources.</P>
<P>Since all studies were community trials, control groups might have been exposed to external sources of information (i.e. national media advertisement, sex education programs in schools) related to condom use and HIV prevention, thus decreasing the relative effect of educational programs in the experimental group. This is known as secular trend, and it is considered as a possible source of bias in any trial conducted at community level (<LINK REF="REF-Atienza-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atienza 2002</LINK>). In this review, this possible source of bias was judged as unclear since it was not feasible to either confirm it or rule it out.</P>
<P>Funnel plots were possible for three outcomes: gonorrhea prevalence, chlamydia prevalence and two or more sexual partners in last year. Publication bias was not detected for gonorrhea prevalence (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>). Although the results for chlamydia prevalence suggested possible publication bias, this is unlikely since the direction of the effect indicates a higher risk of infection in the treatment group (i.e. four out of five studies reported a risk ratio above one; <LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>). The same trend was displayed by the outcome two or more sexual partners in the last year, in which four out of five trials reported a higher risk ratio in the treatment group when compared to controls (<LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-07-10 23:06:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review addressed the question of whether structural interventions to promote condom use at the community level reduced the incidence or prevalence of HIV and other STIs, assessed through laboratory test, as well as other secondary outcomes such as knowledge, self efficacy and sexual behaviors.</P>
<P>Nine studies meeting all inclusion criteria were obtained. Loss to follow-up in three studies was the only relevant source of bias. The studies featured condom acceptability by imparting sexual education and promoting social marketing of condoms; accessibility was addressed through provision of free condoms and implementation of micro-credits. After adjusting for clustering effects, the meta-analysis demonstrated the intervention(s) to have a non-significant effect in reducing incidence or prevalence of HIV, nor did they reduce prevalence or incidence of HSV-2, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia or trichomonas. One individual study (<LINK REF="STD-Garcia-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia 2012</LINK>) proved to be effective in reducing the prevalence of trichomoniasis in the general population when addressing both genders.</P>
<P>In each trial authors reported the possible reasons for the intervention(s) to have not had a significant effect on biological outcomes, including: a 'diluted' intervention in which the results were assessed in some people who were not directly exposed to the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Cowan-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cowan 2010</LINK>); social ambivalence toward condoms, thus hindering their use (<LINK REF="STD-Cowan-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cowan 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Doyle-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Doyle 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feldblum-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Feldblum 2001</LINK>); attrition bias since some people who received the intervention then left the study, consequently reducing the effect of the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Cowan-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cowan 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Doyle-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Doyle 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Garcia-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia 2012</LINK>); 'secular trend', defined as the exposure of the control groups to other sources of HIV and condom awareness such as media condom campaigns or sex education programs, thus reducing the relative impact of the intervention(s) in the experimental group (<LINK REF="STD-Doyle-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Doyle 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gregson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gregson 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kamali-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kamali 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NIMH-2010" TYPE="STUDY">NIMH 2010</LINK>); difficulty in changing behaviors (<LINK REF="STD-Doyle-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Doyle 2010</LINK>); insufficient statistical power (<LINK REF="STD-Gregson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gregson 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jewkes-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Jewkes 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kamali-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kamali 2003</LINK>); insufficient follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Gregson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gregson 2007</LINK>); and self reporting bias related to sexual behaviors (<LINK REF="STD-Jewkes-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Jewkes 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kamali-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kamali 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ross-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ross 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>The results varied substantially regarding secondary outcomes. There was no significant change in the prevalence of respondents with two or more sexual partners in the last year. Although individual trials did not demonstrate any statistically significant change in unprotected sex, the meta-analysis proved the intervention(s) to be effective; individual trials exploring consistent condom use showed non-significant results. All meta-analyses regarding change in knowledge yielded statistically significant results in favor of the intervention(s). Meta-analysis addressing self efficacy was not feasible, but all three individual studies reported no significant results.</P>
<P>After conducting sensitivity analysis with different ICC values, we found that biological and knowledge-related outcomes were robust, whereas behavioral outcomes such as condom use and number of sexual partners tended to fluctuate between significant and non-significant depending on the magnitude of the ICC.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Possible reasons for non-significant results</HEADING>
<P>One plausible explanation for the non-significant results regarding biological outcomes is that not all studies widely distributed free or low-cost condoms, limiting the effect of social acceptability and education regarding HIV and STIs due to financial barriers. However, this possible explanation was ruled out after conducting a stratified analysis which included studies featuring both education and free condom distribution, obtaining non-significant results (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-002.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.5</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-002.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.6</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is a a gap between improvement in knowledge, behaviors and biological outcomes. This review showed that people in intervention groups indeed acquired more knowledge about HIV prevention, but HIV and other STIs' prevalence and incidence did not decrease. Results involving knowledge and biological markers were robust, presenting no heterogeneity and similar outcomes when sensitivity analysis was conducted. In contrast, the intermediate results for behaviors showed a more diverse pattern; condom use showed a statistically significant change, whereas number of sexual partners in the last year did not. However, both of these outcomes showed volatility when sensitivity analysis was conducted. To explain this, several authors have pointed out that modifying sexual behaviors is a difficult task, irrespective of the approach used (<LINK REF="REF-Foss-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foss 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Michielsen-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michielsen 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ojo-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ojo 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ota-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ota 2011</LINK>). Another study showed that levels of consistent condom use have been far from optimum in many communities, despite continuous and intensive promotion campaigns (<LINK REF="REF-Potts-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Potts 2008</LINK>). This in turn may be accounted for the fact that sex occurs in private settings, making these behaviors more difficult to change (<LINK REF="REF-Coates-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coates 2008</LINK>), and because of the entrenched influence of cultural norms and religion (<LINK REF="REF-Lefkowitz-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lefkowitz 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thomsen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomsen 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is also extremely difficult to confirm the validity of self reported behaviors (<LINK REF="REF-Coates-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coates 2008</LINK>) given the tendency of people to over-report practices that are perceived as positive, and similarly, to under-report behaviors that have social negative connotations. This is called social desirability bias, and it is considered an undermining factor in self reported studies (<LINK REF="REF-Randall-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Randall 1991</LINK>). Likewise, lack of blinding could have introduced some bias in self reported condom use. Thus, the validity of the significant findings for these results is questionable, and may explain to some extent the poor impact on biological outcomes.</P>
<P>This review found no change in HIV/STI incidence and prevalence despite an apparent increase in condom use. This may be explained by inconsistent condom use (<LINK REF="REF-Hearst-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hearst 2004</LINK>). People may increase condom use as a result of campaigns, social acceptability and condom availability, but if condom use is not constant and concurrency takes place, particularly with multiple regular partners where condom use is more likely to be irregular (<LINK REF="REF-Foss-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foss 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mah-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mah 2010</LINK>), the probability of acquiring an HIV and other STI remains (<LINK REF="REF-Foss-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foss 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mah-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mah 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Senn-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Senn 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Subramanian-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Subramanian 2008</LINK>). Although this review did not present results regarding concurrency, and only included number of sexual partners, it is likely that both circumstances have played a role in the non-significant biological results (<LINK REF="REF-Gorbach-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gorbach 2005</LINK>). Most of the retrieved studies were obtained from Sub-Saharan Africa, a region in which concurrency has been frequently reported (<LINK REF="REF-Mah-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mah 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>In addition, a methodological issue involving the nature of control groups may explain to some degree the non-significant outcomes. Since constant campaigns on HIV prevention have been implemented in Sub-Saharan Africa (<LINK REF="REF-Painter-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Painter 2001</LINK>), some communities (e.g. South Africa, Senegal and Uganda) already had some awareness about HIV (<LINK REF="REF-Shisana-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shisana 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-USAID-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">USAID 2002</LINK>). As a consequence, control groups are likely to have been exposed to some type of 'intervention' by the time the reviewed strategies were implemented, partially offsetting the overall effect in the experimental group. This is a phenomenon known as a 'secular trend', and it has been regarded as a potential threat in any community trial (<LINK REF="REF-Atienza-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atienza 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Finally, this review attempted to be comprehensive by including all possible rigorous studies in which structural and community level interventions promoted condom use. However, there could be other structural and community-level strategies that may yield positive results, but have not been conducted/published under rigorous methodologies to date. For example, media advertisements or placement of public condom machines using a RCT design coupled with biological outcomes. Thus, future studies may change the conclusions we are presenting in this revision.</P>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-06-20 07:26:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A potential limitation to the external validity of this review is that seven out of the nine trials were carried out in Sub-Saharan Africa, a region that in turn is widely diverse. For example, male circumcision is practiced in most of West Africa, rather infrequent in several southern African countries, and variable in central and eastern Africa (<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2007</LINK>); Islam is the predominant religion in the countries located in the Sahel and the African horn, whereas Christianity is widely extended in central and southern Africa (<LINK REF="REF-Britannica-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Britannica 2003</LINK>); also, concurrency has been reported as more prevalent in western and central Africa when compared to eastern and southern Africa (<LINK REF="REF-Reniers-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reniers 2010</LINK>). In addition, the multi-country trial (<LINK REF="STD-NIMH-2010" TYPE="STUDY">NIMH 2010</LINK>) did not provide individual figures for each disease, leaving only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Garcia-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia 2012</LINK>) with specific results conducted outside Sub-Saharan Africa. Although the results from this review may not be applicable in other settings, most of the global HIV burden is concentrated in Sub-Saharan Africa, which underlines the relevance of the results to the current global HIV prevention context.</P>
<P>Furthermore, given both our definition of community and the population to which the interventions were addressed, the participants included in each trial were mainly drawn from the general population rather than high-risk populations such as men who have sex with men (MSM), injecting drug users (IDUs) or female sex workers (FSWs). Had the trials included and identified large segments of high-risk populations, our meta-analysis may have yielded different results.</P>
<P>Each individual trial proposed a specific set of STIs to be measured, thus making it unfeasible to assess the same STIs in all studies. This was also the case with the proposed secondary outcomes.</P>
<P>It is important to mention that although most studies reported on condom use, their type of assessment was not always comparable across trials; thus preventing a larger pooling of studies in the meta-analysis.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-06-24 08:03:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although only nine trials were retrieved, the number of total participants was large at 75,891. To the best of our knowledge, this meta-analysis covers the largest total sample size related to this topic. Moreover, all meta-analyses were consistent and had low heterogeneity.</P>
<P>An important finding of this review is that none of the studies implemented promotion of condoms as a unique intervention. In fact, all trials promoted it through education, distribution, or both, in combination with one or several of the following: training of medical staff, providing accessible and open health services to adolescents, educating parents on sexuality and encouraging dialogue about sex with teenagers, task-shifting through community members, income generation and strengthened treatment of STIs. Therefore, these results reflect the synergy of promoting condom use along with other strategies as opposed to an outcome derived solely from condom promotion. Nevertheless, conclusions can still be inferred based on these outcomes. Incidence or prevalence of HIV and most biological results did not change after the interventions, implying that condom use combined with other strategies enacted at a community level may not work effectively.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2014-06-20 07:27:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review only included biological outcomes confirmed by laboratory tests as primary results and thus excluded the possibility of self reporting bias. Moreover, all studies were RCTs, reducing the likelihood of imbalance of known and unknown baseline characteristics and confounders.</P>
<P>In order to conduct meta-analysis, each set of results should be comparable. Due to the limited number of studies that were retrieved and a large variation in methodology, performing meta-analysis was not always possible. When meta-analyses were feasible, only a few studies were included with an average of three trials per analysis.</P>
<P>Most studies reported blinding as unfeasible, or did not mention it at all, leading to possible bias in self reported outcomes. This may be the case with measures of condom use, in which a significant result was obtained. Bias arising from lack of blinding is unlikely in the other self reported outcome (two or more sexual partners in the last year) since it did not yield a significant result.</P>
<P>Attrition bias was an important finding in this review. Since the present study focused only on community interventions, entire populations were the subject of research. Under these circumstances, it was frequent that large numbers of participants left the study due to either migration or death, leading to incomplete data. This situation may have undermined to some extent the validity of our findings (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>In addition, the secular trend phenomenon that tends to take place in community trials may have biased to some extent the results in this review by diminishing the apparent effect that education could have on HIV/STIs prevention.</P>
<P>Moreover, It is possible that HIV/STIs prevention programs have different levels of impact depending on the actor leading the initiative. For example, the success of the100% condom use program in Thailand's brothels is likely to have worked since there was government enforcement at a national level (<LINK REF="REF-Rojanapithayakorn-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rojanapithayakorn 1996</LINK>). In Uganda, the early commitment of the government coupled with intersectoral collaboration (i.e. civil organizations, NGOs, private sector) is thought to have hampered the HIV epidemic (<LINK REF="REF-USAID-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">USAID 2002</LINK>). In most of the included studies for this revision, the interventions were led by an international organization/NGO, and some through a partnership between these institutions and local governments. Unfortunately, it was not possible to obtain studies in which a policy change led primarily by the local government took place under the experimental conditions proposed in this review.</P>
<P>Finally, the primary purpose of this review was to explore the effect of condom promotion on the transmission of HIV and other STIs; thus, only studies reporting biological outcomes were included. This approach, in consequence, may have limited the validity of the secondary outcomes reported in this revision. Depending on the scope and purpose of further updates of this document, the inclusion of studies might not be restricted by the type of outcomes so that all results are free of bias.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2014-06-20 07:26:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review found that the intervention(s) had a significant impact in increasing both condom use at last sex and knowledge that condoms can prevent the transmission of HIV and other STIs. However, the incidence and prevalence for HIV and HSV-2 as well as the prevalence of gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis and trichomonas did not yield a significant change after the interventions were implemented. Similarly, number of sexual partners did not show a significant decrease.</P>
<P>The present findings are in agreement with other systematic reviews that found the continued transmission of HIV despite increased condom use (<LINK REF="REF-Ng-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ng 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ota-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ota 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shahmanesh-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shahmanesh 2008</LINK>) One systematic review featuring behavioral interventions (i.e acceptability) at group and community level in FSWs (<LINK REF="REF-Wariki-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wariki 2012</LINK>) found that HIV transmission declined when results were assessed within six months immediately after the intervention was conducted; however, a non-significant effect was found at 12 months&#8217; follow-up. <LINK REF="REF-Sangani-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sangani 2004</LINK> found that population-based interventions implementing education for preventing STIs did not reduce HIV transmission. It should be also noted that few publications have directly assessed HIV sero-prevalence as an outcome, so many reviews could not be compared.</P>
<P>Systematic reviews have found contradictory results regarding condom use along with behavioral interventions and their impact in transmission of other STIs. We found that the intervention(s) described in this paper do not reduce transmission of most STIs. Thus, our results were consistent with other systematic reviews on this topic: <LINK REF="REF-Medley-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Medley 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Ota-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ota 2011</LINK> found a non-significant effect in STI reduction, <LINK REF="REF-Underhill-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Underhill 2008</LINK> did not find any statistical effect on self reported STIs, and <LINK REF="REF-Michielsen-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michielsen 2010</LINK> found only one study reporting a decrease in HSV-2. In contrast, studies with pooled results of several STIs such as <LINK REF="REF-Charania-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Charania 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Herbst-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herbst 2007a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lyles-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lyles 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shahmanesh-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shahmanesh 2008</LINK>, and with individual STI outcomes such as <LINK REF="REF-Ng-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ng 2011</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Wariki-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wariki 2012</LINK> found statistical differences between intervention and control groups after the interventions were conducted. <LINK REF="REF-Sangani-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sangani 2004</LINK> found mixed results (individual STI results). It is, however, difficult to establish a direct comparison with several of those analyses, since many of them did not provide independent figures for each disease, but aggregated all STIs into a unique composite score.</P>
<P>This review yielded a non-significant effect in changing the number of sexual partners. This was consistent with previous studies by <LINK REF="REF-Ojo-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ojo 2011</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Michielsen-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michielsen 2010</LINK> (who found heterogeneous results, highlighting an overall non-significant result), and partially by <LINK REF="REF-Townsend-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Townsend 2013</LINK> who found mixed or little effect. The opposite result was reported by <LINK REF="REF-Paul_x002d_Ebhohimhen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paul-Ebhohimhen 2008</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Lyles-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lyles 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Herbst-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herbst 2007a</LINK>, and <LINK REF="REF-Noar-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noar 2008</LINK>. However, in the majority of systematic reviews we found, the number of sexual partners is usually either aggregated into a composite score (risky behaviors) or not assessed at all.</P>
<P>This review found that condom use increased after intervention. This was also reported by <LINK REF="REF-Charania-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Charania 2011</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Medley-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Medley 2009</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Herbst-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herbst 2007a</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Herbst-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herbst 2007b</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Lyles-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lyles 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Shahmanesh-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shahmanesh 2008</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2008</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Underhill-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Underhill 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Wariki-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wariki 2012</LINK>; studies in which the target was mainly high risk populations (i.e. FSWs, MSM, IDUs). <LINK REF="REF-Wang-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2011</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Bertrand-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bertrand 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Sangani-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sangani 2004</LINK> found a small increase in condom use; with the exception of <LINK REF="REF-Wang-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2011</LINK>, they were conducted in the general population.

<P>Findings in this review demonstrated increased knowledge about HIV and STIs. The same result was reported by <LINK REF="REF-Medley-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Medley 2009</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Paul_x002d_Ebhohimhen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paul-Ebhohimhen 2008</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Underhill-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Underhill 2008</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Ota-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ota 2011</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Bertrand-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bertrand 2006</LINK>. No systematic review was found stating that knowledge did not increase after intervention.</P>

<P>Although several of these systematic reviews have directly or indirectly assessed the impact of condom promotion, this is the first review reporting on individual biological outcomes and including only community-based interventions. For example, <LINK REF="REF-Charania-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Charania 2011</LINK> focused on reported condom use and only provided a unique pooled figure for STIs incidence in which all three levels of interventions (i.e. individual, groups and community) were combined; moreover, it did not mention what particular STIs were included in the analysis. <LINK REF="REF-Herbst-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herbst 2007a</LINK> did not include the general population, and <LINK REF="REF-Ng-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ng 2011</LINK> focused on STI control and did not use structural approaches. Moreover, despite the different methodologies used in the trials included in this review, a quantitative estimate of the intervention's effect (i.e. meta-analysis) was possible.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-06-20 07:24:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We did not find clear evidence that condom promotion, when implemented at community and structural levels, reduces the transmission of HIV or other STIs.<I> </I>The quality of evidence for HIV transmission was moderate when analysed as incidence data due to imprecision, and low when analysed as prevalence data due to imprecision and risk of bias. Moreover, caution is advised regarding to what extent this conclusion reflects the full spectrum of structural interventions, as well as the population in which it is applicable. The selected studies were conducted primarily in Eastern and Southern Africa, and to a lesser extent, in other developing nations (i.e. Peru, China, India, Rusia). Therefore, our conclusions are mainly applicable to these settings and inferences may not be adequate in other contexts. Despite these limitations, it is important to note that the largest proportion of the global HIV burden takes place in these countries, with Sub-Saharan Africa the most affected region worldwide; therefore, our conclusions are pertinent to the current context of the HIV epidemic.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Other considerations</HEADING>
<P>Since the intervention assessed in this review did not have a clear impact in preventing the transmission of HIV and other STIs, efforts to scale up programs that have already proven useful in doing so, such as, but not limited to, circumcision for heterosexual men (<LINK REF="REF-Arora-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arora 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Siegfried-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siegfried 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weiss-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weiss 2000</LINK>) and provision of antiretroviral treatment for people living with HIV (in general and high-risk populations) should be evaluated (<LINK REF="REF-Anglemyer-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anglemyer 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cohen-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 2011</LINK>). Consequently, governments, private sector stakeholders, NGOs and policy makers may need to consider reallocation of some resources from broad-based condom use campaigns in the general population to, for example, HIV screening and treatment programs and male circumcision projects in those developing regions in which the latter interventions have been overlooked. This is of special relevance in those contexts wherein HIV is prevalent. These interventions could be enhanced with community engagement, awareness building and innovative ideas to promote condoms. Also, efforts from the scientific community and financial sponsors should be devoted to search and develop more effective and cost-effective strategies to decrease HIV transmission, such as vaccination or identification of what kinds of voluntary testing and counseling programs are feasible and cost-effective in specific settings. We suggest that these initiatives should be tested within community and structural frameworks to determine their effectiveness under such conditions. </P>

</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-06-20 07:24:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To evaluate the full extent of the role that structural interventions play in condom promotion, we recommend applying strategies that engage different mechanisms to those described in this review. Such interventions should be methodologically strict (i.e. RCTs, providing biological data) and may include changes to policies, installing condom machines, use of public health media campaigns and women empowerment. It is possible that these strategies may have the potential to prevent the transmission of HIV and other STIs.</P>
<P>A significant finding in our review is the inconsistent reporting of ICCs in the literature, suggesting that most cluster trials do not provide ICCs when presenting their results. When conducting systematic reviews that include cluster-RCTs, it is essential to take into account and report design effects and ICCs in order to adjust for the heterogeneity within and between groups. Therefore, we call on researchers to report individual ICCs for each included outcome when conducting cluster trials. In the case of systematic reviews that include cluster studies where ICCs were not reported, it is important to implement a standard procedure to estimate those figures accurately.</P>
<P>Future research that explores structural interventions should both state which of its three main components - acceptability, accessibility or availability &#8211; was conducted and identify the underlying factors influencing these components. If more than one of these interventions were carried out, the review should implement stratified analysis, since each subintervention tackles different obstacles. For example, if a community changes its perception about certain technology (e.g. condoms) but faces economic barriers to purchase it, it is unlikely the intervention produces the expected changes. Using this approach would allow authors to pinpoint which substrategy or combination of substrategies yielded results and which did not.</P>
<P>Finally, since the present review treated the term 'community' as a whole geographical area (i.e. towns, cities), the participants were mainly general and not high-risk populations. Thus, those definitions in which a community implies a smaller group of people were excluded. These 'smaller communities' include brothels, MSM groups, and STI clinics. Therefore, further research should be undertaken to evaluate if high-risk community interventions, at a structural level, and promoting condom use yield better results than those obtained in this review.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Title in the Review</HEADING>
<P>The title slightly changed since the Protocol was published, from "Structural and community-level interventions for increasing condom use to prevent HIV and other sexually transmitted infections" to " Structural and community-level interventions for increasing condom use to prevent the transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections."</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Authors</HEADING>
<P>The authors changed from &#8220;Nababan H, Ota E, Wariki WMV, Koyanagi A, Ezoe S, Shibuya K, Tobe-Gai R&#8221; in the last published protocol, to &#8220;Moreno R, Nababan HY, Ota E, Wariki WMV, Ezoe S, Gilmour S, Shibuya K&#8221; in this document.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Type of interventions</HEADING>
<P>When a trial did not explicitly mention condom promotion but the intervention suggested it, authors were contacted (via email) in order to clarify whether condom promotion occurred or not.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Population</HEADING>
<P>The protocol mentioned examples of 'communities', but without specifying the definition used during study selection. Nonetheless, this concept was crucial during the selection of trials as each study defined the term 'community' in a different manner. Therefore, the selection criterion was based on the most accepted and common concept of community: &#8220;a geographic unit, such as counties, cities or villages&#8221; (<LINK REF="REF-Atienza-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atienza 2002</LINK>). Thus, trials conducted exclusively in 'smaller communities' such as schools, workplaces, brothels or others alike were ruled out.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The original primary outcomes were: reported condom use, HIV incidence or prevalence and STI incidence or prevalence. However, during the review process it was decided that in order to give strength to the review, intermediate outcomes (i.e. reported condom use) should be avoided as primary outcomes and as selection criteria. Instead, only those studies reporting biological data were included. Studies that solely contained self reported STIs without laboratory confirmation were excluded as well.</P>
<P>The initial secondary outcomes for this review were: knowledge about condom use (both self reported and tested), attitudes towards condom use (both self reported and tested), condom acquisition/procurement, stated intention to use condoms, negotiation skills around condom use (both self reported and tested), changes of other STI risk-related practices, including number of partners, process indicators reporting on satisfaction with and/or acceptability of aspects of the intervention (including the mode of condom distribution as well as the structure and/or content of the condom promotion strategy), reported harms related to condom use, such as domestic violence, abuse or allergic reactions to latex, and comparative costs of interventions. However, for several reasons not all these outcomes were included in this review: first, most of these results were not reported in the original papers; second, if they were reported, it was difficult to include these results in a meta-analysis given the different presentation of the data; third, in this review 26 different results were already presented, so the addition of extra outcomes would have made the document difficult to follow given its extension.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>The protocol stated that when possible, stratified analysis would be undertaken among participant subgroups. Subgroups included age, gender, and primary motivation for condom use (contraception and prophylaxis versus prophylaxis only). Additional stratified analyses divided studies according to methodological quality, when sufficient numbers were available. However, since outcomes were homogeneous for all results, subanalysis was deemed unnecessary.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Correction for cluster effect</HEADING>
<P>In the original protocol it was stated that different statistical methods would be used when needed, without mentioning a specific strategy to calculate cluster effect and ICCs. Since it was not possible to find ICCs from authors, and a unique ICC value applied to all results taken from a trial with the same total population is inaccurate, we decided to use a linear regression model to find the missing ICCs.</P>

<P>Intervention:</P>
<P>The intervention was based on community popular opinion leaders, people defined as natural leaders of the communities - who conveyed an educational message about HIV/AIDS, including condom use and in general safer sex practices. These community popular opinion leaders reached the community in public venues where people tend to gather. The objective was to change people&#8217;s behaviours by using the innovation diffusion theory which posits that innovations and changes often originate within a subset of the population, made up of its opinion leaders whose views are then adopted by others in the community. Because the intervention was carried out in different cultural settings, the content of the program was tailored to fit each local community</P>
<P>Control: General information and education about HIV/AIDS was communicated through brochures and educational materials, along with HIV/STI counselling, testing, and - if positive - treatment. This group was also given free or inexpensive condoms</P>

<P>The available text in the ClinicalTrials.gov's webpage with the name "Assessing the Impact of an Intervention to Prevent Intimate Partner Violence and HIV in Uganda" (ID: NCT02050763) does not provide proper information about the study's design or its results. The only full-text study related to this clinical trial and that is available in other databases is "A Public Health Approach to Intimate Partner Violence Prevention in Uganda" by Wagman JA, published in 2012. However, this document only describes a theoretical framework, the implementation and design of the project and the challenges faced by the research team. It is a descriptive document without quantitative results. Thus, no proper classification of the study was feasible (it is unclear if the study was implemented at a community level, the specific type of interventions implemented, if condoms were delivered and if the study collected HIV samples after the intervention(s) took place)</P>
