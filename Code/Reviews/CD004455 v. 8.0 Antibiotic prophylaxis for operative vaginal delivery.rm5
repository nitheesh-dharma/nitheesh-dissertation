<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-07-30 15:10:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>
<B>What is the issue?</B>
</P>
<P>We wanted to assess whether giving antibiotics to all women undergoing operative vaginal deliveries (using vacuum suction or forceps) prevents infections in the mother without increasing other adverse outcomes in the mother and baby.</P>
<P>
<B>Why is this important?<BR/>
</B>Women who undergo vacuum or forceps assisted vaginal births may be more likely to have an infection after the birth or be re-admitted to hospital after the birth when compared to women who experience a normal spontaneous vaginal birth. The main reasons for an operative vaginal delivery are a prolonged second stage of labour, suspicion of problems with the baby and a desire to shorten the second stage of labour for maternal benefit.</P>
<P>Prophylactic antibiotics may be used to prevent or reduce the risk of these infections. However, there are still some doubts about the benefit of prophylactic antibiotics in reducing postpartum infection after operative vaginal delivery.</P>
<P>
<B>What evidence did we find?</B>
</P>
<P>We searched for evidence in July 2017 and identified only one study published in 1989. The study included 393 women undergoing either vacuum or forceps delivery comparing those receiving the antibiotic cefotetan with those women who received no treatment. There were no differences between the two groups of women in terms of age, previous pregnancies and other important characteristics. The only two outcomes reported in the trial were infection of the uterus (endometritis) and length of hospital stay. The trial reported that seven women had an infection of the uterus (endometritis) in the group that did not receive any antibiotics. No woman in the antibiotic group was reported to have an infection. Giving antibiotics had no effect on length of hospital stay for the mother for either group. The quality of the evidence for these two outcomes was assessed as being low: the evidence comes from a single trial, which included a very small number of women and reported on only two outcomes.</P>
<P>
<B>What does this mean?</B>
</P>
<P>Evidence from this single trial suggests that antibiotic prophylaxis may lead to little or no difference in endometritis or maternal length of stay. There were no data on any other outcomes to evaluate the impact of antibiotics for preventing infection after operative vaginal delivery. Future research on antibiotic prophylaxis for operative vaginal delivery is needed to provide evidence on whether it is a useful intervention.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-07-12 11:27:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register (12 July 2017), <A HREF="http://clinicaltrials.gov/">ClinicalTrials.gov</A>, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (<A HREF="http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/">ICTRP</A>) (12 July 2017) and reference lists of retrieved studies.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All randomised trials comparing any prophylactic antibiotic regimens with placebo or no treatment in women undergoing vacuum or forceps deliveries were eligible. Participants were all pregnant women without evidence of infections or other indications for antibiotics of any gestational age undergoing vacuum or forceps delivery for any indications. Interventions were any antibiotic prophylaxis (any dosage regimen, any route of administration or at any time during delivery or the puerperium) compared with either placebo or no treatment.</P>

<P>Two review authors assessed trial eligibility and methodological quality. Two review authors extracted the data independently using prepared data extraction forms.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-07-30 15:08:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>One trial, involving 393 women undergoing either vacuum or forceps deliveries, was included. The trial compared the antibiotic intravenous cefotetan after cord clamping compared with no treatment. This trial reported only two out of the nine outcomes specified in this review. Seven women in the group given no antibiotics had endomyometritis and none in prophylactic antibiotic group, the risk reduction was 93% (risk ratio (RR) 0.07; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.00 to 1.21; low-quality evidence). There was no difference in the length of hospital stay between the two groups (mean difference (MD) 0.09 days; 95% CI -0.23 to 0.41; low-quality evidence). Overall, the risk of bias was judged to be unclear. The quality of the evidence using GRADE was low for both endometritis and maternal length of stay.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-07-30 15:11:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-05-11 13:08:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Operative vaginal delivery is the term used to describe delivery of the fetal head assisted by either vacuum extractor or forceps. The commonest indications for operative vaginal delivery are prolonged second stage of labour, suspicion of immediate or potential fetal compromise and shortening of the second stage of labour for maternal benefit (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2001</LINK>). The rates of operative vaginal delivery reported variously by centres in different countries (<LINK REF="REF-Cammu-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cammu 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hanley-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanley 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hehir-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hehir 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Janni-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Janni 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kabiru-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kabiru 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lawani-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawani 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mola-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mola 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walsh-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh 2013</LINK>) range from 2.1% in Papua NewGuinea (<LINK REF="REF-Mola-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mola 2011</LINK>) to 19.2% of all births in Northern Belgium (<LINK REF="REF-Cammu-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cammu 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>The risk of postpartum infection is increased after operative vaginal birth because of higher rates of vaginal lacerations, routine bladder catheterisation, multiple vaginal examinations, insertion of instruments into the vagina and contamination (<LINK REF="REF-Chaim-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chaim 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pranchev-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pranchev 1993</LINK>). Instrumental deliveries require additional vaginal examinations, a known risk factor for endometritis and febrile morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dare-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dare 1998</LINK>). Insertion of instruments and contamination is also assumed to be one of the risks of postpartum infection because of difficulties in adhering to aseptic practices during delivery (<LINK REF="REF-Dare-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dare 1998</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-05-11 14:04:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Antibiotic prophylaxis is one of the methods used to reduce the risk of postpartum infections. It has been widely studied in obstetrics and has shown to be effective in reducing postoperative puerperal morbidity after caesarean section in a Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Smail-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smail 2014</LINK>). However, there are still some doubts about the benefit of prophylactic antibiotics in reducing postpartum infection after operative vaginal delivery.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-07-30 15:11:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>The reported incidence of postpartum infection or endometritis after operative vaginal delivery varied from 3.5% to 16% (<LINK REF="REF-Hagadorn_x002d_Freathy-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hagadorn-Freathy 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heitmann-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Heitmann 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kabiru-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kabiru 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 1991</LINK>). In addition, the outcomes of readmission within 60 days after delivery and maternal sepsis have been reported as increased in incidence following the use of operative vaginal delivery in comparison with spontaneous vaginal delivery (<LINK REF="REF-Acosta-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Acosta 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Liu-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2005</LINK>). Postpartum infection not only affects the physical status of the mother and prolongs hospital stay after birth but also significantly impacts on the psychological well-being of the mother (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>The most common micro-organisms in the genitourinary tract causing postpartum morbidities such as fever, endometritis, infected episiotomy/vaginal laceration or urinary tract infection are Enterococci, Streptococci, Staphylococci, Gram-negative bacilli and anaerobes (<LINK REF="REF-Kok-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kok 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stray_x002d_Pedersen-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stray-Pedersen 1988</LINK>). Group B streptococcus, <I>Enterococcus</I>, <I>Gardnerella vaginalis</I>, <I>Staphylococcus aureus </I>and anaerobe bacteria were usually recovered from the cervix and endometrium among febrile postpartum women (<LINK REF="REF-Eschenbach-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eschenbach 1986</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-07-30 15:11:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Previous studies (<LINK REF="REF-Janisch-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Janisch 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rechlin-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rechlin 1988</LINK>) have indicated that prophylactic antibiotics may not be necessary due to the relatively low risk of infectious morbidity, and uncertain effect on puerperal fever. Aseptic precautions during operative vaginal delivery may be enough to prevent postpartum infection (<LINK REF="REF-Janisch-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Janisch 1979</LINK>). In contrast, other studies did suggest that antibiotic prophylaxis might reduce the risk of infection after normal vaginal delivery and operative vaginal delivery (<LINK REF="REF-Fernandez-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fernandez 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heitmann-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Heitmann 1989</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Criscuolo-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Criscuolo 1990</LINK> suggested that the cost of prophylactic antibiotics could be much lower compared with the cost of treating the complications of infection related to procedures during delivery.</P>
<P>However, widespread use of antibiotics may contribute to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (<LINK REF="REF-Towers-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Towers 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weinstein-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weinstein 1996</LINK>). A study in Vietnam found that 98% of women who gave birth vaginally received antibiotics (<LINK REF="REF-Ngoc-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ngoc 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>In addition, antibiotics may contaminate breast milk, as well as cause adverse reactions such as rash or antibiotic-related diarrhoea (<LINK REF="REF-Dancer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dancer 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is also a concern that there may be a significantly increased risk of third or fourth degree tears, severe maternal morbidity and death, perinatal mortality and neonatal mortality in women with operative vaginal birth compared with normal birth (<LINK REF="REF-Angioli-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Angioli 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lumbiganon-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lumbiganon 2010</LINK>). The incidence of third- and fourth-degree tears reported range from 1% to 36% of all births (<LINK REF="REF-Boucoiran-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boucoiran 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goldberg-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldberg 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nkwabong-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nkwabong 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Panigrahy-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Panigrahy 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prapas-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prapas 2009</LINK>). The rate of perineal wound complication measured at two weeks postpartum was found to be significantly lower with the use of antibiotic prophylaxis; however, loss to follow-up was high and thus these results should be interpreted with caution (<LINK REF="REF-Buppasiri-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buppasiri 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Duggal-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duggal 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Therefore, the effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis for operative vaginal delivery needs to be carefully evaluated.</P>

<P>We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth&#8217;s Trials Register by contacting their Information Specialist (12 July 2017).</P>
<P>The Register is a database containing over 23,000 reports of controlled trials in the field of pregnancy and childbirth. For full search methods used to populate Pregnancy and Childbirth&#8217;s Trials Register including the detailed search strategies for CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL; the list of handsearched journals and conference proceedings, and the list of journals reviewed via the current awareness service, please follow this link to the editorial information about the <A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clabout/articles/PREG/frame.html">Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth</A> in the Cochrane Library and select the &#8216;<I>

<P>Search results are screened by two people and the full text of all relevant trial reports identified through the searching activities described above is reviewed. Based on the intervention described, each trial report is assigned a number that corresponds to a specific Pregnancy and Childbirth review topic (or topics), and is then added to the Register. The Information Specialist searches the Register for each review using this topic number rather than keywords. This results in a more specific search set that has been fully accounted for in the relevant review sections (<LINK TAG="INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Included studies</LINK>; <LINK TAG="EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Excluded studies</LINK>; <LINK TAG="ONGOING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Ongoing studies</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach</HEADING>
<P>We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach as outlined in the <A HREF="http://gdt.guidelinedevelopment.org/central_prod/_design/client/handbook/handbook.html">GRADE handbook</A> in order to assess the quality of the body of evidence relating to the following outcomes for the main comparison between any antibiotic prophylaxis (any dosage regimen, any route of administration or at any time during delivery or puerperium) compared with either placebo or no treatment.</P>

<P>We used the <A HREF="http://www.guidelinedevelopment.org/">GRADEpro</A> Guideline Development Tool to import data from Review Manager 5.3 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>) in order to create a &#8217;Summary of findings&#8217; table. A summary of the intervention effect and a measure of quality for each of the above outcomes was produced using the GRADE approach. The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome. The evidence can be downgraded from 'high quality' by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious) limitations, depending on assessments for risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates or potential publication bias.</P>

In future updates, we will assess statistical heterogeneity in each meta-analysis using the Tau, I and Chi statistics. We will regard heterogeneity as substantial if an I is greater than 30% and either a Tau is greater than zero, or there is a low P value (less than 0.10) in the Chi test for heterogeneity.

<P>If there is clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differ between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity is detected, we will use random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary, if an average treatment effect across trials is considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary will be treated as the average range of possible treatment effects and we will discuss the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials.

<P>Overall, the included study was at low risk of bias except for allocation concealment, blinding and selective reporting, the details for which were unclear. We could not assess fever, infected episiotomy/perineal/vaginal laceration, urinary tract infection, serious infectious complications and maternal adverse reactions because these outcomes were not reported in the trial. Therefore, we assessed endometritis and maternal length of stay in hospital. The quality of the evidence using GRADE was low for endometritis, and maternal length of stay in hospital.

<P>As the quality of the included trial is unclear, the potential for bias is present. Another significant source of potential bias is missing outcome data. Therefore study results should be interpreted with caution.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-05-11 15:36:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are no other systematic reviews on antibiotic prophylaxis for operative vaginal delivery published. No additional randomised controlled trials on this issue have been conducted. Although there was no evidence to support the use of antibiotic prophylaxis in operative vaginal delivery, it is widely used in clinical practice (<LINK REF="REF-Liabsuetrakul-2014a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liabsuetrakul 2014a</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-08-01 10:55:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>One small trial was identified reporting only two outcomes. Evidence from this single trial suggests that antibiotic prophylaxis may lead to little or no difference in endometritis or maternal length of stay. There were no data on any other outcomes to evaluate the impact of antibiotic prophylaxis after operative vaginal delivery.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-08-01 10:53:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Future research on antibiotic prophylaxis for operative vaginal delivery is needed to clarify whether this intervention is effective in reducing postpartum morbidity, particularly because it is widely used in current practice. Biases should be reduced by appropriate methods of allocation concealment, blinded interventions, clearly defined outcomes and consistent outcome measures. The drug regimens for future trials should be based on the principle of antibiotic prophylaxis for caesarean section with a single dose of intravenous ampicillin or first-generation cephalosporins after cord clamping.</P>

<P>Abstract only (translated). This randomised study included 200 women including, not only instrumental delivery but also women undergoing manual removal of placenta or uterine exploration, or both, premature rupture of the membranes of more than 6 hours and a labour of more than 8 hours. No details of the interventions were given for either the treatment or the control groups. The study outcomes of postpartum fever in both comparison groups were given but they were not described for subgroups; therefore, there were no data suitable for extraction. We could not find a published article. We have tried to contact the author but without success to date.</P>
