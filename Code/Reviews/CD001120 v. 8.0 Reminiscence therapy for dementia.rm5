In particular, we were interested in effects on quality of life, communication, cognition (the general ability to think and remember), mood, daily activities and relationships. We were also interested in any effects on carers.</P><P><B>Background</B></P><P>RT involves discussing events and experiences from the past. It aims to evoke memories, stimulate mental activity and improve well-being. Reminiscence is often assisted by props such as videos, pictures and objects. It can take place in a group or be done with a person on their own, when it often results in some form of life-story book being created. RT helps older people with depression. It may be suitable for people with dementia both because depression is common in dementia and because people with dementia typically have a better memory for the distant past than for recent events.</P><P><B>Methods</B></P><P>We searched for randomised, controlled trials in which RT was compared with no treatment or with a non-specific activity, such as time spent in general conversation. Our search covered all trials available up to April 2017.</P><P><B>Results</B></P><P>We found 22 trials with 1972 participants to include in the review. All the participants had dementia, mostly of mild or moderate severity. Some of the participants were living at home and some were in care homes. The length of the trials varied from four weeks to two years, and the overall amount of time spent on therapy varied from three to 39 hours. Overall, we thought most of the trials were well conducted.</P><P>Looking at all the trials together, there did not seem to be an effect of RT on the quality of life reported by the participants. However, there was probably a slight benefit of treatment in the trials done in care homes, which was not seen in the trials done in the community.</P><P>People having RT scored slightly better than the control group on tests of cognition immediately after the course of treatment, but not weeks to months later. It was not clear that the effect was large enough to be important. The effect was most evident in care home studies, which used individual RT, but not in community studies, which used group RT.</P><P>We found that group RT and RT in community settings may have a positive effect on the communication and interaction of the person with dementia immediately after the end of treatment, and probably also weeks to months later, although the effect was small.</P><P>Apart from a probable slight benefit of individual RT on scales measuring depressed mood, we found no evidence for effects of RT on other outcomes, such as agitation, ability to carry out daily activities or relationships with other people. We found no evidence of harmful effects of RT for the people with dementia themselves.</P><P>We found no effect of RT on family carers other than a suggestion that it made carers slightly more anxious in two large studies of joint reminiscence work. In this type of RT, the carers and the people with dementia were both directly involved in the reminiscence sessions.</P><P><B>Conclusions</B></P><P>We were encouraged to find that the amount and quality of research on RT for dementia has increased considerably since the last version of this review. We concluded that the effects of RT vary, depending on the way it is given and whether it takes place in care homes or the community. However, there is some evidence that RT can improve quality of life, cognition, communication and possibly mood in people with dementia in some circumstances, although all the benefits were small. More research is needed to understand these differences and to find out who is likely to benefit most from what type of RT.</P></SUMMARY_BODY></SUMMARY><ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2018-02-12 16:37:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2018-01-29 09:39:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson"><P>This updated Cochrane Review of reminiscence therapy (RT) for dementia was first published in 1998, and last updated in 2005. RT involves the discussion of memories and past experiences with other people using tangible prompts such as photographs or music to evoke memories and stimulate conversation. RT is implemented widely in a range of settings using a variety of formats.</P></ABS_BACKGROUND><ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2018-01-29 09:40:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson"><P>To assess the effects of RT on people living with dementia and their carers, taking into account differences in its implementation, including setting (care home, community) and modality (group, individual).</P></ABS_OBJECTIVES><ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2018-01-29 09:49:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson"><P>We searched ALOIS (the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register) on 6 April 2017 using the search term 'reminiscence.' </P></ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY><ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2018-01-29 09:49:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson"><P>We included all randomised controlled trials of RT for dementia in which the duration of the intervention was at least four weeks (or six sessions) and that had a 'no treatment' or passive control group. Outcomes of interest were quality of life (QoL), cognition, communication, behaviour, mood and carer outcomes.</P></ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA><ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2018-02-12 15:47:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Two authors (LOP and EF) independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Where necessary, we contacted study authors for additional information. We pooled data from all sufficiently similar studies reporting on each outcome. We undertook subgroup analysis by setting (community versus care home) and by modality (individual versus group). We used GRADE methods to assess the overall quality of evidence for each outcome.</P></ABS_DATA_COLLECTION><ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2018-02-12 16:37:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We included 22 studies involving 1972 people with dementia. Meta-analyses included data from 16 studies (1749 participants). Apart from six studies with risk of selection bias, the overall risk of bias in the studies was low.</P><P>Overall, moderate quality evidence indicated RT did not have an important effect on QoL immediately after the intervention period compared with no treatment (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.12 to 0.33; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 59%; 8 studies; 1060 participants). Inconsistency between studies mainly related to the study setting. There was probably a slight benefit in favour of RT in care homes post-treatment (SMD 0.46, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.75; 3 studies; 193 participants), but little or no difference in QoL in community settings (867 participants from five studies).</P><P>For cognitive measures, there was high quality evidence for a very small benefit, of doubtful clinical importance, associated with reminiscence at the end of treatment (SMD 0.11, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.23; 14 studies; 1219 participants), but little or no difference at longer-term follow-up. There was a probable slight improvement for individual reminiscence and for care homes when analysed separately, but little or no difference for community settings or for group studies. Nine studies included the widely used Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) as a cognitive measure, and, on this scale, there was high quality evidence for an improvement at the end of treatment (mean difference (MD) 1.87 points, 95% CI 0.54 to 3.20; 437 participants). There was a similar effect at longer-term follow-up, but the quality of evidence for this analysis was low (1.8 points, 95% CI -0.06 to 3.65).</P><P>For communication measures, there may have been a benefit of RT at the end of treatment (SMD -0.51 points, 95% CI -0.97 to -0.05; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 62%; negative scores indicated improvement; 6 studies; 249 participants), but there was inconsistency between studies, related to the RT modality. At follow-up, there was probably a slight benefit of RT (SMD -0.49 points, 95% CI -0.77 to -0.21; 4 studies; 204 participants). Effects were uncertain for individual RT, with very low quality evidence available. For reminiscence groups, evidence of moderate quality indicated a probable slight benefit immediately (SMD -0.39, 95% CI -0.71 to -0.06; 4 studies; 153 participants), and at later follow-up. Community participants probably benefited at end of treatment and follow-up. For care home participants, the results were inconsistent between studies and, while there may be an improvement at follow-up, at the end of treatment the evidence quality was very low and effects were uncertain.</P><P>Other outcome domains examined for people with dementia included mood, functioning in daily activities, agitation/irritability and relationship quality. There were no clear effects in these domains. Individual reminiscence was probably associated with a slight benefit on depression scales, although its clinical importance was uncertain (SMD -0.41, 95% CI -0.76 to -0.06; 4 studies; 131 participants). We found no evidence of any harmful effects on people with dementia.</P><P>We also looked at outcomes for carers, including stress, mood and quality of relationship with the person with dementia (from the carer's perspective). We found no evidence of effects on carers other than a potential adverse outcome related to carer anxiety at longer-term follow-up, based on two studies that had involved the carer jointly in reminiscence groups with people with dementia. The control group carers were probably slightly less anxious (MD 0.56 points, 95% CI -0.17 to 1.30; 464 participants), but this result is of uncertain clinical importance, and is also consistent with little or no effect.</P></ABS_RESULTS><ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2018-01-31 16:27:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson"><P>The effects of reminiscence interventions are inconsistent, often small in size and can differ considerably across settings and modalities. RT has some positive effects on people with dementia in the domains of QoL, cognition, communication and mood. Care home studies show the widest range of benefits, including QoL, cognition and communication (at follow-up). Individual RT is associated with probable benefits for cognition and mood. Group RT and a community setting are associated with probable improvements in communication. The wide range of RT interventions across studies makes comparisons and evaluation of relative benefits difficult. Treatment protocols are not described in sufficient detail in many publications. There have been welcome improvements in the quality of research on RT since the previous version of this review, although there still remains a need for more randomised controlled trials following clear, detailed treatment protocols, especially allowing the effects of simple and integrative RT to be compared.</P></ABS_CONCLUSIONS></ABSTRACT><BODY MODIFIED="2018-02-12 18:51:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2018-02-12 16:50:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Reminiscence therapy (RT) was introduced to dementia care in the late 1970s (<LINK REF="REF-Kiernat-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kiernat 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Norris-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norris 1986</LINK>), and has taken a variety of forms. At its most basic, it involves the discussion of past activities, events and experiences, usually with the aid of tangible prompts (e.g. photographs, household and other familiar items from the past, music and archive sound recordings). More recently, digital storage and presentation of photographs, music and video clips have become widely used (<LINK REF="REF-Subramaniam-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Subramaniam 2010</LINK>).</P><P>The development of reminiscence work is usually traced to <LINK REF="REF-Butler-1963" TYPE="REFERENCE">Butler 1963</LINK>'s early work on "Life Review." Butler described Life Review as a naturally occurring process where the person looks back on his/her life and reflects on past experiences, including unresolved difficulties and conflicts. This concept was incorporated in psychotherapy for older people, which emphasises that life review can be helpful in promoting a sense of integrity and adjustment. Butler's seminal work contributed to the change in professional perspectives on reminiscence. Rather than being viewed as a problem, with the older person 'living in the past,' reminiscence was sees as a dynamic process of adjustment. This fitted well with <LINK REF="REF-Erikson-1950" TYPE="REFERENCE">Erikson 1950</LINK>'s late-life stage of development, where the person is seen as reflecting on life, seeking to make sense and find meaning in a life lived.</P><P>Around the same time, increasing interest in oral history meant that the reminiscences of older people were valued more greatly. In the UK, the development of the 'Recall' tape-slide package (<LINK REF="REF-Help-the-Aged-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Help the Aged 1981</LINK>) meant that reminiscence triggers were widely available in day care centres, care homes and hospitals, leading many staff to establish some form of reminiscence work, of variable quality. There was also interest in using reminiscence to guide environmental design on the basis that, for example, a lounge of a care home which resembled a living room from earlier in the person's life would seem more familiar and might lead to better maintenance of independence.</P><P>It is evident that reminiscence work may take a number of different forms, from psychotherapy through to environmental redesign. There is an extensive literature on the various functions of reminiscence, with numerous classification systems proposed (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Romaniuk-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Romaniuk 1981</LINK>). Differences have emerged between reminiscence functions in their association with mental health, with seeking identity having a positive association and a focus on bitterness, boredom reduction and loss being associated with worse mental health (<LINK REF="REF-Ros-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ros 2016</LINK>). In one general systematic review of reminiscence work, across a variety of populations, drawing from over 100 studies, <LINK REF="REF-Pinquart-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pinquart 2012</LINK> categorised the type of 'therapeutic work' undertaken into three broad categories: 'simple reminiscence,' involving the recall and sharing of selected personal and shared memories and stories; 'life review,' seen as a structured, evaluative process, usually conducted individually, covering the whole life story chronologically, seeking to integrate negative and positive memories; and 'life review therapy,' typically aimed at people with depression or other mental health difficulties where the aim is to re-evaluate negative memories, promoting a more positive view of life. 'Life story work' is becoming increasingly used to describe aspects of reminiscence work, such as life review, where the emphasis is on developing a narrative biography, drawing together past, present and future. Life story books are common tangible outcomes from such work, but other media have also been used, such as a display box, portraying key elements of the person's life. Life story work has been employed with children and young people, people with learning disabilities and people with depression (<LINK REF="REF-Woods-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woods 2016</LINK>). The type of reminiscence work undertaken has important implications for the training, supervision and support needed by those acting as facilitators or therapists.</P><P>Reminiscence work, including life review, has consistently been helpful for older people with depressed mood (<LINK REF="REF-Bohlmeijer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bohlmeijer 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pinquart-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pinquart 2007</LINK>). The effects are comparable to both medication and other psychosocial approaches. Life review may also be helpful in preventing depression in older adults (<LINK REF="REF-Pot-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pot 2010</LINK>), and in improving life satisfaction and quality of life (QoL) in older adults in general (<LINK REF="REF-Bohlmeijer-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bohlmeijer 2007</LINK>). The effects are also seen in older people with depressed mood living in long-term care environments (<LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2015</LINK>). Given that depressed mood is more common in people with dementia, reminiscence work may be helpful in dementia in relation to improving mood.</P><P>In the context of dementia, reminiscence work can also be seen to have a cognitive rationale. People with dementia often appear able to recall events from their childhood, but not from more recent times, even earlier the same day. Drawing on the apparently preserved store of remote memories appears a sensible strategy, when dementia is typically accompanied by great difficulty in new learning. By linking with the person's cognitive strengths in this way, communication might be enhanced, allowing the person to talk confidently of their earlier life and experiences. In fact, studies of remote memory suggest that recall for specific events is not relatively preserved; performance across the lifespan is impaired but people with dementia, like all older people, have an 'autobiographical memory bump,' recalling more memories from youth and adolescence (<LINK REF="REF-Morris-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 1994</LINK>). Some of the memories represent well-rehearsed, much practised items or anecdotes. The almost complete absence of autobiographical memories from the person's middle years could lead to a disconnection of past and present, which could contribute to the person's difficulty in retaining a clear sense of personal identity. From a cognitive standpoint, autobiographical memory and level of communication appear key outcomes.</P><P>Since the first study on reminiscence work that was conducted with a group of older people with dementia was reported by <LINK REF="REF-Kiernat-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kiernat 1979</LINK>, the approach has continued to be implemented widely, in a variety of forms. However, the research literature has developed more slowly. The 2005 version of this review included only four studies, and several of them were of low quality. In a more recent review, <LINK REF="REF-Cotelli-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cotelli 2012</LINK> also highlighted the absence of high quality studies. <LINK REF="REF-Subramaniam-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Subramaniam 2012</LINK> focused on individual reminiscence work in their systematic review, identifying five randomised controlled trials (RCT), mainly with small sample sizes. The distinction between 'simple' reminiscence and 'life review,' often leading to the production of a life story book, appeared salient in these reviews. Simple reminiscence may be on an individual or a group basis, whereas life review is typically conducted individually. The involvement of family carers in reminiscence groups jointly with people with dementia is a further development, using simple reminiscence but potentially having an effect on pre-existing relationships (<LINK REF="REF-Bruce-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bruce 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thorgrimsen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Thorgrimsen 2002</LINK>).</P><P>The implications of this background for the current review are as follows.</P><UL><LI>The type of reminiscence work and its aims needs to be clearly defined. In considering reminiscence work with people with dementia, the key distinction is between 'simple' reminiscence work that has a focus on the individual making sense of their own life story, which is described as having an integrative function. This has implications for whether the work is carried out individually or in a group; life review/life story reminiscence is almost always individual, whereas simple reminiscence can be sustained in one-to-one settings or in a group. Life story work usually requires memory triggers specific to the person, whereas more general triggers may be sufficient to trigger a broad range of stories and memories, in simple reminiscence.</LI><LI>Different outcome measures may be appropriate according to the type of reminiscence work and its aims. The range of potential aims include: to enhance communication; to increase a sense of personal identity; to have an enjoyable activity in company with others; to improve mood and QoL; to stimulate memories; to increase the individualisation of care; or a combination of these. This list suggests that improvements in general cognition and behaviour might not be the most prominent of the changes expected, except as an indirect consequence of mood change perhaps.</LI><LI>The impact on others, in addition to the person with dementia, may also be important, particularly where family carers are involved in the reminiscence work. For example, <LINK REF="STD-Baines-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Baines 1987</LINK> examined staff knowledge of those attending group sessions; this increased in reminiscence groups compared with no treatment. Knowledge regarding the person with dementia is of course a prerequisite for individualised care.</LI><LI>Memories from the person's earlier life will not all be sources of pleasure and happiness; indeed some may be distressing or traumatic. Evaluation of any negative impact of this approach is required to monitor whether the recall of such memories occurs, and, if it does, whether these can be managed safely within the particular therapeutic context.</LI></UL></BACKGROUND><OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2018-01-29 11:55:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson"><P>To assess the effects of RT on people living with dementia and their carers, taking into account differences in its implementation, including setting (care home, community) and modality (group, individual).</P></OBJECTIVES><METHODS MODIFIED="2018-02-12 18:46:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2018-02-12 18:46:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><CRIT_STUDIES MODIFIED="2018-02-03 20:13:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Studies had to meet the following criteria.</P><UL><LI>RCTs including cluster randomised trials and cross-over trials that used RT of any type as an intervention for people living with dementia.</LI></UL><UL><LI>Control activity was no treatment, treatment as usual or a passive treatment such as basic social contact.</LI></UL><UL><LI>Study was written in English and published in a peer-reviewed journal.</LI></UL><P>Trials that did not publish (or later supply) adequate information about study design and results were included in the review but not in the meta-analysis.

This type of data required the mean change scores from baseline, the standard deviation of the mean change and the number of participants for each treatment group at each assessment. The majority of study authors did not report change scores from baseline. The baseline assessment was defined as the latest available assessment prior to randomisation, but no longer than two months prior. Where change scores were not reported, the review authors extracted the mean, standard deviation and number of participants for each treatment group at each time point and calculated the required summary statistics manually. In this case, a zero correlation between the measurements at baseline and assessment time was assumed. This method overestimates the standard deviation of the change from baseline, but this conservative approach is considered to be preferable in a meta-analysis.</P><P>The meta-analyses included the combination of data from trials that may not have used the same rating scale to measure a particular outcome. For example, cognition may have been measured by the MMSE in one study and the Autobiographical Memory Interview (AMI) in another. In this situation, the standardised mean difference (SMD; the absolute mean difference (MD) divided by the standard deviation) was used to measure the treatment difference. Where pooled trials used the same rating scale or test to measure an outcome, the MD was used.</P><P>To allow comparisons with other scales assessing similar outcomes, it was necessary to reverse the change scores on certain scales.

For SMDs, we have adopted the rule that an SMD of 0.5 or greater reflects an important difference, with SMDs less than 0.10 being negligible. For analyses using the MMSE, we judged a difference of 1.5 points or more as clinically important. The rate of decline on this measure has been estimated, in mild to moderate dementia, to be between 2 and 4 points per annum (<LINK REF="REF-Mohs-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mohs 2000</LINK>), and so 1.5 points is broadly equivalent to preventing six months of decline in cognition. For other measures, we did not have parallel criteria, so have applied the 0.5 of a standard deviation rule, taking the standard deviation from the baseline evaluations. Thus, for the QoL-AD, we have taken a difference of 3 points or more to be clinically meaningful, reflecting approximately half the typical standard deviation in samples of people with mild to moderate dementia (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Woods-2012a" TYPE="STUDY">Woods 2012a</LINK>).

It has now been possible to include large-scale multicentre RCTs, using clearly defined interventions and protocols. It has also been possible to exclude studies where the risk of bias was rated as too high, without detracting greatly from the volume of research considered. For several outcomes, meta-analyses included 800 or more participants. For the first time, it was possible to undertake analyses taking into account different modalities of reminiscence work and different contexts. Individual and group reminiscence work can now be considered separately for several outcomes, and community studies distinguished from those carried out in care homes.</P><P>The primary finding of the review was that reminiscence work was not associated consistently with improved well-being and QoL for people with dementia assigned to receive it in research studies. Although its clinical importance was uncertain, in care homes, but not in community settings, there was a probable benefit on QoL measures immediately following the reminiscence intervention. This finding arose from a meta-analysis of three studies, from different countries, involving 193 people with dementia. Notably, in four of the five community studies in this analysis (and none of the care home studies), the intervention involved <B>joint</B> group sessions, where people with dementia and their family carers participated together.</P><P>The extent to which reminiscence work would be predicted to improve cognitive functioning is debatable, but this review provides evidence (across 14 studies involving 1219 people with dementia) of a small benefit on cognitive tests evident immediately following the reminiscence work, but not sustained after a longer follow-up period. The analyses separating individual and group reminiscence work indicated probable slight benefits in cognition related to individual work. There was a probable slight benefit to cognition in care homes but not the community. The overall effect size for cognition at the end of treatment (SMD) was 0.11 (95% CI 0.00 to 0.23); the comparable SMD from the Cochrane Review of cognitive stimulation (<LINK REF="REF-Woods-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woods 2012b</LINK>) was 0.41 (95% CI 0.25 to 0.57). However, a direct comparison of the subset of studies using the MMSE in the two reviews indicated an MD of 1.74 points (95% CI 1.13 to 2.36), from 10 studies of cognitive stimulation involving 600 participants, compared with an MD of 1.87 points (95% CI 0.54 to 3.20) for nine studies of RT involving 437 participants. This suggests the effects may be comparable on the MMSE between the two types of interventions, but with a wider CI for the reminiscence result.</P><P>The quality of evidence relating to the communication and interaction outcome was lower, but there was probably a benefit of RT at longer-term follow-up, albeit of uncertain clinical importance. The number of studies including a relevant outcome measure was smaller (six at end of treatment, four at follow-up, with 200 or more participants in each case), and the large studies of joint (with carer) reminiscence work were among those without a relevant outcome measure in this domain. Here, a probable effect was evident for community-based studies at end of treatment and follow-up, but was even less certain in the care home context. Group reminiscence was associated with a probable slight benefit in communication immediately and a benefit within the clinically important range at follow-up, whereas (in smaller studies) there was considerable uncertainty in the results for individual reminiscence work.</P><P>Despite a body of evidence for the effects of reminiscence on depressed mood in older people without dementia (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Bohlmeijer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bohlmeijer 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pinquart-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pinquart 2007</LINK>), only individual reminiscence work was associated with a probable improvement in mood for people with dementia in this review, and the size of the effect (SMD -0.41) was relatively small and of uncertain clinical importance. There were no indications of benefits associated with reminiscence work in relation to the other outcomes examined for the person with dementia. These included the person's level of function, extent of irritability and agitation, and their own rating of the quality of relationship with their family carer. Despite the inclusion of several large studies of joint reminiscence work, where family carers were fully involved in the reminiscence sessions, we identified no benefits for family carers in relation to reduced stress related to caring, well-being and QoL, carer mood or the carer's rating of the quality of their relationship with the person with dementia. The only exception to this was a single care home study, with 88 participants, in which family carers probably experienced less stress after their relative had been involved in reminiscence groups, both immediately after treatment and at six months' follow-up. Interestingly, this was the only study to examine family carer outcomes that did <B>not </B>have a focus on joint reminiscence work. There were some suggestions from the REMCARE (REMiniscence groups for people with dementia and their family CAREgivers) trial (<LINK REF="STD-Woods-2012a" TYPE="STUDY">Woods 2012a</LINK>) of <I>negative</I> effects on carer anxiety, and this was evident to an extent in the analyses combining data from several studies of joint reminiscence work, where there was slightly higher carer anxiety (a difference of uncertain clinical importance) at the seven months' follow-up assessment. One qualitative study explored potential factors in increased anxiety among carers taking part in joint reminiscence groups (<LINK REF="REF-Melunsky-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Melunsky 2015</LINK>). It identified issues such as the carer feeling disappointed when improvements in the group setting were not evident at home; the carer seeing people with more advanced dementia, resulting in increased fears for what the future might hold; and increased guilt from not being able to put into practice skills learned in the groups. These negative aspects were in the context of many positive experiences that carers reported from participation in the groups for themselves and the person with dementia.<BR/></P></SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS><APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2018-01-31 21:36:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson"><P>Although there is now a sufficient body of evidence to enable us to draw conclusions regarding reminiscence work in general, it remains difficult to consider fully different types of reminiscence work. For example, studies of individual reminiscence work have tended to be small-scale and carried out in care homes, so we could not be certain of any difference in outcomes between individual and group approaches. Related to this, we were unable to draw a distinction in our analyses between simple and integrative reminiscence work. Although some studies have followed a very clear, published treatment protocol, reporting of details of interventions in other studies has been less complete, with even the distinction between individual and group reminiscence not always immediately apparent.</P><P>Little evidence has emerged regarding the characteristics of people with dementia that might be associated with better outcomes, with the exception of the suggestion that reminiscence has a stronger effect on QoL in a care home context, as opposed to community settings. There clearly are differences between studies in the extent (and direction of changes) demonstrated by the high levels of heterogeneity evident in several analyses. However, many of these differences are yet to be explained. Some studies included only people with AD; others only recruited people with VD; others included any form of dementia. No clear differences in outcomes related to dementia type emerged from the analyses undertaken, and similarly there were few indications of the effects of dementia severity.</P><P>It is unlikely that there is a simple 'dose' related effect, in that the studies offering the greatest exposure to reminiscence activities were among those with the least positive findings (<LINK REF="STD-Amieva-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Amieva 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Charlesworth-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Charlesworth 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Woods-2012a" TYPE="STUDY">Woods 2012a</LINK>). However, within studies a 'dose' effect may have operated. It is clear that in community settings, a significant proportion of people randomised to receive a reminiscence intervention did not engage with the groups. For example, in <LINK REF="STD-Woods-2012a" TYPE="STUDY">Woods 2012a</LINK>, 11% of participants did not attend a single reminiscence session, with over 25% attending three sessions or fewer. An even larger proportion of participants in the <LINK REF="STD-Charlesworth-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Charlesworth 2016</LINK> study (43%) did not attend any reminiscence sessions. In line with our protocol, we included the ITT results in our analyses in this review. While it is important to know that these groups may not, for a variety of reasons, be taken up by all people with dementia and their carers, their results must underestimate any actual direct effects of reminiscence. For example, in a compliance analysis, <LINK REF="STD-Woods-2012a" TYPE="STUDY">Woods 2012a</LINK> showed an improvement in cognitive function (AMI-E PSS) at the end of treatment and improved QoL (European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions; EQ-5D) and quality of relationship (QCPR) at longer-term follow-up, but accompanied by an increase in carer stress (RSS). In contrast, <LINK REF="STD-Charlesworth-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Charlesworth 2016</LINK> reported no relationship between attendance and outcomes.</P></APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS><QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2018-01-31 17:39:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson"><P>There has been an overall significant improvement in the quality of included studies since the previous version of this review was undertaken. We are now able to include large-scale studies, overseen by accredited clinical trials units, with quality assurance procedures and well-developed remote randomisation procedures.</P><P>However, more generally, under-reporting of details of trials meant that a number of authors had to be contacted for additional information regarding, for example, randomisation and allocation, and several studies were excluded because of their risk of bias.</P><P>Some risks of bias arise from the nature of psychosocial interventions such as RT. Participants and carers will be aware of the intervention being received, and, in general single-blinding is the aim, with assessors being blind to treatment allocation. However, ratings completed by, for example, staff in care homes, may not be blinded, and the blinding of assessors may be compromised by participants and carers providing indications a treatment intervention has been received. Studies such as <LINK REF="STD-Woods-2012a" TYPE="STUDY">Woods 2012a</LINK> asked assessors to indicate which group the participant was in, and their degree of certainty of their judgement so that the extent of bias could be estimated. Expectations of benefit from participation or resentment at not being allocated to the active treatment may occur, and may produce some additional bias. Treatment expectations may be seen in the context of a pragmatic trial as part of the overall 'treatment package,' of course.</P></QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE><POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2018-01-31 21:36:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson"><P>Our search strategy was as comprehensive as possible, and we consulted with experts in the field to identify any further studies. Two review authors (LOP and EF) independently conducted selection of studies, data extraction and risk of bias assessments, and disagreements resolved by contacting authors and consultation with other members of the review author team. The present review included all outcomes detailed in the protocol, irrespective of whether or not the results identified improvements. It must be acknowledged that the included studies could represent a biased sample of the studies undertaken worldwide on RT. It may be the case that trials that are not 'successful' (i.e. do not produce the expected positive findings) are less likely to be published. This may be especially the case with smaller trials. The welcome trend to preregistration of trials, and the publication of trial protocols, makes this less likely to occur in the future in relation to larger, well-funded trials. The meta-analyses here have been influenced strongly by larger trials, several of which did not report any positive findings (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Charlesworth-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Charlesworth 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Woods-2012a" TYPE="STUDY">Woods 2012a</LINK>), but these were both of a group approach, in community settings. Our care home and individual reminiscence findings could perhaps have been more influenced by publication bias. A funnel plot of cognition at the end of treatment showed some asymmetry (<LINK REF="FIG-08" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 8</LINK>), but this was largely driven by smaller/lower quality community studies having positive findings, with care home studies showing a symmetrical pattern. For most of our outcomes, there are too few included studies for meaningful funnel plots to be plotted.</P></POTENTIAL_BIASES><AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2018-02-12 18:29:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We identified five reviews that overlap with this one.</P><P><LINK REF="REF-Cotelli-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cotelli 2012</LINK> included seven RCTs, with 218 participants, three of which were included in the current review. They identified some benefits for mood and cognitive function but pointed out that the number of trials 'remains very small and their quality is often poor' (two were excluded from this review on the basis of risk of bias). This review appeared to have predated the recent improvement in quality and size of trials.</P><P><LINK REF="REF-Subramaniam-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Subramaniam 2012</LINK> focused on individual reminiscence work, identifying five RCTs, three of which were included in the current review. They concluded that there was a consistent pattern emerging, with those studies offering 'individual reminiscence work that includes a life review process, uses specific memory triggers and results in the production of a life story book' having positive psychosocial outcomes for people with dementia. In contrast, where reminiscence was more general, evidence for efficacy was not apparent. Unfortunately, there are still insufficient studies of integrative reminiscence work to confirm this early conclusion.</P><P><LINK REF="REF-Kwon-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kwon 2013</LINK> reported a meta-analysis including 10 studies. The studies included are not referenced, so comparisons were difficult. They conclude that reminiscence had a positive effect on cognition, depression and QoL, all with large effect sizes, but not on problem behaviour.</P><P><LINK REF="REF-Testad-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Testad 2014</LINK> reported a broader review relating to people with dementia in care homes, with RT included as one of several psychosocial interventions. They included six studies involving RT, most of which did not meet the inclusion criteria for the current review (e.g. three were not RCTs). The authors concluded that reminiscence was associated with improved mood, but there was no consistent evidence regarding other outcomes.</P><P><LINK REF="REF-Huang-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huang 2015</LINK> included 12 studies, with 1325 participants. Cognition and depressed mood were the main outcomes studied, with nine studies contributing to meta-analyses in each case. As with the current review, they identified a small effect size for cognition (SMD 0.18, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.30) but unlike the current review, there was a moderate-sized effect for depressed mood (SMD -0.48, 95% CI -0.70 to -0.28). There was evidence that the effect on mood was greater in care home settings than in the community, which is in accordance with our results. Notably the community studies included in the <LINK REF="REF-Huang-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huang 2015</LINK> review were all included in this review, but there were differences in the care home studies included, partly due to different exclusion criteria, but also because they were able to include studies published in Chinese. In general, the current review has adopted stricter quality standards than other reviews, and identified considerably more studies for inclusion, across different modalities and settings.</P></AGREEMENT></DISCUSSION><CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2018-02-12 18:32:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2018-02-12 15:47:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Whilst this updated review has shown that reminiscence therapy (RT) can improve outcomes for people with dementia, its effects are inconsistent, often small in size and can differ considerably across settings and modalities. The outcomes for which some benefit has been identified are cognitive function, communication/interaction, quality of life (QoL) and mood. However, the effects are not consistent across different types of reminiscence work (group or individual, with or without family carer involvement), or across different contexts (care home or community), particularly where QoL is the outcome. The evidence relating to QoL is most promising in care homes; that relating to mood is most promising for individual RT.</P><P>RT can now be viewed alongside cognitive stimulation as an ecopsychosocial intervention with a credible evidence-base. Individual and group approaches have some support, although the two large, well-conducted UK studies of joint reminiscence group work involving family members alongside people with dementia have been the studies showing the smallest effects. Individual work has the potential benefit of resulting in some form of life story book, which provides a platform to enhance person-centred care. However, to date it has not proven clearly superior to group work, which may have added value in terms of enhancing interaction and communication.</P><P>The lack of participation in the two UK studies of joint reminiscence work suggests that consideration should be given to offering it as one of a number of approaches, as participation does not appear to be valued by a significant number of people with dementia and carers. Where it is offered, benefits beyond the 'in the moment' enjoyment of a shared social group experience, should not be anticipated as general outcomes.</P><P>The diversity of approaches to reminiscence seen in the various studies suggests that there is a need for manuals and training to be developed so that approaches can be more readily shared, and common approaches developed, for both individual and group work. It is essential that the different functions of reminiscence and the different types of reminiscence work are recognised, to aid sharing of good practice and understanding of the training, support and resources needed for implementation.</P></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2018-02-12 18:32:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The research agenda in relation to reminiscence work now needs to address some of the discrepancies and uncertainties highlighted by this review, and more fully reflect and identify the differences in function and types of reminiscence work. A large scale randomised controlled trial (RCT) of individual, integrative reminiscence work, producing a conventional or digital life story book, would demonstrate whether the promising results from small studies could be replicated on a larger platform, with greater attention to the detail of randomisation and allocation concealment. Such a study should include enough people living with dementia in care home and community settings, and with a range of severities of impairment, so that more fine-grained conclusions may be drawn. Research is also needed on the extent to which reminiscence work can drive person-centred care, so that the person's biography becomes a rich resource for planning and action.</P><P>There has been increasing interest in digital reminiscence work (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Subramaniam-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Subramaniam 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Subramaniam-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Subramaniam 2016</LINK>), but to date there have been no studies meeting the criteria for inclusion in the current review. This is clearly an area where more research is justified, in developing the intervention and then delineating its effects.</P><P>The research to date has emphasised changes beyond the group, on measures carried out before and after a set number of reminiscence sessions. More emphasis on the experience of people with dementia (and carers) within the reminiscence session may be helpful. Is each session an enjoyable experience in itself, even if the lasting benefits are more elusive? <LINK REF="STD-Brooker-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Brooker 2000</LINK> used an observational method, Dementia Care Mapping, to demonstrate that people with dementia showed greater well-being when participating in simple reminiscence groups than when undertaking other activities, and it would be helpful to take this 'in the moment' evaluation approach further.</P><P>Finally, in view of the significant number of people not taking up reminiscence interventions, research would be helpful delineating who does take it up and why, and what type of approach is beneficial for which people, so there can be better tailoring of interventions to individuals.</P></IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH></CONCLUSIONS></BODY><ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS MODIFIED="2018-01-30 18:20:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson"><P>The authors wish to thank Sue Marcus, Jenny McCleery and Anna Noel-Storr of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group for their invaluable assistance.
