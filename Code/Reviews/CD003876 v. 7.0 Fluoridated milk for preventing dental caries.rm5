<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We compared the evidence on the effects of fluoridated milk versus non-fluoridated milk for the prevention of tooth decay.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Tooth decay remains a major public health problem in most industrialised countries, affecting 60% to 90% of schoolchildren and the vast majority of adults. It is the primary cause of oral pain and tooth loss. The prevalence of tooth decay varies both between and within different countries, but generally, people in lower socioeconomic groups (measured by income, education and employment) are more affected.</P>
<P>Fluoride is a mineral that prevents tooth decay and can be added to drinking water, salt or milk as a public health measure to promote oral health. Fluoridated milk is often available to children alongside non-fluoridated milk through school milk schemes or national nutritional programmes. The use of such distribution systems can provide a convenient and cost-efficient means of targeted fluoride supplementation for children whose parents wish to participate in the programme.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>Authors from the Cochrane Oral Health Group reviewed existing studies to find all available evidence up to November 2014. We searched scientific databases for clinical trials testing the effects of fluoridated milk compared with non-fluoridated milk. Treatment had to be used and monitored for a minimum of two years.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>We found one unpublished study that included 180 three-year olds who were given either fluoridated or non-fluoridated milk at nursery schools in an area with high prevalence of dental cavities and a low level of fluoride in drinking water. After three years, 92% of the children were available for analysis. The evidence suggests fluoridated milk may be beneficial to schoolchildren, substantially reducing the formation of cavities in baby teeth. There was no information available about any possible adverse events.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence was considered to be low quality due to the lack of relevant studies, the risk of bias in the identified study and concerns over the applicability of the results to different settings and populations. Additional studies of high quality are needed before we can draw definitive conclusions about the benefits of milk fluoridation.</P>

<P>We included one unpublished RCT, randomising 180 children aged three years at study commencement. The setting was nursery schools in an area with high prevalence of dental caries and a low level of fluoride in drinking water. Data from 166 participants were available for analysis. The study carried a high risk of bias. After three years, there was a reduction of caries in permanent teeth (mean difference (MD) &#8722;0.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) &#8722;0.24 to &#8722;0.02) and in primary teeth (MD &#8722;1.14, 95% CI &#8722;1.86 to &#8722;0.42), as measured by the decayed, missing and filled teeth index (DMFT for permanent teeth and dmft for primary teeth). For primary teeth, this is a substantial reduction, equivalent to a prevented fraction of 31%. For permanent teeth, the disease level was very low in the study, resulting in a small absolute effect size. The included study did not report any other outcomes of interest for this review (adverse events, dental pain, antibiotic use or requirement for general anaesthesia due to dental procedures).</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-08-27 13:28:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is low quality evidence to suggest fluoridated milk may be beneficial to schoolchildren, contributing to a substantial reduction in dental caries in primary teeth. Due to the low quality of the evidence, further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. There was only one relatively small study, which had important methodological limitations on the data for the effectiveness in reducing caries. Furthermore, there was no information about the potential harms of the intervention. Additional RCTs of high quality are needed before we can draw definitive conclusions about the benefits of milk fluoridation.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-08-31 11:14:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-08-31 11:12:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Dental caries is a disease of the hard tissues of the teeth. Over time, it forms through a complex interaction between acid-producing bacteria, fermentable carbohydrates, and numerous host factors related to teeth and saliva. It is the primary cause of oral pain and tooth loss. In its early stages, it can be arrested and potentially reversed, but without proper care, it can progress until the tooth is destroyed, causing severe pain and suffering, especially in children (<LINK REF="REF-Selwitz-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Selwitz 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>According to the World Oral Health Report 2003, dental caries remains a major public health problem in most industrialised countries, affecting 60% to 90% of schoolchildren and the vast majority of adults (<LINK REF="REF-Petersen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petersen 2003</LINK>). It is also the most prevalent oral disease in several Asian and Latin American countries. Although for the moment it appears to be less common and less severe in most of Africa, the report anticipates that changing living conditions and dietary habits (particularly growing sugar consumption and low exposure to fluorides) will contribute to increasing the incidence of dental caries in many African countries.</P>
<P>There are profound inequalities in caries status both between and within countries, and the distribution of disease within communities fluctuates (<LINK REF="REF-Pitts-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pitts 2011</LINK>). However, a recent systematic review showed that low socioeconomic position is associated with a higher risk of having caries lesions or caries experience; this association might be stronger in developed countries (<LINK REF="REF-Schwendicke-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwendicke 2015</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-08-19 09:47:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The use of milk as a vehicle for providing additional fluoride in a dental public health programme is attractive for several reasons. First of all, milk is already an important part of children's diets and has long been used as a nutritional supplement for vulnerable groups. As early as 1980, a randomised controlled trial (RCT) showed a small but statistically significant benefit to growth in deprived children following the provision of free school milk over two years (<LINK REF="REF-Baker-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baker 1980</LINK>), and the NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination included the provision of free school milk in a list of nine evidence-based interventions to reduce health inequalities (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1997</LINK>). Another RCT confirmed that increased milk consumption significantly enhanced bone mineral acquisition and attainment of peak bone mass in adolescent girls (<LINK REF="REF-Cadogan-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cadogan 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Moreover, fluoridated milk can be produced in a variety of liquid forms (pasteurised, ultra-high temperature pasteurised (UHT) and sterilised) and in powder, each containing different fluoridating compounds. Compounds used to fluoridate milk in early clinical trials and laboratory tests included sodium fluoride, calcium fluoride, disodium monofluorophosphate (MFP) and disodium silicofluoride. However, the vast majority of current fluoridated milk schemes worldwide use sodium fluoride. The exception is the caries prevention programme in rural areas of Chile, where the powdered milk and milk derivatives provided to the participating subjects are fluoridated using MFP (<LINK REF="REF-Villa-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Villa 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>The choice of fluoridation method depends on many factors, including the nature of food supplement programme itself and the availability of human resources and training. Likewise, the concentration of fluoride required will depend on the age of the children, the concentration of fluoride in the local water supply and the volume of fluoridated milk ingested daily, among other considerations (<LINK REF="REF-Mari_x00f1_o-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mariño 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>The feasibility and sustainability of a milk fluoridation scheme depends largely on the existence and type of nutritional supplement programmes. Because any kind of milk can be fluoridated, any system that provides a regular supply of milk to children could potentially provide a vehicle for fluoride delivery. Clearly, an existing milk distribution scheme or national nutrition strategy would simplify the implementation of a milk fluoridation programme (<LINK REF="REF-Mari_x00f1_o-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mariño 2011</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-08-19 09:46:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Elevating the concentration of the fluoride ion at the plaque-enamel interface results in a reduction in the rate of demineralisation, an increase in the rate of remineralisation, and a reduction in the rate of acid production in plaque, all of which help to prevent caries.</P>
<P>The use of milk as a vehicle for fluoride delivery has raised questions concerning possible chemical reactions between milk and fluoride ions, the bioavailability of systematically administered fluoride in milk, and potential interactions involving fluoride in the oral cavity (enamel, saliva, plaque and caries). The results of basic studies on milk fluoridation have been published in more than 100 peer-reviewed papers, with increasing frequency in the past 20 years. Based on these studies, it appears that most of the fluoride added to milk forms a soluble complex with the protein fraction of milk, from which the fluoride can be liberated in ionic (and bioavailable) form. The absorption of fluorides with simultaneous food intake is slower than for fluoride without food, and the proportion absorbed depends on the calcium content of the diet. Different types of milk are consumed around the world: whole or low-fat; fresh, pasteurised or sterilised; liquid or powdered. The bioavailability of added fluoride has been shown to be satisfactory in all of these, both on the day of milk processing and after several days&#8217; storage (<LINK REF="REF-B_x00e1_n_x00f3_czy-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bánóczy 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>The fluoride ions available from the consumption of fluoridated milk are incorporated into dental enamel, which inhibits demineralisation and promotes remineralisation. In addition, 30 to 60 minutes after ingestion of fluoridated milk, the levels of fluoride in both whole saliva and dental plaque increase as a consequence of the presence of fluoridated milk in the mouth and increased concentrations of fluoride in salivary secretions following the absorption of ingested fluoride. Thus, fluoride in milk acts both systematically and topically, in the same way as fluoride in water (<LINK REF="REF-B_x00e1_n_x00f3_czy-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bánóczy 2013</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-08-31 11:14:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Milk fluoridation, as a possible dental caries prevention medium, was first proposed by a Swiss paediatrician in the 1950s (<LINK REF="REF-Ziegler-1953" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ziegler 1953</LINK>). Since then, the caries-inhibiting characteristics of fluoridated milk have been investigated with a view to using it in community-based caries prevention programmes (<LINK REF="REF-B_x00e1_n_x00f3_czy-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bánóczy 2009</LINK>). Economic evaluations have demonstrated that milk provides a relatively cost-effective vehicle for fluoride in the prevention of dental caries (<LINK REF="REF-Calvert-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Calvert 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mari_x00f1_o-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mariño 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mari_x00f1_o-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mariño 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>This is an update of the Cochrane review first published in 2005 (<LINK REF="REF-Yeung-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yeung 2005</LINK>). The original review found that there were insufficient studies with good quality evidence examining the effects (benefits and harms) of fluoridated milk in preventing dental caries. The included studies, however, suggested that fluoridated milk was beneficial to schoolchildren, especially for their permanent dentition.</P>

<P>Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias of the included trial as part of the data extraction process.</P>
<P>We used the Cochrane Collaboration 'Risk of bias' assessment tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) available in Review Manager (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan</LINK>). The domains we assessed included:</P>

<LI>blinding of outcomes assessment;</LI>
<LI>incomplete outcome data;</LI>
<LI>selective outcome reporting;</LI>
<LI>other bias.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The review authors judged the risk of bias for each domain as 'high', 'low' or 'unclear' based on the criteria listed in Section 8.5 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I>, which focuses on the importance of the risk (i.e. whether the presence of the risk could have an important impact the result or the conclusion of the trial) rather than its mere presence (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>If insufficient detail was reported on what happened in the study, the risk of bias would be &#8216;unclear' unless authors had other reasons to judge it as 'high' or 'low'. An &#8216;unclear&#8217; judgement was also made if what happened in the study was adequately described, but the risk of bias was unknown or difficult to judge.</P>
</QUALITY_ASSESSMENT>
<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2015-08-19 09:46:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Prevented fraction (PF) was the measure of treatment effect presented for caries increment. PF was calculated as the mean increment in the control group minus the mean increment in the intervention group, divided by the mean increment in the control group. For an outcome such as caries increment (where discrete counts are considered to approximate to a continuous scale and are treated as continuous outcomes), this measure was considered more appropriate than the mean difference or standardised mean difference since it allowed a combination of different ways of measuring caries increment and a meaningful investigation of heterogeneity between trials. It is also simple to interpret.</P>
<P>For dichotomous outcomes (where the outcome of interest was either present or absent), we planned to express the estimate of treatment effect of an intervention as risk ratios (RRs) together with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) or as hazard ratios if these were available as time-to-event data. Where appropriate, we also planned to present the corresponding absolute reductions with risks, either as numbers needed to treat or absolute risk reduction per 1000 people. For continuous outcomes, we planned to report mean differences (MDs) and standard deviations, except for outcomes which had used difference scales, in which case we would have pooled them using the standardised mean difference.</P>

<P>We planned to assess clinical heterogeneity by examining the type of participants, interventions and outcomes in each study.</P>
<P>Had we found more than one study, we would have assessed statistical heterogeneity by inspecting the point estimates and CIs on the forest plots.

We considered heterogeneity to be statistically significant if the P value was less than 0.1.</P>
<P>A rough guide to interpreting the values obtained from the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic, provided in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>), is as follows:</P>

<P>The importance of the observed value of the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic depends on (i) the magnitude and direction of effects and (ii) the strength of evidence for heterogeneity (e.g. P value from the Chi<SUP>2 </SUP>test, or a CI for the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic).</P>

We would have examined possible causes of any asymmetry identified or assessed it using a table to list the outcomes reported by each included study, to determine whether any studies did not report outcomes that had been reported by most studies.</P>
<P>We assessed within-study reporting bias by comparing the outcomes presented in the published report against the original study protocol, whenever this could be obtained. If no protocol was available, we compared outcomes listed in the methods section against the results reported. If the study mentioned but did not adequately report non-significant results, we considered it possible that bias in a meta-analysis could occur, and we would have sought further information from the study authors. Otherwise, we would simply have noted a 'high' risk of bias. If there was insufficient information to judge the risk of bias, this was rated as 'unclear'.</P>

Trial investigators noted that "the investigators did not participate in the selection process. The district for the project was determined by the Volgograd Administration. The kindergartens [i.e. nursery schools] were selected by the District Administration. The children were recruited by the kindergarten teachers." The author also used stratification during randomisation of these children, who regularly attended the nursery school, were aged three years, were caries free, lived in one city district, and had parents who had given written consent. However, the generation of the randomisation sequence was still unclear. It was also unclear if the sequence had been concealed prior to the randomisation or recruitment of children to investigators or teachers (who were involved in recruitment).

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-08-19 09:46:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We confined this review to studies which were designed as RCTs. The only study we found was conducted in young children (<LINK REF="STD-Maslak-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Maslak 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The included study (<LINK REF="STD-Maslak-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Maslak 2004</LINK>) has a high risk of bias, and its external validity should be viewed with caution. The preventive programme, however, was appropriate, as caries prevalence was high and fluoride in drinking water was low. The applicability of the findings of this study in other settings, where the baseline level of caries and exposure to fluoride through other sources (such as drinking water and toothpaste) may differ, needs to be considered on a case-by-case basis.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-08-25 14:54:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The quality of evidence for the main outcomes was low. Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.</P>
<P>Factors that affected our confidence in effect sizes of the analysis included limitations in the study design (high risk from selection and attrition bias) and other issues in data analysis, such as not taking into account clustering effects. Although randomisation was carried out on an individual basis, analyses of programmes targeted through schools may need to take account of clustering, as children within a school may influence each other and therefore cannot be regarded as completely independent (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>). Failing to adjust for unit of analysis could lead to spurious positive findings (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Intention-to-treat analysis is favoured in assessment of clinical effectiveness, as it mirrors the non-compliance and treatment changes that are likely to occur when the intervention is used in practice, reducing the possibility of overestimating effectiveness due to attrition bias (when participants are excluded from the analysis) (<LINK REF="REF-Hollis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hollis 1999</LINK>). The author of the included study reported in personal communication that intention-to-treat analysis had been carried out (<LINK REF="STD-Maslak-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Maslak 2004</LINK>). However, this information could not be substantiated from the abstract.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-08-31 11:25:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Without a full publication of the study, it is not always possible to comprehensively assess the risk of bias in the reviews or ensure that all relevant information has been obtained. We also excluded a study that was quasi-randomised (<LINK REF="STD-Stephen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Stephen 1984</LINK>), as this type of study design carries a high risk of selection bias.</P>
<P>Most analyses planned in the protocol, such as meta-analysis, subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis, and assessment for publication bias, could not be conducted in this review because of the lack of RCTs published on fluoridated milk.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-08-31 11:40:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Studies on the clinical effectiveness of fluoridated milk in caries prevention have been carried out in several countries using different research methods. These studies also varied with regard to the delivery of fluoridated milk, in particular, the concentration of fluoride. Reductions in caries incidence have varied from no effect (<LINK REF="STD-Ketley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ketley 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stephen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Stephen 1984</LINK>) to 70% (<LINK REF="STD-Pakhomov-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Pakhomov 1993</LINK>) in the primary dentition, and from no effect (<LINK REF="STD-Ketley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ketley 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lopes-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Lopes 1984</LINK>) to 97% (<LINK REF="STD-Pakhomov-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Pakhomov 1993</LINK>) in the permanent dentition. The lack of effect shown in <LINK REF="STD-Ketley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ketley 2003</LINK> may be due to the lack of statistical power. On the other hand, the duration of intervention in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Lopes-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Lopes 1984</LINK> may be too short (16 months) to evaluate the effectiveness of fluoridated milk as a caries prevention method.</P>
<P>The findings of this updated Cochrane review do not differ from those of the original review, which was first published in 2005 (<LINK REF="REF-Yeung-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yeung 2005</LINK>). Other systematic reviews also concluded that there is a low level of quality evidence that milk fluoridation is beneficial in preventing dental caries (<LINK REF="REF-Cagetti-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cagetti 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-National-Health-and-Medical-Research-Council-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">National Health and Medical Research Council 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Cagetti-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cagetti 2013</LINK> carried out a systematic review on the caries-prevention effect of fluoridated food. Two studies on fluoridated milk (<LINK REF="STD-Bian-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bian 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stecks_x00e9_n_x002d_Blicks-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Stecksén-Blicks 2009</LINK>) fulfilled their inclusion criteria. However, as the study period for both was only 21 months, they were excluded from our review.</P>
<P>The systematic review by <LINK REF="REF-National-Health-and-Medical-Research-Council-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">National Health and Medical Research Council 2007</LINK> identified one systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Yeung-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yeung 2005</LINK>), no additional RCTs, no relevant cohort studies or case-control studies. Two cross-sectional studies (<LINK REF="REF-Mari_x00f1_o-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mariño 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Riley-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Riley 2005</LINK>) met the inclusion criteria. These two studies assessed two different populations (one exposed to fluoridated milk and one not exposed to fluoridated milk) and were measured at multiple time points. As neither study was an RCT, both were excluded from the Cochrane review.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-08-19 09:46:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There was only one small RCT examining the effects of fluoridated milk in preventing dental caries, and it had serious methodological limitations. The included study suggested that fluoridated milk may be beneficial to schoolchildren in reducing the level of caries, with a substantial effect size for primary teeth. However, there was no information about the potential harms. Moreover, the study was conducted in a setting where the baseline level of caries was high and the level of fluoride in drinking water was low. Therefore, the potential to replicate the benefits observed in this study in other settings should be considered on a case-by-case basis. The data need to be supplemented by further RCTs to provide a high level of evidence for practice.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-08-31 10:58:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further trials should be well-designed RCTs (adequate sequence generation and allocation concealment methods, blinding of participants and outcome assessors) and reported according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement (<A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org">www.consort-statement.org</A>). In particular, appropriate control groups should be used, and trials should be designed with adequate power in view of a potential high drop-out rate (&gt; 40%) with a follow-up period of at least two years. If a cluster-randomised trial design is used, these should be taken into account in the analysis and reporting. An intention-to-treat analysis (analysing patients according to the group randomised), which is more conservative in its effect size estimation, is probably more useful in reflecting the effectiveness of the intervention. We do acknowledge that such trials will be expensive and difficult to conduct, but they are the only ones able to provide a reliable answer on the relative benefits and harms of the intervention.</P>
<P>Following an international consensus workshop on caries clinical trials, <LINK REF="REF-Pitts-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pitts 2004</LINK> proposed that in new caries trials, the efficacy variables should include a measure of further demineralisation or stimulation of remineralisation in lesions. Despite this consensus statement, however, we are unaware of any other published core outcomes on the assessment of caries and impact of caries. If available (e.g. through the COMET initiative (<A HREF="http://www.comet-initiative.org">www.comet-initiative.org</A>)), these should be used.</P>
<P>The main desirable features for a future trial are summarised below using the EPICOT structure (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Evidence: </B>There is a lack of evidence (low quality, low number of participants and studies) assessing the effectiveness and safety of fluoridated milk in the prevention of dental caries.</P>
<P>
<B>Population: </B>Any age group. It will be important to stratify or report key modifiers of effects observed, including baseline caries level and fluoride exposure.</P>
<P>
<B>Intervention:</B> Fluoridated milk.</P>
<P>
<B>Comparison: </B>Non-fluoridated milk or placebo.</P>
<P>
<B>Outcomes: </B>Change in caries experience (measured by DMFT and dmft), adverse effects (especially dental fluorosis). Other measures of impact of caries include dental pain, antibiotics use for dental infections and use of general anaesthesia for dental treatment.</P>
<P>
<B>Time:</B> Treatment and follow-up should be at least two years.</P>
<P>In order to draw firm conclusions on the effectiveness of fluoridated milk, additional studies should explore other variables such as fluoride dose, number of days per year, background caries experience, time of consumption and method of drinking fluoridated milk (<LINK REF="REF-B_x00e1_n_x00f3_czy-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bánóczy 2009</LINK>).</P>
