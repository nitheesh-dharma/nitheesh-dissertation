<TITLE>Chemotherapy alone versus endocrine therapy alone for metastatic breast cancer</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-05-16 16:34:15 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. If the cancer has spread beyond the breast (metastatic disease), treatments include chemotherapy (anti-cancer drugs) and endocrine therapy (also known as hormonal treatment). Endocrine therapy is mainly given to women whose cancer is determined to be hormone-responsive, that is, where hormone receptors (oestrogen or progesterone receptors) are expressed in the tumour cells. The aim of this review was to see if starting treatment with chemotherapy or starting treatment with endocrine therapy provides more benefit in terms of survival, response to treatment, toxicity from treatment and quality of life. Ten eligible studies were identified, eight of which provided information on response to treatment (in 817 patients) and six on overall survival (in 692 patients). Trials were generally old (published between 1963 and 1995) and small in size (median of 70 women, range 50 to 226 women in each trial) and were of modest quality. The types of chemotherapy used were reasonably conventional by today's standards; the endocrine therapies varied considerably.</P>
<P>This review found that while initial treatment with chemotherapy rather than endocrine therapy may be associated with a higher response rate, the two initial treatments had a similar effect on overall survival. No single group of patients who might benefit from or be harmed by one treatment over the other were identified, although there was little information to address this question. Six of the seven fully published trials commented on increased toxicity associated with chemotherapy including nausea, vomiting and alopecia. Three of the seven trials mentioned aspects of quality of life but their findings provided differing results. Only one trial formally measured quality of life (QOL), concluding that QOL was better with chemotherapy. Based on these trials, no conclusions can be made as to the QOL achieved with either treatment.</P>
<P>Accurate information about hormone receptor status is now routinely available for many women with metastatic breast cancer, and hormonal treatments have improved in their effectiveness in the last 10 years. In women with metastatic breast cancer where hormone receptors are present, a policy of treating first with endocrine therapy rather than chemotherapy appears to be better, on the basis of the trials and outcomes in this review, except in the presence of rapidly progressive disease.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-05-16 16:34:16 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>This review is an update of a previously published review in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (<I>The Cochrane Library </I>Issue 1, 2007). Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in women and the most common cause of cancer-death for women. In 2005, an estimated 500,000 women died of this disease worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>). The stage of breast cancer at the time of diagnosis is an important indicator of prognosis. Metastatic breast cancer is an incurable yet treatable disease and, as survival can be several years, it can be viewed as a chronic relapsing and remitting disease (<LINK REF="REF-Stockler-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stockler 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although there is no randomised evidence comparing chemotherapy with observation in women with metastatic breast cancer, it is widely accepted that women with metastatic disease should receive some form of systemic therapy at some time during the course of their disease. Chemotherapy is considered by many to be the appropriate first treatment option for women with multiple sites of recurrence or where visceral disease is not easily treated by local modalities. Chemotherapy is also considered to be useful in women whose cancer is either hormone refractory or is expected to be hormone resistant. Endocrine therapy is effective only where hormone receptors (oestrogen or progesterone receptors) are expressed in tumour cells (<LINK REF="REF-Hortobagyi-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hortobagyi 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>It has been shown that both chemotherapy and endocrine therapy improve survival in early breast cancer (<LINK REF="REF-EBCTCG-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">EBCTCG 2005</LINK>). It is unclear, however, whether one mode of treatment is more effective than the other, either as initial or subsequent treatment, in women with metastatic breast cancer. The popular view is that chemotherapy may be better than endocrine therapy in patients with predominantly visceral disease or with rapidly progressive disease. On the other hand, endocrine therapy may be better for predominantly bony disease (<LINK REF="REF-Hortobagyi-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hortobagyi 1998</LINK>). Both chemotherapy and endocrine therapy have been shown to produce tumour responses in women with metastatic breast cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Stockler-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stockler 1997a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stockler-1997b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stockler 1997b</LINK>) but uncertainty remains regarding the differential impact these treatments may have on outcomes such as overall survival and quality of life and, in particular, whether the (presumed) greater toxicity of chemotherapy is reflected in better treatment outcomes.</P>
<P>The aim of this review is to systematically identify and assess all of the available evidence from randomised trials that compared the effects of chemotherapy alone versus endocrine therapy alone on treatment-related outcomes for women with metastatic breast cancer. The treatment could be used either as first-line treatment or subsequent to initial chemotherapy or endocrine treatments.</P>

<P>Primary objective: to review the evidence and determine whether chemotherapy alone or endocrine therapy alone has the most beneficial effect on treatment outcomes (listed below) for women with metastatic breast cancer.</P>

<P>For the first full version of this review (Wilcken 2003), the Specialised Register maintained by the editorial base of the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group was searched (16 September 2002) using the codes for "advanced breast cancer", "chemotherapy" and "endocrine therapy". This search was repeated (31 August 2006) for this update. Furthermore, handsearches were done of the proceedings of the annual meetings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (2005 to 2006) and the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (2005). Details of the search strategy applied by the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group to create the register, and the procedure used to code references, are described in the Group's module in <I>The Cochrane Library</I>.</P>
<P>A further search was carried out in the Specialised Register (until 2008), MEDLINE (2008 to 24 September 2010) (<LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>), EMBASE (2008 to 30 September 2010) (<LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform search portal (23 July 2010) (<LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Study selection</HEADING>
<P>Study selection was undertaken independently by two of the authors (JH and NW), both of whom are content experts. The above selection criteria were applied to each trial, initially based on title. The subsequently agreed pool of potentially eligible trials were screened with the results section and any other area where the results appeared masked. For unpublished trials, available information from conference proceedings was screened.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Assessment of trial quality</HEADING>
<P>A quality score was applied to describe the adequacy of allocation concealment:<BR/>A. low risk of bias in the randomisation process (e.g. randomisation by telephone call to central office);<BR/>B. moderate risk of bias (e.g. sealed envelopes);<BR/>C. high risk of bias;<BR/>D. trials where there was insufficient information to score allocation concealment.</P>
<P>Quality assessment was repeated by the third author (DG).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Data extraction</HEADING>
<P>Initial data were extracted independently by two of the authors (JH and NW). This included baseline characteristics of the patients, the interventions being tested, tumour response rates, median survival, information about toxicity and quality of life and the proportion of patients with bone or visceral disease. Subsequent information about survival was independently extracted by one author (NW) and Elizabeth Weir. This involved extracting survival times at three-monthly intervals from the published survival curves in order to derive hazard ratios and confidence intervals (<LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Analysis</HEADING>
<P>The most complete dataset that was feasible was assembled and results of eligible studies were statistically synthesised in a meta-analysis. Response rates were analysed as dichotomous variables and a pooled relative risk was derived. A pooled weighted ratio of median survival was also derived (data not shown).</P>
<P>The hazard ratio (HR) is the most appropriate statistic for time-to-event outcomes. When possible, the HR was extracted directly from the trial publication(s). If not reported, it was obtained indirectly through the methods described by Parmar et al using either other available summary statistics or from data extracted from published Kaplan-Meier curves (<LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>). A pooled HR was obtained by combining the observed (O) minus the expected (E) number of events and the variance obtained for each trial using the fixed-effect model (<LINK REF="REF-Yusuf-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yusuf 1985</LINK>). A weighted average of survival duration across studies was then calculated. A fixed-effect model was used for the primary analyses (see the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>)). Chi<SUP>2</SUP> tests for heterogeneity were used to test for statistical heterogeneity between trials. There were insufficient numbers of trials that were of adequate size to justify the planned subgroup analyses. Quality of life and toxicity data were not formally analysed.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2011-05-15 14:11:33 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>When the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group was searched in September 2002, it contained 5380 references pertaining to clinical trials in breast cancer. A total of 1111 of these were coded as "advanced breast cancer", of which 71 were coded as "chemotherapy" and "endocrine therapy". Based on information in the abstracts it was possible to exclude 47 references that clearly did not relate to eligible trials (most did not compare chemotherapy with endocrine therapy and others were not metastatic breast cancer or were clearly not randomised trials). The full papers were retrieved for the remaining 24 references resulting in the exclusion of five further references (not metastatic breast cancer or did not compare chemotherapy with endocrine therapy). The 19 remaining references reported the results of 13 potentially eligible trials, of which three were excluded: one randomised by date of birth (<LINK REF="STD-Cole-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Cole 1973</LINK>), one was reported as a comparative study but its randomisation status could not be ascertained (<LINK REF="STD-Newsome-1963" TYPE="STUDY">Newsome 1963</LINK>), and more than 30% of patients who were randomised in the third study had locally advanced but not metastatic breast cancer (<LINK REF="STD-Villalon-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Villalon 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>At the time of the new search in August 2006, the Register contained 6081 references pertaining to clinical trials in breast cancer. Of these, 1789 were coded as "advanced breast cancer", of which 99 were coded as "chemotherapy" and "endocrine therapy". For the 2010 update, a repeat search was carried out in the Specialised Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform search portal but no extra eligible studies were identified.</P>
<P>Of the 10 eligible studies identified, eight provided information on response (817 patients) and six on overall survival (692 patients). The trials were generally old (published between 1963 and 1995) and small (median 70 participants, range 50 to 226 women). The chemotherapy regimens used were reasonably conventional, although taxanes were not included. Endocrine therapies were less conventional (see the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two studies included over 100 patients. One study (<LINK REF="STD-ANZBCTG-1986" TYPE="STUDY">ANZBCTG 1986</LINK>) randomised 226 postmenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer to doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) chemotherapy, to be followed on failure by tamoxifen (TAM); or TAM, followed on failure by AC (a third group were allocated the combination of AC plus TAM). Receptor status was mostly unknown and over 50% of the patients had visceral metastases. The other study (<LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1986</LINK>) randomised 181 women who were over the age of 65 years with metastatic breast cancer to cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and fluorouracil (CMF) or tamoxifen, with crossover planned following disease progression. The majority of the women were either hormone receptor positive or of unknown status and over 50% had visceral metastases.</P>

<P>It was not possible to accurately assess the quality of most studies (including the quality of the randomisation process) due to lack of information in the published articles. The quality of two trials were graded as A (<LINK REF="STD-Abe-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Abe 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1986</LINK>) with an additional two being graded as B (<LINK REF="STD-ANZBCTG-1986" TYPE="STUDY">ANZBCTG 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Priestman-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Priestman 1978</LINK>) (see table of <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). The remaining studies were all graded as D, including one study that has only been reported in abstract form (<LINK REF="STD-Rosner-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Rosner 1974</LINK>). Two potentially eligible studies were excluded from the review due to the inadequacy of the randomisation process: one allocated women to treatment based on date of birth (<LINK REF="STD-Cole-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Cole 1973</LINK>) and the other was described simply as a "comparative study" (<LINK REF="STD-Newsome-1963" TYPE="STUDY">Newsome 1963</LINK>).</P>

<P>Ratios of treatment effects are reported so that relative risks (RRs), hazard ratios (HRs) and odds ratios (ORs) less than 1.0 favour endocrine therapy and values greater than 1.0 favour chemotherapy.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Overall survival</HEADING>
<P>The primary analysis of overall effect using hazard ratios derived from published survival curves included six trials (692 women). There was no significant difference (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.12, P = 0.5). A test for heterogeneity gave P = 0.1 (discussed below).</P>
<P>In one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Priestman-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Priestman 1978</LINK>) it was not possible to ascertain the proportion of women who had definite metastatic disease. If this trial was excluded from the survival analysis the estimated HR changed (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.02, P = 0.08).</P>
<P>Other measures of survival were consistent with the above findings. There was no significant difference seen in survival at 12 months (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.43) or 24 months (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.25). A pooled, weighted average of median survival ratios involving seven trials (742 women) was similar (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.34).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Subset analyses</HEADING>
<P>There were insufficient data to justify any quantitative analysis of prospectively identified subsets. There were no obvious trends apparent to suggest an effect of age, menopausal status or pattern of metastatic disease on the efficacy of either treatment modality. The majority of women in these trials had tumours of unknown hormone receptor status. Results were similar whether treatment was first line or subsequent to other chemotherapy or endocrine therapy.</P>
<P>The commonly held view that endocrine therapy is less effective where there are visceral metastases was not supported by subset analyses carried out in the largest trial (<LINK REF="STD-ANZBCTG-1986" TYPE="STUDY">ANZBCTG 1986</LINK>) nor by the fact that over 50% of the women in all the trials (combined) had visceral disease. Post hoc analysis restricted to the higher quality studies suggested that a significant survival benefit in favour of chemotherapy is unlikely.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Tumour response rates</HEADING>
<P>A pooled estimate of reported response rates in eight trials involving 817 women showed a significant advantage for chemotherapy over endocrine therapy (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.54, P = 0.04). However, the point estimates for the two largest trials (<LINK REF="STD-ANZBCTG-1986" TYPE="STUDY">ANZBCTG 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1986</LINK>) were in opposite directions,and an overall test for heterogeneity gave P = 0.0009 (discussed below).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Toxicity and quality of life</HEADING>
<P>There was little information available from the included trials on toxicity and quality of life. Six of the seven fully published trials commented on increased toxicity (nausea, vomiting and alopecia) with chemotherapy. Three of the seven trials commented on aspects of quality of life. In one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Dixon-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Dixon 1992</LINK>) it was noted that an equal improvement in performance status (a measure of physical functioning) was seen with chemotherapy and endocrine therapy. In another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Clavel-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Clavel 1982</LINK>) quality of life was said to be better in the endocrine therapy arm. In a third trial (<LINK REF="STD-Priestman-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Priestman 1978</LINK>) quality of life was formally measured with linear analogue scales and was better with chemotherapy.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-05-15 14:45:09 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>With the increasing advent of more and more sophisticated and expensive cytotoxic drugs for the treatment of breast cancer, it is important not to lose sight of the benefits of endocrine therapy. In incurable, metastatic disease it is generally considered reasonable to begin treatment with endocrine therapy where the tumour is hormone receptor positive. However, the evidence base for this recommendation has been modest. Only one systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Stockler-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stockler 2000</LINK>) with two identified randomised trials had been carried out before the present review. There is also an accepted wisdom that women with visceral metastases tend to respond better to chemotherapy, and endocrine therapy may be avoided for such women.</P>
<P>The trials identified in our review are relatively small and of modest quality. However, the sum of the identifiable evidence is that in women with metastatic breast cancer a policy of treating first with endocrine therapy rather than chemotherapy (where hormone receptors are present) is associated with an inferior tumour response rate but similar overall survival, less toxicity and an uncertain effect on quality of life. The fact that many of the women treated in these trials did not have endocrine responsive tumours means that the survival data may be underestimating the effect of endocrine therapy. This strengthens the notion that there is no disadvantage in using endocrine therapy before chemotherapy.</P>
<P>This review did not identify any subset of patients who might preferentially benefit from (or be harmed by) one treatment modality over the other, but information on this question was very sparse. Indirect comparisons of phase two trials might be a better source of information in this instance. Meanwhile, it would seem prudent to introduce chemotherapy first where there is rapidly progressive disease.</P>
<P>Evidence of statistical heterogeneity among trials was identified for tumour response rate and might be present in the survival analysis as well. Funnel plots did not strongly suggest publication bias, and the reasons for the heterogeneity must remain speculative. It is possible that there were significant differences in the proportion of patients who were truly hormone receptor positive in the different trials. This would be expected to affect the relative effects of chemotherapy and endocrine therapy and may explain the heterogeneity.</P>
<P>How should the results of this review be seen in the light of treatments not available at the time these trials were performed? First, accurate information about hormone receptor status is now routinely available for many women with metastatic breast cancer. This should increase the ability to identify women for whom endocrine treatment would be an appropriate first choice. Second, endocrine therapy may now be more effective than in previous decades. Aromatase inhibitors as treatment for postmenopausal women are probably slightly more effective than tamoxifen, as well as being slightly less toxic (for a review see <LINK REF="REF-Henderson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson 2002</LINK>), while combined endocrine treatment for premenopausal women is superior to tamoxifen or ovarian suppression (<LINK REF="REF-Klijn-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klijn 2001</LINK>). Thus, this review may underestimate the effects of endocrine therapy on survival for women with hormone receptor disease. Conversely, new cytotoxic agents such as taxanes may also be more effective than some older chemotherapy agents (<LINK REF="REF-Ghersi-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ghersi 2005</LINK>). Certainly some new agents are less toxic. Supportive treatments such as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT3) antagonists are also more effective in alleviating chemotherapy side-effects. Thus, this review may be overestimating the toxicity of chemotherapy.</P>
<P>In summary, however, these considerations would not be predicted to alter our main conclusions following this review.</P>

<P>Further trials using modern endocrine and cytotoxic agents and quality of life endpoints are justified. However a pragmatic policy of initiating endocrine treatment and crossing over to cytotoxic treatment following failure is valid and may mitigate the need for further trials. This may be reflected in the fact that in the seven years since this review was first published (<LINK REF="REF-Wilcken-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilcken 2003</LINK>) we have not found any further, eligible trials.</P>
