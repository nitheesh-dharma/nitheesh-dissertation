<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-10-01 00:54:41 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
<BR/>Why is the effect of differing volumes of initial fluid administration on death and various neurological sequelae in people with acute bacterial meningitis important?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
<BR/>Bacterial meningitis is an infection of the fluid in the spinal cord and surrounding the brain. Antibiotics are prescribed as treatment. Supportive care includes other drugs and the regulation of fluid intake. There has been disagreement about whether fluids should be restricted or unrestricted as there are potential risks from giving too much fluid (brain swelling) as well as too little fluid (shock).</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
<BR/>The evidence is current to March 2016. We did not find any trials in adult populations and included three trials involving 420 children. All trials were set in countries where death rates for meningitis are high. In one study no funding source was mentioned. The remaining two studies were funded jointly by pharmaceutical concerns with government agencies and a charitable agency.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
<BR/>No studies reported important healthcare outcomes such as duration of hospital stay, raised intracranial pressure, or status epilepticus. An adverse effect in children with restricted fluid intake was that they were less likely to have low levels of sodium in their blood and therefore they would experience greater reductions in body fluids. An adverse effect of unrestricted fluid administration was reported in one study as short-term swelling of the face and low blood sodium levels one to two days after fluids were started, although the largest study found no difference in blood sodium levels.</P>
<P>The review found limited evidence from these trials in support of not restricting fluids in settings with high mortality rates. There is no evidence to guide clinicians about fluid therapy in adult patients with acute bacterial meningitis. There is a need for more research on these aspects in the future.<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
<BR/>Analysis of available trials found low quality evidence that there is no significant difference between maintenance versus restrictive fluid regimens for the outcome of death and acute severe neurological complications. There was also some evidence favouring maintenance fluid therapy over restricted fluids for chronic severe neurological events at three months follow-up, but the quality was very low.</P>

<P>Acute bacterial meningitis remains a disease with high mortality and morbidity rates. However, with prompt and adequate antimicrobial and supportive treatment, the chances for survival have improved, especially among infants and children. Careful management of fluid and electrolyte balance is an important supportive therapy. Both over- and under-hydration are associated with adverse outcomes. This is the latest update of a review first published in 2005 and updated in 2008 and 2014.</P>

<P>For this 2016 update we searched the following databases up to March 2016: the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Global Health, and Web of Science.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2010-12-02 12:38:40 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of differing volumes of fluid given in the initial management of bacterial meningitis were eligible for inclusion.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-09-19 08:59:14 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>All four of the original review authors extracted data and assessed trials for quality in the first publication of this review (one author, ROW, has passed away since the original review; see Acknowledgements). The current authors combined data for meta-analysis using risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous data or mean difference (MD) for continuous data. We used a fixed-effect statistical model. We assessed the overall quality of evidence using the GRADE approach.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-10-01 00:54:35 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included three trials with a total of 420 children; there were no trials in adult populations. The largest of the three trials was conducted in settings with high mortality rates and was judged to have low risk of bias for all domains, except performance bias which was high risk. The other two smaller trials were not of high quality.The meta-analysis found no significant difference between the maintenance-fluid and restricted-fluid groups in number of deaths (RR 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 1.27; 407 participants; low quality of evidence) or acute severe neurological sequelae (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.08; 407 participants; low quality of evidence). However, when neurological sequelae were defined further, there was a statistically significant difference in favour of the maintenance-fluid group for spasticity (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.93; 357 participants); and seizures at both 72 hours (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.83; 357 participants) and 14 days (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.88; 357 participants). There was very low quality of evidence favouring maintenance fluid over restrictive fluid for chronic severe neurological sequelae at three months follow-up (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.89; 351 participants).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-09-15 16:17:43 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>The quality of evidence regarding fluid therapy in children with acute bacterial meningitis is low to very low and more RCTs need to be conducted. There is insufficient evidence to guide practice as to whether maintenance fluids should be chosen over restricted fluids in the treatment of acute bacterial meningitis.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-09-15 16:32:43 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>Acute bacterial meningitis remains a disease with high mortality and morbidity rates. The outcome in individuals with bacterial meningitis is correlated with many factors, including the age of the person, time and clinical stability before effective antibiotic treatment is begun, type of micro-organism, number of bacteria or quantity of active bacterial products in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at the time of diagnosis, intensity of the host's inflammatory response, and time elapsed to sterilise CSF cultures (<LINK REF="REF-Feldman-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feldman 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mustafa-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mustafa 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saez_x002d_Llorens-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saez-Llorens 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Waage-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waage 1987</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-09-15 16:35:51 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>The highest rates of mortality and morbidity occur in the neonatal period and in the elderly. Nearly one in four adults with the illness will die, and many survivors sustain neurological deficits (<LINK REF="REF-Bohr-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bohr 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pfister-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pfister 1993</LINK>). Bacterial meningitis causes more than 100,000 deaths worldwide each year in infants and young children (<LINK REF="STD-Duke-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Duke 1998</LINK>). A 1993 meta-analysis examined the overall and organism-specific frequencies of death and persistent neurological sequelae in children two months to 19 years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Baraff-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baraff 1993</LINK>). A total of 4920 children with acute bacterial meningitis were included in 45 reports that met the inclusion criteria. Children described in the 19 reports of prospectively-enrolled cohorts from high-income countries had lower mortality than the children included in trials from low-income countries (4.8% versus 8.1%) and were more likely to have no sequelae (82.5% versus 73.9%). A further study that examined the long-term consequences of having meningitis during the first year of life found that 1.8% of children died within five years (<LINK REF="REF-Bedford-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bedford 2001</LINK>). Not only did almost a fifth of children with meningitis have a subsequent permanent, severe, or moderately severe disability, but subtle deficits were also more prevalent.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-09-15 16:42:08 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>The chances for survival are improved with prompt and adequate antimicrobial and supportive treatment, especially in infants and children, for whom case fatality rates have been reduced to less than 10% for bacterial meningitis and less than 5% for meningococcal meningitis (<LINK REF="REF-Saez_x002d_Llorens-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saez-Llorens 2003</LINK>). Two Cochrane Reviews examine the effectiveness and safety of steroids and different antibiotic regimens, respectively, which are used in the treatment of acute bacterial meningitis (<LINK REF="REF-Brouwer-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brouwer 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prasad-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prasad 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Careful management of fluid and electrolyte balance is also important in the treatment of meningitis. Over- or under-hydration are associated with adverse outcomes. Fluid restriction in the initial management of meningitis in children has been widely advocated (<LINK REF="REF-Conner-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conner 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Feigin-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feigin 1992</LINK>). However, this has also been challenged (<LINK REF="REF-Conner-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conner 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Powell-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singhi-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Singhi 1995</LINK>). The practice of fluid restriction is based on reports of hyponatraemia (lower than normal concentration of sodium in the extracellular fluid/blood) that is attributed to increased concentrations of circulating antidiuretic hormone (ADH; a hormone that prevents excretion of water from the body). Over 50% of children have hyponatraemia at the time of admission (<LINK REF="REF-Kaplan-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaplan 1983</LINK>). There are associations between the degree of hyponatraemia and the presence of seizures and severity of acute disease, and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Feigin-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feigin 1977</LINK>). These findings have subsequently been linked with a high incidence of cerebral oedema (swelling of the brain) in those who die from acute bacterial meningitis (<LINK REF="REF-Conner-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conner 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dodge-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dodge 1965</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-1964" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 1964</LINK>), and it has been suggested that inappropriately increased concentrations of ADH lead to water retention, which in turn exacerbates cerebral swelling. Some researchers have concluded that fluid restriction will avoid exacerbating cerebral oedema and may improve neurological outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Brown-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>However, clinical dehydration has also been found in children with acute bacterial meningitis without any accompanying significant risk of mortality (<LINK REF="STD-Duke-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Duke 1998</LINK>). It has also been found that in children who received maintenance fluid plus replacement of volume deficits, the high ADH concentrations normalised over 24 hours; in those who were restricted to two-thirds maintenance fluids, ADH concentrations remained high (<LINK REF="STD-Powell-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 1990</LINK>). The conclusion from this was that ADH concentrations are increased in children with meningitis because of hypovolaemia (a decrease in the volume of circulating blood) and only become normal when sufficient sodium and fluid are given.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-09-15 16:43:31 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>Although it is widely accepted that hyponatraemia is a marker of severe disease in childhood bacterial meningitis, there are different opinions regarding the cause of hyponatraemia at the time of presentation. If dehydration, rather than inappropriately increased antidiuresis, is the major factor in the pathogenesis of hyponatraemia in meningitis, then the rationale for fluid restriction is open to question.</P>

We attempted to contact authors of all identified trials, whether open or unpublished. We sought publications in the literature that described, or may have described, the use of fluid therapy for the treatment of acute bacterial meningitis. We applied no language or publication status restrictions. We searched the citation lists of relevant publications, review articles, and abstracts of scientific meetings, and included both published and unpublished studies.</P>

<STUDY_SELECTION MODIFIED="2016-09-19 08:57:40 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>For this 2016 update, two review authors (SB, IM) independently screened all the search results for consideration of inclusion as per eligibility criteria based on title, abstract, and key words initially, and then after accessing full-texts. Any disagreements were to be resolved by consensus, with the Review Group Editor acting as an arbiter. For previous versions of this review, two review authors (HB, IM) undertook study selection after running the search strategies outlined above. Both review authors had independently assessed whether the studies met the inclusion criteria; any discrepancies then were to be resolved by a third author (ROW, see <LINK TAG="ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS" TYPE="SECTION">Acknowledgements</LINK>) but this proved unnecessary.</P>
<P>We sought further information from the trial authors where papers contained insufficient information to make a decision about eligibility. We had to do this for two studies which we excluded based on these communications (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>).</P>
</STUDY_SELECTION>
<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2016-05-25 12:46:01 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz  Dooley">
<P>We collected information regarding location of the study, methods of the study (as per quality assessment checklist), participant characteristics (age range, eligibility criteria), types of interventions and outcomes for each included trial. Where possible, we sought missing data from the trial authors. Four review authors had previously (IM, HB, MS , ROW) independently performed data extraction. Any discrepancies were to be resolved by discussion but this proved unnecessary.</P>
</DATA_EXTRACTION>
<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2014-04-15 18:20:56 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>We assessed the risk of bias in the included studies using the criteria described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Two review authors independently extracted information about selection bias (random sequence generation and allocation concealment), detection bias (blinding of outcome assessment), attrition bias (incomplete outcome data), reporting bias (selective reporting), sample size, and exclusions after randomisation, and any other sources of bias .</P>
</QUALITY_ASSESSMENT>
<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2016-09-13 09:00:34 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>We analysed each dichotomous outcome for effect in terms of a risk ratio (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) and combined the outcomes for meta-analysis using Review Manager 5 software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). Where data were sufficient, we calculated a summary statistic for each outcome using a fixed-effect model. We analysed continuous outcomes as mean differences (MDs) between groups and 95% CIs. Where data were sufficient, we used a fixed-effect approach in the meta-analysis.</P>
<P>There were two kinds of effect estimates in our study. One, where only a single study contributed to the outcome, in which case a fixed-effect model was appropriate, and two, those pooled estimates where there was more than one study (two studies) and little evidence of heterogeneity was detected. Therefore, a fixed-effect model was used.</P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2014-04-15 18:29:16 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">

<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2016-09-15 17:31:23 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>Where there were missing participants due to dropout, we searched for the use of an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis by the trial authors and reported this in the review. Where there were missing statistics (such as, standard deviations or correlation coefficients) that made analysis impossible, we approached the trial authors. Where there remained missing data, we report this in the review.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">GRADE and 'Summary of findings' table</HEADING>
<P>For the 2014 update, two authors (SB, IM) used the GRADE approach to interpret the findings (<LINK REF="REF-Schunemann-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schunemann 2011</LINK>). We used the GRADE profiler software (<LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-GDT-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro GDT 2014</LINK>), and imported data from <LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK> to create <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> containing the following outcomes: death, and acute and chronic severe neurological sequelae. We used the five GRADE considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness, and publication bias) to assess the quality of a body of evidence as it relates to the studies which contribute data to the meta-analyses for the prespecified outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Atkins-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atkins 2004</LINK>). We used methods and recommendations described in Section 8.5 and Chapter 12 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> provides information about the overall quality of evidence from trials, the magnitude of effect of the interventions, as well as the sum of the available data for the primary outcomes. We justified all decisions to down- or upgrade the quality of studies using footnotes, and we made comments to aid the reader's understanding of the review where necessary.</P>

<P>For the 2014 update, with duplicates removed (including duplicates of the records sent in 2010) there were 496 search results. We removed animal studies (n = 49) and screened 447 search results (<LINK REF="REF-Maconochie-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maconochie 2014</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Volume and constitution of fluid</HEADING>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Duke-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Duke 2002</LINK> trial compared milk-based fluids delivered at 60% of that required for maintenance fluids with 100% of normal maintenance fluids. Maintenance fluids were defined as "100 ml/kg/day for the first 10 kg of body weight, 50 ml/kg for the second 10 kg, and 20 ml/kg for over 20 kg". The milk-based fluids comprised expressed breast milk or other milk feed given via a nasogastric tube for at least 48 hours, or longer with reduced conscious state, convulsions, impaired upper airway reflexes, or persistent respiratory distress. Normal maintenance fluids (defined as above) of a solution containing 0.45% sodium chloride and 5% dextrose plus 10 mmol/L of potassium chloride per litre were delivered intravenously for at least the first 48 hours.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Powell-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 1990</LINK> trial compared two-thirds of required maintenance fluids (similarly defined as "100 ml/kg for the first 10 kg of body weight, plus 50 ml/kg for the next 10 kg (10 kg to 20 kg), plus 20 ml/kg for each kilogram in excess of 20 kg") with full maintenance fluids, plus replacement fluids for any estimated deficit over 24 hours. Rehydration was begun by administering 10 ml/kg or 15 ml/kg by rapid intravenous infusion. Fluids were given intravenously with the composition determined by the attending consultant.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Singhi-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Singhi 1995</LINK> trial compared restricted fluids at 65% of the calculated maintenance fluid requirement with maintenance fluid requirements (110 ml/kg for first 10 kg, 50 ml/kg for next 10 kg and 25 ml/kg for subsequent weight), both given intravenously. The restricted fluids comprised one-fifth normal saline in 5% dextrose for 24 hours, followed by "a gradual liberalisation at a rate of 10 ml/kg over eight hours, if, after 24 hours of hospital stay, the serum sodium and plasma osmolality had returned to normal and there were no clinical signs of dehydration".</P>

<P>We did not attempt a meta-analysis of the two studies comparing mean sodium concentrations, as <LINK REF="STD-Powell-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 1990</LINK> measured serum sodium at 24 hours and <LINK REF="STD-Singhi-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Singhi 1995</LINK>, at 48 hours.

The <LINK REF="STD-Singhi-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Singhi 1995</LINK> study (1 study; 24 children without hyponatraemia, 26 children with hyponatraemia) subgrouped children by hyponatraemia status at study entry.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-09-16 09:53:41 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>The small number of studies identified by this review did not show any statistically significant difference in mortality or acute severe neurological sequelae from restricting fluids. Two studies reported high mortality rates overall, well above 10% (<LINK REF="STD-Duke-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Duke 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singhi-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Singhi 1995</LINK>; 407 children). The third study included very small numbers (19 children analysed), and reported no deaths (<LINK REF="STD-Powell-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 1990</LINK>). Meta-analysis of the two studies reporting neurological sequelae demonstrated statistically significant reductions in the rates of early spasticity and seizures, and later overall neurological sequelae, in children receiving maintenance fluids. There were no statistically significant differences in overall short-term neurological sequelae or in risk of hemiparesis, visual, or hearing impairment.</P>
<P>Two of the studies involved very small numbers of children from single centres (<LINK REF="STD-Powell-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singhi-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Singhi 1995</LINK>). The mortality and morbidity results, therefore, are dominated by the <LINK REF="STD-Duke-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Duke 2002</LINK> study. The long delays before presentation and a high rate of malnutrition in the children in this study may have been associated with a high rate of dehydration at presentation. The finding of a higher rate of neurological sequelae in the restricted-fluid group in this study could result from inadequate initial treatment of dehydration. This might not be relevant in settings where patients present earlier.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-09-16 09:57:40 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>The three included studies were insufficient to evaluate the review objective of evaluating different volumes of initial fluid administrations on treatment outcomes of acute bacterial meningitis. We did not find any trial answering the review question for adult patients. All the trials were conducted in in-hospital settings and no trials were carried out in primary care or out-of-hospital settings, where initial fluid therapy is often instituted, and the patients referred to a tertiary care set-up for specialised care. Trials done in out-of-hospital and primary healthcare settings might be more relevant to low- and middle-income nations, where healthcare delivery is not well monitored, and generally unstructured (<LINK REF="REF-Maher-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maher 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>The largest of the three studies included multiple outcomes relevant to the review question (<LINK REF="STD-Duke-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Duke 2002</LINK>). Its shortcoming was that it could only address the question in settings with high mortality and morbidity rates and long delays before presentation.</P>
<P>The other two included studies were too small to allow any conclusions to be drawn. None of the studies included adults.</P>
<P>The results of short-term fluid and electrolyte balance do not in themselves provide adequate evidence on which to change practice. The reporting of sodium levels was inconsistent so that it was not possible to undertake a meta-analysis.</P>
<P>The quality of evidence for the primary and secondary outcomes was low to very low and thus insufficient to guide clinical practice.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-09-16 09:58:31 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>We assessed the overall quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach (<LINK REF="REF-Schunemann-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schunemann 2011</LINK>), as shown in <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>. The overall quality of the evidence for maintenance-fluid versus restricted-fluid regimens for children with acute bacterial meningitis was low for the outcomes of death, and acute severe neurological sequelae, and very low for chronic severe neurological sequelae. In this 2016 update we revised the GRADE table to reflect current Cochrane standards, and improve clarity and consistency of reporting results.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-11-04 08:18:16 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>There is a lack of high quality evidence to guide the use of fluid therapy for acute bacterial meningitis. There are no trials in adult or elderly populations; all trials were in children. The meta-analysis found no significant difference between the maintenance-fluid and restricted-fluid groups in number of deaths (low quality of evidence), or acute severe neurological sequelae (low quality of evidence). Some evidence was found favouring maintenance fluid over restrictive regimens for the outcome of chronic severe neurological sequelae events at three months follow-up, although the quality of evidence is very low and hence not enough to guide practice. Most of the evidence was from high mortality setting.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-09-16 11:00:54 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>Future randomised clinical trials should evaluate maintenance fluid versus restricted fluid for acute bacterial meningitis. Trials in adult populations, particularly elderly populations, are needed and in countries with high and low mortality rates for acute bacterial meningitis. Large, high quality trials are also needed to assess the effectiveness of either restricting or administering maintenance fluids in populations where people present early and where mortality rates are low. Trials also need to focus on important outcomes such as duration of hospital stay and raised intracranial pressure.</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY MODIFIED="2013-06-14 07:46:42 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In your review, you present separate analyses of &#8216;acute severe sequelae&#8217;, &#8216;chronic severe sequelae&#8217;, and &#8216;mild to moderate sequelae&#8217; of bacterial meningitis.</P>
<P>I can&#8217;t find anything in the review to tell me which sequelae are included under acute severe, which under chronic severe, and which under mild to moderate. The neurological sequelae described in the review seem quite severe to me: hemiparesis/hemiplegia, spasticity, seizures, visual impairment and impaired response to sound. I can&#8217;t see anything that I would consider moderate but that is just my own opinion rather than being based on any external awareness of how sequelae are categorized. I also can&#8217;t be sure what the different sequelae are that occur within 4 weeks (acute) and after 4 weeks (chronic) &#8211; is it the same sequelae manifesting at different times or would different sequelae appear acutely and chronically?</P>
<P>I think these data would be very valuable to understanding the clinical import of the different meta-analyses that you present.</P>
<P>I agree with the conflict of interest statement below:<BR/>I certify that I have no affiliations with or involvement in any organization or entity with a financial interest in the subject matter of my feedback.</P>

</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2016-09-16 12:11:12 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>The classification of acute and chronic is based on whether the sequelae effect persist after the first four weeks of illness or not, irrespective of the type of sequelae. The classification into severe and mild to moderate is as per the limited information available from the studies available and the reporting is only to aid the reader by producing such categorisation. There is no widely accepted categorisation for neurological sequelae of meningitis.<BR/>

MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL were searched using OVID software. The MEDLINE search strategy is in <LINK REF="APP-12" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 12</LINK>.</P>
<P>The following search strategy was used to search MEDLINE and CENTRAL. The MEDLINE search was combined with the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy for identifying randomised trials in MEDLINE: sensitivity- and precision-maximising version (2008 revision); Ovid format (<LINK REF="REF-Lefebvre-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lefebvre 2011</LINK>). The search strategy was adapted to search Embase.com (see <LINK REF="APP-07" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 7</LINK>) and CINAHL (see Appendix 4).</P>
