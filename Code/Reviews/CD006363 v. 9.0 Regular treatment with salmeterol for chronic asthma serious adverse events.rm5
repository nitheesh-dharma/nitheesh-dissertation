Methods: Data synthesis This section cites revisions to the Handbook, but the version cited is not the most current. Please check and update this as necessary. I think this is a bit confusing, but if you don't remember what revision you were referring to, there is not much we can do about this!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE VERSION AND DATE ARE IN THE CITATION TO THE HANDBOOK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 2. Characteristics of included studies Wenzel 1998 Under ?Interventions?: ?Co-interventions: ICS 46%,? ? is this an incomplete sentence? Is there more than 1 co-intervention?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NO THIS IS THE ONLY LISTED ONE, CLARIFIED IN TEXT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Please check. 3. Characteristics of excluded studies Reason for exclusion for SLGL24 is not given. Please check and add. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THANKS ADDED.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Lazarus 2001 ? the numbers of withdrawals do not appear to match what is in the paper ?Twelve of 34 withdrawals occurred during the randomized treatment period; 3 were for dissatisfaction with asthma control, 1 was physician-initiated, and the remainder were for personal or administrative reasons.?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE CURRENT NUMBERS ARE CORRECT AS WE ONLY INCLUDED SALMETEROL AND PLACEBO ARMS ON RANDOMISED TREATMENT (SEE FLOW CHART IN THE PAPER)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was looking for the abbreviation for TAA. Can you please spell out what TAA stands for in the reviews as I am still puzzled! The review is available for you to check out and edit. Please also check that you are happy with the following abbreviations listed under characteristics of included studies and provide me with definitions of the ones without: ASS: ATS: American Thoracic Society bd: Bis die (Latin for 'twice a day') BDP: beclomethasone dipropionate BHR: bronchial hyperresponsiveness CF: cystic fibrosis CFC: chlorofluorocarbon COPD: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease CXR: chest x-ray D &amp;amp; V: diarrhoea and vomiting DPI: dry powder inhaler ECG: electrocardiogram FDA: Food &amp;amp; Drug Administration FP: fluticasone propionate GI: gasrtointestinal GSD: HFA: hydrofluoroalkane ICS: inhaled corticosteroids IM: intramuscular LABA: long-acting beta2-agonist LRTI: leukotriene receptor antagonist MDI: metered dose inhaler OCS: oral corticosteroid PEF: peak expiratory flow PEFR: peak expiratory flow rate PFT:prn: pro re nata (Latin for 'taken as needed') QID: Quarter in die (Latin for 'four times each day') RAO: RTI: respiratory tract infection SAE: serious adverse event SAL: salmeterol TAA: TIA: transient ischemic attack TRA: triam-cinolone acetonide URTI: upper respiratory tract infection&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I HAVE CHECKED AND CORRECTED THE ABBREVIATION LIST&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma Notes 9 Sept 2011&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;hi Chirs - reviewing this has been fun as it has presented a science communication challenge! I think that the new requirement for clearer plain language summaries will give me plenty of science communication experience - just to let you know that this is taking up quite a lot of my time compared to what it has done over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks very much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please check the highlighted changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are too many figures. Which would you like to keep and which can safely be lost? I have deleted most of these and linked to analyses instead. I would liike to keep 8 rather than 6 though!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Figure 9 therefore needs to be interpreted with caution, but does not indicate any significant effect of salmeterol on cardiovascular death when compared to placebo or salbutamol.&amp;quot; - it's not really the figure that needs interpreting with caution - it is the pooled OR. I made a change to this sentence as I think it's unclear to the reader. When I read that sentence I assumed that there was going to be a massive treatment effect, but there was not. What do you think? Changes accepted. Thanks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discussion about published versus unpublished information belongs in the results section and not in the discussion. Can you move this to a subgroup analysis? I would rather leave this in the discussion please. We can discuss!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract - this result appears in the abstract, but not elsewhere in the article - where did it come from, or is it a typo? (OR 9.52; 95% CI 1.24 to 73.09) I think this must have been left over from a previous calculation using M-H OR?? Well spotted!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second sentence here seems to contradict the first: &amp;quot;In patients who were not taking inhaled corticosteroids, compared to regular salbutamol or placebo, there was a significant increase in risk of asthma-related death with regular salmeterol&lt;span class=&quot;marker&quot;&gt; (OR 9.52; 95% CI 1.24 to 73.09)&lt;/span&gt;. The confidence interval for patients taking inhaled corticosteroids is too wide to rule in or out an increase in asthma mortality in this group.&amp;quot; Thanks I have corrected the wrong OR and changed the second sentence to clarify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PLS - I am not quite clear on why you are talking about the two larger trials separately. I thought it was because these were the only two to record any deaths - if this is the case, it makes the sentence in the paragraph above redundant. or was it because they were the only two that had independent patient data? what does this mean &amp;quot;These showed similar sized increases in the risk of asthma-related death&amp;quot;? I replace this sentence with one from the abstract Fine, amended to make this clearer as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;this statement appears in the PLS but does not in the abstract &amp;quot;Therefore regular salmeterol should be discontinued if no symptomatic benefit is achieved and the manufacturers' advice not to increase the dose of salmeterol during exacerbations should be made clear. &amp;quot; should this recommendation be added to the abstract or deleted form the plain language summary? Agreed, I have deleted this from the PLS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC August 17 2011. New search in Aug 2011 identified 155 new citations but none were relevant to this review. Cumulative total 733. Ready for submission as technical update.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sept 7th 2009. Edited following MJC feedback. Await feedback on SoF from Grade team. Now incorporated following comments from Peer Reviewer. Data made plural in the discussion as pointed out by John White. SoF tables sent to MJC to sign off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sept 2009 Sadly evidence is hard wired into Grade Pro! Corrected using Global replace! Data also changed to be plural. John added in acknowledgements. D'Urzo and ICS doses clarified in the discussion (following comment from Matthew).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;August 2009&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work on MD has thrown up the misclassification of Russell as an adult study. New SoF tables generated for adults and children and new search did not reveal any new studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;March 16th. New comparison tree structure to fit with SoF tables, single new SoF table added. I will send this to Matt for his inspection. CJC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dec 19th Changed all analyses to Peto for consistency! Text amended to reflect this change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~#&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;October 8th - SoF order changed and Figures renumbered! Fig 9 is published as Fig 18&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;August 12th. SoF tidied up!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;July 16th. SoF added&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;July 3rd versions reconciled for this update.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;July 2nd - new search result incorporated and review marked as updated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;June 28 - Selective reporting tidied up and What's New completed. New search awaited from Liz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the AE and DAE data now included and mentioned in the discussion. Matts corrections incorporated into background.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I need to mention the FDA results in the text and add DAE and AE data as sensitivity analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Post publication Comparison 13 removed SMART data which was fatal and non-fatal SAE in CVS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This replaced by admissions for asthma in FDA report. Also FDA data on non-fatal asthma SAEs added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figure 22 added combined fatal and non-fatal SAEs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paper published data added and error in SNS data corrected too!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;May 13th&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MJC contribution altered to include appendices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;April 29 new background inserted and details added as Appendix 1 and 2. Data and analysis graphs checked labels and metrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;April 21 Abstract made shorter and clarified. Also plain language. Summary of Findings next?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;April 17 Review restructured and re-written. Table of included studies tidied up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;April 7 Discussed issues below with Matt. Steve has found a website for Boulet so SAE added for this trial! Otherwise rather stuck. May have to proceed with what we have extracted!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;++++++++++++++++++++&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;March 14 - initial glitch in relation to Archie has passed. Should FDA studies be taken out and just mentioned in discussion? Should SNS and SMART be combined at all for asthma deaths. Phone Call from Pim after she found my protocol on the Library. Should Figure 2 combine SNS and SMART. Abstract added for the review. GSK data awaited from Steve Yancey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feb 29 more pruning but cannot go further until SNS adverse event data comes in. This needs changing in Comparisons 2,3 and 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FEb28 Outcomes pruned to match protocol and I think more of the subgroup comparisons could be removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FEb 26 CJC has edited the comparison tree in line with the protocol. Note that we could do a sensitivity analysis looking at those studies in which ICS was withdrawn and look at D'Urso within study ICS profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;=======================&lt;br&gt;Jan 15&lt;br&gt;Thompson 94 moved to excluded as no control arm. D' Urso includes interesting ICS dose data from within the study.&lt;br&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br&gt;Jan 09 2008&lt;br&gt;On reflection Lemanske excluded as patients randomised to both salmeterol and TAA and then some were withdrawn from the TAA, so there is no salmeterol v placebo comparison! This will go in LABA2 and needs to be in the DISCUSSION. I think Boyd 1995 should also be in LABA2 as all the patients had to be on high dose ICS for inclusion.&lt;br&gt;Lemanske is relevant as TAA was tailed off but does not fit inclusion criteria for LABA1, however an inclusion criteria for Boyd was high dose ICS so this really does not belong in LABA2. Kemp 1998b and Russell 1995 are also an issue as stable ICS use was part of the inclusion criteria. Probably an idea to amend the protocols to reflect this (randomised to LABA + ICS or ICS as an inclusion criteria for LABA2)? D'Alonzo 1995 &amp;amp; Nathan 1995 are both a review of two studies already included (Pearlman and D'A 1994)! Subsequently excluded.&lt;br&gt;Shapiro 2000, Pearlman 2004, Nathan 2006, Kavuru 2000 all withdrawn ICS from the salmeterol and placebo arms, with a resultant high withdrawal rate from the placebo groups (this could lead to bias?)&lt;br&gt;Verberne 1996 is in the wrong review as patients were randomised to BDP and salmeterol. As this is excluded I have moved the total mortality outcome to the dummy review.&lt;br&gt;IPD data on deaths and SAEs according to ICS status at entry would be really helpful for my MD!!!&lt;br&gt;It will also be of interest to carry out separate analyses on reported and unreported data.&lt;br&gt;Von Berg, Lenney and Lundback all raise issues about how to input the data (early and late outcomes reported....)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;br&gt;Kavuru and Shapiro details imported from FP review. List of GSK studies in FDA submission will need checking! Total mortality and non-fatal SAEs moved to first outcomes and SMART and SNS data confirmed for these. Kavuru and Shapiro results here too. Weinstein needs check of paper publication (and ask Steve Yancey re no web details). Liz asked for Shapiro paper to enter in outcomes. Does Steve Yancey have both arm data from von Berg I wonder.&lt;br&gt;Adinoff data needs extracting from Paper. Nathan 2006 and Pearlman 2004 data added. Cloosterman excluded as Formterol is the LABA!&lt;br&gt;Lundback paper results needed, also Russell.&lt;br&gt;Will need info on baseline ICS use for subgroup work.&lt;br&gt;Send MAtt SLGL24 to assess! Also SMAJ 0145 &amp;amp; SMAA0556 (SMS40138) with control treatment arms of different interventions.&lt;br&gt;Lenney 1995a contains data for children on 25 and 50mcg daily. This can be dealt with separately in subgroups for dose later on, with head to head dose comparison too&lt;br&gt;Also we need a blinded decision on use of Lenney 1995a or b. Resolved after discussion with Toby. Need to see what Matt thinks.&lt;br&gt;Boyd and Kemp and Langton Hewer 1998b data needs to be entered from paper. ?Website.&lt;br&gt;Wolfe added from paper and Russell. Check that Gotz is a crossover study!&lt;br&gt;I need an overview to send to Steve Yancey. Long list sent on Dec 11th.&lt;br&gt;=======================&lt;br&gt;CJC November 23&lt;br&gt;Included studies added and data from SMART and SNS. Disaster on EndNote search put right when included D'Urzo study was not on the list as label was LAB1 not LABA1.......&lt;br&gt;Excluded studies added with reasons for exclusion, also Rickard and Woolerton added as references to SMART&lt;br&gt;3 awaiting assessment!&lt;br&gt;Additional studies added.&lt;br&gt;Nov 26: Went through included and excluded studies with Matt. Pollard moved to included and Poundfield ongoing. 4 that Matt did not think were included intially were agreed as being included. Para added to results.&lt;br&gt;Tenses changed to past for methods etc. Data added on all cause hospitalisations and Resp and Cardiac SAEs from FDA submission.&lt;br&gt;###########################################################################################&lt;br&gt;CJC and MJC amended Nov 12&lt;br&gt;Interventions&lt;br&gt;Inhaled salmeterol given twice daily for a period of at least 12 weeks, delivered by any device (CFC-MDI, HFA-MDI, DPI) and at any dose. Studies that use comparison groups with placebo or short-acting beta2-agonists will be included, and co-intervention with leukotriene receptor antagonists, inhaled or oral corticosteroids or theophylline will be allowed as long as they are not part of the randomised intervention, and are therefore not systematically different between groups. Studies that compare different doses of salmeterol, or different delivery devices or propellants (with no placebo arm) will not be included. Studies in which salmeterol is randomised together with an inhaled steroid (in separate inhalers or a combined inhaler) will be excluded from this review but will be considered in a separate review, and studies comparing salmeterol with formoterol will also be subject to a separate review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outcomes&lt;br&gt;Outcomes will not be sub-divided according to whether the trial investigators considered them to be related to trial medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data extraction&lt;br&gt;Data will be extracted using a prepared checklist before being entered into Rev Man 4.2 by CJC and MJC. Data will include characteristics of included studies (methods, participants, interventions, outcomes) and results of the included studies. Authors of included studies will be contacted for unpublished adverse event data, and manufacturers' web sites will be searched for further details of adverse events. All cause serious adverse events (fatal and non-fatal) will be recorded, and in view of the difficulty in deciding whether events are asthma related, details of the cause of death and serious adverse events will be noted where they are available. The definition of serious adverse events will also be recorded, and further information will be sought if this is not clear (particularly in relation to hospital admissions and serious adverse events).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subgroup analyses will be conducted on the basis of dose of salmeterol (usual dose versus high dose), age (adults versus children), severity of asthma, reported corticosteroid use at baseline, comparator used, and ethnic groups. Subgroups will be compared using tests for interaction (Altman 2003), not by comparing P values of the subgroups&lt;br&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC Nov 9th&lt;br&gt;Further refinements to background, PICO and methods made after discussion with Toby and George Foreman&lt;br&gt;Background: &amp;quot;This review will focus on studies that capture mortality and serious adverse events&amp;quot; - I have removed designed to capture from this sentence as important data could be excluded.&lt;br&gt;Objectives have been amended (see red text) to specify comparisons with SABA and placebo with any co-intervention.&lt;br&gt;I will send to MJC to check over the weekend with a view to publication on Tuesday.&lt;br&gt;Chris&lt;br&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br&gt;CJC amendments following peer review - the following sentences have been added:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secondary outcomes:&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Cardiovascular-related mortality&lt;br&gt;Cardiovascular-related non-fatal serious adverse events&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;Methods- data extraction&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Authors of included studies will be contacted for unpublished adverse event data, and manufacturers web sites will be searched for further details of adverse events. In view of the difficulty in deciding whether events are asthma related, all respiratory related mortality will be inlcuded as a secondary outcome, with details of the cause of death noted when such information can be obtained.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~&lt;br&gt;The protocol looks good, I only have&amp;#160;4 suggestions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. As reporting of adverse events (and mortality) is very poor in the trials manuscripts, will there be systematic efforts made to contact the manufacturer or trialists?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. For secondary outcomes, is it possible to more clearly define items such as 'respiratory related mortality'? Does this include diverse items such as pneumonia, lung cancer etc.?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Given the previous concerns over cardiovascular effects of beta-2-agonists, would it be worth having a composite CV endpoint as a secondary measure (e.g. MI, stroke)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. For quality assessment, it would be good to record what adverse effects monitoring was put in place, how regular or intense it was, who conducted it, and also whether there was an independent committee who reviewed the events?&lt;br&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br&gt;Oct 17; Pearce reference added. Objectives and statistical methods tidied up to exclude trials in which salmeterol was randomised with ICS. Also high dose salmeterol will not be in the main analysis. Emphasis is now on total mortality and SAE/Admission.&lt;br&gt;October 16th: Refined protocol. MJC needs opportunity to comment on this. Beach added to references&lt;br&gt;October 9th 2007 Protocol split to make it more manageable when assessing the different LABAs and inhaled steroids as a co-intervention. Protocol adjusted to clarify salmeterol only at usual dose for main analysis (not 100mcg bd), without all patients on ICS. Adults and children. New search terms added, formoterol may need to come out).&lt;br&gt;Nov 14th&lt;br&gt;Search terms added. Review widened to include any comparator used in surveillance studies. Background added by MJC. This is now ready for submission after Susan has kindly checked the references.&lt;br&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2013-04-11 14:39:26 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson" REVIEW_NO="LAB1-AST" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.2.1 " REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="9.0">

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-10-25 17:37:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>Asthma is a common condition that affects the airways &#8211; the small tubes that carry air in and out of the lungs. When a person with asthma comes into contact with an irritant (an asthma trigger), the muscles around the walls of the airways tighten, the airways become narrower, and the lining of the airways becomes inflamed and starts to swell. This leads to the symptoms of asthma - wheezing, coughing and difficulty in breathing. They can lead to an asthma attack or exacerbation. People can have underlying inflammation in their lungs and sticky mucus or phlegm may build up, which can further narrow the airways. There is no cure for asthma; however there are medications that allow most people to control their asthma so they can get on with daily life.</P>
<P>Long-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists, such as salmeterol, work by reversing the narrowing of the airways that occurs during an asthma attack. These drugs - taken by inhaler - are known to improve lung function, symptoms, quality of life and reduce the number of asthma attacks. However, there are concerns about the safety of long-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists, particularly in people who are not taking inhaled corticosteroids to control the underlying inflammation. We did this review to take a closer look at the safety of people taking salmeterol daily compared to people on placebo or the short acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist salbutamol.</P>
<P>There was no statistically significant difference in the number of people who died during treatment with salmeterol compared with placebo or salbutamol. Because so few people die of asthma, huge trials or observational studies are normally required to detect a difference in death rates from asthma. There were more non-fatal serious adverse events in people taking salmeterol compared to those on placebo; for every 188 people treated with salmeterol for 28 weeks, one extra non-fatal event occurred in comparison with placebo. There was no significant differences in serious adverse events in people on salmeterol compared to regular salbutamol.</P>
<P>In order to obtain individual patient data on asthma deaths, we looked separately at mortality in two large trials on over 51,000 patients who were not taking inhaled corticosteroids, and found that there was an increase in the number of asthma-related deaths among people on salmeterol.</P>
<P>We conclude that, for patients whose asthma is not well-controlled on moderate doses of inhaled corticosteroids, additional salmeterol can improve symptoms but this may be at the expense of an increased risk of serious adverse events and asthma related mortality. Salmeterol should not be used as a substitute for inhaled corticosteroids, and adherence with inhaled steroids should be kept under review if separate inhalers are used. Salmeterol should not be taken by people who are not taking regular inhaled steroids due to the increased risk of asthma-related death.</P>

<P>Epidemiological evidence has suggested a link between beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists and increases in asthma mortality. There has been much debate about possible causal links for this association, and whether regular (daily) long-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists are safe.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2008-05-09 15:29:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>The aim of this review is to assess the risk of fatal and non-fatal serious adverse events in trials that randomised patients with chronic asthma to regular salmeterol versus placebo or regular short-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2011-10-10 20:19:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified trials using the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials. We checked websites of clinical trial registers for unpublished trial data and FDA submissions in relation to salmeterol. The date of the most recent search was August 2011.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2011-10-10 20:19:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>We included controlled parallel design clinical trials on patients of any age and severity of asthma if they randomised patients to treatment with regular salmeterol and were of at least 12 weeks' duration. Concomitant use of inhaled corticosteroids was allowed, as long as this was not part of the randomised treatment regimen.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2011-10-10 20:20:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>Two authors independently selected trials for inclusion in the review. One author extracted outcome data and the second checked them. We sought unpublished data on mortality and serious adverse events.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-10-25 17:37:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>The review includes 26 trials comparing salmeterol to placebo and eight trials comparing with salbutamol. These included 62,815 participants with asthma (including 2,599 children). In six trials (2,766 patients), no serious adverse event data could be obtained.</P>
<P>All-cause mortality was higher with regular salmeterol than placebo but the increase was not significant (Peto odds ratio (OR) 1.33 (95% CI 0.85 to 2.08)). Non-fatal serious adverse events were significantly increased when regular salmeterol was compared with placebo (OR 1.15 95% CI 1.02 to 1.29). One extra serious adverse event occurred over 28 weeks for every 188 people treated with regular salmeterol (95% CI 95 to 2606). There is insufficient evidence to assess whether the risk in children is higher or lower than in adults. We found no significant increase in fatal or non-fatal serious adverse events when regular salmeterol was compared with regular salbutamol.</P>
<P>We combined individual patient data from the two largest studies (SNS: n=25,180 and SMART: n=26,355), as all the asthma-related deaths in adults occurred in these studies. In patients who were not taking inhaled corticosteroids, compared to regular salbutamol or placebo, there was a significant increase in risk of asthma-related death with regular salmeterol (Peto OR 6.15 95% CI 1.73 to 21.84). The confidence interval for patients who were taking inhaled corticosteroids is wide and cannot rule in or out an increase in asthma mortality in the presence of an inhaled corticosteroid (Peto OR 2.03 95% CI 0.82 to 5.00).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-10-25 17:37:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>In comparison with placebo, we have found an increased risk of serious adverse events with regular salmeterol. There is also a clear increase in risk of asthma-related mortality in patients not using inhaled corticosteroids in the two large surveillance studies. Although the increase in asthma-related mortality was smaller in patients taking inhaled corticosteroids at baseline, the confidence interval is wide, so we cannot conclude that the inhaled corticosteroids abolish the risks of regular salmeterol. The adverse effects of regular salmeterol in children remain uncertain due to the small number of children studied.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-10-25 17:38:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>There is currently no universally accepted definition of the term "asthma". This is in part due to an overlap of asthmatic symptoms with those of other diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but is also due to the probable existence of more than one underlying pathophysiological process. There are, for example, wide variations in the age of onset, symptoms, triggers, associations with allergic disease and the type of inflammatory cell infiltrate seen in patients diagnosed with severe asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Miranda-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miranda 2004</LINK>). Patients with all forms and severity of disease will typically have intermittent symptoms of cough, wheeze and/or breathlessness. Underlying these symptoms there is a process of variable, at least partially reversible airway obstruction, airway hyper responsiveness and, in most cases, chronic inflammation.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Airway obstruction</HEADING>
<P>Patients with a history of asthma demonstrate chronic changes within the airways including goblet cell hyperplasia, airway smooth muscle (ASM) hyperplasia and hypertrophy (<LINK REF="REF-Ebina-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ebina 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ordonez-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ordonez 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Woodruff-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woodruff 2004</LINK>) and excess myofibroblasts with increased subepithelial collagen deposition (<LINK REF="REF-Brewster-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brewster 1990</LINK>). In the acute setting, in patients who have died of status asthmaticus airway obstruction is evident from air-trapping and lung hyperinflation with mucus plugging of the small and large airways (<LINK REF="REF-Dunnill-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dunnill 1960</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kuyper-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuyper 2003</LINK>). There is also shedding of ciliated bronchial mucosal cells, inflammatory cell infiltrates and submucosal oedema with transudation of fluid into the bronchial lumen (<LINK REF="REF-Carroll-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carroll 1993</LINK>). It is more difficult to measure the degree of ASM contraction (bronchoconstriction) at post-mortem studies although evidence for a role of bronchoconstriction in airway narrowing comes from other sources.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Airway hyper responsiveness</HEADING>
<P>Patients with asthma typically display a degree of 'airway hyper responsiveness' to inhaled allergens (<LINK REF="REF-Cockcroft-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cockcroft 2006</LINK>), and to a variety of chemical stimuli including histamine, serotonin, bradykinin, prostaglandins, methacholine and acetylcholine as well as other triggers such as exercise, deep inhalation and inhalation of cold air (<LINK REF="REF-Boushey-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boushey 1980</LINK>). Bronchoconstriction is implicated as the primary effector mechanism of airway narrowing in these responses. This is because of both the short time frame of the response and because many of these stimuli typically either cause bronchoconstriction directly <I>in vitro</I> or promote bronchoconstriction through interference with the autonomic control of ASM. Further evidence comes from findings that this response can be abolished or diminished by bronchodilator medications such as atropine and beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists (<LINK REF="REF-Phillips-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillips 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simonsson-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simonsson 1967</LINK>); although beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists in particular may have additional mechanisms of action. Whether airway hyper responsiveness relates primarily to an abnormality of ASM, to increased ASM bulk (<LINK REF="REF-Wiggs-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiggs 1990</LINK>), to aberrant autonomic control or reflex pathways, or to physical damage to the airway epithelium remains to be established. Regular use of salbutamol has, however, been shown to increase airway hyper responsiveness to allergen exposure and produce tolerance to the protective effect of salbutamol against bronchoconstriction induced by both methacholine and allergens (<LINK REF="REF-Cockcroft-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cockcroft 1993</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Inflammation</HEADING>
<P>It has long been thought that the histological changes described above and the phenomenon of airway hyper responsiveness are due to a combined acute and chronic inflammatory response (<LINK REF="REF-Bousquet-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bousquet 2000</LINK>). Patients with status asthmaticus have increased numbers of inflammatory cells including eosinophils and neutrophils, as well as a variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines found in bronchial alveolar lavage (<LINK REF="REF-Tonnel-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tonnel 2001</LINK>). In patients with chronic asthma there is also evidence of increased eosinophil numbers (<LINK REF="REF-Bousquet-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bousquet 1990</LINK>), inflammatory cell adhesion molecules (<LINK REF="REF-Vignola-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vignola 1993</LINK>) and some evidence of an association between the extent of inflammation, disease severity and hyperreactivity. This association has however been questioned on the background of a number of negative results (<LINK REF="REF-Brusasco-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brusasco 1998</LINK>), although it is made difficult to prove by the lack of a consistent marker of a sequential and variable inflammatory response (<LINK REF="REF-Haley-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haley 1998</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Time trend data and case control studies</HEADING>
<P>Adrenaline was successfully used in the symptomatic treatment of asthma as far back as 1903 (<LINK REF="REF-Tattersfield-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tattersfield 2006</LINK>). Initially given subcutaneously, the inhaled route was tried in 1929 to reduce adverse effects but these remained a problem and in 1940 details of a new agent isoprenaline (isoproterenol) were published in Germany (<LINK REF="REF-Konzett-1940" TYPE="REFERENCE">Konzett 1940</LINK>). Although isoprenaline was more selective for beta- as opposed to alpha-adrenoreceptors, adverse effects including palpitations were still a major problem, particularly with oral administration (<LINK REF="REF-Gay-1949" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gay 1949</LINK>) and it first became available as atomizer spray for use in the UK in 1948 (<LINK REF="REF-Pearce-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pearce 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Prior to the 1940s, mortality rates from asthma in a number of countries were stable and low at less than one asthma death per 100,000 people per year (<LINK REF="REF-Pearce-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pearce 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). During the 1940s and 50s, there was a slight rise in mortality rates and concerns about a possible link to inhaled adrenaline were raised at an early stage (<LINK REF="REF-Benson-1948" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benson 1948</LINK>). However, the rise was small and the cause unclear and sales continued to increase with the introduction of aerosol or metered dose inhalers in the early 1960s. During this decade, there was an epidemic of asthma deaths in at least six countries including England, Wales and New Zealand (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). In all six countries the epidemics coincided with the licensing of an aerosol called 'Isoprenaline Forte', which contained five times the dose of isoprenaline per administration than the standard preparation (<LINK REF="REF-Stolley-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stolley 1972</LINK>). In other countries including the Netherlands where isoprenaline forte was introduced late and sales volumes low and in the US, where isoprenaline forte was not licensed, no increase in asthma mortality occurred. This was despite an approximate trebling in per capita alternative bronchodilator sales between 1962 and 1968 in the US (<LINK REF="REF-Stolley-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stolley 1972</LINK>). A detailed review of the epidemic in England and Wales concluded it was not due to changes in death certification, disease classification or an increase in asthma prevalence, but instead was most likely due to new methods of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Speizer-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Speizer 1968</LINK>). In England and Wales, mortality rates fell following health warnings about the overuse of inhalers and banning of over the counter sales in 1968. It was around this time that more selective beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists such as terbutaline (<LINK REF="REF-Bergman-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bergman 1969</LINK>) and salbutamol (albuterol) (<LINK REF="REF-Cullum-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cullum 1969</LINK>) were being developed.</P>
<P>In the late 1970s, a second epidemic of asthma deaths occurred in New Zealand (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). It was later shown that this epidemic coincided with the introduction and rising sales of fenoterol, a new short-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist (<LINK REF="REF-Crane-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crane 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). A significant association between mortality and fenoterol use was demonstrated in three consecutive case-control studies, the latter studies addressing criticisms of the first (<LINK REF="REF-Crane-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crane 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grainger-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grainger 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pearce-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pearce 1990</LINK>). Furthermore, the relative risk of asthma death in patients prescribed fenoterol increased markedly when analysis was restricted to subgroups defined by markers of severity, including previous hospital admission and use of oral corticosteroids. Following the publication of the first case control study, the fenoterol market share in New Zealand fell from 30% in 1988 to 3% in 1991 and by the early 1990s the mortality epidemic appeared to be over (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). During the gradual decline in mortality in New Zealand from its peak in 1979, total sales of alternative beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists, including salbutamol, gradually rose and the use of inhaled corticosteroids also increased during the latter half of the 1980s (<LINK REF="REF-Pearce-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pearce 2007</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">The introduction of long-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists</HEADING>
<P>Given the relatively short-lived action of beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists such as salbutamol, in the late 1980s efforts were made to develop longer-acting compounds. Subsequently, the long-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists (LABAs), salmeterol and formoterol were released by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and Novartis, respectively. Both drugs cause bronchodilation that lasts for more than 12 hours, although formoterol has a faster onset of action (<LINK REF="STD-Kemp-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kemp 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ringdal-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ringdal 1998</LINK>). Given previous concerns about the safety profile of some of the short acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists, salmeterol and formoterol were subject to randomised controlled trials on larger numbers of patients. Using these trials, several Cochrane reviews have addressed the efficacy of LABAs in addition to inhaled corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Ni-Chroinin-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ni Chroinin 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ni-Chroinin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ni Chroinin 2005</LINK>), in comparison with placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Walters-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walters 2007</LINK>), short-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists (<LINK REF="REF-Walters-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walters 2002</LINK>), leukotriene-receptor antagonists (<LINK REF="REF-Ducharme-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ducharme 2006</LINK>), and increased doses of inhaled corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Greenstone-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenstone 2005</LINK>). The beneficial effects of LABAs on lung function, symptoms, quality of life and exacerbations requiring oral steroids have been demonstrated. However, with some studies demonstrating an associated increase in mortality, concerns about the safety profile of LABAs have heightened and there has been much debate about the potential protective role of inhaled corticosteroids.</P>

<P>We have outlined the pharmacology of beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists in detail in <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>.

<P>We have taken a different approach from <LINK REF="REF-Salpeter-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salpeter 2006</LINK>, in that we have not assumed a class effect of long-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists, but we have considered trials comparing regular salmeterol to placebo or regular salbutamol. We have chosen not to include results from trials on formoterol in this review, as there are known differences in the pharmacology properties of salmeterol and formoterol (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Noord-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Noord 1996</LINK>); however formoterol is the subject of another ongoing review.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2011-10-25 17:45:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>The outcomes of this review were dichotomous, and we recorded the number of participants with each outcome event, by allocated treated group. We planned to conduct the primary analysis, mortality, using risk difference, as many studies did not have any deaths in either arm. However, revisions to the <I>Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>) since the protocol was written advise against this approach. Therefore, the risk differences were only used to estimate the absolute impact of treatment. The Peto odds ratio has advantages when events are rare as no continuity correction for zero cells is required, and although it can perform less well with unbalanced treatment arms and large effect sizes, the updated review has now used Peto odds ratio for all primary analyses, and the Mantel-Haenszel random effects model has been used for sensitivity analysis.</P>

<P>The initial search in October 2007 found 512 abstracts, which we reduced to 504 after removing duplicates. Of these, we identified 154 abstracts that related to salmeterol alone (three were from references listed in identified trials and review articles, and one was only published on the GSK website). We included 32 studies in the review (42 references) and excluded 118: 71 were less than 12 weeks in duration (including 26 single-dose studies); eight were not RCTs; five were dose comparison studies; five are ongoing studies; four were on exercise-induced bronchospasm; four compared with theophylline; three were propellant studies; three were cross-over in design; and seven were for other reasons. We reached consensus on all the included studies after inspection of the full text from papers and websites; there was initial disagreement on six abstracts, five of which we subsequently included and one excluded. We identified additional references to the included studies and one unpublished study from other reviews (<LINK REF="STD-SLGA-3014" TYPE="STUDY">SLGA 3014</LINK>).</P>

<P>A total of 46,501 (74%) people completed treatment, encompassing more than 19,000 patient years studied.

<P>Twenty-six studies (34,781 participants) compared salmeterol to placebo and eight studies (28,532 participants) compared salmeterol to regular salbutamol.

<P>All studies were double-blind and unlikely to have been subject to selection bias; however lack of comprehensive reporting of fatal and non-fatal SAEs make selective reporting a threat to the validity of this review (see <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>).

<P>Data were available from seven studies comparing salmeterol (N = 18,199) to salbutamol (N = 9,416), representing 93% of the randomised patients for this comparison. The larger numbers in the salmeterol arm are due to <LINK REF="STD-SNS-1993" TYPE="STUDY">SNS 1993</LINK>, in which twice as many patients were randomised to salmeterol in comparison to salbutamol. Three studies in adults (<LINK REF="STD-Britton-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Britton 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lundback-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lundback 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SNS-1993" TYPE="STUDY">SNS 1993</LINK>) and one study in children (<LINK REF="STD-Lenney-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Lenney 1995a</LINK>) contributed data to the outcome, although almost all the events came from the SNS study. The results were similar to those from the placebo comparison: 55 deaths occurred in the salmeterol arm compared to 23 in the salbutamol arm but again the difference was not statistically significant (Peto OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.96; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>; see <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). The Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio was very similar (1.23, 95% CI 0.75 to 2.02). The pooled risk difference was an increase of seven in 10,000, with a CI from six fewer deaths to 20 more deaths per 10,000 treated with salmeterol. There was some heterogeneity in this outcome (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 19%) but sensitivity analysis using a fixed effect risk difference gave a very similar result, with a point estimate of six per 10,000 and a CI from eight fewer deaths to 19 more deaths per 10,000 treated with salmeterol.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">SAEs (non-fatal all cause)</HEADING>
<P>An illustrative example of the definition of SAEs used in trials by GSK is shown in <LINK REF="APP-04" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 4</LINK>. Whilst the majority of SAEs result in hospitalisations, the number of patients with SAEs tends to be higher than the number who are admitted to hospital (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.22" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.22</LINK> for comparative data from <LINK REF="STD-SMART-2006" TYPE="STUDY">SMART 2006</LINK>). We have used information on patients with any SAE for these analyses (with the exception of <LINK REF="STD-SNS-1993" TYPE="STUDY">SNS 1993</LINK> where this was not reported, so we have used hospital admissions and life-threatening events).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Salmeterol versus placebo</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Combined data from adults and children</HEADING>
<P>Data were available on non-fatal SAEs from the GSK trial register and FDA submissions for 18 studies comparing salmeterol (N = 15,895) to placebo (N = 15,634); this represents 91% of the randomised patients for this comparison. The studies were largely on adults, but some data from 1333 children in five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Russell-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Russell 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simons-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Simons 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SLGA-3014" TYPE="STUDY">SLGA 3014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Von-Berg-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Von Berg 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weinstein-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Weinstein 1998</LINK>) contributed to the analysis. The overall result indicated an increased risk of SAEs with salmeterol (Peto OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.29) with low heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0), <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>. Random-effects Mantel-Haenzel modelling gave a very similar result (OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.28) and the CI was unchanged when <LINK REF="STD-Boyd-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Boyd 1995</LINK> was excluded in view of the higher dose of salmeterol (100 mcg bd) used in this trial.</P>
<P>Since SAEs were rare in the studies (overall 3.6% of patients on placebo), the risk difference is small at 0.005 (95% CI 0.001 to 0.008); using the placebo arm of <LINK REF="STD-SMART-2006" TYPE="STUDY">SMART 2006</LINK> for reference over a 28-week period there would need to be 188 patients treated (95% CI 95 to 2606) for one extra SAE to occur, calculated by <A HREF="http://www.nntonline.net">Visual Rx</A> using the odds ratio and baseline risk of 3.6%. This is illustrated in <LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>, which shows that for every thousand patients treated with salmeterol there are an extra five patients who will suffer a SAE, so that in comparison to 40 per thousand in the placebo group this rises to 45 per thousand on salmeterol.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Adults with non-fatal SAEs</HEADING>
<P>When the adult data comparing salmeterol with placebo were considered alone, the results showed a similar increase in risk which is also statistically significant (Peto OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.28; <LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK>). The result was unchanged using Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect, but became borderline significant using random-effects (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.28).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Children with non-fatal SAEs</HEADING>
<P>There were only 1333 children reported for this outcome so, although the direction of effect was the same as for the adults, the CI is wide (Peto OR 1.30, 0.82 to 2.85; <LINK REF="FIG-08" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 8</LINK>). The results in children include both the possibility of a greater risk than in adults, but also the possibility of no difference between salmeterol and placebo.</P>

<P>In contrast, the results from eight studies comparing salmeterol (N = 18,481) to salbutamol (N = 9,702), representing 98% of the randomised patients for this comparison, showed a reduction in the risk of SAEs with salmeterol which was not statistically significant (Peto OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.14). A test for interaction between the results comparing salmeterol with placebo and salbutamol was not significant. As it has not proved possible to obtain missing information in relation to the number of patients with any SAEs in <LINK REF="STD-SNS-1993" TYPE="STUDY">SNS 1993</LINK>, we used the number of hospitalisations or life/threatening events reported in the trial for the main analysis. We adopted this approach because the data collection form allowed more than one classification of events, and in contrast to the other studies in the review, the number of SAEs that did not result in hospitalisation was greater than in the hospitalisation category. We carried out a sensitivity analysis combining all non-fatal SAEs (although this carries a risk that patients may have been more than once, which would lead to an over precise estimate) and this is shown in <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>. This approach made very little difference to the pooled result (Peto OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.11).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Adults with non-fatal SAEs</HEADING>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Children with non-fatal SAEs</HEADING>
<P>Again the number of children contributing to this outcome is very small, which makes the uncertainty around the results considerable. As with the previous comparison between salmeterol and placebo, it remains possible that the risk may be higher or lower in children than in adults.</P>
<P>We carried out a sensitivity analysis because separate results are reported from <LINK REF="STD-Lenney-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Lenney 1995a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Lenney-1995b" TYPE="STUDY">Lenney 1995b</LINK> for the first three months and the subsequent nine months of the trial. Since patients could have contributed adverse event data from both periods of these trials, we did not consider it safe to combine the results, and full 12-month data were not available. Both pooled results are shown in <LINK REF="FIG-08" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 8</LINK>, and there is no significant difference shown in either period. For the first three months the pooled Peto OR was 1.37 (95% CI 0.71 to 2.64) and for the nine-month follow-up the pooled Peto OR was 1.17 (95% CI 0.71 to 1.94).</P>

<P>The cause of death was only independently assessed in the two large surveillance studies (<LINK REF="STD-SMART-2006" TYPE="STUDY">SMART 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SNS-1993" TYPE="STUDY">SNS 1993</LINK>). The results for asthma mortality in these studies are in <LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>; both studies found a similar increase in asthma mortality, but in the earlier <LINK REF="STD-SNS-1993" TYPE="STUDY">SNS 1993</LINK> study this three-fold increase in the risk of asthma death was not statistically significant, whilst in <LINK REF="STD-SMART-2006" TYPE="STUDY">SMART 2006</LINK> a significant four-fold increase in the risk of asthma death was found. In absolute terms the size of the risk difference for asthma mortality in <LINK REF="STD-SMART-2006" TYPE="STUDY">SMART 2006</LINK> was very similar to that found for mortality of any cause; the point estimate for asthma related death being an increase of eight asthma deaths for every 10,000 patients treated with salmeterol for six months, with a CI from two more deaths to 14 more deaths per 10,000.</P>
<P>The direction and size of the increase in asthma mortality is consistent between the two studies, and although there are differences in study design and the comparator used, if the results of the two studies are combined there is a significant increase in asthma mortality with regular salmeterol, (Peto OR 2.94, 95% CI 1.41 to 6.14).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Inhaled corticosteroid use in relation to asthma mortality</HEADING>
<P>We were able to obtain unpublished data from GSK in relation to asthma mortality and the use of corticosteroids at baseline for each of the asthma-related deaths in <LINK REF="STD-SNS-1993" TYPE="STUDY">SNS 1993</LINK>. This is shown together with similar published data from <LINK REF="STD-SMART-2006" TYPE="STUDY">SMART 2006</LINK> in <LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>. In the subgroup of patients not taking inhaled corticosteroids at baseline the combined increase in asthma mortality is statistically significant (Peto OR 6.43, 95% CI 2.13 to 19.42). This indicates a clear increase in risk of asthma death when inhaled corticosteroids were not used when the two studies are considered together.</P>
<P>For the subgroup taking inhaled corticosteroids at baseline, the increase in asthma mortality is smaller and not statistically significant (Peto OR 1.49, 95% CI 0.54 to 4.11). The<SUP> </SUP>test for interaction between inhaled corticosteroid use and asthma related deaths shows a relative OR of 0.23 (95% CI 0.05 to 1.04) and the CI includes the possibility of a 95% relative reduction in the risk of asthma death, but also a 4% relative increase in those on baseline inhaled corticosteroids. Moreover it should be pointed out that the CI for those on inhaled corticosteroids at baseline includes the overall three-fold increase in mortality, so this finding cannot be interpreted as meaning that corticosteroids abolish any increased risk of asthma mortality from regular salmeterol.</P>

As no details were provided in the report of <LINK REF="STD-SMART-2006" TYPE="STUDY">SMART 2006</LINK> in relation to the number of patients taking oral corticosteroids at baseline, we assumed that the proportion is very small in comparison to those on inhaled corticosteroids.

Moreover it is very difficult in practice to know which deaths should be included in this category. The only child who died in all the identified studies was in <LINK REF="STD-Lenney-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Lenney 1995a</LINK>; the death is listed both under asthma attack and circulatory arrest. The pooled odds ratio was not statistically significant and small numbers of deaths and classification problems mean that there is wide uncertainty around the finding, see <LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Asthma-related SAEs</HEADING>
<P>The reporting of disease-specific SAEs on the GSK controlled trial register does not indicate how many patients suffered from more than one event. This represents a risk of over-counting the number of patients suffering an asthma-related SAE in the large studies, so we only included data for this outcome from studies which show individual events on the controlled-trial web reports. The events in these studies are shown in <LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>. When salmeterol is compared to placebo the increase in asthma-related SAEs is significant using Peto OR 1.59 (95% CI 1.05 to 2.41) but is not statistically significant using Mantel-Haenszel random-effects OR 1.48 (95% CI 0.97 to 2.27). In comparison with salbutamol the decrease in asthma-related SAEs is not statistically significant (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.81).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Within study subgroup analyses</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Urzo-2001" TYPE="STUDY">D'Urzo 2001</LINK> reported the number of patients with severe asthma exacerbations (defined as hospitalisation, emergency department visit or use of oral prednisolone) in patients treated in primary care. They subgrouped according to the reported inhaled or oral corticosteroid consumption, and we found significant heterogeneity between subgroups. The direction of effect in the moderate dose subgroup was in favour of salmeterol (Peto OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.08). However in participants on oral corticosteroids or an inhaled daily dose of more than 1000 µg, the direction of effect reversed in favour of placebo (OR 1.75, 95% CI 0.99 to 3.11; <LINK REF="CMP-001.13" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.13</LINK>). The Chi<SUP>2 </SUP>test for differences among the three subgroups returned P = 0.04, in keeping with the results of logistic regression analysis reported in the paper (P = 0.038). Very similar results were seen when the patients were stratified according to predicted peak flow (<LINK REF="CMP-001.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.14</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-SMART-2006" TYPE="STUDY">SMART 2006</LINK> reported on numerous post-hoc subgroups in relation to the primary outcome of the study (respiratory related deaths or life threatening events). The main results are shown in <LINK REF="CMP-001.15" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.15</LINK> to <LINK REF="CMP-001.21" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.21</LINK>. Of these, the only comparison that had a statistically significant test for interaction was the post hoc comparison between African Americans and Causcasians (test for subgroup differences: Chi² = 5.50, df = 1 (P = 0.02); <LINK REF="CMP-001.16" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.16</LINK>). Whilst it may be tempting to interpret the individual subgroup results according to their statistical significance (such as for the subgroup with PEF less than 60% predicted as shown in <LINK REF="CMP-001.20" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.20</LINK>), this approach is not the correct way to test for interaction between PEF and salmeterol (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 2003</LINK>); the test for interaction between subgroups does not indicate a significant difference between those with high and low % predicted PEF (test for subgroup differences: Chi² = 1.97, df = 1 (P = 0.16)).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-10-25 17:41:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>The difference in the risk of all-cause mortality with regular salmeterol when compared with placebo does not reach statistical significance. Non-fatal SAEs were significantly increased in comparison with placebo. These events were uncommon, such that in the largest study (<LINK REF="STD-SMART-2006" TYPE="STUDY">SMART 2006</LINK>) 3.6% of the placebo group suffered a SAE over 28 weeks; in comparison in the salmeterol arm of the trial 4.0% reported a SAE. One additional SAE was found to occur for every 188 people treated with regular salmeterol over 28 weeks, and the play of chance is compatible with one extra event for every 100 to nearly 3000 given regular salmeterol. This increase is largely derived from the studies in adults, and as the number of children studied is small there are insufficient data to ascertain how the effect in children compares to that found in adults.</P>
<P>We found no significant differences for all-cause mortality or non-fatal SAEs in trials comparing regular salmeterol with salbutamol.</P>
<P>Disease-specific mortality was not easy to assess, but we found no significant differences in cardiovascular deaths. In contrast there was a consistent increase is asthma-related mortality in both <LINK REF="STD-SMART-2006" TYPE="STUDY">SMART 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-SNS-1993" TYPE="STUDY">SNS 1993</LINK>. The four-fold increase in <LINK REF="STD-SMART-2006" TYPE="STUDY">SMART 2006</LINK> was statistically significant whilst the three-fold increase in <LINK REF="STD-SNS-1993" TYPE="STUDY">SNS 1993</LINK> was not. The absolute increase in asthma-related mortality in <LINK REF="STD-SMART-2006" TYPE="STUDY">SMART 2006</LINK> was very similar to the size of the absolute increase in all-cause mortality; the increase represents eight extra asthma deaths for every 10,000 patients treated for six months.</P>
<P>The combined results of <LINK REF="STD-SMART-2006" TYPE="STUDY">SMART 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-SNS-1993" TYPE="STUDY">SNS 1993</LINK> showed a significant in increase asthma mortality. This increase was most apparent in patients who did not take inhaled corticosteroids at baseline, but in patients who took inhaled corticosteroids at baseline the wide confidence interval failed to rule out the possibility of a three fold increase in asthma mortality.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-10-25 17:41:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>Although a very large number of adults given salmeterol were included in these studies, the rarity of mortality and SAEs means that there is still considerable uncertainty in relation to the size of the effects being investigated. This is a particular problem in children, where the numbers are smaller. There is insufficient evidence to be sure how the results in adults compare with those in children. It has proved difficult for the sponsor of these studies (GSK) to confirm data for some of the studies we identified, since they do not appear on their web-based trial results register, and no data pertaining to adverse events were available for six of the included studies. The missing data are unlikely to alter the direction of the effects seen in this review, but could alter the point estimates and confidence intervals.</P>
<P>It is interesting to note that if this review had relied upon the information on SAEs published in papers, the results would have looked quite different (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.23" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.23</LINK>). The published information does not indicate any significant increase in SAEs when regular salmeterol is compared to placebo in the 2117 patients included in this small subset of the included studies (Peto OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.95). If the analysis had been confined to SAEs that were thought to be drug related, the small number of events would not have provided sufficient information to draw any conclusions (<LINK REF="CMP-001.28" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.28</LINK>).</P>
<P>Similar differences can be seen between published (<LINK REF="CMP-001.26" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.26</LINK>) and complete data for adverse events (<LINK REF="CMP-001.25" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.25</LINK>). The published drug related adverse events are shown in <LINK REF="CMP-001.27" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.27</LINK>.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2011-10-25 17:41:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>All of the included studies were double blind, and are likely to have had adequate allocation concealment. However, only the two large surveillance studies had independent assessment of the cause of death. This should not be a threat to all-cause mortality and all-cause SAEs (primary outcomes). In contrast the ascertainment of disease-specific outcomes may have been subject to bias, and the data were difficult to use as they were presented as numbers of events rather than number of patients who suffered an event.</P>
<P>Almost all of the studies included in this review were sponsored or supported by GSK, and the lack of published data from some of the studies is of concern.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2011-10-25 17:41:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>The findings of this review are in agreement with the findings of <LINK REF="REF-Salpeter-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salpeter 2006</LINK>, who reviewed the trial evidence in relation to asthma exacerbations leading to hospital admissions, life-threatening events or death. However the Salpeter review combined studies on salmeterol and formoterol, and only considered placebo controlled studies. Our findings also match those presented to the FDA summarising the results of salmeterol trials carried out in the USA (<LINK REF="STD-FDA-GSK-USA-Studies" TYPE="STUDY">FDA GSK USA Studies</LINK>). The submission reported: "....analysis shows similar results for hospitalizations due to asthma for subjects receiving ICS compared with salmeterol plus ICS. For subjects not receiving concomitant ICS, there were a higher number of events in salmeterol recipients compared with placebo." The same submission also found a higher incidence of respiratory related SAEs in the salmeterol group compared to placebo and this is shown alongside our results in <LINK REF="CMP-001.29" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.29</LINK>.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">The impact of inhaled corticosteroids on adverse events in relation to long-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists</HEADING>
<P>We compared data provided by GSK in relation to the inhaled corticosteroid status of those patients who died from asthma in <LINK REF="STD-SNS-1993" TYPE="STUDY">SNS 1993</LINK> to the findings of <LINK REF="STD-SMART-2006" TYPE="STUDY">SMART 2006</LINK>. Both studies showed a similar pattern, in that the main increase in asthma-related mortality occurred in the subgroup of patients who were not on corticosteroids when they were recruited to the study Figure 12.</P>
<P>It is not possible to draw firm conclusions about the risks of salmeterol when used in conjunction with inhaled corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Martinez-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martinez 2006</LINK>), as the patients in this review were not randomised to inhaled corticosteroid treatment and the test for interaction between the use of inhaled corticosteroids and salmeterol was not significant. We cannot therefore conclude that inhaled corticosteroids abolish the increased risk of asthma mortality in patients taking salmeterol, nor can we assume that mortality rates might not be even lower if inhaled corticosteroids were taken alone. Moreover, the findings of <LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Urzo-2001" TYPE="STUDY">D'Urzo 2001</LINK> do not show consistency in the risk of severe asthma exacerbations with salmeterol and inhaled corticosteroids in primary care; beneficial effects of regular salmeterol with moderate doses of inhaled corticosteroids contrast with increased exacerbations in patients on high doses or maintenance oral corticosteroids. Whilst the interactions between inhaled corticosteroids and beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists are complex, corticosteroids do not appear to prevent the development of tolerance during chronic beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Hancox-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hancox 2006b</LINK>).</P>
<P>The results of <LINK REF="STD-Lazarus-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lazarus 2001</LINK> provide support for the fact that salmeterol cannot be used to replace inhaled corticosteroids, because although there were no hospitalisations or deaths in the study, replacing triamcinolone with salmeterol did not maintain asthma control; there was a significant increase in exacerbations on salmeterol or placebo in comparison to triamcinolone. Compliance with inhaled corticosteroids is often poor as demonstrated in <LINK REF="REF-Sovani-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sovani 2008</LINK>, and there is a risk that patients who are using salmeterol and an inhaled steroid in separate inhalers may default on the latter without immediate deterioration in their asthma symptoms.</P>
<P>For patients whose asthma is not well-controlled on moderate doses of inhaled corticosteroids, additional salmeterol can give symptomatic benefit, but this may be at the expense of an increased risk of SAEs and asthma-related mortality, risks which are not clearly abolished by inhaled corticosteroids. Therefore, the risks as well as the benefits of regular salmeterol should be discussed with patients; the drug should be discontinued if no symptomatic benefit is achieved and the manufacturers' advice not to increase the dose of salmeterol during exacerbations should be made clear. Salmeterol should not be used as a substitute for inhaled corticosteroids, and adherence with inhaled steroids should be kept under review if separate inhalers are used. Combining the medications in a single inhaler prevents patients taking salmeterol alone. Observational data from <LINK REF="REF-Delea-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delea 2008</LINK> indicated use of salmeterol and fluticasone in a single inhaler resulted in higher use of inhaled corticosteroids in comparison to patients prescribed two separate inhalers.</P>

<P>In comparison with placebo, we have found an increased risk of serious adverse events with regular salmeterol. There is also a clear increase in risk of asthma-related mortality in patients not using inhaled corticosteroids in the two large surveillance studies. Although the increase in asthma-related mortality was smaller in patients taking inhaled corticosteroids at baseline, the CI is wide, so it cannot be concluded that inhaled corticosteroids abolish the risks of regular salmeterol. The adverse effects of regular salmeterol in children remain uncertain due to the small number of children studied.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-10-25 17:41:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>Data on SAEs should be more fully reported in medical journals. In view of the increasing use of salmeterol in combination with inhaled corticosteroids, further studies investigating the impact of salmeterol alone on SAEs in adults may not be feasible, but studies using a combination of salmeterol and inhaled steroids should collect and fully report data on fatal and non-fatal SAEs. The evidence base for assessing the risks and benefits of salmeterol in children is currently weak.</P>

<APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2011-10-25 17:44:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>Beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists are thought to cause bronchodilation primarily through binding beta<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenoceptors on airways smooth muscle (ASM), with subsequent activation of both membrane-bound potassium channels and a signalling cascade involving enzyme activation and changes in intracellular calcium levels following a rise in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 1993</LINK>).  However, beta<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenoceptors are also expressed on a wide range of cell types where beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists may have a clinically significant effect including airway epithelium (<LINK REF="REF-Morrison-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrison 1993</LINK>), mast cells, post capillary venules, sensory and cholinergic nerves and dendritic cells (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 2006</LINK>).  Beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists will also cross-react to some extent with other beta-adrenoceptors including beta<SUB>1</SUB>-adrenoceptors on the heart. </P>
<P>The <I>in vivo </I>effect of any beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist will depend on a number of factors relating to both the drug and the patient. The degree to which a drug binds to one receptor over another is known as <I>selectivity, </I>which can be defined as absolute binding ratios to different receptors <I>in vitro</I>, whilst <I>functional selectivity</I> is measured from downstream effects of drugs in different tissue types <I>in vitro </I>or <I>in vivo.  </I>All of the beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists described thus far are more beta<SUB>2</SUB> selective than their predecessor isoprenaline <I>in vitro</I>. However, because attempts to differentiate selectivity between the newer agents are confounded by so many factors, it is difficult to draw conclusions about <I>in vitro </I>selectivity studies and probably best to concentrate on specific adverse side-effects in human subjects at doses which cause the same degree of bronchoconstriction. The <I>potency</I> of a drug refers to the concentration that achieves half the maximal receptor activation of which that drug is capable but it is not very important clinically as for each drug, manufacturers will alter the dose to try to achieve a therapeutic ratio of desired to undesired effects. In contrast <I>efficacy</I> refers to the ability of a drug to activate its receptor independent of drug concentration. Drugs that fully activate a receptor are known as full agonists and those that partially activate a receptor are known as partial agonists. Efficacy also is very much dependent on the system in which it is being tested and is affected by factors including the number of receptors available and the presence of other agonists and antagonists. Therefore, whilst salmeterol acts as a partial agonist <I>in vitro</I>,<I> </I>it causes a similar degree of bronchodilation to the strong agonist formoterol in stable asthmatic patients (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Noord-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Noord 1996</LINK>), presumably because there are an abundance of well-coupled beta<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenoceptors available with few downstream antagonising signals.  In contrast, with repetitive dosing formoterol is significantly better than salmeterol at preventing methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction (<LINK REF="REF-Palmqvist-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palmqvist 1999</LINK>). These differences have led to attempts to define the 'intrinsic efficacy' of a drug independent of tissue conditions (<LINK REF="REF-Hanania-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanania 2002</LINK>), as shown in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. The clinical significance of intrinsic efficacy remains unclear.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Direct toxicity</HEADING>
<P>This hypothesis states that direct adverse effects of beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists are responsible for an associated increase in mortality and most research in the area has concentrated on effects detrimental to the heart. Whilst it is often assumed that cardiac side-effects of beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists are due to cross-reactivity with beta<SUB>1</SUB>-adrenoceptors (i.e. poor selectivity), it is worth noting that human myocardium also contains an abundance of beta<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenoceptors capable of triggering positive chronotropic and inotropic responses (<LINK REF="REF-Lipworth-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipworth 1992</LINK>). Indeed, there is good evidence that cardiovascular side effects of isoprenaline and other beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists including salbutamol are mediated predominantly via cardiac beta<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenoceptors thus making the concept of <I>in vitro </I>selectivity less relevant (<LINK REF="REF-Arnold-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arnold 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hall-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 1989</LINK>). Generalised beta<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenoceptor activation can also cause hypokalaemia and it has been proposed that, through these and other actions beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists may predispose to life-threatening dysrhythmias or cause other adverse cardiac effects (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1983</LINK>).</P>
<P>During the 1960s epidemic, most deaths occurred in patients with severe asthma and it was originally assumed that asthma and its sequelae, including hypoxia, were the primary cause of death. However, mucus plugging and hypoxia does not preclude a cardiac event as the final cause of death, and one might expect those with severe asthma to take more doses of a prescribed inhaler. As noted by Speizer and Doll, most deaths in the 1960s were in the 10-19 age group and &#8220;at these ages children have begun to act independently and may be particularly prone to misuse a self-administered form of treatment&#8221; (<LINK REF="REF-Speizer-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Speizer 1968</LINK>).  If toxicity were related to increasing doses of beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists one might expect most deaths to occur in hospital where high doses are typically used and this was not the case. One possible explanation for this anomaly was provided by animal experiments in which large doses of isoprenaline caused little ill effect in anaesthetised dogs with normal arterial oxygenation whereas much smaller doses caused fatal cardiac depression and asystole (although no obvious dysrhythmia) when hypoxic (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McDevitt-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDevitt 1974</LINK>). It has been hypothesised therefore that such events would be less likely in hospital where supplemental oxygen is routinely given. The clinical relevance of these studies remains unclear although there is some evidence of a synergistic effect between hypoxia and salbutamol use in asthmatic patients in reducing total peripheral vascular resistance (<LINK REF="REF-Burggraaf-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burggraaf 2001</LINK>) &#8211; another beta<SUB>2</SUB> mediated effect which could be detrimental to the heart during an acute asthma attack through a reduction in diastolic blood pressure. Other potential mechanisms of isoprenaline toxicity include a potential increase in mucous plugging and worsening of ventilation perfusion mismatch despite bronchodilation (<LINK REF="REF-Pearce-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pearce 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>Further concerns about a possible toxic effect of beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists were raised during the New Zealand epidemic in the 1970s. In 1981 Wilson et al who first reported the epidemic reviewed 22 fatal cases of asthma and noted &#8220;In 16 patients death was seen to be sudden and unexpected. Although all were experiencing respiratory distress, most were not cyanosed and the precipitate nature of their death suggested a cardiac event, such as an arrest, inappropriate to the severity of their respiratory problem&#8221; (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 1981</LINK>). In humans, fenoterol causes significantly greater chronotropic, inotropic and electrocardiographic side effects than salbutamol in asthmatic patients (<LINK REF="REF-Wong-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wong 1990</LINK>). Interestingly, across the same parameters fenoterol also causes more side-effects than isoprenaline (<LINK REF="REF-Burgess-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burgess 1991</LINK>). </P>
<P>In patients with mild asthma and without a bronchoconstrictor challenge, salmeterol and salbutamol cause a similar degree of near maximal bronchodilation at low doses (<LINK REF="REF-Bennett-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 1994</LINK>). However, whilst as a one off dose salbutamol is typically used at 2 to 4 times the concentration of salmeterol, the dose equivalences for salmeterol versus salbutamol in increasing heart rate and decreasing potassium concentration and diastolic blood pressure were 17.7, 7.8 and 7.6 respectively (i.e. salmeterol had a greater effect across all parameters).  Given the lower intrinsic efficacy of salmeterol (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>), these results highlight the importance of <I>in vivo </I>factors; one possible explanation for the difference is the increased lipophilicity of salmeterol compared to salbutamol contributing to higher systemic absorption (<LINK REF="REF-Bennett-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 1994</LINK>).    </P>
<P>When comparing increasing actuations of standard doses of formoterol and salmeterol inhalers in stable asthmatic patients, relatively similar cardiovascular effects are seen at lower doses (<LINK REF="REF-Guhan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guhan 2000</LINK>). However, at the highest doses (above those recommended by the manufacturers) there were trends towards an increase in systolic blood pressure with formoterol; in comparison there was a trend towards a decrease in diastolic blood pressure and an increase in QTc interval with salmeterol although no statistical analysis of the difference was performed. In contrast in asthmatic patients with methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction there was no significant difference between salmeterol and formoterol in causing increased heart rate and QTc interval although formoterol caused significantly greater bronchodilation and hypokalaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Palmqvist-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palmqvist 1999</LINK>). Whilst there is good evidence of cardiovascular and metabolic side-effects with increasing doses of beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists, it is a little difficult to envisage serious adverse effects of this nature when using LABAs at manufacturer-recommended preventative doses. However, it is possible that some patients choose to use repeated doses of LABAs during exacerbations. </P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Tolerance</HEADING>
<P>In this setting, the term <I>tolerance </I>refers to an impaired response to beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists in patients who have been using regular beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist treatment previously (<LINK REF="REF-Haney-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haney 2006</LINK>). Tolerance is likely to result from a combination of reduced receptor numbers secondary to receptor internalisation and reduced production and also uncoupling of receptors to downstream signalling pathways following repeated activation (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 1995</LINK>). This phenomenon is likely to explain the beneficial reduction in systemic side effects seen with regular use of beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists including salbutamol after 1 to 2 weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Lipworth-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipworth 1989</LINK>). However, the same effect on beta<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenoceptors in the lung might be expected to produce a diminished response to the bronchodilating activity of beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists following regular use. In patients with stable asthma, whilst there is some evidence of tolerance to both salbutamol (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 1977</LINK>) and terbutaline (<LINK REF="REF-Weber-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weber 1982</LINK>) other studies have been less conclusive (<LINK REF="REF-Harvey-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harvey 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lipworth-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipworth 1989</LINK>). However, evidence of tolerance to short and long-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists in both protecting against and reducing bronchoconstriction is much stronger in the setting of an acute bronchoconstrictor challenge with chemical, allergen and 'natural' stimuli (<LINK REF="REF-Haney-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haney 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lipworth-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipworth 1997</LINK>). </P>
<P>Studies comparing salmeterol and formoterol have shown that both cause tolerance compared to placebo but there was no significant difference between the drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Van-der-Woude-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van der Woude 2001</LINK>). There also appears to be little difference in the tolerance induced by regular formoterol and regular salbutamol treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Hancox-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hancox 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jones-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2001</LINK>). To the authors' knowledge no studies have looked specifically at the degree of tolerance caused by isoprenaline and fenoterol in the setting of acute bronchoconstriction. Tolerance to bronchodilation has been shown to clearly occur with addition of inhaled corticosteroids to salmeterol and formoterol (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2003</LINK>) and terbutaline (<LINK REF="REF-Yates-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yates 1996</LINK>). There is conflicting evidence as to whether high dose steroids can reverse tolerance in the acute setting (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lipworth-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipworth 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>At first glance the toxicity and tolerance hypotheses might appear incompatible as systemic and cardiovascular tolerance ought to protect against toxicity in the acute setting and there is good evidence that such tolerance occurs in stable asthmatic patients (<LINK REF="REF-Lipworth-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipworth 1989</LINK>). However, whilst this study showed that changes in heart rate and potassium levels were blunted by previous beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist use, they were not abolished; furthermore, at the doses studied these side effects appear to follow an exponential pattern (<LINK REF="REF-Lipworth-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipworth 1989</LINK>). In contrast, in the presence of bronchoconstrictor stimuli the bronchodilator response to beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists follows a flatter curve (<LINK REF="REF-Hancox-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hancox 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wong-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wong 1990</LINK>) and as previously discussed this curve is shifted downwards by previous beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist exposure (<LINK REF="REF-Hancox-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hancox 1999</LINK>). Thus, it is theoretically possible that in the setting of an acute asthmatic attack and strong bronchoconstricting stimuli, bronchodilator tolerance could lead to repetitive beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist use and ultimately more systemic side effects than would otherwise have occurred. Of course, other sequelae of inadequate bronchodilation including airway obstruction will be detrimental in this setting.</P>
<P>Whilst the tolerance hypothesis is often cited as contributing towards the asthma mortality epidemics it is difficult to argue that reduced efficacy of a drug can cause increased mortality relative to a time when that drug was not used at all. However, tolerance to the bronchodilating effect of endogenous circulating adrenaline is theoretically possible and there is also evidence of rebound bronchoconstriction when stopping fenoterol (<LINK REF="REF-Sears-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sears 1990</LINK>), which may be detrimental. Furthermore, it appears that regular salbutamol treatment can actually increase airway responsiveness to allergen (<LINK REF="REF-Cockcroft-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cockcroft 1993</LINK>), a potentially important effect that could form a variant of the toxicity hypothesis. Differences between beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists in this regard are unclear, but the combination of rebound hyperresponsiveness and tolerance of the bronchodilator effect with regular beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist exposure has been recently advocated as a possible mechanism to explain the association between beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists and asthma mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Hancox-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hancox 2006a</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Other explanations</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Confounding by severity</HEADING>
<P>Historically, this hypothesis has been used extensively to try to explain the association between mortality and the use of fenoterol during the 1970s New Zealand epidemic and is still quoted today (<LINK REF="REF-Pearce-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pearce 2007</LINK>). The hypothesis essentially relies on the supposition that patients with more severe asthma are more likely to take either higher doses of beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists or a particular beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist (such as fenoterol) thereby explaining the association. This hypothesis was carefully ruled out in the three case-control studies by comparing the association between fenoterol and mortality in patients with varying severity of disease (<LINK REF="REF-Crane-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crane 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grainger-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grainger 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pearce-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pearce 1990</LINK>). Furthermore, the hypothesis cannot explain the overall increase in mortality in the 1960s and 1970s, nor can it explain any significant increase in mortality (whether taking inhaled steroids or not) from randomised controlled trial data.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">The delay hypothesis</HEADING>
<P>This hypothesis accepts that beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists or a particular beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist cause an increased risk of mortality but indirectly by causing patients to delay before getting medical help and further treatments including high dose steroids and oxygen. There is evidence that both salmeterol and formoterol can reduce awareness of worsening underlying inflammation (<LINK REF="REF-Bijl_x002d_Hofland-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bijl-Hofland 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McIvor-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">McIvor 1998</LINK>). It is difficult to rule out the delay hypothesis in either explaining or contributing towards both the asthma mortality epidemics and an association with regular use of LABAs. There is evidence that beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists with higher intrinsic efficacy are more effective at relieving bronchoconstriction in the acute setting and could paradoxically cause patients to delay seeking medical help for longer (<LINK REF="REF-Hanania-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanania 2007</LINK>). For the delay hypothesis to explain the increase in mortality during the 1960s and 1970s, one has to imply that hospital treatment of asthma when mortality rates were low during the earlier years of the 20<SUP>th</SUP> century was effective. It is difficult to say exactly how effective such treatment is likely to have been.   </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Reduced corticosteroid treatment</HEADING>
<P>A slight but significant variation of the delay hypothesis suggests that patients who have separate beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists and corticosteroid inhalers may choose to take less corticosteroid because of better symptom control from the inhaled beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists and it is reduced corticosteroid treatment that contributes to a rise in mortality. It is rather difficult to see how this hypothesis explains the epidemics of asthma deaths in the 1960s and 1970s relative to the 1920s and 30s (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>), given that corticosteroids were not used for the treatment of asthma in the earlier decades. If this hypothesis were to explain increased mortality from more recent randomised controlled trial data, one would not expect to see an increase in mortality in those taking LABAs alone. </P>
