<P>It is not clear whether altering maternal posture or applying external pressure to the mother's pelvis before birth helps the baby's shoulders pass through the birth canal.</P>
<P>Various manoeuvres are used to assist the passage of the baby through the birth canal by manipulating the fetal shoulders and increasing the functional size of the pelvis. These manoeuvres can also be used before the baby's head appears to prevent the fetal shoulders becoming trapped in the maternal pelvis (shoulder dystocia). In this review, the two studies involving 25 women were not large enough to show if manoeuvres such as manipulating the mother's pelvis can prevent instances of shoulder dystocia. Rates of birth injury did not appear to be affected by carrying out the manoeuvres early. Neither study addressed important maternal outcomes such as maternal injury, psychological outcomes and satisfaction with birth. Because shoulder dystocia is a rare occurrence, more studies involving larger groups of women are required to properly assess the benefits and adverse outcomes associated with such interventions.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-07-03 13:38:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two trials were included; one comparing the McRobert's manoeuvre and suprapubic pressure with no prophylactic manoeuvres in 185 women likely to give birth to a large baby and one trial comparing the use of the McRobert's manoeuvre versus lithotomy positioning in 40 women. We decided not to pool the results of the two trials. One study reported 15 cases of shoulder dystocia in the therapeutic (control) group compared to five in the prophylactic group (risk ratio (RR) 0.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17 to 1.14) and the other study reported one episode of shoulder dystocia in both prophylactic and lithotomy groups. In the first study, there were significantly more caesarean sections in the prophylactic group and when these were included in the results, significantly fewer instances of shoulder dystocia were seen in the prophylactic group (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.86). In this study, 13 women in the control group required therapeutic manoeuvres after delivery of the fetal head compared to three in the treatment group (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.02).</P>
<P>One study reported no birth injuries or low Apgar scores recorded. In the other study, one infant in the control group had a brachial plexus injury (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.02 to 10.61), and one infant had a five-minute Apgar score less than seven (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.02 to 10.61).</P>

<P>There are no clear findings to support or refute the use of prophylactic manoeuvres to prevent shoulder dystocia, although one study showed an increased rate of caesareans in the prophylactic group.

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Shoulder dystocia and associated risk factors</HEADING>
<P>Shoulder dystocia is an obstetric emergency with a potentially catastrophic outcome. Following the birth of the head, delivery of the shoulders and body is complicated by the impaction of the fetal shoulders in the maternal pelvis. Typically, the term is used to describe births in which manoeuvres other than gentle downward traction are required to complete the delivery of the anterior shoulder. The overall incidence of shoulder dystocia varies based on fetal weight, occurring in 0.6% to 1.4% of births where the infant weighed between 2500 g to 4000 g. In infants with a birthweight of 4000 g to 4500 g the rate of shoulder dystocia increases to 5% to 9% (<LINK REF="REF-Baxley-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baxley 2004</LINK>). Incidence rates also vary depending on the criteria used for diagnosis.</P>
<P>Shoulder dystocia is associated with a high risk of physical and psychological complications for the mother and neonate. Common maternal complications include uterine rupture, postpartum haemorrhage (11%) and soft tissue damage to the cervix and vagina (3.8%) (<LINK REF="REF-Baxley-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baxley 2004</LINK>). Psychologically, mothers may experience postnatal depression, post-traumatic stress syndrome and may have problems with maternal-infant interaction (<LINK REF="REF-Coates-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coates 2004</LINK>). Immediate fetal consequences include asphyxia and meconium aspiration. Following delivery, brachial plexus injuries are most commonly encountered occurring in 4% to 15% of infants (<LINK REF="REF-Baxley-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baxley 2004</LINK>). The brachial plexus is a major nerve network supplying the upper limb. It begins in the neck, extends into the axilla and can be injured by excessive stretching of the neck during birth. A large proportion of brachial plexus injuries resolve within six to 12 months. Cases in which complete severance of nerve roots has occurred may require several stages of surgery to restore function, but less than 10% result in permanent injury. Bony injuries involving the clavicle and, less often, the humerus are also common.<BR/>
<BR/>Although attempts to correctly predict cases of shoulder dystocia have had limited success, several risk factors are associated with an increased rate of its occurrence. Higher birthweight is the common denominator connecting most current reports on maternal and fetal risk factors for shoulder dystocia. The related maternal risk factors include diabetes, obesity and multiparity.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Keller-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keller 1991</LINK> identified shoulder dystocia in 7% of pregnancies complicated by gestational diabetes. It is important to note that diabetic women diagnosed with a macrosomic infant are more likely to experience a difficult vaginal delivery (<LINK REF="REF-Coustan-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coustan 1996</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-McFarland-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">McFarland 1998</LINK> reported that macrosomic infants of diabetic mothers had larger shoulders and a decreased head-to-shoulder ratio than non-diabetic control infants of similar birthweight and length. These differences in anthropomorphic characteristics may explain the propensity for shoulder dystocia amongst this population.</P>
<P>In a study of pregnancy complications and adverse perinatal outcomes associated with obesity, <LINK REF="REF-Cedergren-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cedergren 2004</LINK> found that shoulder dystocia occurred three times more often in overweight women than in those of normal weight. <LINK REF="REF-Orskou-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orskou 2003</LINK> found that women with parity greater than two had an increased risk of giving birth to infants weighing more than 4000 g (macrosomic) and hence were more likely to have adverse outcomes during birth including shoulder dystocia. There is evidence that macrosomia associated with continued fetal growth in post-term pregnancies poses a risk for shoulder dystocia (<LINK REF="REF-Baskett-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baskett 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>A prior birth complicated by shoulder dystocia has been identified as a risk factor in some studies (<LINK REF="REF-Baskett-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baskett 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ginsberg-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ginsberg 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1994</LINK>). For instance, <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1994</LINK> reported recurrent shoulder dystocia in five out of 42 women (12%) who had previously had births complicated by shoulder dystocia. However, <LINK REF="REF-Baskett-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baskett 1995</LINK> reported a smaller recurrence rate of only 1% to 2%. In a retrospective study of 602 births complicated by shoulder dystocia, <LINK REF="REF-Ginsberg-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ginsberg 2001</LINK> reported a recurrence rate of 16.7%. The wide variation in recurrence rates reported in these studies may be attributed to varied population demographics of the sample and variations in the clinical definition of shoulder dystocia leading to under- or over-reporting of cases. Nevertheless, these studies do show that women with a history of shoulder dystocia are at a higher risk of a subsequent dystocia than the general population.</P>
<P>Using the knowledge of these risk factors, efforts, such as caesarean and induction of labour, have been made to prevent shoulder dystocia in women at risk. Since the 1970s, certain pregnancy risk factors have been used to identify women in whom a caesarean could potentially avoid shoulder dystocia. According to a study of the cost-effectiveness of prophylactic caesarean for fetal macrosomia by Rouse and Owen (<LINK REF="REF-Rouse-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rouse 1999</LINK>), it would require over 100 caesareans to prevent a single permanent brachial plexus injury. Reflecting this view, a review of the literature by <I>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists</I> inferred that performing caesareans in all women suspected of carrying a macrosomic fetus is not appropriate. The same review proposed that planned caesarean delivery may be reasonable for a non-diabetic woman with an estimated fetal weight exceeding 5000 g or a diabetic woman whose fetus weighs over 4500 g. Some authors, however, continue to support caesarean in all cases of fetal macrosomia diagnosed by ultrasound (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Leary-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Leary 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>The ability to detect macrosomic fetuses accurately using clinical estimation and ultrasound has been the topic of several studies (<LINK REF="REF-Delpapa-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delpapa 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Deter-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deter 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Levine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levine 1992</LINK>). A study by <LINK REF="REF-Gonen-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gonen 1996</LINK> found that the predictive value of clinical estimation of fetal weight alone may be slightly higher than when combined with ultrasonography. The second part of this study determined the effect of prenatal diagnosis of macrosomia on the incidence of shoulder dystocia and birth trauma and hence the ability to prevent such occurrences. Although fetal macrosomia is an obvious predisposing factor for a birth complicated by shoulder dystocia, most cases of shoulder dystocia and birth trauma occur in non-macrosomic infants (<LINK REF="REF-Geary-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geary 1995</LINK>). In support of this, the study concluded that the prenatal diagnosis of fetal macrosomia had little effect on the predictability and, consequently, the preventability of shoulder dystocia.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Prevention and management of shoulder dystocia</HEADING>
<P>A recent study assessing the effects of glycaemic control on pregnancy outcomes in women with gestational diabetes demonstrated that treatment of gestational diabetes reduces serious perinatal morbidity, including the risk of shoulder dystocia (<LINK REF="REF-Crowther-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowther 2005</LINK>). This may be attributed to the reduced incidence of fetal macrosomia reported amongst women in the treatment group. <LINK REF="REF-Salim-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salim 2004</LINK> conducted a prospective study to determine whether differences in anthropometric measurements found in infants from diabetic mothers still persisted with strict glycaemic control. The results showed that infants of mothers with well-controlled gestational diabetes had anthropomorphic characteristics similar to infants of non-diabetic mothers. This may also contribute to the reduced incidence of shoulder dystocia seen in mothers with gestational diabetes subject to strict glycaemic control.</P>
<P>Induction of labour has been trialled as a preventative measure in women identified as having an increased risk of shoulder dystocia (<LINK REF="REF-Gonen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gonen 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjos-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjos 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tey-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tey 1995</LINK>). Two Cochrane reviews have assessed the role of induction of labour in preventing pregnancy complications including shoulder dystocia; <LINK REF="REF-Irion-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irion 1998</LINK> in cases of suspected fetal macrosomia and <LINK REF="REF-Boulvain-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boulvain 2001</LINK> in diabetic pregnant women. Both reviews concluded that there was insufficient evidence regarding the effect of inducing labour on preventing shoulder dystocia.</P>
<P>With the exception of the recent evidence regarding the benefits of strict glycaemic control in preventing shoulder dystocia, the efficacy of prophylactic treatment in women at risk prior to the onset of labour remains controversial. The difficulty in correctly predicting women at risk of shoulder dystocia has contributed to this controversy. Due to this unpredictability, health practitioners caring for women in labour must be educated in the management of shoulder dystocia to be able to provide appropriate care once it has occurred.</P>
<P>A key management strategy is the application of various manoeuvres. <I>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists</I> has developed a shoulder dystocia drill to help better organise the emergency management of an impacted shoulder (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2000</LINK>). The drill is a set of manoeuvres performed sequentially as needed to complete vaginal birth. The manoeuvres are arranged from the simple, which require only movement of the mother, to the complex, requiring manipulation of the fetus.</P>
<P>Manoeuvres used late in the management of shoulder dystocia are complex, requiring direct manipulation of the fetus. These include the Woods manoeuvre, the Rubin manoeuvre, cleidotomy and the Zavanelli manoeuvre. The Woods corkscrew manoeuvre and the Rubin manoeuvre involve manual rotation and adduction of the fetal shoulders. Cleidotomy involves deliberate fracture of the clavicle to accomplish delivery but it is usually a difficult procedure, especially in a large, mature fetus. The Zavanelli manoeuvre remains the last resort in the management of shoulder dystocia and involves replacing the fetal head into the maternal pelvis followed by a caesarean section.</P>
<P>Manoeuvres used in the early management of shoulder dystocia aim to relieve the dystocia by manipulating the fetal shoulders and increasing the functional size of the maternal pelvis. The pelvis is a rigid structure consisting of four bones united by cartilaginous joints and ligaments and forms the walls of the birth canal. In pregnancy, the joints and ligaments undergo temporary changes under the influence of the hormones relaxin, progesterone and oestrogen allowing some movement of the joints to facilitate birth (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1997</LINK>). Therefore, by manoeuvring the mother and placing external pressure on the pelvis it is possible to take advantage of this laxity and aid the passage of the fetus.</P>
<P>The McRobert's manoeuvre, the all-fours position and the application of suprapubic pressure, are manoeuvres implemented in the early management of shoulder dystocia. Manoeuvres related to maternal position can be implemented at the commencement of the second stage of labour and held until delivery of the fetal shoulders is complete. The McRobert's manoeuvre involves assisting the mother into an exaggerated knee-chest position whilst lying flat (or slightly tilted upward) on her back. This does not change the actual dimensions of the pelvis but aids delivery by straightening the sacrum relative to the lumbar spine and rotating the pubic symphysis toward the mother's head allowing it to slide over the fetal shoulder (<LINK REF="REF-Gherman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gherman 2000</LINK>). When there is a minor degree of shoulder dystocia, movement of the mother into an all-fours position can dislodge the obstruction so the shoulders can negotiate the pelvis normally. This position acts as an 'upside-down' McRobert's position and has the same beneficial effects as described above. The application of suprapubic pressure, by an assistant or the delivering practitioner, aims to displace the anterior shoulder away from the pubic symphysis (the anterior point of union of the pelvic bones) to allow the fetal shoulders to enter the pelvis in an oblique diameter. This is advantageous as the entry of the birth canal (the pelvic inlet) is oval in shape with the transverse diameter usually being the widest. Pressure is applied by delivery room nursing staff or the delivering physician as the fetal shoulders are traversing the birth canal.</P>
<P>The mechanics of shoulder dystocia would suggest that the complication could be avoided by applying the manoeuvres outlined previously in a prophylactic manner rather than as treatment once shoulder dystocia has occurred. The use of the McRobert's manoeuvre or the adoption of the all-fours position would maximise the functional size of the maternal pelvis thus minimising the chance of shoulder impaction. The application of suprapubic pressure late in the second stage of labour may prevent fixation of the descending shoulders under the pubic symphysis.</P>
<P>The efficacy, easy application and perceived safety of these manoeuvres may warrant their application as preventative measures in cases where the risk of shoulder dystocia seems high. There are reports of potential, albeit extremely rare, adverse effects related to their use. <LINK REF="REF-Heath-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heath 1999</LINK> describes a case of symphyseal separation and sacroiliac dislocation resulting from excessive or prolonged maternal hip flexion and <LINK REF="REF-Hankins-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hankins 1998</LINK> reports a case of fetal injury resulting from the application of excessive pressure as it passed beneath the pubic symphysis. This review aims to determine the efficacy of such manoeuvres as intrapartum interventions for reducing the incidence of shoulder dystocia. In determining their efficacy, their ability to reduce the incidence of shoulder dystocia will be offset against any maternal or fetal morbidity arising as a consequence of their use.</P>

<P>All studies identified by the search strategy outlined above were considered for inclusion. They were evaluated for appropriateness and methodological quality without consideration of their results. Two authors performed this assessment independently. Differences in opinion were resolved by discussion.</P>
<P>Selection bias was assessed by examining the adequacy of allocation concealment. Two authors independently assessed this using the criteria outlined in Section six of the <I>Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2004</LINK>). The adequacy of allocation concealment was indicated as adequate (A), unclear (B), or inadequate (C).</P>
<P>Due to the nature of the intervention being analysed, blinding is not feasible. Blinding of outcome assessors was noted. Completeness to follow up of each trial was not documented as no data for long-term outcomes were included.</P>
<P>The data were independently extracted and double entered. There was no blinding of authorship. Statistical analyses were performed using Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>) and included trial data was processed as described in the <I>Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Dichotomous data were compared using risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Statistical heterogeneity between trials were tested using the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic and the method described by <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2002</LINK>.</P>
<P>The types of participants included in the review were changed from the protocol to encompass all women with a term, cephalic, singleton gestation and not only those identified as being at increased risk of shoulder dystocia. Accordingly, the title of the review was changed from 'Intrapartum interventions for preventing shoulder dystocia in women at increased risk' to 'Intrapartum interventions for preventing shoulder dystocia'. The reason for this is that although several studies have identified factors associated with an increased incidence of shoulder dystocia (most commonly fetal macrosomia), most cases occur unexpectedly in women with no known risk factors and in non-macrosomic infants (<LINK REF="REF-Al_x002d_Najashi-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al-Najashi 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Geary-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geary 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McFarland-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">McFarland 1995</LINK>). Due to the unpredictability of impending shoulder dystocia, it was felt appropriate to extend the criteria to include all women with term, cephalic, singleton gestations.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Participants</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Beall-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Beall 2003</LINK> recruited women admitted for delivery at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center in Torrance, California with estimated fetal weights by ultrasound or clinical examination of greater than 3800 g and no contraindication to vaginal birth. A total of 185 women were enrolled and 90 were randomised to the treatment group and 95 to the control group. Forty-two women gave birth by caesarean, and of the women birthing vaginally, the head-to-body time was not reported in 15, leaving 128 evaluable cases (55 women in the treatment group and 73 women in the control group).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Poggi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Poggi 2004</LINK> recruited women with a history of a vaginal birth of at least one term infant and arriving in labour or for the induction of labour with a term, cephalic, singleton gestation at Georgetown University Hospital. Of the forty women enrolled, 21 were assigned to the treatment group and 19 were assigned to the control group. Three women requiring caesarean delivery were excluded in addition to 10 women who gave birth with the use of the force-sensing glove, but data were not obtained because of technical or recording errors. This left 27 women (14 in the treatment group and 13 in the control group) available for analysis.</P>

<P>Due to the nature of the intervention, blinding of caregivers and outcome assessors was not possible. This may have resulted in both performance and detection bias.

Of these 42 women, 31 were initially randomised to the prophylactic manoeuvre group and 11 were randomised to the control group, leaving a significant discrepancy in the sample size included in each group. In <LINK REF="STD-Poggi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Poggi 2004</LINK>, three women were excluded due to caesarean birth (groups not specified) and a further 10 women were excluded from analysis because of technical errors with the force sensing glove. </P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Only two studies were able to be included in this review. <LINK REF="STD-Beall-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Beall 2003</LINK> investigated the prophylactic use of the McRobert's manoeuvre with the addition of suprapubic pressure versus therapeutic manoeuvres while <LINK REF="STD-Poggi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Poggi 2004</LINK> compared the prophylactic use of the McRobert's manoeuvre versus lithotomy positioning. The results are presented separately since <LINK REF="STD-Beall-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Beall 2003</LINK> recruited women with suspected fetal macrosomia and <LINK REF="STD-Poggi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Poggi 2004</LINK> recruited women with a history of at least one vaginal birth. </P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Beall-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Beall 2003</LINK>, there was a trend towards a reduction in the incidence of shoulder dystocia in the prophylactic group which gained statistical significance when women excluded from the trial for caesarean birth were included. This result is no doubt influenced by the larger number of caesareans (n = 31) in the prophylactic group than in the therapeutic group (n = 11). This trial included women identified as at risk of shoulder dystocia and therefore the presentation of women in a prophylactic position may have signalled to caregivers that these women were at risk. This awareness may have biased the management of these women and resulted in an increased caesarean rate in this group. The rate of caesarean delivery for failure to progress was statistically significantly increased amongst women randomised to the prophylactic manoeuvre group, as was the rate of caesarean delivery for all other indications. The fact that caesarean deliveries for all indications were increased amongst women randomised to the treatment group increases the likelihood that the results reflect bias introduced by an inability to blind delivering practitioners. It is difficult to see how a prophylactic McRobert's manoeuvre could cause physical changes that would require a caesarean section to be done. <BR/>
<BR/>The results of this review are limited by several methodological issues in addition to those arising from the exclusion of large numbers of randomised women from the analyses reported and the inability to pool the results of the two included trials. Both studies failed to address important maternal outcomes such as maternal injury, psychological outcomes and satisfaction with birth. Due to the nature of the intervention being assessed, blinding of caregivers and outcome assessors was not possible which may have been a source of bias. In light of the low incidence of shoulder dystocia and the rarity of complications associated with the implementation of the manoeuvres investigated, the sample size included was insufficient to adequately assess the risk and benefits of the intervention.<BR/> </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Neither study produced clear findings to either support or refute the use of prophylactic manoeuvres to prevent shoulder dystocia. In addition, both studies failed to address important maternal outcomes such as maternal injury, psychological outcomes and satisfaction with birth. It is not clear if the increased rate of caesarean births in the prophylactic group in <LINK REF="STD-Beall-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Beall 2003</LINK> is an artefact of the trial's design or whether such prophylactic manoeuvres influence the decision to carry out a caesarean section. <BR/>
</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Shoulder dystocia is associated with a high risk of physical and psychological complications for the mother and neonate. Therefore, the discovery of prophylactic measures to prevent its occurrence would be valuable. Further trials comparing prophylactic manoeuvres (for example, the McRobert's manoeuvre, the all-fours position and suprapubic pressure) administered prior to the delivery of the fetal head are required.</P>
<P>Future research should address maternal outcomes such as injury, psychological outcomes and satisfaction with birth. Attempts to determine the optimal timing for prophylactic manoeuvres to be implemented (that is, during the first stage or beginning or early in the second stage of labour) should also be made. </P>
<P>In light of the low incidence of shoulder dystocia, trials with larger sample sizes are indicated to properly assess the risks and benefits associated with the use of prophylactic manoeuvres for the prevention of shoulder dystocia. Studies should include all women regardless of their perceived risk until a good predictive tool for shoulder dystocia is established. This could also potentially reduce performance and detection bias introduced by an inability to blind caregivers and outcome assessors due to the nature of the intervention. <BR/>

<CHAR_METHODS>
<P>Treatment assigned by drawing next in series of sealed, opaque envelopes and determined by a random number table. A total of 185 women were enrolled in the study. 90 women were randomised into the intervention group and 90 were randomised into the control group. 42 women delivered by caesarean, and of the women delivering vaginally, the head-to-body time was not reported in 15 leaving 128 evaluable cases, 55 in the intervention group and 73 in the control group.</P>
</CHAR_METHODS>
<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Inclusion: women with estimated fetal weights by ultrasound or clinical examination &gt; 3800 g with no contraindication to vaginal delivery.<BR/>Exclusion: women with indication for caesarean birth at admission, multiple gestations and non-cephalic presentation. <BR/>185 (randomised): 90 to McRobert's group and 95 to control group.<BR/>
</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Treatment group: prophylactic McRobert's manoeuvre and suprapubic pressure commencing at crowning of the fetal head (n = 90(55)).<BR/>Control group: necessary maneuvers only administered following delivery of fetal head (including McRobert's manoeuvre, suprapubic pressure, delivery of posterior arm) (n = 95(73)).</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>Incidence of shoulder dystocia; head-to-body delivery time (seconds); newborn birth injuries; 5 min Apgar score &lt; 7; instrumental vaginal delivery; prophylactic manoeuvres performed; therapeutic manoeuvres performed; admission to special care nursery.</P>

<CHAR_METHODS>
<P>Drawing of small folded piece of paper with the word 'McRobert's' or 'lithotomy' from an opaque container. 40 women were randomly assigned (19 to the control group and 21 to the intervention group). 3 women required caesarean delivery and 10 women that were delivered with the force-sensing glove were excluded due to technical or recording errors. Therefore 27 women (13 in the control group and 14 in the intervention group) were available for analysis.</P>
</CHAR_METHODS>
<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Inclusion: multiparous women with term, cephalic singleton gestations, with a history of giving birth vaginally to at least 1 term infant.</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Treatment group: prophylactic McRobert's maneuver following delivery of the fetal head (n = 21(14)). Control group: lithotomy position (n = 19(13)).</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>Incidence of shoulder dystocia; head-to-body delivery time (seconds); newborn birth injuries; 5 min Apgar score &lt; 7; instrumental vaginal delivery; perinatal death; peak force (lb) to deliver neonate and peak force (lb) to deliver anterior shoulder measured with use of a force-measuring system that consisted of a custom glove with force sensors.</P>
</CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<CHAR_NOTES>
<P>It is possible that the standard deviations in head-to-body delivery time are really standard errors which would be more consistent with the non-significant result reported for this outcome in the paper.</P>
