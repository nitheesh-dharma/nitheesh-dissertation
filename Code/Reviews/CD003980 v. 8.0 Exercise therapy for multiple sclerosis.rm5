<P>MS is a chronic disease of the central nervous system. The variable distribution of the damage in the myelin sheath of nerves may lead to loss of strength, sensation, co-ordination and balance causing severe and progressive limitations of function in daily life. To date, there is no effective treatment for MS, however, a number of studies suggest that exercise interventions aimed to improve daily functioning of patients with MS are effective. Nine randomized controlled trials of exercise therapy for MS patients were included in this review six of which used no therapy as the comparator. There was strong evidence in favor of exercise therapy, compared to no therapy, regarding muscle function and mobility while no evidence was found of improved fatigue, in one study only. No one specifically targeted exercise program was more successful than others. No deleterious effects were described in the included studies.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>No intervention has proven effective in modifying long-term disease prognosis in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) but exercise therapy is considered to be an important part of symptomatic and supportive treatment for these patients. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effectiveness of exercise therapy for patients with MS in terms of activities of daily living and health-related quality of life. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-07-01 12:13:15 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Deirdre Beecher">
<P>We searched the Cochrane MS Group Trials Register (searched: March 2004), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) "The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2004", MEDLINE (from 1966 to March 2004), EMBASE (from 1988 to March 2004 ), CINAHL (from 1982 to March 2004), PEDro (from 1999 to March 2004). Manual search in the journal 'Multiple Sclerosis' and screening of the reference lists of identified studies and reviews. We also searched abstracts published in proceedings of conferences.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) that reported on exercise therapy for adults with MS, not presently experiencing an exacerbation; outcomes that include measures of activity limitation or health-related quality of life or both.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers independently extracted data and methodological quality of the included trials. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. The results were analysed using a best-evidence synthesis based on methodological quality. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Nine high-methodological-quality RCTs(260 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Six trials focussed on comparison of exercise therapy versus no exercise therapy, whereas three trials compared two interventions that both met our definition of exercise therapy. Best evidence synthesis showed strong evidence in favour of exercise therapy compared to no exercise therapy in terms of muscle power function, exercise tolerance functions and mobility-related activities. Moderate evidence was found for improving mood. No evidence was observed for exercise therapy on fatigue and perception of handicap when compared to no exercise therapy. Finally, no evidence was found that specific exercise therapy programmes were more successful in improving activities and participation than other exercise treatments. No evidence of deleterious effects of exercise therapy was described in included studies. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The results of the present review suggest that exercise therapy can be beneficial for patients with MS not experiencing an exacerbation. There is an urgent need for consensus on a core set of outcome measures to be used in exercise trials. In addition, these studies should experimentally control for 'dose' of treatment, type of MS and should include sufficient contrast between experimental and control groups. </P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-09-12 10:17:55 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Liliana Coco">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease of the central nervous system. The variable distribution of demyelination and axonal loss throughout the central nervous system may lead to disorders of strength, sensation, co-ordination and balance, as well as visual, cognitive and affective deficits, that may lead to severe progressive limitations of functioning in daily life. Although the exact aetiology of the disease is unknown, it is generally accepted that MS involves an abnormal immune response within the central nervous system. In Europe, at least 350,000 persons have the disease. Wide variations exist between and within European countries in the incidence of MS (3.4/100,00 between 1983 and 1987 in Western areas of Norway to 11.6/100,000 between 1979 and 1993 in western Seinäjoki, Finland) and its prevalence (38-58/100,000 in France to 144/100,000 in North-western Sardinia), as well as in the general standard of care for MS patients (<LINK REF="REF-Pozzilli-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pozzilli 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>One of the primary aims of rehabilitation for patients with multiple sclerosis is to increase their levels of activity and participation and increase their independence (<LINK REF="STD-Langdon-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Langdon 1999</LINK>). Recent advances in drug therapies, such as with ß-interferon that reduce relapse rate offer renewed hope (<LINK REF="REF-Anonymous-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anonymous 1995</LINK>). However, a clinically meaningful effect of drug therapy on disability (activity) has not yet been demonstrated (<LINK REF="STD-Freeman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 1997</LINK>). Therefore, the symptomatic and supportive therapies that aim to achieve an optimisation of daily functioning of patients with MS remain important. The role of rehabilitation with physical training being a central component is perceived to be important in this process. In most cases the exercise therapy is part of a goal-orientated, multidisciplinary approach (for example <LINK REF="STD-Freeman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Patti-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Patti 2003</LINK>); although, sometimes, exercise therapy is offered by one discipline only (for example <LINK REF="STD-Fuller-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Fuller 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Svensson-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Svensson 1994</LINK>). </P>
<P>To our knowledge, the effectiveness of exercise-based rehabilitation programmes for multiple sclerosis has not been formally assessed in a systematic review. In 2001, a meta-analysis on the effectiveness of physical, psychological, and functional interventions in treating clients with multiple sclerosis was performed (<LINK REF="REF-Baker-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baker 2001</LINK>), suggesting that occupational therapy (OT) was effective in treating the deficits in MS. However, this systematic review was not focussed on effects of exercise therapy alone, but also on the effects of other intervention regimes, such as psychotherapy and electrotherapy. In addition, pre-experimental designs without a control group were included in the analysis, which may have biased the found outcomes. Recently, a systematic review on the effectiveness of OT interventions on functional ability, social participation or health-related quality of life or both in patients with MS was performed (<LINK REF="REF-Steultjens-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steultjens 2003</LINK>). No recommendations could be made on whether occupational therapy improves outcome in MS patients. The authors conclude that further research is needed, due to lack of (randomised controlled) efficacy studies. In addition, Steultjens review (<LINK REF="REF-Steultjens-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steultjens 2003</LINK>) was not focused on effects of exercise therapy alone, but also examined the effects of education, advice and counselling. In addition, quasi-experimental trials (<LINK REF="REF-Cook-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 1980</LINK>) were included in the analysis. This review focused only on the effects of exercise therapy for MS. </P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The primary aim of the present review was to determine whether exercise therapy is an effective treatment for patients with MS in terms of Activities of Daily Living (ADL). <BR/>The secondary objective is to determine the effects of exercise therapy on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in these patients.</P>

<SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-06-25 11:25:49 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Liliana Coco">
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>The review was restricted to randomised controlled clinical trials (RCT's). RCT's are defined as trials in which investigators allocate eligible people to treatment and control group on a random basis (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2000</LINK>). Randomized Cross-over trials were considered as RCT's (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2000</LINK>). </P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Studies with patients, of all ages and of either sex, who fulfilled a clinical diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis (as described by <LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Poser-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poser 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schumacher-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schumacher 1965</LINK>) were included. For inclusion in this review the patients under research have to be free of exacerbation.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2008-06-25 11:25:49 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Liliana Coco">
<P>All trials that fitted the authors' definition of exercise therapy were considered for inclusion. Exercise therapy was defined as: "a series of movements with the aim of training or developing the body by a routine practise or as a physical training to promote good physical health" (Webster's New World Dictionary 1982)</P>
<P>The goal of the exercise therapy had to be associated to one or more of the following codes of the International Classification of Functioning (ICF) (<LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>): code b455 (exercise tolerance functions), code d410 (changing basic body position), code d415 (maintaining a body position), code d430 (lifting and carrying objects), code d435 (moving objects with lower extremities), code d440 (fine hand use), code d445 (hand and arm use) code d450 (walking), code d455 (moving around), code d460 (moving around in different locations), code d510 (washing oneself), code d530 (toileting), code d540 (dressing), code d550 (eating), code d560 (drinking).</P>
<P>Therefore, the included interventions concerned studies that applied:<BR/>rehabilitation, physical therapy (with or without using training equipment), training, functional training, home physical training, and aquatic exercise. Studies were excluded if the goal of the therapy primaraly focussed on improving physical functions, but was associated with learning to handle products, technology and equipment in daily living. As a result, the following codes of the ICF-classifications were excluded: code e120 (products and technology for personal indoor and outdoor mobility and transportation), code e1151 (assistive products and technology for personal use in daily living).<BR/>In line with the above codes for exclusion, the following interventions were not incorporated in the present analysis: baths, electrotherapy, electric stimulation (functional, neuromuscular), transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (See <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>).</P>

</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-06-25 11:52:21 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Liliana Coco">
<P>Study selection<BR/>Two reviewers (MJCP &amp; MBR) independently screened titles and abstracts of all studies identified by the search strategy and discarded irrelevant publications in order to create a list of eligible studies. After the potential trials had been retrieved, each reviewer independently applied the inclusion/exclusion criteria to unblinded full reports. Additional information was sought, where necessary, for all trials that appeared to meet the inclusion criteria. Consensus was used to resolve disagreements concerning the final inclusion of studies, and a third reviewer was consulted if disagreements persisted.</P>
<P>Methodological quality assessment<BR/>Two reviewers (DB, MBR) independently assessed the methodological quality of included trials, using an 11-items scoring list (see <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>). This list contains seven criteria for internal validity and four descriptive criteria. All items were scored as clearly yes (2 points), clearly no (0 points) or not sure (1 point). Equal weight was applied to all items. Scores of individual items were summed to obtain overall score. Inter-rater agreement on methodological quality scale scores was assessed by means of the kappa statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1960</LINK>). The kappa coefficient ranges between zero (completely chance-explained agreement) and one (perfect agreement). A third reviewer resolved disagreements.</P>
<P>Data extraction<BR/>The following information was systematically extracted by the reviewers: study design, description of randomisation, characteristics of the participants (number, type of MS, disease duration, age, gender and Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS]-score), inclusion/exclusion criteria, description of the study and control treatment, outcome measures, length of follow up, and number of patients withdrawn or dropping out of the trial. For studies where the required data were missing, further details were requested from the main author of the manuscript.</P>
<P>Analysis<BR/>In order to allow for differences in applied treatment contrast, the analysis focused on comparisons of an exercise therapy intervention with a non-exercise intervention. Studies that applied exercise training for the control group as well were separated from those studies in which the control group received no exercise training. In case of comparability between two or more independent studies we pooled reported results into summary effect sizes. If a quantitative analysis was not applicable due to diversity of outcome measures, then a qualitative best-evidence synthesis was performed on the basis of the Cochrane list (see "Methodological quality of included studies <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>"). Included studies that obtained at least 50% (or 11 out of 22 points) of the maximum feasible methodological quality score were considered to be of 'high quality', whereas studies that achieve 10 points or less on the Cochrane list were judged as 'low quality' RCTs (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Evidence was graded into 'Strong evidence' (evidence from studies providing consistent, statistically significant findings in outcome measures in multiple high-quality RCTs), 'Moderate evidence' (evidence from studies providing at least consistent findings among multiple low-quality RCTs, or CCTs, or one high-quality RCT, or a combination of these), or 'Limited evidence' (one low-quality RCT, or CCT, or both). 'Conflicting evidence' was classified as conflicting statistically significant positive and statistically significant negative results among RCTs, or CCTs, or both. 'No evidence' was classified as no RCTs or CCTs if the number of studies showing evidence is less than 50% of the total number of retrieved studies within the same category of methodological quality (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 2003</LINK>).</P>

<B>Participant characteristics</B>
<BR/>Details are presented in the Table of Characteristics of Included Studies and in Additional Table 2 (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). The participants of the studies considered in the present review all fulfilled a clinical diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis. Most included studies describe that a neurologist assessed patients' eligibility for inclusion. Criteria for exacerbation or relapse were not defined. For trials comparing exercise therapy with no exercise therapy, the severity of the disease, as expressed by the EDSS-score, ranged from 1 to 6.5. In addition, different types of MS (benign, relapsing-remitting, secondary-progressive, progressive and chronic MS) were considered. Mean disease duration of the subjects ranged from 4.3 to 15.1 years. The mean percentage of women ranged from 30% to 83% and the mean age of the participants ranged from 34.8 to 51.6 years. For the trials comparing exercise therapy with a control exercise intervention, EDSS-scores ranged from 1 to 6.5, relapsing-remitting-, primary-progressive-, secondary-progressive- and chronic progressive MS were considered. The mean disease duration of the participants ranged from 11.2 to 18.3 years. The mean percentage of woman ranged from 48 to 85 and the mean age of the participants ranged from 44 to 54 years.</P>

</I>
<BR/>In the study of <LINK REF="STD-Petajan-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Petajan 1996</LINK>, ambulatory patients with MS participated in a 15-week outpatient exercise training programme to improve measures of physical fitness and to determine its effects on ADL, mood and levels of fatigue. Patients with MS were randomly assigned to an exercise or non-exercise group. Exercise therapy consisted of 3 x 40 minute sessions per week of combined arm and leg ergometry. Of the 54 patients originally selected for the study, six were excluded for reasons unrelated to the research project and to MS. Two additional subjects were excluded secondary to an MS exacerbation. Thus, data from 46 participants were used for statistical analysis. Compared with the control group, the exercise therapy group showed statistically significant increases in maximal aerobic capacity (VO2 max.) and Physical Work Capacity (PWC) after the treatment period. For maximum isometric strength, significant differences between groups after 15 weeks of intervention were found for summed upper extremity strength (i.e., shoulder flexion, shoulder extension, elbow flexion, and elbow extension) and for summed lower extremity strength (i.e., hip extension, hip flexion, knee flexion, and knee extension). For the upper extremity three (i.e., shoulder flexion, shoulder extension, and elbow flexion) out of the four measured muscle groups reached statistically significant changes. Whereas for the lower extremity one (knee extension) out of the four measured muscle groups reached statistically significant change. Compared with the non-exercise group, the exercise therapy group improved significantly on all aspects of the physical subscale (i.e., ambulation, mobility, body care and movement) of the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP) after 10 weeks of training. After 15 weeks of training there was still a significant effect for the total score on the physical subscale (but only the mobility aspect reached significance).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Jones-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 1999</LINK> compared a mobility exercise programme with a weighted leg exercise training programme and with a control group receiving no exercise. Both exercise programmes were performed at home. Nineteen patients with MS were randomly allocated to the three arms of the trial. One patient of the weighted leg exercise group left the study after four weeks, due to back pain, which was believed not to be the result of the intervention. One patient of the mobility exercise group had a relapse shortly after the beginning of the study. These dropouts left 17 patients for statistical analyses. Muscle strength (MVC) of quadriceps and the functional activities walking and transferring (Timed Walk and Timed Transfer) were measured, respectively. Although the weighted leg group improved significantly on time needed for chair transfers, no significant differences were found between the three groups for gait speed, ability to transfer and muscle strength.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Wiles-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Wiles 2001</LINK> performed a randomised cross-over trial to determine whether physiotherapy can improve mobility in patients with chronic MS and whether there is a difference between treatments at home and in the outpatient clinic. Forty-two patients with chronic MS were randomly allocated to one of the six permutations of three-week intervals: treatments consisted of physiotherapy at home, in the outpatient clinic and no therapy. Forty patients formed the basis of the analysis, because two patients declined further assessments. No statistically significant differences were found between both exercise groups on the Rivermead Mobility Index (RMI) or any of the secondary mobility measures (i.e. balance time, timed walk, nine hole peg test, assessor global mobility change scale, VAS-patient mobility, VAS-carer mobility, and VAS-falls). Wiles 2001 reported a significant treatment effect on the primary outcome RMI when hospital or home-based physiotherapy were compared with no physiotherapy. This was corroborated by significant effects on all above-mentioned secondary measures in favour of exercise therapy compared to no exercise. In addition, statistically significant effects were found in favour of exercise therapy for mood and reduction in anxiety and depression measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Carter-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Carter 2003</LINK>, 11 participants with mild to moderate MS, who were able to walk for at least four minutes, were randomly assigned to an exercise group or to a non-exercise group. The 12-week outpatient exercise-training programme consisted of twice-weekly supervised general aerobic, strengthening and flexibility exercise sessions. Of the 13 participants originally selected for the study, two were excluded before the start of the intervention, one having severe hypertension and one having developed abdominal cancer. There was a significant reduction in the normalised physiological cost index (PCI, represented by the formula: Working heart rate - Resting heart rate (beats per minute) divided by speed of walking (metres per minute) scores after 12 weeks in the exercising group, but not in the non-exercising control group. In addition, there was a significant difference between the groups in the percentage change in PCI. When comparing the exercise with the non-exercise group, significant effects were observed for isometric strength in the hip flexors and knee flexors of both limbs, the knee extensors and the ankle dorsal flexors of the right limb, but not in the ankle dorsal flexors or the knee extensors of the left limb.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connell-2003" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connell 2003</LINK> conducted a randomised controlled trial to assess the effects of an outpatient exercise therapy programme on MS patients with mild disability. Eleven participants, in the relapse-remitting stage of the disease, were randomly allocated to an exercise or non-exercise group. Exercise training consisted of twice-weekly, one hour supervised aerobic training in circuit style and once-weekly individual exercise. Two participants from the experimental group were excluded due to relapse. Following the three-month exercise training programme, the exercise group had improved significantly regarding fitness as measured with a Modified Graded Exercise Test (MGET) and quality of life as measured with the Functional Assessment of Multiple Sclerosis (FAMS) compared to baseline. The mean change in heart rate, cadence and Borg's Perception of Exertion were statistically significantly larger in favour of the exercise group when compared to the non-exercise group. No significant differences were found on the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS) and gait speed.</P>
<P>In the study of <LINK REF="STD-DeBolt-2004" TYPE="STUDY">DeBolt 2004</LINK>, MS patients participated in an eight-week home-based resistance exercise programme to examine the effects on balance, leg extension power, and mobility. After stratification by disability level and age, participants were randomly assigned to an exercise or a non-exercise group. Exercise therapy consisted of resistance training (i.e., chair raises, forward lunges, step-ups, heel-toe raises, and leg curls) three times a week. The control group maintained their current level of activity. Of the 37 patients originally selected for the study, 1 was excluded secondary to an MS exacerbation. Thus, data from 36 (exercise group n = 19, and controls n = 17) participants remained for statistical analysis. After the intervention a significant difference between groups was found for leg extensor power. No between-group effects were found for exercise therapy on mobility and balance.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Lord-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lord 1998</LINK> used a pilot study to compare two exercise therapy approaches to improve walking in outpatients with gait disturbances due to MS. Comparison was made between a facilitation and a task-oriented approach. In total twenty-three patients with clinically stable MS were randomised; however, three participants (two from the facilitation group and one from the task group) were excluded due to a relapse or further medical intervention. Ten in each group completed the study, and were treated for a minimum of 15 treatments over a five to seven week period. Participants in both groups showed a significant overall improvement in mobility, as measured with the 10-metre timed walk, stride length, RMI and the Rivermead Visual Gait Assessment and in balance using the Berg Balance Test. No significant differences between the two exercise groups were found.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Solari-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Solari 1999</LINK> assessed the efficacy of an inpatient physical rehabilitation programme on impairment (body functions and structures), disability (activities) and quality of life (QoL) of patients with MS in a randomised, single-blind controlled study. Fifty ambulatory patients with MS were assigned to three weeks of physical rehabilitation (study group) or to exercises performed at home (controls). The inpatient rehabilitation programme consisted of twice-daily exercise periods, each 45 minutes long, and included passive (stretching, mobilisation) and active interventions (for example facilitation of a normal gait pattern). Patients were evaluated at baseline, 3, 9, and 15 weeks. Five patients withdrew from the study before the end of the study period (three in the rehabilitation group: one had an exacerbation, two deteriorated clinically; two controls: one failed to present for the last examination, one deteriorated), but all were included in the analyses. No significant differences were found for impairment (body functions and structures), as measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). At the end of the intervention significant differences were observed between the study group and the control group in disability (activities), as assessed by the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) motor domain and overall health-related QoL as measured with the mental composite score (emotional role-limitation, mental health, vitality and social functioning) of the SF-36. These differences remained at nine weeks.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Mostert-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Mostert 2002</LINK> 37 MS patients taking part in an inpatient rehabilitation programme were randomly assigned to an aerobic exercise training group or to a non-training group. The four weeks aerobic training intervention consisted of five 30 minute sessions per week of bicycle exercise with individualised intensity. The non-exercise group took part in the normal physical therapy of the rehabilitation programme but agreed not to increase their physical activity level. Of the 37 patients originally included, 26 remained for statistical analyses. Two were excluded because of significant change in the exercise electrocardiogram . Three patients quit the study directly after random assignment to the exercise group. Two suffered from elevated spasticity of the lower extremities after testing. Of the non-exercise group, three patients had motivational problems to sustain the intervention program; two others had symptom exacerbations. Compared with baseline, the exercise group demonstrated a significant improvement of the aerobic threshold, an improvement in HRQoL (as measured with the SF-36), and an increase in activity level. However, in the present study statistical analyses were restricted to within-group comparison. Therefore, the differential effects between the groups remain inconclusive.</P>

In addition, strong evidence was found for exercise therapy on mobility related activities (ICF codes d410 changing basic body position, d415 maintaining a body position, d450 walking, d455 moving around and d460 moving around in different locations) as measured with the Rivermead Mobility Index (<LINK REF="STD-Wiles-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Wiles 2001</LINK>), timed transfer (<LINK REF="STD-Jones-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 1999</LINK>), balance time (<LINK REF="STD-Wiles-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Wiles 2001</LINK>) and walking cadence (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connell-2003" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connell 2003</LINK>).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This systematic review investigated the effectiveness of exercise therapy for MS patients in terms of activities of daily living and health-related quality of life. Unfortunately, statistical pooling of data was not possible mainly due to differences in measurements of outcome. Instead, a qualitative analysis using levels of evidence was performed showing strong evidence in favour of exercise therapy compared to no exercise therapy in terms of muscle power functions, exercise tolerance functions and mobility-related activities. Moderate evidence was found for improving mood. However, no evidence was observed for exercise therapy on fatigue and perception of handicap when compared to no exercise therapy. Finally, no evidence was found that specific exercise therapy programmes, including type of exercise therapy and type of setting, were superior in improving activities and participation than other exercise treatments. This latter finding suggests that the contrast of treatment between experimental and control treatment is an important element in determining the effectiveness of treatment in MS. Although the above conclusions are based on high-quality RCTs, it should be noted that most studies included a small number of patients. This lack of statistical power could have introduced type-II-error. In addition, it seems that included studies emphasised when presenting the results on the within group differences. Moreover, one study restricted the statistical analysis to within-group changes and not between-group differences (<LINK REF="STD-Mostert-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Mostert 2002</LINK>). </P>
<P>Interestingly, only the study of <LINK REF="STD-Mostert-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Mostert 2002</LINK>Mdescribes evidence of deleterious effects after testing, by means of elevated spasticity of the lower extremity in two subjects. However, no evidence of deleterious effects of exercise therapy was described by any of the nine included studies. Although in seven trials, dropouts due to an MS exacerbation were reported in groups receiving exercise training (two in <LINK REF="STD-Petajan-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Petajan 1996</LINK>; one in <LINK REF="STD-Jones-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 1999</LINK>; three in <LINK REF="STD-Lord-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lord 1998</LINK>; one in <LINK REF="STD-Solari-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Solari 1999</LINK>; two in <LINK REF="STD-Mostert-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Mostert 2002</LINK>; two in <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connell-2003" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connell 2003</LINK>; one in <LINK REF="STD-DeBolt-2004" TYPE="STUDY">DeBolt 2004</LINK>), none of the authors of the concerned trials related these dropouts to the applied intervention. This latter finding seems to be important, because people with MS have traditionally been advised by doctors to avoid exercise therapy due to the potential effect on triggering an exacerbation or worsening disease activity. Increases in core temperature can lead to a transient increase in the frequency of clinical signs and symptoms of MS (<LINK REF="REF-White-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 2000</LINK>). Acknowledging that fatigue affects the vast majority of patients, it was believed that exercise could not be tolerated and that it was preferable to focus on conserving energy. On the other hand, avoiding exercise also has its disadvantages. Sedentary people have an increased risk of developing a large number of other health problems, like obesity and cardiovascular disease. In addition, the very low activity levels observed in people with MS (<LINK REF="REF-Ng-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ng 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stuifbergen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stuifbergen 1997</LINK>) often coincide with a loss in leisure activities, social contacts, or normal activities of daily life, which are important for self-esteem and psychological well-being. </P>
<P>
<B>Participants</B> <BR/>All participants considered in the present review fulfilled a clinical diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis, as described by <LINK REF="REF-Poser-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poser 1983</LINK> or <LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2001</LINK>. However, there was much diversity among studies with regard to patient characteristics. The large range of 1 to 6.5 in the EDSS-scores, best illustrates the diversity in severity of the disease among participants. In the studies considered different types of MS were included. However, none of the trials stratified patients on the basis of type of MS. Therefore, the effectiveness of exercise therapy for different types of MS remains indistinct in the present review. Finally, patients of all ages and of either sex were included. The percentage of female participants (64%) seems to reflect the epidemiological findings about the between-gender distribution of MS (<LINK REF="REF-Pozzilli-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pozzilli 2002</LINK>). The mean age of the participants ranged from 34 to 54 years. Most studies had an upper limit of 65 years of age for participants, restricting the generalisation of the present findings. </P>
<P>
<B>Exercise programmes </B>
<BR/>The present review did not control for 'dose' (intensity, duration and frequency) of exercise therapy. However, intensity, duration and frequency seem to be important factors in modifying treatment effects. In the present review, there was diversity among the included trials with regard to duration and frequency of training sessions, while intensity was often poorly described. Thus, it is impossible to state the best 'dose' of treatment to achieve optimal beneficial effects of exercise therapy in terms of activities and participation for patients suffering from MS. Optimum number, duration and intensity of treatment sessions all need further study. </P>
<P>
<B>Methodological quality of the RCTs </B>
<BR/>RCTs are generally considered to be the best paradigm of intervention research providing the strongest scientific proof of the effectiveness of an intervention (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 2003</LINK>v). Most systematic reviews evaluating the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions are confined to evaluating RCTs. The methodological quality score of the RCTs included in the present review ranged from 55% to 82% of the maximum feasible score of 22 points. Even though adequate methodological approaches such as concealment of allocation, blinding of the outcome assessor, and inclusion in the analysis of all randomised participants are recognised as the most important factors in reducing bias (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>), only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Solari-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Solari 1999</LINK>) included in this review met all three of the above methodological criteria. In addition, reviewers were unable to obtain a methodological quality score for the studies of <LINK REF="STD-Carter-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Carter 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connell-2003" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connell 2003</LINK>, since only the abstracts as published in proceedings of conferences were available. Instead, the methodological quality scores of these studies were based on information as provided by the first authors, which may have biased the results. </P>
<P>
<B>Outcome measures </B>
<BR/>Although some studies measured the same domains, different test protocols were used for strength, physical fitness, balance, gait speed and HRQoL, which impeded pooling of data. The large variety in outcome measures used underscores the need for a general agreement about most important measures to assess effects of exercise intervention. International consensus about a core set of outcome measures to determine the effect of exercise therapy would enable comparison of the magnitude of effect of different exercise regimens. </P>
<P>
<B>Potential biases of systematic reviews </B>
<BR/>Selection of all relevant studies is crucial to the validity of a systematic review. However, several biases can be introduced by the literature search and selection procedure (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 2003</LINK>v). We might have missed relevant unpublished trials, which are more likely to be small studies with non-significant or negative results due to publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1998</LINK>). Screening references of identified trials and systematic reviews may result in an overrepresentation of positive studies in the review, because trials with a positive result are more likely to be referred to in other publications, leading to reference bias (<LINK REF="REF-Goetzsche-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goetzsche 1987</LINK>). The literature search was restricted to English, German, French and Dutch publications. Although reviewers acknowledge that systematic reviews should aim at inclusion of all relevant trials, independent of language, identifying trials published in any language is difficult, time consuming and costly. It is possible to include trials, of other languages, in a future update of this review. <BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Summary and future research <BR/>
</B>In summary, the present research synthesis suggests that exercise therapy can be beneficial for patients with MS on isometric strength, physical fitness and mobility-related ADLs such as time needed for transfer, walking cadence and balance time. In addition, positive findings were found for outcomes related to mood, such as anxiety and depression. Finally, no evidence was found that specific exercise therapy programmes were more successful in improving activities and participation than other exercise treatments. These conclusions were based on a best research evidence synthesis due to lack of comparability between measurements of outcome, acknowledging that defining the levels of evidence is essentially an arbitrary and subjective way of summarising evidence (<LINK REF="REF-De-Vet-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Vet 2003</LINK>). No evidence of deleterious effects of exercise therapy were described in the identified studies. </P>
<P>This review provides a template for the inclusion of future trials and could be used to guide further research. It shows the need for research in older individuals, those more disabled (EDSS-score over 6.5) and those diagnosed for over 18 years. To overcome the problem of heterogeneity between subjects, future studies should stratify patients on the basis of type of MS. There is an urgent need for a general agreement about core set of measurements to be applied in MS trials investigating effectiveness of exercise therapy. Outcome measures in the activities of daily living and HRQoL domains should be included. In addition, these studies should experimentally control for 'dose' of treatment and sufficient contrast in type of intervention and adhere to the methodological principles, especially concealment of allocation, blind recording and an adequate description of the number of dropouts. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The results of this review suggest that exercise therapy, whether similar to that recommended for the healthy population or modified to simply maintain function, does have efficacy in MS. There was no evidence described of deleterious effects of exercise therapy for patients with MS and the effect of type of MS remains unclear. Based on these results, it seems reasonable to promote exercise therapy to patients with MS not experiencing an exacerbation. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There is an urgent need for a consensus on a core set of measurements of outcome to be used in exercise trials. These outcome measures should be reliable and valid and reflect activities of daily living and quality of life domains. In addition, these studies should experimentally control for 'dose' of treatment and sufficient contrast in type of intervention between experimental and control groups and adhere to the methodological principles, especially concealment of allocation, blind recording and description of dropouts.</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<P>Some neglected problems dog the rehabilitation in MS: Patients may suffer longer periods of visual loss, fatigue and other incapacitations after definite efforts.<BR/>They show periventricular lesion formations whose dynamics can only be explained by local physical impacts: http://www.med.harvard.edu/AANLIB/cases/case5/mr2/020.html.The possibility of producing corresponding impacts by stronger efforts (www.ms-info.net) deserves more attention.<BR/>All this provokes the question whether, in training MS patients, there ought not to be paid more attention to the point whether this training does entail a propagation of extracranial venous pressure excesses into the affected parts of the brain.<BR/>Hoping not to appear all to burdensome in raising this issue, but I would greatly appreciate to learn something about your ideas in this respect.</P>
</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<FEEDBACK_REPLY>
<P>Thank you for your reaction on our review 'Exercise therapy for multiple sclerosis'. The question you are raising is interesting. However, based on our review we can't provide an answer to this question. To our knowledge there is no direct evidence for your hypothesis. We are not aware of any report of harm from exercise. Further research is needed to determine the effects of exercise therapy on extra cranial venous pressure and the affected parts of the brain.</P>

<P>In your qualitative review, when considering the three studies comparing "exercise therapy" to a control intervention, you reported that there was no evidence of efficacy of "exercise therapy" for the FIM motor domain (Results page 12, and Discussion page 14).  On the opposite, there was a significant effect at the end of treatment (3 weeks) which persisted at nine weeks (Solari et al., Neurology 1999). The same was for the SF-36 mental composite score.</P>
</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2009-07-09 13:32:13 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We appreciate your feedback on our review &#8216;exercise therapy for multiple sclerosis&#8217;. The issue that you remind us of is interesting and seems to be conflicting in the present review. We acknowledge the found results in your study (Solari 1999) in favour of the physical rehabilitation group on the FIM motor domain, and SF-36 mental composite score. Those results are presented in the results section of our review (study characteristic on page 9, and Table 3. Between group effects on page 11 and 12).</P>
<P>However, it is important to note that we did apply a best (research) evidence syntheses (BES) in our review. For that we defined different categories for evaluation at different levels of ICF. As shown in our systematic review, physical fitness was measured by VO2-max, and mobility by outcomes such as gait speed, stride length, Rivermead Mobility Index, Rivermead Visual Gait Assessment, Berg Balance Test, Functional Independence Measure motor domain and Beacke Activity Questionnaire. Health related quality of life (HrQoL) was measured by SF-36.</P>
<P>Best evidence syntheses of the category &#8216;mobility&#8217; did reveal the classification &#8216;no evidence&#8217;, because the number of studies showing evidence is less than 50% of the total number of studies within the same category of methodological  quality.  </P>
<P>Best evidence syntheses of the category &#8216;Health related quality of life&#8217; was classified as &#8216;no evidence&#8217;. Your study reported a between group effect on the MCS of the FS-36 at 3 and 9 weeks, the study of Mostert (2002), however, did not report between group effects. Within that, the outcome of HrQoL after BES remains inconclusive.</P>
<P>Since 2004, new RCTs on exercise therapy for MS have been published and, recently, we started making an update of our review. In this update, we will reconsider above mentioned points addressed by you and we will reconsider a meta-analysis of pooled outcomes. Otherwise we will stick by applying a best evidence synthesis. Hopefully, the update will allow us to publish more straightforward conclusions with respect to effects of exercise therapy in patients with MS.</P>
