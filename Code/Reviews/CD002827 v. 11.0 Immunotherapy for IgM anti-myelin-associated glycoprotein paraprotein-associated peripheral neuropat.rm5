<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-09-30 20:11:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>What are the benefits and harms of immune treatments for peripheral neuropathy caused by an IgM paraprotein antibody that may bind to myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG)?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>There are several types of antibodies in the human body. They are more or less specifically adapted to recognise a target, usually a 'foreign' protein such as a bit of a bacterium, virus or tumour. In some people too much of one type of antibody is made, called a paraprotein. Some of these paraproteins are of the IgM class (IgM antibodies are usually an 'early attack force' type of antibody). Some of these antibodies may react against myelin-associated glycoprotein, also known as MAG. MAG is a molecule on the insulating myelin sheath of nerves. The antibody probably results in damage to the nerve myelin to which it is bound and thus causes a specific type of damage to the nerves, known as a peripheral neuropathy. Anti-MAG paraprotein-associated peripheral neuropathy is a condition affecting more men than women, most commonly over the age of 60 years. It causes progressive sensory symptoms, unsteadiness and tremor, and sometimes some weakness of the feet and lower legs.</P>
<P>Treatments that act on the immune system such as plasma exchange (which removes circulating antibodies and replaces blood plasma with a clean plasma substitute), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg; antibodies that have been purified from donated blood), rituximab (which kills some of the cells that produce the antibody), corticosteroids, or anticancer drugs might be expected to reduce levels of these neuropathy-causing IgM antibodies and slow or prevent progression of the disease.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>Many of these therapies have been tried in non-randomised studies, but we found only eight small randomised controlled trials (RCTs), involving 236 participants, that met our criteria for inclusion.</P>
<P>
<B>Results and quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Two trials with 22 and 11 participants (20 with antibodies against MAG) suggest that IVIg may sometimes produce short-term measurable benefit and is relatively safe, but the benefit is of doubtful clinical significance. No severe adverse effects related to IVIg were reported in these trials. A trial of cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids showed some mild benefit. Two trials of rituximab demonstrated a positive benefit of rituximab, but this evidence was of low quality because of small numbers of participants and concerns about the design of one of the two studies. Reported adverse effects of rituximab were few, and mostly minor. Other trials did not allow us to draw conclusions about the efficacy of other agents and reported few serious adverse events. We need large, well-designed RCTs to assess the efficacy of the existing and new therapies, and better ways for doctors and researchers to detect changes that people report in response to treatments.</P>
<P>The evidence is up to date to February 2016.<BR/>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-09-30 20:06:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>Serum monoclonal anti-myelin-associated glycoprotein (anti-MAG) antibodies may be pathogenic in some people with immunoglobulin M (IgM) paraprotein and demyelinating neuropathy. Immunotherapies aimed at reducing the level of these antibodies might be expected to be beneficial. This is an update of a review first published in 2003 and previously updated in 2006 and 2012.</P>

<P>To assess the effects of immunotherapy for IgM anti-MAG paraprotein-associated demyelinating peripheral neuropathy.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-09-27 18:12:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>On 1 February 2016 we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and Embase for randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We also checked trials registers and bibliographies, and contacted authors and experts in the field.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-10-03 10:05:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs involving participants of any age treated with any type of immunotherapy for anti-MAG antibody-associated demyelinating peripheral neuropathy with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and of any severity.</P>
<P>Our primary outcome measures were numbers of participants improved in disability assessed with either or both of the Neuropathy Impairment Scale (NIS) or the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at six months after randomisation. Secondary outcome measures were: mean improvement in disability, assessed with either the NIS or the mRS, 12 months after randomisation; change in impairment as measured by improvement in the 10-metre walk time, change in a validated linear disability measure such as the Rasch-built Overall Disability Scale (R-ODS) at six and 12 months after randomisation, change in subjective clinical scores and electrophysiological parameters at six and 12 months after randomisation; change in serum IgM paraprotein concentration or anti-MAG antibody titre at six months after randomisation; and adverse effects of treatments.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-08-23 17:43:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We followed standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-09-30 20:06:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>We identified eight eligible trials (236 participants), which tested intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), interferon alfa-2a, plasma exchange, cyclophosphamide and steroids, and rituximab. Two trials of IVIg (22 and 11 participants, including 20 with antibodies against MAG), had comparable interventions and outcomes, but both were short-term trials. We also included two trials of rituximab with comparable interventions and outcomes.</P>
<P>There were very few clinical or statistically significant benefits of the treatments used on the outcomes predefined for this review, but not all the predefined outcomes were used in every included trial and more responsive outcomes are being developed. A well-performed trial of IVIg, which was at low risk of bias, showed a statistical benefit in terms of improvement in mRS at two weeks and 10-metre walk time at four weeks, but these short-term outcomes are of questionable clinical significance. Cyclophosphamide failed to show any benefit in the single trial's primary outcome, and showed a barely significant benefit in the primary outcome specified here, but some toxic adverse events were identified.</P>
<P>Two trials of rituximab (80 participants) have been published, one of which (26 participants) was at high risk of bias. In the meta-analysis, although the data are of low quality, rituximab is beneficial in improving disability scales (Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and Treatment (INCAT) improved at eight to 12 months (risk ratio (RR) 3.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.30 to 9.45; 73 participants)) and significantly more participants improve in the global impression of change score (RR 1.86, 95% CI 1.27 to 2.71; 70 participants). Other measures did not improve significantly, but wide CIs do not preclude some effect. Reported adverse effects of rituximab were few, and mostly minor.</P>
<P>There were few serious adverse events in the other trials.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-09-28 10:57:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>There is inadequate reliable evidence from trials of immunotherapies in anti-MAG paraproteinaemic neuropathy to form an evidence base supporting any particular immunotherapy treatment. IVIg has a statistically but probably not clinically significant benefit in the short term. The meta-analysis of two trials of rituximab provides, however, low-quality evidence of a benefit from this agent. The conclusions of this meta-analysis await confirmation, as one of the two included studies is of very low quality. We require large well-designed randomised trials of at least 12 months' duration to assess existing or novel therapies, preferably employing unified, consistent, well-designed, responsive, and valid outcome measures.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2016-10-03 11:22:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-10-03 10:48:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>Up to 10% of people with a peripheral neuropathy which is not secondary to another primary illness have a paraprotein in the serum (<LINK REF="REF-Kelly-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelly 1981</LINK>). A paraprotein is an abnormal protein produced by bone marrow cells and may belong to one of the three classes of immunoglobulin (Ig), IgG, IgA or IgM. The majority of paraproteins in people with peripheral neuropathy are IgM, produced by an initially benign condition of blood cells called monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Of this group of paraproteins, 50% react with the CD57/HNK-1 carbohydrate epitope found on myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG). This epitope is also found on other peripheral nerve myelin molecules (myelin protein zero, peripheral myelin protein 22, sulphated glucuronyl paragloboside (SGPG), sulphated glucuronyl lactosaminyl paragloboside (SGLPG) and others) but the antibodies are commonly referred to as anti-MAG.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-09-28 10:58:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>The clinical neuropathy associated with anti-MAG antibodies is usually relatively phenotypically homogeneous, and consists of a slowly progressive distal sensorimotor neuropathy with a variable degree of ataxia and prominent tremor (<LINK REF="REF-Chassande-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chassande 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yeung-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yeung 1991</LINK>). The neurophysiological features are demyelination, characteristically with more slowing of conduction in the distal than the proximal nerve segments (<LINK REF="REF-Kaku-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaku 1994</LINK>). The term anti-MAG IgM paraproteinaemic demyelinating peripheral neuropathy (PDPN) is therefore sometimes used to refer to this condition.</P>
<P>Other antibody reactivities exist in people with neuropathy and an IgM paraprotein and they have tentatively been classified into small homogeneous groupings. Examples include motor neuropathies with anti-GM1 antibodies (<LINK REF="REF-Steck-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steck 1996</LINK>), chronic sensory ataxic neuropathy associated with antibodies to GQ1b and other gangliosides with at least two sialic acid groups called CANOMAD (<LINK REF="REF-Willison-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Willison 2001</LINK>), and sensory demyelinating neuropathies with anti-sulfatide antibodies (<LINK REF="REF-Ferrari-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferrari 1998</LINK>). However, the most clearly described, relatively homogeneous group remains the neuropathy associated with IgM anti-MAG antibodies, the subject of this review.<BR/>
<BR/>Considerable evidence exists that anti-MAG antibodies are pathogenic. Deposits of the IgM paraprotein have been demonstrated in sural nerves of affected people (<LINK REF="REF-Takatsu-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Takatsu 1985</LINK>). The paraprotein is bound to myelin in a similar distribution to MAG. In some cases the binding has been associated with the deposition of activated complement components (<LINK REF="REF-Hays-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hays 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Monaco-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Monaco 1990</LINK>). Demyelination has also been induced in some animal models by the passive transfer of anti-MAG antibodies (<LINK REF="REF-Tatum-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tatum 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Willison-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Willison 1988</LINK>), and more recently by immunisation with SGPG (<LINK REF="REF-Ilyas-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ilyas 2008</LINK>). People have been reported to respond to immunotherapies, the improvement sometimes correlating with a reduction in levels of IgM (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 1999</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-10-03 10:48:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>There are a number of possible therapies which have been described as effective in the treatment of anti-MAG paraproteinaemic neuropathy, including plasma exchange, corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), cyclophosphamide, fludarabine and cytarabine, chlorambucil, alpha-interferon, rituximab or combinations of these agents. These are described below in the <LINK TAG="RESULTS" TYPE="SECTION">Results</LINK> and <LINK TAG="DISCUSSION" TYPE="SECTION">Discussion</LINK> sections.</P>
<P>Currently, treatment is largely decided on the informed choice of the individual. Many people are too old or too mildly affected to make the risks of treatment worthwhile. There are only eight randomised controlled trials (RCTs) testing the efficacy of the various immunosuppressive regimens in IgM paraproteinaemic neuropathies (<LINK REF="STD-Comi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Comi 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dalakas-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Dalakas 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dalakas-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dalakas 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dyck-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dyck 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-L_x00e9_ger-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Léger 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mariette-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Mariette 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mariette-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mariette 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Niermeijer-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Niermeijer 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oksenhendler-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Oksenhendler 1995</LINK>). Most case series have been small, included diverse groups of participants and have not presented results of efficacy clearly.</P>

<P>We included participants of any age with a diagnosis of MGUS, demyelinating neuropathy and anti-MAG antibodies. Other causes of peripheral neuropathy should have been ruled out.</P>

<P>As anti-MAG methods varied, we accepted positive anti-MAG results as reported by the trial authors and we did not define a threshold titre for positivity.</P>
<P>The neuropathy was to be typical distal symmetrical sensory or sensorimotor and should fit published criteria for slowing of motor nerve conduction in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (<LINK REF="REF-Ad-Hoc-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ad Hoc 1991</LINK> or <LINK REF="REF-Nicolas-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicolas 2002</LINK>), with or without prominent slowing in distal nerve segments.

We considered the following therapies for inclusion: plasmapheresis or plasma exchange or selective apheresis, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), corticosteroids (prednisolone, prednisone, methylprednisolone, dexamethasone), chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, fludarabine,cladribine, interferon alfa-2a, adriamycin, melphalan, and monoclonal antibody-based therapies (for example, rituximab). We considered comparisons versus placebo, another treatment, or an alternative dosage or treatment protocol. Therapies could be administered using any protocol (for example, single agent, combined therapy or sequential administration). If the control arm received a co-intervention then the experimental arm had to also receive that same treatment.</P>

<P>We selected the NIS and mRS as primary outcome measures, as we considered them to be broad, commonly-used scores that were potentially easy to retrospectively derive from collected data. We predefined six months as the favoured time point for re-evaluation on the basis that IgM anti-MAG paraprotein-associated neuropathy is a chronic and slowly progressive disorder. A reduction in either score indicates improvement and as there is no published minimum clinically important difference for the NIS, we defined a 10% change as improvement.</P>

<P>Up to 2006, a search of the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register revealed 12 possible trials. Searching MEDLINE and Embase with the same strategy and handsearching bibliographies failed to reveal further trials. A further search to July 2009 for the update identified trials and papers as follows: CENTRAL: 4, MEDLINE: 679 (13 papers reviewed), and Embase: 212 (seven reviewed). Review of the full texts identified two new eligible studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dalakas-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dalakas 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Niermeijer-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Niermeijer 2007</LINK>).

<P>The eight included studies enrolled 236 participants (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>), of whom 104 were treated at some stage with the study intervention. In only three trials were all the predeclared inclusion criteria met (<LINK REF="STD-Comi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Comi 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dalakas-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dalakas 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Niermeijer-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Niermeijer 2007</LINK>). Three studies stated that the participants had benign monoclonal gammopathy or monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (<LINK REF="STD-Comi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Comi 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dalakas-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dalakas 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Niermeijer-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Niermeijer 2007</LINK>). Other studies may have included participants with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia (<LINK REF="STD-Mariette-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Mariette 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mariette-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mariette 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oksenhendler-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Oksenhendler 1995</LINK>), or participants with other causes of neuropathy (<LINK REF="STD-Dalakas-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Dalakas 1996</LINK>). Three studies stated that all participants had a demyelinating neuropathy (<LINK REF="STD-Comi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Comi 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dalakas-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Dalakas 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dalakas-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dalakas 2009</LINK>), but only one of these stipulated the electrophysiological criteria for demyelination used (<LINK REF="STD-Comi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Comi 2002</LINK>). All of the included participants had serum IgM anti-MAG activity tested but this was established by various methods of western blotting, immunofluorescence or anti-SGPG ELISA testing. In total, 194 of 236 participants had anti-MAG activity, and in four of eight studies all the participants in the study had anti-MAG activity (<LINK REF="STD-Dalakas-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dalakas 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-L_x00e9_ger-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Léger 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mariette-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Mariette 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mariette-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mariette 2000</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Niermeijer-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Niermeijer 2007</LINK> stated that numbers of participants were too small to establish an effect of anti-MAG antibodies and no original data were available to analyse the subgroup of anti-MAG participants in the other three studies.</P>
<P>The interventions and trial designs of the eight included studies were widely different. Two studies compared IVIg with placebo in a placebo-controlled cross-over design (<LINK REF="STD-Comi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Comi 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dalakas-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Dalakas 1996</LINK>). Both of these studies included a one-month minimum washout period between the cross-over arms, considered rather short given the half-life of IgG, even though <LINK REF="STD-Comi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Comi 2002</LINK> gave a single dose of IVIg compared to the three monthly doses in <LINK REF="STD-Dalakas-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Dalakas 1996</LINK>. One study compared interferon alfa-2a with IVIg in an open-label design (<LINK REF="STD-Mariette-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Mariette 1997</LINK>) and another with placebo in a double-blind design (<LINK REF="STD-Mariette-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mariette 2000</LINK>). One study compared chlorambucil alone with a combination of chlorambucil and plasma exchange (<LINK REF="STD-Oksenhendler-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Oksenhendler 1995</LINK>). The most recent trials studied the effect of cyclophosphamide and prednisolone (<LINK REF="STD-Niermeijer-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Niermeijer 2007</LINK>), or rituximab (<LINK REF="STD-Dalakas-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dalakas 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-L_x00e9_ger-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Léger 2013</LINK>).

<P>See <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK> for a summary of the review authors' 'Risk of bias' assessments for the included studies.</P>
<P>All the included trials had a randomised design and participants were randomly assigned to receive the intervention or control for the whole trial, or the first arm in cross-over studies (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). All but one of the studies stipulated explicit diagnostic criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Dalakas-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Dalakas 1996</LINK>). Baseline characteristics were not significantly different in six of the studies, but in <LINK REF="STD-Dalakas-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dalakas 2009</LINK> the groups were very unbalanced with very few men in the rituximab-treated group at randomisation. Differences in baseline characteristics were also present in <LINK REF="STD-Dalakas-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Dalakas 1996</LINK>. </P>
<P>The trials of IVIg both had low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Comi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Comi 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dalakas-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Dalakas 1996</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Dalakas-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Dalakas 1996</LINK>, the risk of bias was a little greater, as allocation concealment was unclear and the participants randomised to placebo were much older than in the IVIg arm, although this did not reach significance with the nine anti-MAG participants included. However, the sensory scores were significantly higher in the placebo group than the IVIg-treated group. Furthermore, this study did not state explicit diagnostic criteria. Both trials suffer from a short washout period and a potential carry-over effect, although this would be expected to reduce the significance of any therapeutic effect of IVIg.</P>
<P>Mariette et al studied interferon alfa-2a in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Mariette-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Mariette 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mariette-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mariette 2000</LINK>). The second study was blinded and controlled and at a much lower risk of bias than the preliminary randomised open trial. Four of 10 participants in the IVIg group in <LINK REF="STD-Mariette-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Mariette 1997</LINK> and three of 12 in the interferon group in <LINK REF="STD-Mariette-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mariette 2000</LINK> dropped out early in the trial, which may confound results in these small groups.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Oksenhendler-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Oksenhendler 1995</LINK> studied plasma exchange plus chlorambucil versus chlorambucil alone. As a result of the plasma exchange procedure, the blinding and allocation concealment were inadequate. Furthermore, although dropouts were balanced in the two groups (four of 22 in one group and four of 23 in the other), and the investigators performed an intention-to-treat analysis, the dropout numbers were deemed significant given the small number of included participants. Overall, we judged the risk of bias in this small study to be high.</P>
<P>The first published RCT of rituximab for paraproteinaemic demyelinating peripheral neuropathy (PDPN) was at high overall risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Dalakas-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dalakas 2009</LINK>). The treatment groups at entry were unbalanced with respect to sex distribution (PDPN affects more men than women, but only two of 13 participants randomised to treatment were men). The randomisation method was not clear, and although the National Institutes of Health (NIH) pharmacy provided drug and placebo, it is not clear that the trial maintained allocation concealment. Most importantly, one participant was randomised and then removed from the trial having received rituximab and suffered an adverse event; this participant's data were not analysed. A further participant was removed at the analysis stage when it became clear the person did not fulfil the inclusion criteria; statistical analyses were done including and excluding this participant. We judged a second trial of rituximab to be at low risk of bias. The trial was entered in <A HREF="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</A>, but the published protocol does not contain all outcomes presented in the trial report, which appear to have been added post protocol publication. To clarify the meta-analysis, we requested trial data from the authors of these two studies. Data were provided for <LINK REF="STD-L_x00e9_ger-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Léger 2013</LINK>. The authors of <LINK REF="STD-Dalakas-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dalakas 2009</LINK> were unable to provide any outcome data for their trial, which were lost with a retiring colleague.</P>
<P>We considered the study of cyclophosphamide and steroid to be at low risk of bias in all domains (<LINK REF="STD-Niermeijer-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Niermeijer 2007</LINK>). We analysed the first six months of the trial, as after this point participants who experienced a clinical decline were rerandomised to treatment with a different corticosteroid or cyclophosphamide.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">General comment</HEADING>
<P>Two trials compared IVIg with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Comi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Comi 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dalakas-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Dalakas 1996</LINK>). Their designs differed in IVIg dose and outcome measures and neither provided six- or 12-month assessments.</P>
<P>Two trials tested rituximab in a very similar group of participants, using fairly similar outcomes. In <LINK REF="STD-Dalakas-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dalakas 2009</LINK>, 26 participants were randomised to rituximab or a placebo infusion. There were concerns about the validity of the statistical manipulations used in this trial (see above and below) and corroborative data were not available. <LINK REF="STD-L_x00e9_ger-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Léger 2013</LINK> also studied rituximab and randomised 54 participants to rituximab or placebo. The study produced similar results to <LINK REF="STD-Dalakas-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dalakas 2009</LINK> (see analysis below). The trial data were analysed at slightly different time points, but the review authors considered eight- and 12- month outcomes similar enough in this slowly changing disease.</P>
<P>The other four trials tested different interventions or combinations of treatment. <LINK REF="STD-Oksenhendler-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Oksenhendler 1995</LINK> compared plasma exchange with no plasma exchange in participants receiving chlorambucil. Mariette et al compared IVIg with interferon alfa-2a (<LINK REF="STD-Mariette-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Mariette 1997</LINK>), and, in a follow-up study, interferon alfa-2a with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Mariette-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mariette 2000</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Niermeijer-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Niermeijer 2007</LINK> randomised participants to cyclophosphamide and prednisolone pulses or placebo in a six-month-long phase one of a 24-month trial. To satisfy ethical concerns, any participant who deteriorated in phase one was reassigned to cyclophosphamide and prednisolone (if they had received placebo in phase one) or dexamethasone (if they had received cyclophosphamide and prednisolone) (termed phase 2 of the study), making the 24-month outcomes difficult to assess. In phase two the placebo group was not truly randomised, as phase two contained only participants who had not improved on placebo, nine of 19 participants having switched to active treatment in phase two. After discussion of the trial data released by the trial authors, we did not include six-month to 24-month outcomes in the analysis.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Primary outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>One trial with 22 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Comi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Comi 2002</LINK>), of IVIg versus placebo in IgM paraprotein-associated neuropathy used the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). However, this was a short trial and the investigators only measured the primary outcome at two and four weeks, not at six months. Eleven of 22 participants had anti-MAG antibodies but the data concerning the anti-MAG participant subgroup were not available. At two weeks, the mRS score showed a significant improvement with IVIg (-0.38, standard deviation (SD) 0.58) over placebo (+0.19, SD 0.51) at two weeks (P = 0.008), a difference that may not be clinically significant. No significant difference between the groups was present at four weeks.</P>
<P>The primary outcome of <LINK REF="STD-Comi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Comi 2002</LINK> was the Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and Treatment (INCAT) disability score at four weeks. This was not one of our prespecified outcome measures (see <LINK TAG="DISCUSSION" TYPE="SECTION">Discussion</LINK>). After two weeks, the INCAT disability score did not change significantly; there was no difference between the groups and no evidence of a carry-over effect. After four weeks, the INCAT disability score decreased by a mean of 0.55 (SD 0.67) grades in the IVIg period (P = 0.001), with no significant change (mean 0.05 (SD 0.90)) in the placebo period. Only the mean difference (MD) between the treatment effects in the two four-week periods was significant (0.5 of a grade, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.00 to 1.00).</P>

<P>a. One trial assessed the 10-metre walk (<LINK REF="STD-Comi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Comi 2002</LINK>), but only at four weeks in the first arm of the study, as there was significant evidence of a carry-over effect into the second arm. There was a significant reduction in 10-metre walk time with IVIg compared with placebo in the whole IgM treatment group (MD 2.77 seconds, 95% CI 0.01 to 5.54). No data were available on the anti-MAG participants alone, but the trial authors state that MAG antibodies "did not influence the response to IVIg treatment".</P>

In <LINK REF="STD-Dalakas-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Dalakas 1996</LINK>, no serious adverse events occurred as a result of IVIg infusion, but mild and transient effects were "more common in the IVIg than the placebo group".

<P>The mRS was not assessed. The Neuropathy Impairment Scale (NIS) was the primary outcome in both studies involving interferon alfa-2a (referred to as the Clinical Neuropathy Disability Score (CNDS), a scale derived with minor modifications from the NIS, maximum score 93 (higher scores indicate greater disability)). In the initial randomised but open parallel-group study of interferon alfa-2a versus IVIg (<LINK REF="STD-Mariette-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Mariette 1997</LINK>), participants in the IVIg group worsened by a mean of 2.3 (SD 7.6) points on the NIS at six months, and those in the interferon alfa-2a group improved by 7.5 (11.1) points, a MD of 9.80 (95% CI 1.46 to 18.14, n = 20) in favour of interferon alfa-2a (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). However, <LINK REF="STD-Mariette-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mariette 2000</LINK> (n = 24), a randomised and blinded trial of interferon alfa-2a versus placebo at low risk of bias, failed to confirm the beneficial effect of interferon alfa-2a in the primary outcome at six months (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>).</P>

<P>The two trials derived a subjective clinical score (<LINK REF="STD-Mariette-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Mariette 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mariette-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mariette 2000</LINK>). In the unblinded 1997 study, the subjective scores improved significantly in favour of interferon alfa-2a over IVIg (MD 3.10, 95% CI 1.02 to 5.18, n = 20; <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). In the later blinded and reported 'negative' placebo-controlled study of interferon alfa-2a, the subjective scores were not presented in the published data.</P>
<P>The presence of sural sensory nerve action potentials (SNAPs) was examined at six months in both studies. The number of participants with detectable sural nerve SNAPs did not improve with either interferon alfa-2a or IVIg in the first study and exhibited "no significant improvement" in the second (data not presented). More participants had recordable median SNAPs after six months treatment with interferon alfa-2a (2/7 improved to 5/7) compared to IVIg (4/8 declined to 1/8) in the first study (<LINK REF="STD-Mariette-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Mariette 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Mariette-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Mariette 1997</LINK>, IgM paraprotein bands and anti-MAG activity were still detectable at six months in all participants but only decreased significantly in two participants receiving interferon alfa-2a (50% reduction each).

Interferon alfa-2a caused flu-like symptoms in all 10 participants in the open study (<LINK REF="STD-Mariette-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Mariette 1997</LINK>), which were persistent and required tapering of the dose in three (moderate side effects). A further three participants required dose-tapering for systemic adverse effects (also moderate). One of 10 participants in the IVIg treatment group withdrew because of self-limiting erythroderma (<LINK REF="STD-Mariette-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Mariette 1997</LINK>). No other mild or moderate side effects were reported with IVIg.</P>
<P>In the placebo-controlled, blinded study, two of 12 participants withdrew from the study because of side effects (severe), one with diarrhoea and one with flu-like symptoms (<LINK REF="STD-Mariette-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mariette 2000</LINK>). One participant withdrew with worsening of neuropathy. There were no other severe side effects reported for interferon alfa-2a.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Rituximab versus placebo</HEADING>
<P>In 2012 only one study had been published using rituximab as an intervention for paraproteinaemic neuropathy that fulfilled our inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Dalakas-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dalakas 2009</LINK>). A second study called RiMAG has now been published and we include it here (<LINK REF="STD-L_x00e9_ger-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Léger 2013</LINK>). See <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Dalakas-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dalakas 2009</LINK> randomised 26 participants to receive either rituximab or placebo at a standard dose of four infusions of 375 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP> every week for four weeks. Outcomes were measured at eight months (which for the purposes of this review we have used as six-month outcomes). One randomised participant had a severe anaphylactic adverse event with the first infusion of the drug. The participant was replaced and not included in any further analysis. One further participant randomised to rituximab and treated in accord with the protocol was found to have had an INCAT leg score at entry of zero (inadvertently assigned as 1 at entry). He could not therefore have improved. We have performed the analysis here with the participant included as in the protocol for this review.</P>
<P>Some discrepancies exist in the results in the published paper (see below) (<LINK REF="STD-Dalakas-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dalakas 2009</LINK>). These were resolved through enquiry with the trial author. Original trial data were not made available in 2012 and further requests in 2014 and 2015 were not fruitful. Trial data were "entered directly by the statistician who retired more than 10 years ago" and he was untraceable.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-L_x00e9_ger-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Léger 2013</LINK> randomised 54 participants to receive either rituximab in a standard 375 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP> dose or placebo. Outcomes were measured at 0 and 12 months, but upon request, the trial authors also made nine-month data available for the INCAT scale, change in INCAT scale and IgM levels, to correspond to outcomes of <LINK REF="STD-Dalakas-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dalakas 2009</LINK>. We requested data for the leg subscale of the INCAT score but these were not available. The outcomes in the published and amended <A HREF="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</A> protocol are limited and do not fully correspond to the outcomes in the methods section of the published paper (which are those with results). There is no suggestion of suppression of negative outcome data or selective reporting, but these outcomes could have been decided post hoc.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Primary outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>These two studies included neither the NIS nor the mRS as outcomes. The INCAT leg score reported in <LINK REF="STD-Dalakas-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dalakas 2009</LINK> corresponds broadly to the mRS and thus we used this in our analysis both as a continuous and a dichotomous outcome. For the dichotomous improvement we have compared the leg score at eight months from <LINK REF="STD-Dalakas-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dalakas 2009</LINK> with the dichotomous complete INCAT score at 12 months from <LINK REF="STD-L_x00e9_ger-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Léger 2013</LINK> (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). The RR for improvement was 3.51, 95% CI 1.30 to 9.45 (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, 73 participants). We will perform a six-month meta-analysis if other studies become available. Using the published eight-month data from <LINK REF="STD-Dalakas-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dalakas 2009</LINK> and 12-month data from <LINK REF="STD-L_x00e9_ger-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Léger 2013</LINK>, the mean improvement in the INCAT leg disability score (MD -0.45, 95% CI -0.85 to -0.05; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%) was statistically significant, whether the INCAT 0-score participant from <LINK REF="STD-Dalakas-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dalakas 2009</LINK> was included in the analysis or not (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>). Participant-level data obtained for nine-month improvement from <LINK REF="STD-L_x00e9_ger-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Léger 2013</LINK> (not published), which are at a more comparable time point to <LINK REF="STD-Dalakas-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dalakas 2009</LINK>, give a MD of -0.33, 95% CI -0.73 to 0.07 (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, 70 participants) in the same direction as the longer time point but including the possibility of no effect (<LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>).</P>
<P>(Note: in the published paper of <LINK REF="STD-Dalakas-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dalakas 2009</LINK> there is a discrepancy between the data for the INCAT leg score in the text and in the published table. We checked the data with the trial authors who gave verbal clarification and we included the correct figures. No recorded trial data were made available.)</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Secondary outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>Secondary outcomes that we could include in our analyses were the 10-metre walk time, the change in IgM levels, and anti-MAG titre, but these were all measured at eight months in <LINK REF="STD-Dalakas-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dalakas 2009</LINK> and at 12 months in <LINK REF="STD-L_x00e9_ger-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Léger 2013</LINK>. Nine-month data were not available for <LINK REF="STD-L_x00e9_ger-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Léger 2013</LINK> except for the IgM levels.</P>
<P>The 10-metre walk times did not improve significantly, either in terms of time to walk (MD -0.35 seconds, 95% CI -1.89 to 1.19; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, 68 participants) or numbers of participants improved (RR 1.80, 95% CI 0.83 to 3.92; 26 participants; <LINK REF="STD-Dalakas-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dalakas 2009</LINK> only - data from Léger requested; <LINK REF="CMP-003.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.5</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-003.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.6</LINK>). As might be expected, there was a measurable and significant decrease in the level of serum IgM eight months after rituximab (reduction of 286 mg/dL, 95% CI 329 to 244; 26 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-003.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.7</LINK>). Less expected (from reports of other studies of treatment of anti-MAG neuropathy) but not surprising was a decrease in the titre of anti-MAG activity of -17.79 units/mL (95% CI -33.33 to -2.25; <LINK REF="CMP-003.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.8</LINK>; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, 71 participants).</P>

Most adverse events were minor, including mild temperature increases and chills, headaches and mild hypotension, nausea, vomiting, dizziness and lightheadedness, and rash. One severe adverse event of bronchospasm led to the participant being removed from <LINK REF="STD-Dalakas-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dalakas 2009</LINK>, despite receiving the drug; his data were not included in the published results. In <LINK REF="STD-L_x00e9_ger-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Léger 2013</LINK>, one participant with rituximab was withdrawn from the study after developing a bradycardia.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2016-10-03 11:22:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Randomised controlled trials (RCTs)</HEADING>
<P>We identified eight RCTs for this update. Four fulfilled all our strict predefined inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Comi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Comi 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dalakas-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dalakas 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-L_x00e9_ger-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Léger 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Niermeijer-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Niermeijer 2007</LINK>). The trials of Comi, Leger and Niermeijer had a low risk of bias, whereas <LINK REF="STD-Dalakas-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dalakas 2009</LINK> had a high risk of bias in multiple domains (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). We included the four other RCTs that did not fulfil all the inclusion criteria, because their inclusion criteria closely approximated to those intended.</P>
<P>According to evidence from two trials, IVIg may produce some short-term benefit in the treatment of anti-MAG IgM paraproteinaemic neuropathy. One double-blind, placebo-controlled study with minimal bias showed benefit of IVIg at four weeks in one of the primary outcome measures (mRS) and the 10-metre walk time secondary outcome measure but no other significant outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Comi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Comi 2002</LINK>). The outcomes were available only at four weeks and were not available for the predefined endpoints of six and 12 months; it is not clear whether any short-term benefit would be sustained or whether IVIg is clinically useful. Furthermore, this trial was of IgM paraproteinaemic neuropathy and not all the included participants had associated anti-MAG activity. Evidence for any benefit from IVIg should be regarded with caution.</P>
<P>Two trials with interferon alfa-2a gave contradictory results. Interferon alfa-2a appeared to be of benefit in treating anti-MAG neuropathy when tested in an open trial with IVIg (<LINK REF="STD-Mariette-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Mariette 1997</LINK>). Because this trial was not blinded it was at high risk of bias. The later, less biased, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of interferon alfa-2a did not demonstrate any significant benefit from interferon alfa-2a (<LINK REF="STD-Mariette-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mariette 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>A single trial assessed the use of plasma exchange as additional treatment to chlorambucil (<LINK REF="STD-Oksenhendler-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Oksenhendler 1995</LINK>). No additional benefit was gained from the addition of plasma exchange in the predefined outcome measures at four or 12 months. This relatively large study lacked blinding and allocation concealment, and the results should therefore be interpreted with caution. Since the trial showed no additional benefit from plasma exchange, any possible bias did not lead to a significant result.</P>
<P>A number of case reports and small case series have described use of rituximab for the treatment of paraproteinaemic neuropathy (<LINK REF="STD-Barohn-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Barohn 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Benedetti-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Benedetti 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Benedetti-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Benedetti 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Benedetti-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Benedetti 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Canavan-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Canavan 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Delmont-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delmont 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goldfarb-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Goldfarb 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gono-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gono 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gorson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gorson 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kelly-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelly 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kilidireas-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kilidireas 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Latov-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Latov 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Levine-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levine 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pestronk-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Pestronk 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Renaud-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Renaud 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Renaud-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Renaud 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weide-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weide 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Niermeijer-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Niermeijer 2009</LINK>). The results were varied, with most reporting positive outcomes in the majority of participants but some very usefully reporting no response in all their reported cases (<LINK REF="STD-Barohn-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Barohn 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rojas_x002d_Garc_x00ed_a-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rojas-García 2003</LINK>), and some reporting deteriorations (<LINK REF="REF-Broglio-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Broglio 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gironi-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gironi 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Noronha-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noronha 2006</LINK>). We included the first rituximab RCT in the 2012 update (<LINK REF="STD-Dalakas-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dalakas 2009</LINK>), and we now include a further RCT (<LINK REF="STD-L_x00e9_ger-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Léger 2013</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Dalakas-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dalakas 2009</LINK> had a high risk of bias in two assessed domains and unclear risks in three others of the six assessed. As such, we assessed the evidence from this trial as very low quality across the outcomes stipulated. The results should therefore be regarded with caution. With the removal of a participant from the analysis who should perhaps not have been randomised, the trial reported improvements in the INCAT leg score and the 10-metre walk time, and in the whole group, the IgM levels and anti-MAG titres. The study reported seven of 13 rituximab-treated participants compared to none of the 13 participants in the placebo group experiencing improvement in "patient clinical assessments and questionnaires". In our analysis, although there was a trend in favour of the treatment group in all analyses, none of the clinical outcomes were statistically significantly different from placebo. However, rituximab did reduce IgM levels and anti-MAG titres, as would be expected. The interpretation of the results in the original paper by the trial authors concludes that "The results warrant confirmation with a larger trial". We have now added the data from the larger and less biased <LINK REF="STD-L_x00e9_ger-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Léger 2013</LINK> to the meta-analysis. <LINK REF="STD-L_x00e9_ger-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Léger 2013</LINK> was reported as demonstrating no change in its primary and secondary outcomes. However, the outcome changes, where they are comparable, are all in a similar direction and of similar magnitude to those of <LINK REF="STD-Dalakas-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dalakas 2009</LINK> (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0% throughout). In meta-analysis, comparing rituximab to placebo, significant improvements are seen in numbers of participants improved on the INCAT score (although the magnitude of this does not reach clinical significance), the biological parameters (IgM, anti-MAG titres), the physical subscores of the SF36 (but not the mental), and perhaps importantly the patient clinical impression of change scores, both for improvement alone and stabilisation and improvement. The numbers of participants are small but the results demonstrate no heterogeneity. The results of <LINK REF="STD-L_x00e9_ger-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Léger 2013</LINK> are more robust, at less risk of bias and more reliable, and support an effect of rituximab in stabilising or improving anti-MAG neuropathy.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Niermeijer-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Niermeijer 2007</LINK> trialed cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids (CP) in combination, versus placebo. Ethical concerns led to modification of the protocol such that we could not use the data after the sixth month in the meta-analysis. We found no significant improvements in the functional scales used (mRS and RMI), as displayed here, from moderate-quality evidence. The trial reports significant improvements in validated impairment measures of strength and sensory dysfunction (not predefined outcomes in this meta-analysis), which did not translate into functional benefits.</P>
<P>This review has identified many problems with the trials of treatment for this indication, including variations in trial design, participant inclusion and exclusion criteria, analysis points, and outcome measures. Only six of the eight trials were blinded. Some trials employed a cross-over design, which must be allowed for in analysis. In one study an alteration in the trial design for ethical reasons meant that data beyond the six-month time point were not usable in this analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Niermeijer-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Niermeijer 2007</LINK>). Most studies did not use validated clinical and disability scales that are likely to detect changes (for example, the INCAT Sensory Sum Score (<LINK REF="REF-Merkies-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merkies 2000</LINK>)) and these should be considered in future studies. Further, more sensitive scales measuring both disability and specific domains of impairment that are affected in this predominantly sensory neuropathy are being developed. Although <LINK REF="STD-Comi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Comi 2002</LINK> was possibly too short to detect meaningful changes, it did include validated, clinically useful, and reproducible endpoints such as the sensory sum score, 10-metre walking time, nine-hole peg test, the Rotterdam Scale (a handicap score), and the SF36 quality-of-life scale. <LINK REF="STD-Dalakas-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dalakas 2009</LINK> also used more up-to-date outcomes, although the trial was probably too small to detect significant change, and bias makes the results unreliable. Further work is ongoing to develop valid disability measures (see for example the <A HREF="http://www.comet-initiative.org/studies/details/252">PeriNomS project</A>). Objective endpoints such as presence of SNAPs were infrequently used, but in clinical practice these seldom change in the short to medium term. No study has included a measure of fatigue (<LINK REF="REF-Merkies-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merkies 1999</LINK>), which is prevalent in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy but has not been investigated in anti-MAG neuropathy. Furthermore, effective treatments, if identified, are likely to be expensive and possibly invasive, and investigators should therefore consider measures of quality of life and cost effectiveness in all trials.</P>
<P>Only four trials confined recruitment to participants with anti-MAG antibodies (<LINK REF="STD-Dalakas-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dalakas 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-L_x00e9_ger-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Léger 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mariette-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Mariette 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mariette-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mariette 2000</LINK>). The anti-MAG neuropathies constitute the majority of the IgM paraproteinaemic demyelinating neuropathies in terms of immunoreactivity. They are relatively homogeneous in their clinical features and are distinct from some other rare but identified subgroups (for example, those with IgM anti-GM1/GD1b reactivity). Many IgM paraproteinaemic neuropathies have no identified antigen target and yet are not clinically very different from those with anti-MAG antibodies. This is often used as an argument that anti-MAG antibodies are not relevant in the pathogenesis. Although this may be the case, there is a considerable body of evidence in favour of anti-MAG antibodies causing demyelination, as described in the <LINK TAG="BACKGROUND" TYPE="SECTION">Background</LINK>. Lack of anti-MAG antibodies may simply reflect low detection through inadequate immunological identification, or alternative antigenic targets yet to be described. Subgroup analysis by anti-MAG activity should be reported in future trials.</P>
<P>Cochrane is increasingly concerned about the quality of data supplied for systematic reviews from original trials where a number of instances of fraudulent publishing have been uncovered. Any future trials in the area should eradicate the need for suspicion about the data published, by publishing, in full, the trial protocol on a clinical trials website, making minimal change (but being transparent with the change if required), publishing all the predefined outcomes for all trials, and making the data available for scrutiny.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-10-03 00:20:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>The evidence from trials of immunotherapies in anti-myelin-associated glycoprotein (anti-MAG) paraprotein-associated peripheral neuropathies is inadequate to identify whether any particular immunotherapy treatment is significantly beneficial. The eight published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of immunotherapy in anti-MAG IgM paraproteinaemic neuropathy were all individually either too small, too short or too flawed for us to draw confident conclusions about the efficacy of individual treatments or comparisons between them.</P>
<P>In meta-analysis there is low-quality evidence (two small studies, one significantly biased including inconsistency, indirectness), that rituximab is of benefit in stabilising or improving anti-MAG neuropathy. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-10-02 22:10:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>The statistically significant short-term benefit from IVIg may not be clinically significant. The evidence is of low quality and needs further confirmation. More large, carefully-constructed, collaborative studies are required to identify whether anti-CD20 therapies or other treatments are effective. </P>
<P>The IgM paraproteinaemic neuropathies are chronic and slowly progressive. We chose to measure our outcomes at six and 12 months as these are more likely to reflect a time course over which measurable progression or recovery might occur. Endpoints of four weeks or even three to four months may not be long enough to detect clinical stabilisation or improvement. <LINK REF="STD-Dalakas-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dalakas 2009</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-L_x00e9_ger-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Léger 2013</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Niermeijer-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Niermeijer 2007</LINK> used sensible longer-term outcomes and future studies should replicate this. We would encourage the authors of future trials to collect consistent, comparable and clinically-meaningful endpoint data. We predefined our primary outcome measures as improvement in the Neuropathy Impairment Scale and modified Rankin Scale (disability) at six months. The inclusion of a disability measure in future trials would be appropriate, being relevant both to patients and to healthcare providers. We have included Rasch-built disability scores in the secondary outcome measures for future studies, as these show promise in reflecting change and more effectively representing a greater range of disability. These remain in development and have not so far appeared in any trial. Predictive scoring systems which allow the clinician to estimate the trajectory and likely outcome of patients at an early stage will allow people who warrant treatment to be identified earlier in the disease; work needs to be undertaken to study the natural history of the disease progression.</P>
<P>The Perinoms study is completed and a further study (Perinoms 2) is underway at the time of publication, which will define appropriate outcome measures for clinical and research outcome measurement in this condition.</P>
<P>Studies of other novel agents such as cladribine or fludarabine may be indicated.</P>
