<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-02-19 14:07:33 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is some evidence that prebiotic added to infant formula may prevent eczema and asthma in infants. However, there is some concern about the reliability of the evidence due to not all trials reporting allergy outcomes and trials not reporting the outcome for all infants. Reactions to foods and allergies (including asthma, eczema and hay fever) are common and may be increasing. Many infants become sensitised to foods, including infant formula, through their gastrointestinal tract, a process that may be affected by the composition of the intestinal bacteria. Attempts to promote the growth of normal gastrointestinal bacteria and prevent sensitisation to foods have included the addition of prebiotic to infant formula. Prebiotics are nondigestible food components that help by selectively stimulating the growth or activity of 'healthy' bacteria in the colon. This review found some evidence that a prebiotic supplement added to infant feeds may prevent eczema in infants up to two years of age. It is unclear whether the use of prebiotic should be restricted to infants at high risk of allergy or may have an effect in low risk populations; or whether it may have an effect on other allergic diseases including asthma. However, further research is needed to confirm the findings before routine use of prebiotics can be recommended for prevention of allergy.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-02-19 14:07:33 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The 2012 update identified 13 studies classified as ongoing or awaiting classification (yet to report allergy outcomes). Forty-three studies were excluded, primarily as no allergy data were reported, although none of these enrolled infants were at high risk of allergy. Four studies enrolling 1428 infants were eligible for inclusion. All studies were at high risk of attrition bias. Allergy outcomes were reported from four months to two years of age.</P>
<P>Meta-analysis of two studies (226 infants) found no significant difference in infant asthma although significant heterogeneity was found between studies. Meta-analysis of four studies found a significant reduction in eczema (1218 infants, typical risk ratio 0.68, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.97; typical risk difference -0.04, 95% CI -0.07 to -0.00; number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 25, 95% CI 14 to &gt; 100; P = 0.03). No statistically significant heterogeneity was found between studies. One study reported no significant difference in urticaria.</P>
<P>No statistically significant subgroup differences were found according to infant risk of allergy or type of infant feed. However, individual studies reported a significant reduction in asthma and eczema from supplementation with a mixture of galacto- and fructo-oligosaccharide (GOS/FOS 9:1 ratio) (8 g/L) in infants at high risk of allergy; and in eczema from supplementation with GOS/FOS (9:1) (6.8 g/L) and acidic oligosacccharide (1.2 g/L) in infants not selected for allergy risk.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-02-19 14:07:33 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Food allergy and allergic disease are prevalent and represent a substantial health problem that may be increasing in developed countries (<LINK REF="REF-Burr-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burr 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schultz-Larsen-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schultz Larsen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Halken-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halken 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prescott-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prescott 2005</LINK>). Genetic susceptibility plays a large role in the development of food allergy. Although less than half of those who develop childhood allergic disease have a first degree relative with a history of allergy, the risk of development of allergy increases substantially with a positive family history of allergic disease. Approximately 10% of children without an allergic first degree relative develop allergic disease compared to 20% to 30% with an allergic first degree relative (parent or sibling) and 40% to 50% with two affected relatives (<LINK REF="REF-Kjellman-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjellman 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hansen-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hansen 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bergmann-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bergmann 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Arshad-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arshad 2005</LINK>). The manifestations of allergic disease are age dependent. Infants commonly present with symptoms and signs of atopic eczema, gastrointestinal symptoms and recurrent wheezing. Asthma and rhinoconjunctivitis become prevalent in later childhood. Sensitization to allergens tends to follow a characteristic pattern (<LINK REF="REF-Halken-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halken 2004</LINK>), with sensitization to food allergens in the first two to three years of life, followed by indoor allergens (for example, house dust mite and pets) and, subsequently, outdoor allergens (for example, rye and timothy grass). The cumulative prevalence of allergic disease in childhood is high, with up to 7% to 8% developing a food allergy, 15% to 20% atopic eczema, and 31% to 34% developing asthma or recurrent wheezing (<LINK REF="REF-Halken-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halken 2004</LINK>). Of these, 7% to 10% will continue to have asthma symptoms beyond five years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Halken-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halken 2004</LINK>). Food hypersensitivities affect approximately 6% of infants less than three years of age, with the prevalence decreasing over the first decade (<LINK REF="REF-Sampson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sampson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Osterballe-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osterballe 2005</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-02-18 17:16:10 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A major focus of current research is the mechanisms for the development of immune tolerance and allergen sensitization in the fetus and newborn as well as primary prevention strategies. This review focused on the evidence for use of prebiotic in infants for the prevention of food allergy and allergic disease. A separate review examines the effects of probiotics compared to no probiotics in infants for prevention of allergic disease and food allergy (<LINK REF="REF-Osborn-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osborn 2007a</LINK>). Prebiotics are nondigestible food components that benefit the host by selectively stimulating the growth or activity of bacteria in the colon. Prebiotics have frequently been added to infant formula. The most common prebiotic used in infant food is indigestible oligosaccharide, although other nitrogen and lipid containing compounds may also have a prebiotic effect (<LINK REF="REF-Agostoni-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agostoni 2004</LINK>). To be effective, prebiotic should escape digestion and absorption in the upper gastrointestinal tract, reach the large bowel, and be used selectively by microorganisms that have been identified as having health promoting properties. To date, studies in infants have demonstrated significant increases in faecal bifidobacteria in response to formula supplementation with oligosaccharides (<LINK REF="STD-Boehm-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Boehm 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moro-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Moro 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schmelzle-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmelzle 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Decsi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Decsi 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moro-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Moro 2006</LINK>). One study also demonstrated an increase in fecal lactobacilli (<LINK REF="STD-Moro-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Moro 2002</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-02-18 17:16:54 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>An altered microbial exposure in the gastrointestinal tract may be partly responsible for the increase of allergic diseases in populations with a western lifestyle (<LINK REF="REF-Holt-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holt 1997</LINK>). Differences in intestinal microflora are found in infants delivered by caesarean section when compared to those delivered vaginally, and in breast fed versus formula fed infants (<LINK REF="REF-Agostoni-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agostoni 2004</LINK>). Breast feeding promotes the colonization of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli that inhibit growth of pathogenic microorganisms and compete with potentially pathogenic bacteria for nutrients and epithelial adhesion sites. The gastrointestinal flora may modulate mucosal physiology, barrier function and systemic immunologic and inflammatory responses (<LINK REF="REF-Sudo-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sudo 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Agostoni-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agostoni 2004</LINK>). Food allergy is a manifestation of an abnormal mucosal immune response to ingested dietary antigens (<LINK REF="REF-Sampson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sampson 2004</LINK>). The gastrointestinal barrier is a complex physiochemical barrier and cellular barrier. However, some ingested food antigens are absorbed. The efficiency of this gastrointestinal barrier is reduced in the newborn period (<LINK REF="REF-Sampson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sampson 2004</LINK>). Perinatal risk factors reported for asthma or allergy, or both, have included prematurity (<LINK REF="REF-Jaakkola-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jaakkola 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Raby-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raby 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bernsen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernsen 2005</LINK>) and fetal growth restriction (<LINK REF="REF-Bernsen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernsen 2005</LINK>), both of which are associated with an immature and potentially injured gastrointestinal mucosal barrier. The composition of the intestinal microflora may be different in those with atopic eczema, and such differences may precede the development of eczema. The most consistent finding in such studies is a reduced proportion of bifidobacteria species in the faeces of infants with eczema (<LINK REF="REF-Bjorksten-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bjorksten 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murray-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 2005</LINK>) and atopic sensitization (<LINK REF="REF-Kalliomaki-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kalliomaki 2001</LINK>), but not in the faeces of children with asthmatic symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 2005</LINK>). The recognition of the importance of intestinal flora has led to the development of strategies aimed at manipulating bacterial colonization in formula fed infants, including the use of prebiotics and probiotics.</P>
<P>Prevention of allergy is divided into primary prevention, the prevention of immunological sensitization (development of IgE antibodies); and secondary prevention, the prevention of allergic disease following sensitization (<LINK REF="REF-Asher-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Asher 2004</LINK>). A substantial proportion of infants who develop sensitization will not go on to develop clinical manifestations of allergic disease or food allergy (<LINK REF="REF-Halken-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halken 2004</LINK>). This review focused on the prevention of clinical allergic disease (including asthma, eczema and allergic rhinitis) and food allergy. Since the risk of allergy and food allergy is affected by heredity, subgroup analysis examined the effect of prebiotic in populations of infants at high risk of allergy separately from infants at low risk or not selected on the basis of heredity. Since breast feeding promotes the colonization of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli (<LINK REF="REF-Agostoni-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agostoni 2004</LINK>), subgroup analysis examined the effect of prebiotic in human milk fed infants separately from prebiotic in formula fed infants.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-02-18 18:15:16 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The 2012 update identified 13 studies classified as ongoing or awaiting classification (yet to report allergy outcomes). Forty-three studies were excluded primarily as no allergy data were reported, although none of these enrolled infants at high risk of allergy. Four studies enrolling 1428 infants were eligible for inclusion. All studies were at high risk of attrition bias. Allergy outcomes were reported from four months to two years of age.</P>
<P>Meta-analysis of two studies (226 infants) found no significant difference in infant asthma although significant heterogeneity was found between the studies. Meta-analysis of four studies found a significant reduction in eczema (1218 infants, typical RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.97; typical RD -0.04, 95% CI -0.07 to -0.00; NNTB 25, 95% CI 14 to &gt; 100; P =0.03). No statistically significant heterogeneity was found between studies. One study reported no significant difference in urticaria.</P>
<P>No statistically significant subgroup differences were found according to infant risk of allergy or type of infant feed. However, individual studies reported a significant reduction in asthma and eczema from supplementation with galacto-oligosaccharide and fructo-oligosaccharide (GOS/FOS) (9:1) (8 g/L) in infants at high risk of allergy; and in eczema from supplementation with GOS/FOS (9:1) (6.8 g/L) and acidic OS (1.2 g/L) in infants not selected for allergy risk.</P>
<P>The GRADE profile (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>) found the quality of the evidence for use of prebiotics for prevention of asthma was very low, the quality was low for prevention of eczema, and the quality very low for prevention of urticaria. We recommend further research is needed before routine use of prebiotics can be recommended for prevention of allergy. No studies reported food allergy.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-02-18 18:16:57 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Moro-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Moro 2006</LINK>) reported the effect of prebiotic in infants at high risk of allergy. The other included studies enrolled healthy term infants (<LINK REF="STD-Ziegler-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ziegler 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gruber-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gruber 2010</LINK>) or preterm, low birth weight infants (<LINK REF="STD-Westerbeek-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Westerbeek 2010</LINK>). There is concern regarding the potential for publication bias for studies not enrolling high risk infants. The 2012 search identified seven studies awaiting classification as they have completed enrolment but are yet to publish allergy related outcomes, although none of these has enrolled infants at high risk of allergy. Six studies were assessed as ongoing, although again none of these enrolled infants at high risk of allergy. Forty-three studies that compared a prebiotic versus no prebiotic were excluded, with 19 of these enrolling healthy term infants but not reporting allergy. Five studies enrolled preterm or low birth weight infants but did not report allergy. None of the other studies enrolled infants at high risk of allergy with the goal of preventing allergy.</P>
<P>Potential benefits for prebiotics are restricted to studies providing supplements for the duration of formula feeding using combinations of prebiotic similar to that found in human milk. Studies reporting a significant reduction in eczema used a GOS/FOS (9:1) combination with or without acidic oligosaccharides at a concentration of 8 g/L. The duration of prebiotic supplementation was prolonged, for the duration of formula feeding (six to 12 months), in two studies with both studies reporting a significant reduction in infant eczema. The duration of prebiotic supplementation was more limited in the other two studies (30 to 120 days). These reported no significant difference in infant eczema. In addition, the studies used differing prebiotic preparations at differing concentrations.</P>
<P>It is unclear if the potential benefit of prebiotic persists beyond infancy. Of the included studies, <LINK REF="STD-Ziegler-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ziegler 2007</LINK> reported eczema to only four months; <LINK REF="STD-Gruber-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gruber 2010</LINK> reported eczema to 12 months; <LINK REF="STD-Westerbeek-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Westerbeek 2010</LINK> reported bronchial hyper-reactivity and eczema to 12 months; and <LINK REF="STD-Moro-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Moro 2006</LINK> reported asthma, eczema and urticaria to two years.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-02-20 11:07:45 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is potential for publication bias, particularly regarding studies that do not enrol infants at high risk of allergy. There are a substantial number of studies of prebiotic enrolling healthy, sick, preterm or low birth weight infants that have not reported allergy outcomes. All included studies were assessed as being at high risk of attrition bias. It was also unclear as to whether 300 breast fed infants were part of the initial randomisation and the reason for premature stopping of one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Gruber-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gruber 2010</LINK>). Only two studies provided prolonged supplementation of prebiotic for the duration of the formula feed and only one study reported the allergy outcome to two years, and none beyond. Only <LINK REF="STD-Moro-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Moro 2006</LINK> enrolled infants at high risk of allergy with the primary goal of preventing allergy.</P>
<P>It is unclear if the effect of prebiotic in preventing eczema is clinically important. Meta-analysis found a significant reduction in infant eczema (NNTB 25, 95% CI 14 to &gt; 100; P = 0.03) with the upper confidence limit including a benefit of unclear clinical importance. The single study that enrolled infants at high risk of allergy was also insufficiently powered to determine if the effect on infant eczema was clinically important (NNTB 7, 95% CI 4 to 100; P = 0.05). However, there is some evidence for a possible dose effect with a larger risk decrease in high risk infants compared to low risk infants, although the difference is not statistically significant (high risk infants RD -0.14, 95% CI -0.28 to -0.01; low risk infants RD -0.02, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.01).</P>
<P>Only a single study pre-specified a primary allergy related outcome. All studies appear to have been commercially sponsored.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-02-19 14:07:33 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The review conducted extensive searches of the published and unpublished literature for trials of prebiotics. However, there is substantial potential for publication bias from under reporting of negative trials in infants not selected for allergy risk. Many of the trials that did not report allergy assessed infants for adverse events and tolerance. The reported trials to date and with positive results have a common commercial sponsor.</P>
<P>In an attempt to avoid publication bias, the review included data from one study reported in an abstract of conference proceedings (<LINK REF="STD-Westerbeek-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Westerbeek 2010</LINK>), and from another study which had unclear definitions of allergy related outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Ziegler-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ziegler 2007</LINK>). The review combines studies reporting outcomes at multiple times and differing time periods. The risk of selective reporting bias was minimised in the review by pre-specifying the data from the latest time point reported by each study (infant up to two years).</P>
<P>Two review authors have independently assessed the trials and extracted data. Outcomes included in this review were compatible with standardised definitions of clinical allergy. Surrogate outcomes (sensitisation) including results of skin tests and serological evidence of atopy without clinical allergy were not included as pre-specified outcomes in this review. However, where infants with clinical allergy were confirmed as atopic by skin tests or serological markers, this was pre-specified for inclusion. The authors of this review have no financial or material conflicts of interest.</P>

<P>There are no other systematic reviews of the use of prebiotics in infants for prevention or treatment of allergy found in our search of <I>The Cochrane Library</I> and MEDLINE to August 2012. No systematic reviews were found of the use of prebiotics for treatment of infants with allergy. A 2009 systematic review of trials of prebiotic supplemented formula in full-term infants reported the formula to be well tolerated and to increase stool colony counts of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli and result in stools similar to those of breast fed neonates without affecting weight gain (<LINK REF="REF-Rao-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rao 2009</LINK>). A 2009 systematic review of the efficacy and safety of prebiotic oligosaccharide supplementation of formula in preterm neonates born at &#8804; 37 weeks gestation reported in one trial that necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) did not occur in any of the enrolled neonates, and meta-analysis found that the prebiotic supplemented formula increased stool colony counts of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli without adversely affecting weight gain (<LINK REF="REF-Srinivasjois-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Srinivasjois 2009</LINK>).</P>

The study used a synbiotic preparation containing <I>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</I> GG, <I>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</I> LC705, <I>Bifidobacterium breve</I>, <I>Propionibacterium freudenreichii</I> and GOS 8 g/L and reported a reduction in infant eczema but not all allergic disease. The study was rated as at high risk of attrition bias and had unclear allocation concealment.</P>

<P>Further research is needed before routine use of prebiotics can be recommended for prevention of allergy. There is some evidence that a prebiotic supplement added to infant feeds may prevent eczema. It is unclear whether the use of prebiotic should be restricted to infants at high risk of allergy or may have an effect in low risk populations; or whether it may have an effect on other allergic diseases including asthma.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-02-18 18:20:20 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Futher large independent trials of prebiotic are needed before prebiotics can be recommended for prevention of allergy in formula fed infants. Current data indicate trials should use preparations of prebiotic that approximate the composition of human milk. Trials are needed both in infants at high risk of allergy and of the routine use of prebiotic in infants not selected by allergy risk. The intervention and measurement of outcomes should be blinded and allergy outcomes measured preferably to two years and beyond using standardised definitions.</P>
