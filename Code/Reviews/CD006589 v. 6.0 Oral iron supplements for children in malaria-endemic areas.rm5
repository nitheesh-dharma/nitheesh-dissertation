<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-02-26 09:45:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne-Marie Stephani">
<P>
<B>Why the review is important</B>
</P>
<P>Children living in malarial areas commonly develop anaemia. Long-term anaemia is thought to delay a child's development and make children more likely to get infections. In areas where anaemia is common, health providers may give iron to prevent anaemia, but there is a concern amongst researchers that this may increase the risk of malaria. It is thought that the iron tablets will increase iron levels in the blood, and this will promote the growth of the <I>Plasmodium </I>parasite that causes malaria. We aimed to assess the effects of oral iron supplementation in children living in countries where malaria is common.</P>
<P>
<B>Main findings of the review</B>
</P>
<P>Cochrane researchers searched the available evidence up to 30 August 2015 and included 35 trials (31,955 children). Iron did not increase the risk of malaria, indicated by fever and the presence of parasites in the blood (<I>high quality evidence</I>). There was no increased risk of death among children treated with iron, although the quality of the evidence for this was low. Among children treated with iron, there was no increased risk of severe malaria (<I>high quality evidence</I>). Although it is hypothesized that iron supplementation might harm children who do not have anaemia living in malarial areas, there is probably no increased risk for malaria in these children (<I>moderate</I> <I>quality evidence</I>). In areas where health services are sufficient to help prevent and treat malaria, giving iron supplements (with or without folic acid) may reduce clinical malaria. In areas where these services are not available, iron supplementation (with or without folic acid) may increase the number of children with clinical malaria (<I>low quality evidence</I>). Overall, iron resulted in fewer anaemic children at follow up, and the end average change in haemoglobin from base line was higher with iron.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusions</B>
</P>
<P>Our conclusions are that iron supplementation does not adversely affect children living in malaria-endemic areas. Based on our review, routine iron supplementation should not be withheld from children living in countries where malaria is prevalent and malaria management services are available.</P>

<P>We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (up to August 2015) and LILACS (up to February 2015). We also checked the <I>meta</I>Register of Controlled Trials (<I>m</I>RCT) and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) up to February 2015. We contacted the primary investigators of all included trials, ongoing trials, and those awaiting assessment to ask for unpublished data and further trials. We scanned references of included trials, pertinent reviews, and previous meta-analyses for additional references.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-02-25 05:11:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included individually randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster RCTs conducted in hyperendemic and holoendemic malaria regions or that reported on any malaria-related outcomes that included children younger than 18 years of age. We included trials that compared orally administered iron, iron with folic acid, and iron with antimalarial treatment versus placebo or no treatment. We included trials of iron supplementation or fortification interventions if they provided at least 80% of the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for prevention of anaemia by age. Antihelminthics could be administered to either group, and micronutrients had to be administered equally to both groups.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-02-21 13:02:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The primary outcomes were clinical malaria, severe malaria, and death from any cause. We assessed the risk of bias in included trials with domain-based evaluation and assessed the quality of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. We performed a fixed-effect meta-analysis for all outcomes and random-effects meta-analysis for hematological outcomes, and adjusted analyses for cluster RCTs. We based the subgroup analyses for anaemia at baseline, age, and malaria prevention or management services on trial-level data.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-02-25 15:22:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Thirty-five trials (31,955 children) met the inclusion criteria.

Iron probably does not cause an excess of clinical malaria in both populations where anaemia is common and those in which anaemia is uncommon. In areas where there are prevention and management services for malaria, iron (with or without folic acid) may reduce clinical malaria (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.97; seven trials, 5586 participants, <I>low quality evidence</I>), while in areas where such services are unavailable, iron (with or without folic acid) may increase the incidence of malaria, although the lower CIs indicate no difference (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.31; nine trials, 19,086 participants, <I>low quality evidence</I>). Iron supplementation does not cause an excess of severe malaria (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.98; 6 trials, 3421 children, <I>high quality evidence). </I>We did not observe any differences for deaths (control event rate 1%, <I>low quality evidence</I>). Iron and antimalarial treatment reduced clinical malaria (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.67; three trials, 728 children, <I>high quality evidence</I>).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Childhood anaemia and iron deficiency</HEADING>
<P>Childhood anaemia is a major, widespread public health problem in sub-Saharan Africa and other low-income areas (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2008a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kassebaum-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kassebaum 2014</LINK>). The highest prevalence of anaemia is found among children younger than five years of age who are living in low-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-Kassebaum-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kassebaum 2014</LINK>). Causes of anaemia in developing countries are numerous and often multifactorial, and include iron deficiency, infectious diseases (such as malaria, intestinal helminths, and schistosomiasis), haemoglobinopathies, and chronic kidney disease (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2011a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kassebaum-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kassebaum 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Iron is an important mineral needed to produce haemoglobin. It is also a component of many enzymes that are essential for proper cell development and cell growth of the brain, muscle, and the immune system (<LINK REF="REF-Beard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beard 2001</LINK>). It is a component of the peroxidase and nitrous oxide-generating enzymes that participate in the immune response to infections and is probably involved in regulating the production and action of cytokines (mediators of immune function released during early stages of infection). Since free iron is toxic to cells, it is stored as ferritin, an intracellular protein.</P>
<P>A relatively large amount of iron is required to produce red blood cells (erythropoiesis) in the first few months after birth. This is usually derived from the iron stored by the foetus in the last months of pregnancy. However, by the time a child is four to six months old, these stores become marginal or depleted. A child whose diet does not provide enough iron risks development of iron-deficiency anaemia. Infants with low total body iron at birth are particularly prone to iron deficiency; this is often exacerbated by the early introduction of cereal-based weaning food from which iron absorption can be as low as 5% (<LINK REF="REF-FAO_x002f_WHO-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">FAO/WHO 2005</LINK>). Iron deficiency may be worsened by chronic blood loss from the intestines that results from intestinal parasitic infections (<LINK REF="REF-Stoltzfus-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoltzfus 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Iron deficiency is common and affects approximately two billion people worldwide, which results in over 500 million cases of anaemia (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2004</LINK>). In most areas, and specifically in all low- and middle-income regions, the most significant contributor to the onset of anaemia is iron deficiency (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2008a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kassebaum-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kassebaum 2014</LINK>). In sub-Saharan Africa, the prevalence of iron-deficiency anaemia is estimated to be around 60% overall (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2004</LINK>), with 40% to 50% of all children under five years in developing countries being iron-deficient (<LINK REF="REF-UNICEF-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNICEF 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Based on estimates of iron-deficiency anaemia as a risk factor for death, iron deficiency has been estimated to cause 726,000 deaths in the perinatal and childhood periods globally, with the greatest toll in Southeast Asia and in Africa (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-FAO_x002f_WHO-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">FAO/WHO 2005</LINK>). Experimental and observational studies have linked iron deficiency to adverse effects on child development, including impairments of cognitive, emotional, and motor development (<LINK REF="REF-Pollitt-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pollitt 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grantham_x002d_McGregor-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grantham-McGregor 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gewa-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gewa 2009</LINK>), growth (<LINK REF="STD-Lawless-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lawless 1994</LINK>), immune function, and increased risk of infection (<LINK REF="STD-Berger-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Berger 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Beard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beard 2001</LINK>). The relative risk for mental retardation associated with a 1 g/dL increase in population mean haemoglobin level has been estimated at 0.78 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70 to 0.86) (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2004</LINK>). However, these studies have been criticized for their inability to fully adjust for confounders and to establish causality (<LINK REF="REF-Oppenheimer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oppenheimer 2001</LINK>). Systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on iron supplementation's effect on mental development, intelligence scores, motor development, and growth reported conflicting results (<LINK REF="REF-Bhandari-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhandari 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ramakrishnan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramakrishnan 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sachdev-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sachdev 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Iannotti-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iannotti 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sachdev-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sachdev 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Low-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Low 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thompson-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wang-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2013</LINK>). Notably the time frame of many RCTs may not have allowed for a full evaluation of developmental outcomes.</P>
<P>The diagnosis of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anaemia relies mainly on the measurement of a person's haemoglobin, iron, and ferritin (<LINK REF="REF-Pasricha-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pasricha 2013</LINK>). The measurement of haemoglobin alone is not sufficiently sensitive (due to overlapping values in iron-replete and iron-deficient individuals) and is not specific because of the numerous causes of anaemia in developing countries. Ferritin is the most commonly accepted measure of iron status (<LINK REF="REF-Mei-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mei 2005</LINK>). However, there is a complex interaction between infection, inflammation (even when subclinical), and ferritin. Infection and inflammation increase ferritin, which is an acute phase reactant. The increase is proportional to the baseline ferritin levels and available iron stores (<LINK REF="REF-Thurnham-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thurnham 2010</LINK>). It decreases only slowly after the resolution of infection and remains elevated in the convalescent phases of infection. Thus, in developing countries it is difficult to interpret ferritin levels and their use as a biomarker of iron deficiency may underestimate the true prevalence of iron deficiency (<LINK REF="REF-Nyakeriga-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nyakeriga 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zimmermann-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zimmermann 2005</LINK>). Other biomarkers or combinations of biomarkers have been suggested for the assessment of iron deficiency in locations with a high prevalence of infection. These include the serum transferrin receptor, zinc protoporphyrin, transferrin saturation, and the ratio of serum transferrin receptor to serum ferritin (<LINK REF="REF-Lynch-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lynch 2011</LINK>), as well as the adjustment of ferritin to C-reactive protein or alpha1-acid glycoprotein levels, or both (<LINK REF="REF-Mburu-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mburu 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thurnham-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thurnham 2010</LINK>). The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend the use of concurrent measurements of haemoglobin, ferritin, and transferrin receptor to assess the iron status of a group (<LINK REF="REF-WHO_x002f_CDC-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO/CDC 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2011b</LINK>). The concurrent measurement of the inflammatory markers C-reactive protein and alpha1-acid glycoprotein facilitates the interpretation of ferritin levels. However, the exclusion of children with elevated markers of inflammation from iron deficiency assessment is not reasonable, since up to 69% of children in malaria-endemic areas may have elevated markers of inflammation (<LINK REF="REF-Darboe-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Darboe 2007</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Malaria and iron deficiency</HEADING>
<P>Malaria is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children in sub-Saharan Africa (<LINK REF="REF-Breman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Breman 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2008b</LINK>). Most infections are caused by the most virulent parasite species, <I>Plasmodium falciparum (</I>
<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2008b</LINK>), which is transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected female <I>Anopheles</I> mosquito. Trends and general patterns of malaria transmission vary greatly geographically. Children are vulnerable to malaria from the age of approximately three months, when immunity acquired from the mother wanes. Malaria is an important contributor to anaemia in endemic regions through the destruction of parasitized red blood cells (haemolysis), increased clearance of infected and uninfected red blood cells by the spleen, cytokine-induced dyserythropoiesis (abnormal production of red blood cells), and probably also decreased absorption of dietary iron (<LINK REF="REF-Menendez-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Menendez 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ekvall-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ekvall 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glinz-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glinz 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is an ongoing debate on whether iron deficiency offers protection from malaria and whether an excess of iron increases the risk of malaria or severe malaria (<LINK REF="REF-Oppenheimer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oppenheimer 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stoltzfus-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoltzfus 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Suchdev-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suchdev 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oppenheimer-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oppenheimer 2012</LINK>). Iron is required by many pathogens for their survival and pathogenicity (killing ability) (<LINK REF="REF-Beard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beard 2001</LINK>). Removal of free circulating iron seems to be an important part of the host (human) response to infection. The theory that iron deficiency may be an important defence mechanism has been termed "nutritional immunity" (<LINK REF="REF-Kochan-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kochan 1973</LINK>). The erythrocytic form of the <I>Plasmodium</I> parasite requires free iron (which is lacking in an iron-deficient person). In one observational study iron deficiency was associated with a small, albeit significant, degree of protection from episodes of clinical malaria in a cohort of young children living on the Kenyan coast (<LINK REF="REF-Nyakeriga-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nyakeriga 2004</LINK>).<BR/>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-02-22 07:42:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In areas where the prevalence of anaemia is 40% or more in young children, guidelines generally recommend that children of normal birthweight receive oral iron (2 mg/kg/day of elemental iron, daily, for three months) between the ages of six months and two years, and that children with a low birthweight receive the same amount of iron starting at two months (<LINK REF="REF-Stoltzfus-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoltzfus 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-INACG-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">INACG 1999</LINK>). </P>
<P>Several meta-analyses have previously examined the benefits and risks of iron supplementation in children (<LINK REF="REF-INACG-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">INACG 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oppenheimer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oppenheimer 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gera-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gera 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Iannotti-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iannotti 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gera-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gera 2007</LINK>). These have shown that iron treatment increases haemoglobin and prevents anaemia. The absolute effects on haemoglobin were larger among children who were anaemic at baseline and smaller in malarial hyperendemic regions compared with non-endemic regions, and with iron-fortified food compared with oral medicinal iron (<LINK REF="REF-Gera-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gera 2007</LINK>). An increased risk of malaria has been highlighted by several meta-analyses. Most studies reported parasitaemia (being slide-positive for <I>P. falciparum</I> at the end of supplementation) rather than clinical malaria (<LINK REF="REF-INACG-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">INACG 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oppenheimer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oppenheimer 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gera-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gera 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Iannotti-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iannotti 2006</LINK>). The effects on parasitaemia were associated with baseline rates of parasitaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Gera-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gera 2002</LINK>). In <LINK REF="REF-Gera-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gera 2002</LINK> other infections were also assessed. Overall there was no difference in the incidence rate ratio for all recorded infections. Diarrhoea was more frequent in the iron-supplemented group.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-02-22 07:55:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In 2006, the results of a large RCT that evaluated the effect of iron and folate supplements in a malaria-endemic area of Zanzibar (Pemba Island) were published (<LINK REF="STD-Sazawal-2006-_x0028_C_x0029_a" TYPE="STUDY">Sazawal 2006 (C)a</LINK>). The study was terminated prematurely on the recommendation of the study data safety and management board following the higher proportion of hospitalization or death among participants randomized to treatment with iron and folic acid. A subgroup analysis revealed that the risk was limited to children who were iron-replete when iron supplementation was started. This trial heightened global concern about the routine, non-selective iron supplementation policy in areas where malaria is highly prevalent. Before this trial, the WHO guidelines for children living in malaria-endemic areas were no different than the general recommendations (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2003</LINK>). In 2007 a consultation convened to consider the recommendations for children living in malaria-endemic areas (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2007</LINK>). The trial's subgroup analysis suggested that it might be necessary to screen for iron deficiency and treat only iron-deficient children. However, such a recommendation is difficult or impossible to implement. There is no consensus on the most appropriate biomarker to assess iron deficiency or monitor iron status during supplementation in regions with a high prevalence of infection (<LINK REF="REF-Mburu-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mburu 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thurnham-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thurnham 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lynch-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lynch 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pasricha-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pasricha 2013</LINK>). Furthermore, as a public health intervention, screening of all children before iron supplementation is impractical in most malaria-endemic areas. Thus, it has become critical to examine the safety and effects of iron supplementation in malaria-endemic areas considering all the available evidence. In 2013 another large RCT that evaluated the effect of iron added to micronutrient powder was conducted in Ghana. Insecticide-treated bed nets were provided to all participants and antimalarial treatment was systematically administered when indicated (<LINK REF="STD-Zlotkin-2013-_x0028_C_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Zlotkin 2013 (C)</LINK>). The use of iron in this trial did not result in an increased incidence of malaria among participants.</P>
<P>In view of the newly available data we set to examine the complete evidence in all RCTs that assessed iron supplementation for children in malaria-endemic areas. In a previous version of the review, we did not observe an increased risk of malaria with iron supplementation overall nor was iron harmful in the treatment of malaria (<LINK REF="REF-Ojukwu-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ojukwu 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ojukwu-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ojukwu 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Okebe-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Okebe 2011</LINK>). Since any theoretical harm of iron administration would be expected to occur in the setting of intense malaria transmission, in the current review version we limited our analysis to areas with hyperendemic or holoendemic transmission of malaria or to trials conducted in other areas, but reported malaria-related outcomes. We specifically searched for outcomes related to malaria and data for all-cause mortality, which ultimately combines benefit and harm. Due to the conflicting results of the studies conducted in Pemba Island, <LINK REF="STD-Sazawal-2006-_x0028_C_x0029_a" TYPE="STUDY">Sazawal 2006 (C)a</LINK>, and in Ghana, <LINK REF="STD-Zlotkin-2013-_x0028_C_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Zlotkin 2013 (C)</LINK>, we compared the effect of iron administration on the incidence of clinical malaria in studies in which prevention or management of malaria were offered as an integral part of the study design, with studies in which neither malaria prevention nor malaria management were systematically administered.</P>

The trials were published between the years 1973 and 2013. Overall the included trials recruited 31,955 children: 7953 in 26 individually RCTs and 24,002 (73%) in nine cluster RCTs. The largest cluster RCT included two separate, independent cohorts: the main trial, <LINK REF="STD-Sazawal-2006-_x0028_C_x0029_a" TYPE="STUDY">Sazawal 2006 (C)a</LINK>, and an independent substudy, <LINK REF="STD-Sazawal-2006-_x0028_C_x0029_b" TYPE="STUDY">Sazawal 2006 (C)b</LINK>. We only included two arms of this trial in the review (iron, folic acid, and vitamin A versus vitamin A alone), totaling 15,956 children in the main study and 1619 children in the substudy (analysed as separate trials in the review). We included unpublished data supplied by the trial authors on the outcomes of malaria and death from the substudy. Our attempts to obtain data on the two trial arms that compared iron and folic acid and vitamin A and zinc versus zinc and vitamin A (<LINK REF="REF-Sazawal-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sazawal 2007</LINK>) at the time the iron trial arm had been stopped (August 2014) were unsuccessful. This analysis could have been a major contribution to the evidence. Twenty trials reported adherence, and the average overall adherence to all trial drugs was good (89%).</P>
<P>All trials assessed the administration of iron or iron plus folic acid for the prevention or treatment of anaemia among children without an acute illness. The mean iron supplementation dose was 2 mg/kg/day, and the mean duration of treatment was 4.5 months (one to 12 months). Twenty-seven trials added the antimalarial treatment to the iron arm or both trial arms, 12 trials added anthelminthics to both trial arms, and eight trials added micronutrients to both trial arms. Twenty-three trials reported one or more of the review-defined malaria-related outcomes (65.7% of trials included in the review. We have described the types of outcomes and their definitions in <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>. Severe malaria, as defined per protocol, was reported in a single trial and its substudy that reported on cerebral malaria (<LINK REF="STD-Sazawal-2006-_x0028_C_x0029_a" TYPE="STUDY">Sazawal 2006 (C)a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sazawal-2006-_x0028_C_x0029_b" TYPE="STUDY">Sazawal 2006 (C)b</LINK>). Five trials reported clinical malaria with high-grade parasitaemia (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-1989-_x0028_C_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1989 (C)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Adam-1997-_x0028_C_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Adam 1997 (C)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Massaga-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Massaga 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ayoya-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Ayoya 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zlotkin-2013-_x0028_C_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Zlotkin 2013 (C)</LINK>). Twelve trials reported only or mostly (over 80%) on <I>P. falciparum</I> malaria (<LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>). Most trials that reported malaria-related outcomes performed regular surveillance for malaria using blood smears at baseline and during treatment (either at regular intervals or whenever children were febrile), and offered trial participants treatment when they were symptomatic (<LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>). Notably, no surveillance or treatment outside the hospital was offered in the main trial (<LINK REF="STD-Sazawal-2006-_x0028_C_x0029_a" TYPE="STUDY">Sazawal 2006 (C)a</LINK> , unlike its substudy (<LINK REF="STD-Sazawal-2006-_x0028_C_x0029_b" TYPE="STUDY">Sazawal 2006 (C)b</LINK>), where monitoring was performed and treatment was offered to children at their home. The baseline rate of malaria parasitaemia (reported in 11 of 19 trials) ranged from 0% to 70% of children (mean 45%). The mean baseline haemoglobin was lower than 10 g/dL in 17 trials (when iron was most commonly administered for the treatment of anaemia) and 10 g/dL or higher in 22 (when iron was administered for the prevention of anaemia). The trial population consisted of children aged less than two years of age in 12 trials, two to five years of age in 11 trials, and over five years of age in 16 trials. The respective number of trials that reported on malaria-related outcomes in the three age groups were eight, nine, and six trials.</P>

<P>One trial specified methods for assessment of malaria throughout the trial (without defining these as study outcomes), but did not report the results per trial arm (<LINK REF="STD-Olsen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Olsen 2006</LINK>). We could not contact the authors of this trial. We contacted authors of trials that did not report on malaria in their methods or result sections; the authors of one trial reported that data had been collected in the trial but were no longer available (<LINK REF="STD-Powers-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Powers 1983</LINK>), while the authors of seven trials replied that malaria-related outcomes were not collected in their trials (<LINK REF="STD-Greisen-1986-_x0028_C_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Greisen 1986 (C)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Latham-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Latham 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dossa-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Dossa 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dossa-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Dossa 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hall-2002-_x0028_C_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 2002 (C)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hess-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hess 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zlotkin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Zlotkin 2003</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Clinical and severe malaria</HEADING>
<P>All trials defined clinical malaria as fever (usually greater than 37.5°C) and parasitaemia (any density). Overall, there was no significant difference in the risk ratio (RR) for clinical malaria between iron treatment and placebo or no treatment, with a trend in favour of iron treatment (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.00; 14 trials, 7168 children). Specifically, there was no difference in the risk for clinical malaria between iron treatment versus placebo or no treatment in the subgroup of trials including non-anaemic children (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.09; five trials, 2112 children) without heterogeneity, <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). Significant heterogeneity was present in the subgroup analysis with anaemia (P = 0.01, I² statistic = 56%) and in the overall analysis. We rated the quality of the evidence as high for the overall analysis and moderate for the subgroups of anaemic and non-anaemic children (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>The RR of malaria was lower for children younger than two years of age (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.97), and this result was largely driven by the recent study conducted in Ghana (<LINK REF="STD-Zlotkin-2013-_x0028_C_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Zlotkin 2013 (C)</LINK>). In children aged between two and five years, and among children older than five years, we did not observe any effect of iron treatment on the relative risk of clinical malaria (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>).</P>
<P>The results favoured iron treatment when we only included trials that described malaria caused solely or primarily by <I>P. falciparum </I>(RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.99; nine trials, 5503 children, <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). Similarly, in six trials that reported malaria with high-grade parasitaemia as an outcome, the RR was lower among children treated with iron when compared to children receiving placebo or no treatment (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.98; <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>) and we rated the quality of this evidence as high (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Ten of the 17 trials included in the analysis were at low risk of bias with respect to allocation concealment, and all but two of the trials were double blinded. Sensitivity analysis restricted to trials at low risk of bias for allocation concealment did not affect results. The funnel plot was asymmetrical, which indicated that small studies that favour iron could be missing (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). Three trials reported either on episodes of malaria (<LINK REF="STD-Richard-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Richard 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leenstra-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Leenstra 2009</LINK>) or clinic visits for malaria (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-1989-_x0028_C_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1989 (C)</LINK>) rather than participants with their first or only episode. The exclusion of these trials did not affect the pooled RR for this comparison. One trial reported on children with clinical malaria only at end of follow-up, which was six months after completion of iron supplementation (<LINK REF="STD-Menendez-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Menendez 1997</LINK>). Its exclusion did not affect the results.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Deaths</HEADING>
<P>15/17 trials reported mortality, and in most trials no deaths occurred among the evaluable children (control event rate 1%). Overall, there was no difference between the iron and placebo/no treatment groups, without heterogeneity (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>). We assessed the quality of the evidence for this outcome as low due to imprecision (very low event rate) and incomplete outcome assessment in most of the trials (a drop-out range of 2% to 62% of participants), as deaths might have occurred among the people lost to follow up (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>

<P>There was no statistically significant difference in the prevalence of parasitaemia of any level, with a trend favouring placebo or no treatment (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.0 to 1.23; nine trials, 3393 children, without significant heterogeneity;<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). We converted odds ratios to RRs to allow for the use of data on parasitaemia from one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Mebrahtu-2004-_x0028_C_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Mebrahtu 2004 (C)</LINK>). This outcome was not affected by age, anaemia at baseline, or <I>Plasmodium</I> species assessed (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>). Despite the lack of heterogeneity overall, there was a significant difference between trials that described adequate allocation concealment (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.15, four trials, 1727 children, <LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>) and trials with unclear or inadequate methods that showed significantly higher rate of parasitaemia with iron treatment (RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.40, five trials, 1666 children; P = 0.04 for the difference between subgroups; <LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>). All of the trials included in the comparison of parasitaemia were double blinded. There was no statistically significant difference in the occurrence of high-grade asymptomatic parasitaemia, most commonly defined as &gt; 5000 parasites/&#956;L (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.37; five trials, 2565 children <LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>). In trials that continued follow-up after the cessation of iron administration, there was a higher prevalence of any level of parasitaemia at the end of follow-up among participants treated with iron (RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.40; five trials, 1150 children; <LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>).</P>
<P>It was difficult to establish whether the trials reported on children with parasitaemia or on parasitaemia episodes. <LINK REF="STD-Gebreselassie-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gebreselassie 1996</LINK> clearly reported on cumulative incidence and <LINK REF="STD-Leenstra-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Leenstra 2009</LINK> included repeated episodes. <LINK REF="STD-Leenstra-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Leenstra 2009</LINK> reported incidence rate ratios with 95% CIs adjusted for age, baseline parasitaemia, and school. We used these in our analysis as relative risks. The exclusion of these trials did not affect the results.</P>
<P>The trials reported parasite density differently, with differences that referred both to the unit of measurement and the denominator (<LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK>). A meta-analysis was therefore not possible; we have shown the results in <LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK> for each trial. Qualitatively, parasite density was higher in the iron supplemented group in four trials, lower in one, and similar in one of the six trials that reported on parasite density at the end of treatment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Admissions to hospital and clinic visits</HEADING>
<P>Six trials reported hospitalizations or clinic visits. Overall, there was no difference between iron and placebo or no treatment (<LINK REF="CMP-001.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.12</LINK>); these results were not affected by the administration of antimalarial medications. We assessed the quality of the evidence as very low due to inconsistency and indirectness of this outcome ('Summary of findings' table 1).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Haemoglobin and anaemia</HEADING>
<P>Analyses for haemoglobin were highly heterogeneous, since the absolute magnitude of treatment effect in trials differed, and the 95% CIs were narrow. However, the heterogeneity stemmed from different magnitudes of increase in haemoglobin with iron supplementation and not in the direction of the result. Overall, at the end of treatment there was a mean difference of haemoglobin level of 0.75 g/dL (95% CI 0.48 to 1.01; 16 trials, 5261 children; I² statistic = 93%; <LINK REF="CMP-001.13" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.13</LINK>). In trials with anaemic children at baseline, the children gained 0.95 g/dL haemoglobin (95% CI 0.38 to 1.51; seven trials, 2481 participants) with iron supplementation, while in trials including mostly children without anaemia the end haemoglobin was higher than control by 0.61 g/dL (95% CI 0.38 to 0.85; nine trials, 2780 participants; P = 0.28 for subgroup difference). The mean change of haemoglobin from the baseline at end of treatment was 0.67 g/dL (95% CI 0.42 to 0.92; 12 trials, 2462 children; I² statistic = 82%; <LINK REF="CMP-001.19" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.19</LINK>).</P>
<P>The RR for anaemia at the end of treatment, as defined in the trial, was 0.63 (95% CI 0.49 to 0.82; 15 trials, 3784 children; <LINK REF="CMP-001.15" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.15</LINK>), with similar substantial heterogeneity mainly in the magnitude of benefit.</P>
<P>We did not observe any differences when we analysed the effect of iron on haemoglobin by age groups, or by the addition of antimalarial medications or multinutrients to both study arms (analyses not shown). Heterogeneity was maintained in all these subgroup analyses.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Other outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Six studies provided data on respiratory infections. There was no difference between iron and placebo overall (rate ratio 0.99, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.15; six trials, 21,767 child-months; I² statistic = 0%; <LINK REF="CMP-001.20" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.20</LINK>). Trials usually reported diarrhoea as 'infectious diarrhoea', although we could not clearly differentiate the symptoms from diarrhoea related to iron or iron/zinc supplementation. We stratified this analysis by zinc co-administration (<LINK REF="CMP-001.17" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.17</LINK>). Overall, treatment was associated with an increased risk of diarrhoea (rate ratio 1.15, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.26; eight trials, 23,912 child-months; I² statistic = 40%). This association was driven by the effect of the iron-zinc combination (rate ratio 1.29, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.44; three trials, 6346 children), and not by iron treatment alone (rate ratio 0.99, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.13; seven trials, 17566 children). Six trials reported the number of febrile episodes; there was no difference between iron treatment and control arm (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.14; 15531 children). One trial reported more days with fever among iron-treated participants, and one trial reported more infectious episodes among participants randomized to the iron treatment arm. Definitions and reporting methods were highly variable; results are shown per outcome (<LINK REF="CMP-001.18" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.18</LINK>).</P>
<P>Results for height and weight were inconsistently reported as end values or as the change from baseline and absolute values or z-scores matched for age, height, or weight. The analyses shown are based on absolute weight in kg and height in cm at the end of treatment or weight/height for age z-scores. For end of treatment weight, there was no statistically significant difference between iron and placebo/no treatment study arms (<LINK REF="CMP-001.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.14</LINK>), while the change from baseline favoured iron (<LINK REF="CMP-001.16" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.16</LINK>). The latter analysis was heterogenous and the heterogeneity was not explained by the review-defined subgroups. There were no significant differences in end values or change from baseline of height, with similar heterogeneity in the change from baseline analysis (<LINK REF="CMP-001.21" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.21</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.22" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.22</LINK>).</P>

<P>The only trial that reported on malaria-related outcomes was the Pemba study (<LINK REF="STD-Sazawal-2006-_x0028_C_x0029_a" TYPE="STUDY">Sazawal 2006 (C)a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sazawal-2006-_x0028_C_x0029_b" TYPE="STUDY">Sazawal 2006 (C)b</LINK>). Malaria-related outcomes reported were admissions for malaria (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>) and cerebral malaria (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>). The results for the main study and the substudy were significantly different, and the main study showed a higher risk for severe malaria with iron plus folic acid and the substudy showed a lower risk. Therefore we did not pool the results. Children in the substudy were older than children in the main trial (mean age of 22.5 versus 18.3 months) and the baseline haemoglobin for the substudy cohort was probably higher than that of the main trial, because children with severe anaemia (haemoglobin &lt; 7 g/dL) were excluded only from the substudy. However the main difference, as described by the trial authors, was that children in the substudy were monitored and offered treatment for malaria at home throughout the trial period. In the main trial, <LINK REF="STD-Sazawal-2006-_x0028_C_x0029_a" TYPE="STUDY">Sazawal 2006 (C)a</LINK>, there was no organized infrastructure for the diagnosis and treatment of uncomplicated malaria.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-02-25 05:47:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Oral iron supplementation alone did not increase the risk for clinical malaria, and the upper level of the 95% CI indicated no harm (risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.00). The risk was probably not increased in trials that recruited children who were not anaemic at baseline (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.09). There was no increased risk of <I>P. falciparum</I> malaria or malaria with high-grade parasitaemia, and pooled results favoured iron treatment. The combination of iron and folate resulted in a higher rate of admissions for malaria and cerebral malaria in one large trial, <LINK REF="STD-Sazawal-2006-_x0028_C_x0029_a" TYPE="STUDY">Sazawal 2006 (C)a</LINK>, but a substudy pointed at the opposite direction. The difference in malaria surveillance and management strategies in the two parts of this trial led to an analysis of all iron supplementation trials by malaria management infrastructure. Overall, iron treatment, with or without folate, was safe and may be protective in settings where malaria prevention or management programmes were implemented (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.97). Conversley, it might be associated with an increased risk of clinical malaria when neither prevention nor antimalarial treatment were available (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.31; P &lt; 0.001 for the difference between subgroups). This finding agrees with the analysis of iron with an antimalarial drug as the intervention, which significantly decreased the occurrence of clinical malaria compared to placebo or no treatment. In all analyses, mortality was low in general and not different between iron-treated participants, and those that received placebo or no treatment.</P>
<P>There were no effects of iron administration alone on infections, hospitalizations and clinic visits, and parasitaemia at the end of treatment. Iron treatment alone resulted in higher rates of parasitaemia at the end of follow-up in trials with unclear allocation concealment methods. The combination of iron and antimalarial medication resulted in fewer clinic visits and hospitalizations, which probably reflected the effect of the antimalarial drug. The combination of zinc and iron was associated with more episodes of diarrhoea, while iron monotherapy was not. In all comparisons, iron supplementation increased haemoglobin and decreased anaemia. All analyses were highly heterogenous, which precluded a precise pooled estimate of effect, but the increase in haemoglobin was substantial in most individual trials and the prevalence of anaemia was reduced by 40% to 50% in most comparisons. We did not observe a clear beneficial or adverse effect of iron supplementation on weight or height.</P>
<P>In this current review update we applied more stringent inclusion criteria to focus on the question of iron's safety and beneficial effect in areas where these are doubtful. Firstly, since the debate that concerned iron administration centred around its effect in areas with significant burden of malaria, we chose to include only trials conducted in hyperendemic or holoendemic areas for malaria transmission, or trials that reported malaria outcomes. Secondly, we included trials of iron fortification and for all included trials we excluded trials that administered low-dose iron that is not expected to result in iron repletion. Of the five trials that we added to the current review update, one large trial had a large impact on the pooled malaria outcome results (<LINK REF="STD-Zlotkin-2013-_x0028_C_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Zlotkin 2013 (C)</LINK>). Thirdly, we omitted from this update an analysis of iron administration during proven malaria episodes. We included four trials in the 2011 version of this review, <LINK REF="REF-Okebe-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Okebe 2011</LINK>, that assessed this intervention and no new trials have been published in recent years.</P>
<P>In the 2011 version of this review, <LINK REF="REF-Okebe-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Okebe 2011</LINK>, we deemed that iron treatment not harmful regarding clinical malaria. In the current analysis, we found a trend towards a favourable effect of iron treatment on clinical malaria, with a statistically significant benefit in several subgroup analyses: children younger than two years of age, children infected primarily or exclusively by <I>P. falciparum</I>, and children included in trials in which malaria prevention or management strategies were implemented as an integral part of the trial's design. These results strengthen our conclusions from the previous versions of this Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Ojukwu-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ojukwu 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Okebe-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Okebe 2011</LINK>); iron administration for the prevention or treatment of anaemia is safe in malaria-endemic areas if malaria is adequately prevented, diagnosed, and treated.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-02-23 05:39:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We have provided the results and the quality of evidence assessments in the 'Summary of findings' tables. There were several main reasons that led to downgrading of the evidence. We downgraded the quality of the evidence for imprecision whenever the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) showed possible harm with iron. Some of the important patient-relevant outcomes assessed, including hospital admissions, clinical visits, and deaths, can obviously be triggered by causes other than malaria and the difference between arms is probably not only explained by malaria. Thus, we downgraded these outcomes for indirectness. For deaths, a serious concern of missing data with or without publication bias led to downgrading of the evidence; mortality data were reported in 26/39 of the trials included in the analyses and most of the trials that reported on mortality referred only to children available for analysis at the end of treatment or follow-up. Deaths should be assessed among all children randomized, mainly those lost to follow-up. Inconsistency was apparent in the outcome definitions, mainly with the large Pemba trial that reported only on malaria requiring hospital admission, while all other trials reported on fever with parasitaemia (<LINK REF="STD-Sazawal-2006-_x0028_C_x0029_a" TYPE="STUDY">Sazawal 2006 (C)a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sazawal-2006-_x0028_C_x0029_b" TYPE="STUDY">Sazawal 2006 (C)b</LINK>). Some degree of imprecision might exist in the latter outcome, as asymptomatic parasitaemia is common in malaria-endemic regions and fever with parasitaemia may be caused by infections other than malaria. Funnel plot asymmetry was present in the analyses of iron versus placebo or no treatment, with an excess of small trials that favoured the control arm. However, we did not consider this as a reflection of publication bias since malaria was not the primary outcome assessed in most trials (specifically, it was not the primary outcome in all small trials) and the direction of the small trials' effect was against the safety of iron.</P>
<P>For the intervention of iron with folic acid, the large Pemba trial reported a significantly increased risk for death or hospital admission (<LINK REF="STD-Sazawal-2006-_x0028_C_x0029_a" TYPE="STUDY">Sazawal 2006 (C)a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sazawal-2006-_x0028_C_x0029_b" TYPE="STUDY">Sazawal 2006 (C)b</LINK>), but the relative contributions of the addition of folic acid and the poor infrastructure for diagnosis and surveillance of malaria to the adverse effects of iron in this trial are unclear. Thus, data on the safety of iron and folate supplementation are unclear.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-02-26 09:53:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne-Marie Stephani">
<P>There is an interest in the assessment of the effect of iron supplementation on malaria by iron status and iron-deficiency anaemia at baseline. We could not conduct a subgroup analysis by individual children's iron status or haemoglobin at baseline due to the lack of subgroup data reported in the included trials for the outcomes of deaths and malaria. Our analyses stratified by anaemia are based on the study groups' mean haemoglobin level. Most of the trials recruited a uniform population of anaemic or non-anaemic children, and thus enabled this stratification in the meta-analysis. Although this analysis could mask an adverse effect in individual iron-replete, non-anaemic children compensated by benefit in iron-deplete, anaemic children, the lack of heterogeneity in the analyses for malaria and deaths makes this possibility unlikely. This possibility is not supported by a trial-level stratified analysis restricted to trials that recruited only anaemic or non-anaemic children (data not shown). However, we could not conduct an analysis by true iron status or iron-deficiency anaemia at baseline. Since all trials of non-anaemic children had malaria prevention and management services, we could not assess iron supplementation in non-anaemic populations where malaria prevention and management services were not present.</P>
<P>There was heterogeneity regarding the management of children identified as anaemic during the trial and after its conclusion. Some trials supplied iron to all children identified as anaemic below a certain threshold during the trial. After treatment, during a follow-up period, children who remained anaemic were all given iron per protocol, were offered the possibility of treatment, or the issue was not addressed specifically. We could not assess the effects of this variable due to the large heterogeneity in trial protocols and poor reporting. This factor could underlie some of the unexplained heterogeneity observed in our analyses for haemoglobin and anaemia.</P>
<P>Much of the evidence relies on cluster RCTs. Naturally, these were the largest trials and thus carried a large weight in the meta-analysis. However, the major outcomes assessed in these trials are probably correlated within clusters, including anaemia, iron status, malaria, and other infectious complications. In classes or schools, the correlation between individuals may be smaller than among families, but the large cluster size increases the cluster effect. Ideally, we would want these trials to be planned and analyzed accordingly. The trial should report on the unit of randomization, the average cluster size (number of children in household or class), the number of clusters and individuals randomized, the intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) value for each outcome (denoting the degree of similarity between individuals in the same cluster) and an effect estimate adjusted for clustering. Unadjusted effect estimates, calculated as if the trial was individually randomized, may result in an exaggerated precision of the effect estimate, thus inflating the weight of the trial in the meta-analysis. Out of the nine cluster RCTs included in our review, only <LINK REF="STD-Sazawal-2006-_x0028_C_x0029_a" TYPE="STUDY">Sazawal 2006 (C)a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sazawal-2006-_x0028_C_x0029_b" TYPE="STUDY">Sazawal 2006 (C)b</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Zlotkin-2013-_x0028_C_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Zlotkin 2013 (C)</LINK> reported adjusted analyses for the primary outcomes. In our analyses we used estimated ICCs to adjust the weight of the cluster RCTs in the meta-analysis. We cannot be sure that the contribution of these trials to the compiled analysis is correct.</P>
<P>Other analyses or outcomes lacking from our Cochrane review include an assessment of the effect of children&#8217;s nutritional status at baseline on the results; analyses stratified by the schedule of iron supplementation (daily versus weekly); psychomotor and cognitive outcomes assessed in another Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2013</LINK>); tuberculosis, and age/weight/height-adjusted Z scores for growth. Finally, we do not have the data from <LINK REF="STD-Sazawal-2006-_x0028_C_x0029_a" TYPE="STUDY">Sazawal 2006 (C)a</LINK> on malaria-related events, hospital admissions, and deaths for the two trial arms: iron plus folic acid plus vitamin A plus zinc versus zinc plus vitamin A. These data could add 16,196 more children to the analyses of iron plus folic acid versus placebo treatment. Similarly, we cannot exclude the existence of more unpublished RCTs that could contribute to the evidence on iron supplementation and malaria, such as those identified in PhD theses (<LINK REF="STD-Gebreselassie-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gebreselassie 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Adam-1997-_x0028_C_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Adam 1997 (C)</LINK>) or others (<LINK REF="STD-Roschnik-2003-_x0028_C_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Roschnik 2003 (C)</LINK>).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Sazawal-2006-_x0028_C_x0029_a" TYPE="STUDY">Sazawal 2006 (C)a</LINK> is by far the largest trial to date, and probably the only trial to date, powered to assess the effect of iron supplementation on severe malaria. It showed a significantly increased risk for the composite outcome of death or hospitalization among children, most of whom who were younger than two years of age. The risk of death was increased, but without statistical significance. In a stratified analysis of an independent substudy, we observed adverse effects of iron supplementation among children who were iron-replete and non-anaemic at baseline, while among children who were iron-deficient and anaemic there were fewer adverse events. At the time there was no malaria control programme in Zanzibar, and the main trial's protocol did not offer children special malaria prevention or management services. In the substudy, <LINK REF="STD-Sazawal-2006-_x0028_C_x0029_b" TYPE="STUDY">Sazawal 2006 (C)b</LINK>, surveillance for parasitaemia was performed and children received treatment according to the study protocol in their homes. The main trial showed that iron is harmful, while the substudy showed that iron supplementation is protective for severe malaria. Our analysis, which included all trials that assessed iron supplementation, concords with this conclusion (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>In 2007, based on <LINK REF="STD-Sazawal-2006-_x0028_C_x0029_a" TYPE="STUDY">Sazawal 2006 (C)a</LINK>, the World Health Organization (WHO) released a statement that recommended that iron supplementation should be prescribed only after screening for iron deficiency (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2007</LINK>). Universal screening for anaemia and iron status places a significant burden on healthcare systems in low-income countries. This Cochrane review was originally published in 2009, <LINK REF="REF-Ojukwu-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ojukwu 2009</LINK>, and added further debate into the conundrum of iron supplementation for children in malaria-endemic areas (<LINK REF="REF-Roth-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roth 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stoltzfus-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoltzfus 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Suchdev-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suchdev 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oppenheimer-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oppenheimer 2012</LINK>).

In 2011 the WHO amended its recommendation to state that &#8220;In malaria-endemic areas, the provision of iron should be implemented in conjunction with measures to prevent, diagnose and treat malaria" (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2011c" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2011c</LINK>). In 2013 the results of the <LINK REF="STD-Zlotkin-2013-_x0028_C_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Zlotkin 2013 (C)</LINK> trial became available, with no harm observed for iron-treated children. Children included in the latter trial underwent initial screening for malaria, received insecticide-treated bed nets, and were provided with first-line antimalarial treatment if ill. The results of the <LINK REF="STD-Zlotkin-2013-_x0028_C_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Zlotkin 2013 (C)</LINK> trial and this current analysis further shift the emphasis of decision making prior to iron supplementation on malaria prevention and management rather than on the assessment of iron status.</P>

<P>We did not find an increased risk of clinical malaria and parasitaemia, all-cause mortality, or other infectious complications with iron supplementation alone for children living in areas with intense malaria transmission. Subgroup analyses did not point at an increased risk for these outcomes in children that were non-anaemic at baseline and in children younger than two years of age. Overall, iron supplementation may be associated with an increased risk of malaria in settings with no access to malaria prevention or management services, but is safe when such services are available. In such circumstances, administration of iron with an antimalarial drug confers significant protection from malaria, and probably reflects the effect of the antimalarial drugs.</P>
<P>Iron supplementation significantly improves haemoglobin levels and reduces the prevalence of anaemia in highly malaria-endemic areas. Universal screening for iron deficiency and anaemia can select the population most likely to benefit from iron administration, but such screening programmes are not currently feasible in most areas with intense malaria transmission.</P>
<P>Based on our Cochrane review, iron supplementation should not be withheld from children that live in malaria-endemic countries. The new data added to this meta-analysis since 2011 significantly strengthen this recommendation. Malaria prevention and management should be offered to children regardless of iron supplementation, since these interventions reduce malaria, mortality, and anaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Meremikwu-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meremikwu 2008</LINK>). Improvements in prevention and management of malaria have occurred in the last decade in sub-Saharan Africa, allowing for iron supplementation in safer settings than ever before (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-GMP-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO GMP 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MDG-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">MDG 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murray-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are not enough data to draw conclusions on the intervention of iron with folic acid. Folic acid may interfere with the efficacy of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine, an antimalarial drug used for intermittent preventive treatment or treatment of clinical episodes of malaria (<LINK REF="REF-Mulenga-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mulenga 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Metz-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Metz 2007</LINK>). Furthermore, there is no evidence of folate deficiency among children under two years old in malaria-endemic areas (<LINK REF="REF-Metz-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Metz 2007</LINK>).</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-02-23 05:45:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is perhaps a remaining uncertainty whether iron supplementation alone results in an increased risk of malaria in a subset of iron-replete, non-anaemic children living in highly malaria-endemic areas. To address this question, an individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis of existing trials might be of value. Such an analysis will allow a better assessment of the covariates of interest than the trial-level analysis presented herein. These include participants' iron and haemoglobin status at baseline (most trials reported baseline assessment of one or measures of iron status and haemoglobin), and more precise age stratification to address the main group of interest, that of children between six months and two years of age.</P>
<P>Well-conducted observational studies that assess the effects of iron supplementation and fortification (<LINK REF="REF-Stoltzfus-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoltzfus 2011</LINK>) are important since RCTs measure only a limited duration of iron supplementation and may not represent the child population in need of iron supplementation. Growth and developmental outcomes would probably be better assessed in such long-term studies.</P>
<P>Further studies should establish optimal malaria prevention and management programmes to prevent harm during iron administration.</P>

<LI>We moved parasitaemia was moved from the primary to secondary outcomes.</LI>
<LI>We removed protocol-defined secondary outcomes on iron levels, ferritin levels, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), zinc protoporphyrin concentration and zinc. We extracted these outcomes but reporting was sparse</LI>

<LI>We completely separated comparisons of iron versus placebo/no treatment and iron plus folic acid versus placebo/no treatment.</LI>
<LI>We separated analyses of severe malaria by definition of this outcome.</LI>
<LI>Trials that did not report any of the review-defined outcomes were excluded.</LI>
<LI>We added new trials and reclassified trials awaiting assessment.</LI>
<LI>We added stratification for anaemia at baseline based on mean haemoglobin in the control group rather than on the percentage of children with anaemia in the trial and subgroup analyses by anaemia at baseline.</LI>

<P>Based on other trials included in this Cochrane review we assumed an average cluster size of 1.5 for households and 32 for classes, when the average cluster size or number of clusters and individuals were not reported (see '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' tables, <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK> for reported and assumed cluster sizes). The design effects (DEs) or intracluster correlation coefficients (ICCs) used for the different outcomes were the following.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Malaria (<LINK REF="STD-Sazawal-2006-_x0028_C_x0029_a" TYPE="STUDY">Sazawal 2006 (C)a</LINK>): unadjusted risk ratio (RR) 1.14 (confidence interval (CI) 1.01 to 1.30) (using number of events reported and number evaluated for clinical malaria), SE (ln RR) = 0.064391; adjusted RR 1.16 (CI 1.00 to 1.34) (reported in the publication for the same outcome), SE (In RR) = 0.074661. DE = (0.074661/0.064391)² = 1.3444 for an average cluster size of 1.4 (households). All trials reporting on malaria-related outcomes used households as the unit of randomization and the same DE of 1.34 was used for all trials and all malaria-related outcomes.</LI>
<LI>Deaths (<LINK REF="STD-Tielsch-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tielsch 2006</LINK>): unadjusted RR 1.04 (0.80 to 1.34), SE (ln RR) = 0.131585; adjusted RR 1.03 (0.78 to 1.37), SE (ln RR) = 0.143692. DE = (0.143692/0.131585)² = 1.192481 for an average cluster size of 82 (sectors), ICC = 0.002. The DE adjusted for a cluster size of 1.5 (household) was 1.001.</LI>
<LI>Anaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Kaiser-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaiser 2006</LINK>). We expected a significant ICC between children in the same household (given their similar nutritional status and infection incidences) and a lower degree of clustering at the community level. However, we did not find ICC estimates in the literature for these units and the cluster RCTs included in the review did not provide data that allowed us to calculate DE or ICC. <LINK REF="REF-Ngnie_x002d_Teta-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ngnie-Teta 2007</LINK> reported that the degree of community-level clustering with regard to moderate to severe anaemia among Beninese and Malian children was 0.14 to 0.19. Assuncao 2007 reported an ICC of 0.07 and a DE of 2.5 in a cluster survey of all children under six years of age, where clusters of about 30 children comprised several households each. <LINK REF="REF-Kaiser-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaiser 2006</LINK> reported the design effects (DE) between 1.4 and 2.4 for anaemia &lt; 11 g/dL in three cluster surveys in Afghanistan and Mongolia (DEs between 1.4 and 2.4), which allowed us to calculate ICCs of between 0.093 and 0.100. We used a DE of 1.4 for trials that used households as the unit of randomization and an ICC value of 0.093 to calculate the DE of trials using larger units of randomization (DE range 2.8 to 3.9). The ICC for haemoglobin, though measuring the same thing, is much smaller because it is a more precise measure. We used an ICC of 0.000 for households and 0.00271 for large clusters (school or class) based on values reported for households and the district health authority level, respectively, although these values refer to adults in England (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Diarrhoea (<LINK REF="REF-Kaiser-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaiser 2006</LINK>). The pooled design effect from five observational studies in <LINK REF="REF-Kaiser-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaiser 2006</LINK> was 3.1, for an average cluster size of 17, the ICC value was 0.131. The DE adjusted for a cluster size of 1.5 was 1.065.</LI>
<LI>Infectious episodes: we calculated a DE of 1.36 from the <LINK REF="STD-Sazawal-2006-_x0028_C_x0029_a" TYPE="STUDY">Sazawal 2006 (C)a</LINK> study that reported both raw numbers and adjusted RR/SE.</LI>
