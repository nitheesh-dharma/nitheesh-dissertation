<TITLE MODIFIED="2008-05-28 09:11:41 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">Major bladder surgery improves chances of survival for people with bladder cancer that has invaded the muscle, but more studies are needed</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Bladder cancer is common worldwide. In rare cases, cancer spreads to the bladder muscle. A combination of surgery and radiation therapy (radiotherapy) is used to try to treat bladder cancer that has invaded the muscle. One treatment involves some radiotherapy, followed by major surgery to remove the bladder. Another treatment uses intensive radiotherapy, followed by smaller surgery if needed. However, it is not clear which treatment offers people the best chance of survival. The review found that survival was better in people receiving major surgery, compared with major radiotherapy although recent surgical and radiotherapy advances have not yet been studied.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2008-05-28 09:24:21 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Muscle invasive bladder cancer is a serious clinical problem and is fatal for the majority of patients. Alternative treatments for this condition are radical cystectomy or radical radiotherapy. The choice of treatment varies according to the resident country. The ideal treatment would be a bladder preserving therapy with total eradication of the tumour without compromising survival.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this review was to compare the overall survival after radical surgery (cystectomy) versus radical radiotherapy in patients with muscle invasive cancer.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (July 2001), MEDLINE (July 2001), EMBASE (July 2001), CancerLIT (July 2001), Healthstar (July 2001) and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (July 2001). Attempts to contact authors of unpublished data were undertaken.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised trials comparing surgery versus radiotherapy were eligible for assessment.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Three reviewers assessed trial quality based on the Cochrane Guidelines. Data were extracted from the text of the article or extrapolated from the Kaplan-Meier plot. The Peto odds ratio was determined to compare the overall survival and disease-specific survival. Analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis and treatment actually received. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-05-28 09:24:21 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three randomised trials comparing pre-operative radiotherapy followed by radical cystectomy (surgery) versus radical radiotherapy with salvage cystectomy (radical radiotherapy) were eligible for assessment. These trials represented a total of 439 patients, 221 randomised to surgery and 218 to radical radiotherapy. Three trials were combined for the overall survival results and one for the disease-specific analysis (Bloom 1982).</P>
<P>The mean overall survival (intention-to-treat analysis) at 3 and 5 years were 45% and 36% for surgery, and 28% and 20% for radiotherapy, respectively. Peto odds ratio (95% confidence interval) analysis consistently favoured surgery in terms of overall survival. The results were significantly in favour of surgery at 3 years (OR = 1.91, 95% CI 1.30 to 2.82) and at 5 years (OR = 1.85 95% CI 1.22 to 2.82).</P>
<P>On a 'treatment received' basis, the results were significantly in favour of surgery at 3 (OR = 1.84, 95% CI 1.17 to 2.90) and 5 years (OR = 2.17, 95% CI 1.39 to 3.38) for overall survival and at 3 years (OR = 1.96, 95% CI 1.06 to 3.65) for disease-specific survival.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The analysis of this review suggests that there is an overall survival benefit with radical surgery compared to radical radiotherapy in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer. However, it must be considered that only three trials were included for analysis, the patients numbers were small and that many patients did not receive the treatment they were randomised to. It must also be noted that many improvements in both radiotherapy and surgery have taken place since the initiation of these trials. </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-03-05 08:57:12 -0600" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The standard therapy in many countries, including the United States, for T2/T3 N0 (UICC stage) muscle invasive transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder is primary radical cystectomy . However, in a number of Oncology Centres in the UK and Canada, a policy of bladder conservation has been pursued for many years. This involves a course of radical radiotherapy treatment to the bladder followed by close observation and salvage cystectomy, if required. This policy has recently been questioned since it has been suggested that the results of radical radiotherapy are inferior to primary cystectomy. In addition, the operative mortality from radical cystectomy has decreased in recent years, and there are now alternative methods to avoid urinary diversion such as reconstructive surgery and the construction of a 'neo-bladder'.</P>
<P>The possibility that radiotherapy may be less effective than surgery has arisen partly because in some published non-randomised clinical trials, radiotherapy appears to result in a poorer overall survival than surgery. However, this difference in overall survival may be attributable to a number of confounding factors, including selection bias. For example, patients undergoing cystectomy are likely to be younger and fitter than those having radiotherapy. Secondly, their tumours are likely to be staged pathologically rather than clinically, which usually results in an increase in the assigned stage for some patients. The equivalence of radiotherapy and surgery in achieving tumour control is however, supported by a study from the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Duncan-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duncan 1986</LINK>). Here radiotherapy was given to all patients as a departmental policy, hence selection bias was mostly avoided. In this series, of almost one thousand patients, overall survival was comparable with that achieved by surgery.</P>
<P>A number of clinical trials (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sell-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Sell 1991</LINK>) where a strategy of preoperative radiotherapy and immediate cystectomy was compared to a full course of radical radiotherapy with surgical salvage, showed no statistically significant difference in overall survival between the two arms. However, there appear to be no data available where surgery alone and radiotherapy have been compared in randomised controlled trials.</P>
<P>Our goal was to conduct a systematic review and, if possible, a meta-analysis to evaluate the impact of surgery or radiotherapy on survival in patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The aim of this review is to define the overall survival and disease-specific survival in patients with localised muscle invasive bladder cancer receiving radical cystectomy or radical radiotherapy. A secondary objective is to evaluate trials where preoperative radiotherapy and immediate cystectomy were compared to a course of radical radiotherapy with surgical salvage.</P>

<P>A total of 571 citations were retrieved from the literature search. These were categorised as 'A' relevant, 'B' reviews and 'C' not relevant. After screening the 'A' category containing 217 references, 6 articles describing relevant randomised trials were obtained: (<LINK REF="STD-Bloom-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Bloom 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wallace1976" TYPE="STUDY">Wallace1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Horwich-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Horwich 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sell-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Sell 1991</LINK>).

<P>For purposes of analysis, preoperative radiotherapy plus radical cystectomy was considered the experimental group, abbreviated to 'surgery', therefore an odds ratio of greater than one would indicate a beneficial effect of surgery. The radical radiotherapy plus salvage cystectomy group was abbreviated to 'radiotherapy'. The three included trials represented a total of 439 patients with invasive bladder cancer ('<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>' - '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>'). Two hundred and twenty-one patients were randomised to the surgery arm and 218 to the radiotherapy arm. However, not all the patients received the protocol treatment after randomisation. In the Bloom study, 21 patients (15 surgery and 6 radiotherapy) did not complete the allocated protocol treatment due to medical unfitness or the development of metastatic disease. In the study by Miller, 5 patients did not receive cystectomy (surgery) due to metastatic disease. Twenty-nine patients in the Sell study did not receive the protocol treatment (22 surgery and 5 radiotherapy) because of refusal or lack of adherence to the protocol. All these patients were excluded from the ITT group and considered as the ' treatment received' group and numbered in total 378, with 173 randomised to surgery and 205 to radiotherapy. All three studies reported data on an intention-to-treat (ITT) and treatment received basis. <LINK REF="STD-Wallace1976" TYPE="STUDY">Wallace1976</LINK> (same study as Bloom), <LINK REF="STD-Miller-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1977</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sell-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Sell 1991</LINK> reported overall survival, whilst <LINK REF="STD-Bloom-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Bloom 1982</LINK> only reported disease-specific survival.</P>
<P>The pooled overall survival at 3 years on an ITT basis was 45% for surgery and 28% for radiotherapy, giving an absolute improvement of 17% and at 5 years the respective values were 36% and 20% (absolute improvement of 16%). On a 'treatment received' basis the overall survival at 3 years was 47% (surgery) and 32% (radiotherapy), and at 5 years were 41% (surgery) and 21% (radiotherapy).</P>
<P>The ITT analysis for overall survival at 3 and 5 years favoured surgery over radiotherapy and was statistically significant at 3 years with an odds ratio (95% confidence interval) = 1.91 (1.30 - 2.82) and at 5 years OR = 1.85 (1.22 - 2.82). The corresponding ratios for 'treatment received' were also significantly in favour of surgery at 3 years OR = 1.84 (1.17 to 2.90) and at 5 years 2.17 (1.39 to 3.38).</P>
<P>For the <LINK REF="STD-Bloom-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Bloom 1982</LINK> study, the disease-specific survival on an ITT basis at 3, 5 and 10 years for surgery were 45%, 38% and 30% and for radiotherapy were 33%, 29% and 20% (the 10 year values were reported by Horwich 1999). On a 'treatment received' basis, the disease-specific survival at 3 and 5 years was 53% and 44% (surgery) and 36% and 31% (radiotherapy). No 10-year data were reported.</P>
<P>The odds ratios (95% confidence interval) for disease-specific survival on an ITT basis as reported by Bloom 1982 at 3, 5, and 10 years were respectively 1.65 (0.92 to 2.95), 1.38 (0.75 to 2.54) and 1.77 (0.92 to 3.40), in favour of surgery but not statistically significant. The ratios for the 'treatment received' group at 3 and 5 years (no data are available for 10 years of follow up) were 1.96 (1.06 to 3.65) and 1.78 (0.94 to 3.37), respectively.</P>
<P>No toxicity data were reported in the <LINK REF="STD-Bloom-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Bloom 1982</LINK> study. <LINK REF="STD-Miller-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1977</LINK> did not report treatment complications for the randomised study included in this review, but did report on 724 patients receiving radiation therapy for carcinoma of the urinary bladder at the M.D. Anderson Hospital and Tumour Institute between 1954 and 1970. In 533 patients receiving definitive radiation (7000 cGy in 35 fractions over 7 weeks) the complication rate was 14% with a mortality rate of 4%. The most common major sites of complication were bladder (27%), rectum (13%) and renal (10%). For 125 patients receiving pre-operative radiation and cystectomy the complication rate was 48%. The most common complications were wound infection and/or dehiscence (18%), ureto-ileal obstruction or leakage (10%), pyelonephritis (10%) and bowel fistula or obstruction (9 and 8%).</P>
<P>The most frequent early side effect for both radical and pre-operative radiation therapy in the <LINK REF="STD-Sell-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Sell 1991</LINK> study was diarrhoea, requiring medical attention in 20% of patients. One third in each group experienced urinary frequency and dysuria. Early complications of radical cystectomy were cicatricial rupture (5%), intestinal fistula (5%), urinary fistula (5%), wound infection (3%), haematoma (3%), pelvic abscess (3%) and defecatory problems (3%). Ileus (5%) was the main early complication of pre-operative radiotherapy. Thirty-eight percent of early complications following cystectomy needed treating compared to 30% following salvage cystectomy. The major late complication following radical radiotherapy was contracted bladder (10%), whereas late rectal complications were observed in 30% of patients receiving radical radiotherapy compared to 36% in the cystectomy group. Additionally, all male patients following radical cystectomy experienced impotence whereas 41% of patients following radical radiotherapy could practice normal coitus.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-03-05 08:56:31 -0600" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The prognosis for invasive bladder is poor with 5 year survival ranging between 20% to 50%. Our knowledge of the genetic and molecular mechanisms of bladder cancer have increased considerably in recent years, but this has not yet been translated in to improved survival figures. Many urologists consider cystectomy to be generally indicated for patients with muscle invasive tumours (<LINK REF="REF-Turner-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 1999</LINK>). However, the ideal treatment for this disease would be to totally eradicate the tumour whilst preserving bladder and sexual function. Bladder-sparing radical radiotherapy may be just as effective as surgery in terms of patient survival (<LINK REF="REF-Tsujii-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tsujii 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>The literature search in the present study (1966 to July 2000), did not identify any randomised controlled trials comparing primary cystectomy with definitive radiotherapy for invasive bladder cancer. Three randomised trials were found that compared pre-operative radiotherapy followed by radical cystectomy (surgery) versus radical radiotherapy with salvage cystectomy (radiotherapy). Analysis of these three studies indicated that overall survival at 3 and 5 years was significantly better with surgery in the 'intention-to-treat' group and in the 'treatment received' group.</P>
<P>Disease-specific survival is an assessment of treatment efficacy which eliminates confounding factors due to other causes of death, in an ostensibly elderly population. In the present analysis, a substantial number of patients (14 %) did not receive the treatment they were randomised to receive. Although in both the 'intention-to-treat' and the 'treatment received' analysis the odds ratios were in favour of surgery, it was only significant at 3 years for the latter group.</P>
<P>An attempt to contact the author, SD Cutler of the National Bladder Cancer Group, cited as a personal communication in a review by <LINK REF="REF-Scher-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scher 1997</LINK> has so far proved unsuccessful. It was reported in this review that T2 to T4a bladder cancer patients were randomised to 50 Gy followed by cystectomy (37 patients ) or 60 Gy to 80 Gy plus salvage cystectomy (35 patients). The 5 years survival rates were 27% and 40%, respectively. Although these figures support the view that radical radiotherapy provides a better outcome in terms of survival, it was considered inappropriate to include these data in the present review because there was insufficient trial information and the data were not first hand. We will continue our attempts to contact SD Cutler and if successful will include the results in an update of this review. We have also been unable to obtain individual patient data on the three included trials, to perform an updated meta-analysis. The results are therefore based on published data.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Based on the review of three randomised trials, comparing pre-operative radiotherapy with radical radiotherapy followed by salvage cystectomy and the results of our subsequent meta-analysis, we consider that the evidence consistently favours surgery in terms of survival. However, it must also be considered that the randomised trials evaluated in this analysis were not recent and that major advances have been made since these trials commenced in both surgery (with respect to neobladder construction), and radiotherapy and include areas such as CT planning, higher dose delivery, conformal radiotherapy and supportive care.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Taking into account the poor 5 year survival figures for invasive bladder cancer and the limited data available, we would propose that a further randomised trial of sufficient power be undertaken to provide convincing evidence that one modality is superior. Although radical radiotherapy showed a reduced overall and disease-specific survival in the present review, it is uncertain whether the optimal treatment conditions were used because of the variation in dose and schedule given in these studies. Future randomised trials with radiotherapy in invasive bladder cancer, using modern doses, schedules and planning techniques, should provide a more realistic comparison with radical cystectomy.</P>
