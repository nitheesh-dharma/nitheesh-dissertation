<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Doctors and healthcare professionals often give blood transfusions to people after loss of blood from surgery, bleeding, or medical illnesses. Blood is a limited resource, so for this reason, and because some low-income countries do not test the blood used in transfusions for the presence of dangerous viruses such as HIV or hepatitis, it is helpful to give blood transfusions only when they are really necessary.</P>
<P>A normal blood count is above 12. This review summarised all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated whether it is safe to give blood transfusions when the blood count drops to between seven and eight (thereby reducing the number of transfusions), rather than giving transfusions at higher blood counts of nine to 10.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We examined the results of RCTs that randomly allocated participants to one of two groups. In one group, trial participants received blood at lower blood counts. In the other group, trial participants received blood at higher blood counts. The data are current up to May 2016.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>We identified a total of 31 relevant trials, which involved 12,587 participants. All of the studies compared different policies for blood transfusions. We found that participants who were assigned to receive blood at lower blood counts were 43% less likely to receive a blood transfusion than those who were given blood at higher blood counts. The risk of dying within 30 days of the transfusion was the same whether the participants received transfusion at lower or higher blood counts. We also evaluated harmful events that occurred after participants received, or did not receive, blood transfusions, including infection (pneumonia, wound infection, and blood poisoning), heart attacks, strokes, and problems with blood clots, and found that there was no clear difference in the instance of these events between the group that received transfusions at lower blood counts and the group that received transfusions at higher blood counts.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of evidence</B>
</P>
<P>We found that most of the RCTs provided a high quality of evidence, in that they were adequately conducted and used appropriate methods that minimised any possible biases that could make the validity of the results uncertain.</P>
<P>
<B>Authors conclusions</B>
</P>
<P>We concluded that it was not harmful to the participants' health status to give blood at lower or higher blood counts. If a policy of giving blood only at lower blood counts were followed routinely in clinical practice, it would reduce the amount of blood patients receive substantially and reduce the risk of patients receiving blood transfusions unnecessarily, as transfusions can have harmful effects. Additional studies are needed to establish the blood count at which a blood transfusion is needed in patients who have suffered a heart attack, brain injury, or have cancer.<BR/>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-10-07 12:54:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laura E  Prescott">
<P>There is considerable uncertainty regarding the optimal haemoglobin threshold for the use of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in anaemic patients. Blood is a scarce resource, and in some countries, transfusions are less safe than others because of a lack of testing for viral pathogens. Therefore, reducing the number and volume of transfusions would benefit patients.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-10-11 17:13:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The aim of this review was to compare 30-day mortality and other clinical outcomes in participants randomized to restrictive versus liberal red blood cell (RBC) transfusion thresholds (triggers) for all conditions. The restrictive transfusion threshold uses a lower haemoglobin level to trigger transfusion (most commonly 7 g/dL or 8 g/dL), and the liberal transfusion threshold uses a higher haemoglobin level to trigger transfusion (most commonly 9 g/dL to 10 g/dL).</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-10-07 13:46:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laura E  Prescott">
<P>We identified trials by searching CENTRAL (2016, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1946 to May 2016), Embase (1974 to May 2016), the Transfusion Evidence Library (1950 to May 2016), the Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index (1990 to May 2016), and ongoing trial registries (27 May 2016). We also checked reference lists of other published reviews and relevant papers to identify any additional trials.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-10-11 17:14:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomized trials where intervention groups were assigned on the basis of a clear transfusion 'trigger', described as a haemoglobin (Hb) or haematocrit (Hct) level below which a red blood cell (RBC) transfusion was to be administered.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-10-07 14:08:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laura E  Prescott">
<P>We pooled risk ratios of clinical outcomes across trials using a random-effects model. Two people extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias. We conducted predefined analyses by clinical subgroups. We defined participants randomly allocated to the lower transfusion threshold as 'restrictive transfusion' and to the higher transfusion threshold as 'liberal transfusion'.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-10-10 16:04:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A total of 31 trials, involving 12,587 participants, across a range of clinical specialities (e.g. surgery, critical care) met the eligibility criteria. The trial interventions were split fairly equally with regard to the haemoglobin concentration used to define the restrictive transfusion group. About half of them used a 7 g/dL threshold, and the other half used a restrictive transfusion threshold of 8 g/dL to 9 g/dL. The trials were generally at low risk of bias .Some items of methodological quality were unclear, including definitions and blinding for secondary outcomes.</P>
<P>Restrictive transfusion strategies reduced the risk of receiving a RBC transfusion by 43% across a broad range of clinical specialties (risk ratio (RR) 0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 0.65; 12,587 participants, 31 trials; high-quality evidence), with a large amount of heterogeneity between trials (I² = 97%). Overall, restrictive transfusion strategies did not increase or decrease the risk of 30-day mortality compared with liberal transfusion strategies (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.16, I² = 37%; N = 10,537; 23 trials; moderate-quality evidence) or any of the other outcomes assessed (i.e. cardiac events (low-quality evidence), myocardial infarction, stroke, thromboembolism (high-quality evidence)). Liberal transfusion did not affect the risk of infection (pneumonia, wound, or bacteraemia).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-10-10 15:48:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Transfusing at a restrictive haemoglobin concentration of between 7 g/dL to 8 g/dL decreased the proportion of participants exposed to RBC transfusion by 43% across a broad range of clinical specialities. There was no evidence that a restrictive transfusion strategy impacts 30-day mortality or morbidity (i.e. mortality at other points, cardiac events, myocardial infarction, stroke, pneumonia, thromboembolism, infection) compared with a liberal transfusion strategy. There were insufficient data to inform the safety of transfusion policies in certain clinical subgroups, including acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction, neurological injury/traumatic brain injury, acute neurological disorders, stroke, thrombocytopenia, cancer, haematological malignancies, and bone marrow failure. The findings provide good evidence that transfusions with allogeneic RBCs can be avoided in most patients with haemoglobin thresholds above 7 g/dL to 8 g/dL.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-10-11 17:14:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-10-07 15:38:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laura E  Prescott">
<P>Patients who are ill in hospital are frequently anaemic, with low haemoglobin concentrations. The causes of anaemia are diverse, including loss of blood from surgery, bleeding, excessive blood sampling for laboratory tests, or as a consequence of illness. Patients with cancer may develop anaemia because of the underlying disease or chemotherapy affecting production of red cells in their bone marrow. Anaemia both decreases the oxygen content of the blood supplied to the tissues, including the myocardium, and increases myocardial oxygen demand by requiring a higher cardiac output to maintain adequate systemic oxygen delivery (<LINK REF="REF-Sabatine-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sabatine 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Anaemia has been associated with worse outcomes in patients who are anaemic prior to surgery or who have cardiovascular disease (<LINK REF="REF-Carson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carson 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shander-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shander 2014</LINK>). However, it does not necessarily follow that the correction of anaemia by red blood cell (RBC) transfusion will improve outcomes. Anaemia is generally well tolerated by many people, and therefore, the benefits of potentially corrective treatments such as red cell transfusions need to be weighed against their risks.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-10-10 16:10:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The main treatment option for raising the haemoglobin concentration rapidly in patients with anaemia remains RBC transfusion. Red cells for transfusion are collected from whole blood donations that are centrifuged to concentrate them, prior to the addition of anticoagulant and storage solutions. However, there are recognised risks of blood transfusion, as with any medical intervention. These risks and the general availability of RBC transfusion vary throughout the world. In countries with well-regulated blood supplies, the safety of allogeneic red cell transfusion has improved significantly over the past 30 years, and the overall risks are very low. For example, in the USA, the estimated risk per unit for HIV is 1:1,467,000 (<LINK REF="REF-Zou-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zou 2010</LINK>); for the hepatitis C virus (HCV), 1:1,149,000 (<LINK REF="REF-Zou-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zou 2010</LINK>); and for the hepatitis B virus (HBV), 1:282,000 to 1:357,000 (<LINK REF="REF-Zou-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zou 2009</LINK>). This has been primarily due to improvements in donor blood screening policies and the implementation of more stringent quality control measures (<LINK REF="REF-Klein-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>In resource-poor countries, the supply of blood is inadequate and may not be safe because it is not often tested for viral pathogens. Blood donations are not routinely tested in 39 countries for transfusion-transmissible infections that include HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and syphilis (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2011</LINK>). In 40 countries, less than 25% of the blood supply is collected from voluntary unpaid blood donors, with most coming from family or paid blood donors (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2011</LINK>). The prevalence of HIV in low-income countries is 2.3% of blood donations compared with 0.001% in high-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Other general risks of transfusion have been described (although perhaps under-reported) and include acute transfusion reactions, volume overload, bacterial contamination, infection with new - but currently unknown - blood-borne pathogens, and transfusion-related acute lung injury (<LINK REF="REF-Delaney-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delaney 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Toy-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toy 2012</LINK>). Additional possible adverse effects include loss of red cell nitric oxide production, which is thought to induce local vasodilatation; prothrombotic effects from factors in the supernatant; and variable immunomodulatory or proinflammatory effects from different cellular products in the red cell component. Overall, these harmful effects of red cell transfusions may be manifested as increased risks of infections in hospitals or cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction or stroke.</P>
<P>There were concerns that the effects of storage on red cells may also render them less effective and potentially harmful. However, recent trials have not demonstrated clinical harm to blood stored for approximately 21 to 28 days compared with less than seven to 10 days (<LINK REF="REF-Dhabangi-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dhabangi 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fergusson-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fergusson 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lacroix-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lacroix 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steiner-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steiner 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>Blood transfusion is expensive. The direct costs of each collected bag of red cells fail to capture the many associated costs related to hospital blood-banking practice and safe patient administration. In 2008, the mean payment for one unit of leukoreduced RBCs in the USA was USD 223 (<LINK REF="REF-Whitaker-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitaker 2011</LINK>). However, if the costs of administration as well as the acquisition expenses of RBC transfusion are considered, the estimated cost derived from four USA and European hospitals rises to USD 761 per unit (standard deviation +/- USD 294) (<LINK REF="REF-Shander-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shander 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Treatment options for anaemia other than red cell transfusions may include erythropoietin, and oral or intravenous iron therapy. These have been used in chronic anaemia, particularly in renal failure, for many years, but are the subjects of other systematic reviews, so we did not consider them further within this review.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-10-11 17:14:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The rationale for transfusing RBCs in anaemic patients is to improve oxygen delivery to the tissues and to the myocardium itself, to reduce the compensatory work done by the heart to increase cardiac output. Red blood cell transfusion is one of the few treatments that may restore tissue oxygenation adequately when oxygen demand exceeds supply (<LINK REF="REF-Klein-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wang-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Many randomized controlled trials that compared outcomes in participants allocated to different policies or schedules of using red cell transfusions have now been completed and reported. These studies presented results after randomising participants to either 'restrictive' triggers (typically, participants are transfused only when their haemoglobin concentration falls to around 7 g/dL to 8 g/dL) or 'liberal' triggers (participants are transfused at a higher haemoglobin concentration of around 9 g/dL to 10 g/dL). Historically, the widely accepted clinical standard was to transfuse patients when the haemoglobin level dropped below 10 g/dL or the haematocrit fell below 30%. Adams and Lundy first proposed this '10/30 rule' in 1942, and it served as a RBC transfusion trigger for decades (<LINK REF="REF-Madjdpour-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Madjdpour 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wang-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2010</LINK>). However, the 1988 National Institutes of Health Consensus Conference in the USA reported that the evidence did not support a single criterion for transfusion (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 1988</LINK>). Since then, most published guidelines have advised against a single threshold for RBC transfusion, recommending that a range of haemoglobin values between 6 g/dL and 10 g/dL can be used, depending on the presence of serious comorbidity (<LINK REF="REF-AAGBI-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAGBI 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ASA-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">ASA 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-BCTMAG-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">BCTMAG 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Carson-2012a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carson 2012a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Napolitano-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Napolitano 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NBUGI-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">NBUGI 2001</LINK>). The American Association of Blood Banks (AABB) guidelines advise using a restrictive transfusion threshold of 7 g/dL to 8 g/dL in most clinical settings (<LINK REF="REF-Carson-2012a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carson 2012a</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-10-11 17:14:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Much of the earlier evidence comparing restrictive and liberal thresholds comes from trials based in critical care. In 1999, the landmark TRICC trial (<B>t</B>ransfusion <B>r</B>equirements <B>i</B>n <B>c</B>ritical <B>c</B>are) found a similar mortality in participants transfused at a restrictive trigger of less than 7 g/dL compared with a liberal trigger of less than 10 g/dL (<LINK REF="STD-H_x00e9_bert-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hébert 1999</LINK>). Since the last review (<LINK REF="REF-Carson-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carson 2012b</LINK>), the number of participants enrolled in trials has doubled from 6264 to 12,587. Therefore, there is a need to update this systematic review to ensure that new guidelines continue to be based on the most recent literature reporting on the effectiveness and safety of RBC transfusion.</P>
<P>The purpose of the review was to identify, appraise, and summarize the data from all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that studied the clinical impact of varying thresholds for transfusion with RBCs. We were particularly interested in whether the results of RCTs support the trend for increasingly restrictive RBC transfusion practices across all patient groups and if RBC transfusions can be withheld in some circumstances without harming patients.</P>

<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-10-11 17:14:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The aim of this review was to compare 30-day mortality and other clinical outcomes in participants randomized to restrictive versus liberal red blood cell (RBC) transfusion thresholds (triggers) for all conditions. The restrictive transfusion threshold uses a lower haemoglobin level to trigger transfusion (most commonly 7 g/dL or 8 g/dL), and the liberal transfusion threshold uses a higher haemoglobin level to trigger transfusion (most commonly 9 g/dL to 10 g/dL).</P>

<P>To examine the evidence for the effect of transfusion thresholds on the use of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions and the evidence for any change in clinical outcomes, we included randomized controlled trials if the comparison groups were assigned on the basis of a transfusion 'threshold' (also known as a 'trigger'), defined as a haemoglobin or haematocrit level (with or without a specified level of haemodynamic instability) that had to be reached before a RBC transfusion was administered. We required that control group participants had to have been either transfused with allogeneic or autologous red blood cells, or both, at higher haemoglobin or haematocrit levels (transfusion threshold) than the intervention group, or transfused in accordance with current transfusion practices, which may not have included a well-defined transfusion threshold, but involved liberal rather than restrictive transfusion practices. We excluded trials that were not designed to include any clinical outcomes relevant to this review.</P>

<P>The intervention considered was the use of transfusion thresholds ('triggers') as a means of guiding allogeneic or autologous RBC transfusion, or both. A liberal transfusion threshold most often refers to administration of blood transfusion when the haemoglobin level falls below 9 g/dL to 10 g/dL. A restrictive transfusion threshold most often refers to administration of blood transfusion when the haemoglobin level falls below 7 g/dL to 8 g/dL.</P>

<P>In contrast to prior versions of this systematic review, the primary outcome for this analysis was 30-day mortality. The primary outcome was changed because mortality is a more clinically relevant outcome and the number of participants enrolled in trials provided sufficient power to examine this outcome. Sample size calculations assuming baseline 30-day mortality of 9% for restrictive transfusion, 90% power, alpha level of 0.05, indicate that to detect a 15%, 20%, or 25% relative decrease in mortality with the use of liberal transfusion, a study needs to enrol 17,500, or 9600, or 6000 participants, respectively.</P>

<CRIT_OUTCOMES_SECONDARY MODIFIED="2016-10-10 22:34:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Other time periods we examined for mortality included: during hospital admission, at 90 days, and long term (median follow-up of 3.1 years). We compared RBC transfusion use between the groups (listed below for the morbidity outcome) by proportion of participants exposed to transfusion, participants exposed to allogeneic or autologous transfusion, units of blood transfused, and units of blood transfused in those receiving any transfusion. We evaluated morbidity that occurred during hospitalisation, including cardiac events (composite of myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, pulmonary oedema, and angina), non-fatal and fatal myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, cerebral vascular accident (stroke), rebleeding, infection, thromboembolism, renal failure, mental confusion, function, and fatigue. Infection was defined in three ways: sepsis or bacteraemia, pneumonia alone, or pneumonia plus wound infection. We defined all morbidity outcomes according to their definitions in the individual trials.</P>
<P>As this review is an update, we have continued to include some of the secondary outcomes for historical reasons. As stronger evidence is accrued, we feel that in future updates of this review, some of these outcomes may need to be modified or omitted.</P>

For trials involving surgical participants, we recorded the following outcomes: postoperative complications (infection, haemorrhage, non-fatal myocardial infarction, cardiac events, renal failure, stroke, thromboembolism, pulmonary oedema, mental confusion), mortality, and length of hospital stay (not reported in the review). We recorded data for blood loss and haemoglobin and hematocrit levels (on admission, pre- and post-transfusion, and at discharge). We recorded information regarding demographics (age, sex), type of surgery, and medical condition on the data extraction form.

<P>We calculated the risk ratio (RR) for allogeneic blood transfusion in the intervention group compared with the control group and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each trial using a random-effects model (<LINK REF="REF-Der-Simonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Der Simonian 1986</LINK>). We adopted a similar approach for other outcomes of transfusion. We also entered the mean number of units of RBCs transfused to each group and the corresponding standard deviations. We used the mean difference (MD) and 95% CI to express the average mean reduction in the number of units of RBC administered to the intervention group compared with the control group. When the event rate was low, we considered using the Peto odds ratio when criteria for this method were fulfilled.</P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2016-10-10 01:51:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laura E  Prescott">
<P>The unit of analysis was the participant. In all of the trials except one (<LINK REF="STD-Jairath-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Jairath 2015</LINK>), randomisation was at the individual participant level. In one trial in people with gastrointestinal bleeding (<LINK REF="STD-Jairath-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Jairath 2015</LINK>), the randomisation was at the level of the hospital (cluster), but the analysis occurred at the level of the individual participant. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was very low (0.0001) for the outcome of mortality, and we therefore included the data considering the participant as the unit of randomisation and ignoring the clustering, but performed a sensitivity analysis excluding this trial, to see what effect, if any, it had on the analysis. We did not evaluate any outcomes with repeated measures.</P>

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2016-10-11 17:14:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We examined statistical heterogeneity using both the I² statistic and Chi² test. The I² statistic describes the percentage of total variation across studies due to heterogeneity rather than chance. A value of 0% indicates no observed heterogeneity, and larger values show increasing heterogeneity; moderate or substantial heterogeneity is considered to exist when the I² exceeds 50% or 85% respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). For the Chi² test, we used a P value of &lt; 0.10 to indicate the presence of statistically significant heterogeneity. Because of the anticipated significant clinical heterogeneity of the trials, we analyzed data using a random-effects model. We also anticipated a high level of heterogeneity related to transfusion rates because practice in the different specialties of the trials would vary considerably according to speciality-specific protocols. Therefore, as described later, we chose to provide a summary statistic for the outcomes of transfusion even when I² was very high, because of the clinically relevant information it provides.</P>

<P>When there were more than 10 studies available, we examined funnel plots for the primary outcome of 30-day mortality and the proportion of participants transfused for evidence of publication bias. We used the proportion of participants transfused because all trials reported this outcome, and it may reflect overall risk of publication bias better than 30-day mortality, which was not reported in all of the trials.</P>

<P>We performed all analyses using Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-Review-Manager-5a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Review Manager 5a</LINK>). We entered data for the numbers of participants exposed to allogeneic blood and the numbers of participants in each treatment group into Review Manager. When studies presented transfusion volume as millilitres (mL), we converted these amounts to units by dividing by 300. We converted studies reporting haematocrit to haemoglobin concentration by dividing by three. We pooled the data for all outcomes and presented data stratified by subgroups for the primary outcome of 30-day mortality and proportion of participants transfused. We used Peto odds ratios for the outcomes with event rates less than 1%. For continuous variables, we estimated the pooled mean difference and 95% CI using the generic inverse variance method.</P>

<P>The prespecified subgroups evaluated were clinical specialties (acute blood loss/trauma, cancer, cardiac surgery, critical care, orthopaedic surgery, myocardial infarction, vascular surgery, and haematological malignancies).

We also examined a post hoc subgroup of participants enrolled with myocardial infarction compared with all other clinical specialties, and we combined cardiac surgery with myocardial infarction because of emerging evidence that participants with acute myocardial infarction might differ from other anaemic participants (<LINK REF="STD-Carson-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Where appropriate, as part of the exploration for clinical heterogeneity, we distinguished between adult and paediatric trials, for example, in analysis of the quantity of blood transfused (as this would not be directly comparable between adults and children), or in clinical settings where the widely used paediatric transfusion protocols differ.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Performance bias</HEADING>
<P>The nature of the intervention means that blinding of clinicians involved in the care and administration of blood transfusions would not have been feasible. The extent to which this could have biased the results is unclear, but we rated 28 trials as being at unclear risk of bias for this domain. One trial reported that participants were blinded to treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Foss-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Foss 2009</LINK>). Thus, we have rated this study as being at low risk of bias for this domain. We rated one study as being at high risk because in a cluster design everyone knows the assigned group or cluster (<LINK REF="STD-Jairath-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Jairath 2015</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Detection bias</HEADING>
<P>Outcomes are optimally assessed when assessors are blinded to assignment. It is possible to blind the assessment of many outcomes by using, for example, an adjudication committee. In contrast, for some outcomes such as death, blinded assessment is less useful. Since most trials evaluated multiple outcomes, it is possible that the potential bias for the assessment of one outcome would differ to that for another outcome. We classified risk of bias on the basis of the primary outcome of the trial. We judged the risk of bias to be low for 15 studies, high for three, and uncertain for 13 trials.</P>

The overall risk ratio for 30-day mortality stratified by clinical specialty was 0.97 (95% CI 0.81 to 1.16; <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). The test for differences in 30-day mortality between the subgroups was not significant (Chi² = 9.78, df = 6 (P = 0.13); I² = 38.6%).</P>
<P>In two trials that reported mortality at 30 days in 2221 participants with acute blood loss or trauma (GI bleeding), the mortality was significantly lower using the restrictive strategy compared with the liberal strategy (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.97; <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two trials recruited 154 participants who had acute myocardial infarction and evaluated mortality after random allocation; for this subgroup, the mortality risk was higher in the restrictive strategy group than in the liberal strategy group (RR 3.88, 95% CI 0.83 to 18.13). We carried out a post hoc subgroup analysis that compared the 30-day mortality in the two trials that included 154 acute myocardial infarction participants versus all other participants, but found no differences. The P value for subgroup differences was 0.08 (Chi² = 3.09, df = 1; I² = 67.6%; <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). Although we observed a very high risk ratio for the myocardial infarction participants (RR 3.88), the two included studies were very small, and hence, the pooled estimate is not robust.</P>
<P>In a separate subgroup, we combined five trials, with 3096 participants, those with myocardial infarction and those undergoing cardiac surgery; the risk ratio for 30-day mortality was 1.28 (95% CI 0.80 to 2.06; <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>), and there was very little heterogeneity (I² = 12%).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Blood transfusions</HEADING>
<P>Historically, exploration of differences in the proportion of participants transfused has been the analysis of preference in earlier versions of this Cochrane Review. As indicated in the <LINK TAG="METHODS" TYPE="SECTION">Methods</LINK>, we anticipated high levels of heterogeneity in the analysis of transfusion outcomes, for several reasons. In particular, standard 'control' rates of transfusion practice are very variable across the clinical specialties in which trials were identified for this update. These differing rates of transfusion policy reflect practice defined in speciality guidelines and recommendations. It is usually recommended that pooled estimates are not presented when there is such high heterogeneity. However, we have chosen to present the pooled results here, and our further justification for presenting these results for transfusion outcomes is presented in the <LINK TAG="DISCUSSION" TYPE="SECTION">Discussion</LINK>.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Proportion of participants transfused</HEADING>
<P>This analysis demonstrates the difference in the proportion of participants transfused in the liberal and restrictive arms of the trials. Data on the proportion of transfused participants were available from 31 trials (12,547 participants). The implementation of a restrictive transfusion trigger across all trials reduced the relative risk of receiving a RBC transfusion by 43% (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.65; <LINK REF="CMP-006.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.1</LINK>). Heterogeneity between these trials was large and significant (Chi² = 948.58, df = 30 (P &lt; 0.00001); I² = 97%).</P>
<P>The proportion of participants transfused in the liberal and restrictive arms of the trials were very different across the different clinical specialities, with the largest difference evident in the subgroup of participants with acute blood loss (<LINK REF="CMP-006.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.2</LINK>). The test for subgroup differences was significant: Chi² = 175.97, df = 6 (P &lt; 0.00001); I² = 96.6%. The acute blood loss/trauma subgroup included diverse underlying illnesses for haemorrhage, including comorbidities. For example, <LINK REF="STD-Prick-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Prick 2014</LINK> recruited young (otherwise healthy) women with postpartum haemorrhage, while <LINK REF="STD-Jairath-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Jairath 2015</LINK> enrolled older participants with gastrointestinal bleeding, characterised by many comorbidities. <LINK REF="STD-Prick-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Prick 2014</LINK> contributed to a large extent to the high heterogeneity in this subgroup, and temporarily removing it from the analysis reduced heterogeneity to 77%. By contrast, participants enrolled in the subgroup of cardiac surgery trials demonstrated less variability in risk of transfusion across trials, and in this subgroup, we observed no heterogeneity. In the subgroup of critical care trials, the high heterogeneity (I² = 88%) was substantially reduced to 35% by temporarily removing the paediatric trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lacroix-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lacroix 2007</LINK>). This sensitivity analysis, although post hoc, highlights how transfusion policies in this setting differed from adult protocols in a critical care setting.</P>
<P>The relative risk of transfusion was higher when the differences in haemoglobin transfusion thresholds between the restrictive and liberal transfusion arms were 2 g/dL or more, compared with those in which the difference was less than 2 g/dL (test for overall effect: Z = 2.17 (P = 0.03); <LINK REF="CMP-006.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.3</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was no difference in the proportion of participants transfused between trials that used a restrictive transfusion threshold of 8 g/dL to 9 g/dL versus less than 7 g/dL (test for subgroup differences: Chi² = 0.13, df = 1 (P = 0.72); I² = 0%; <LINK REF="CMP-006.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.4</LINK>).</P>
<P>The funnel plot for the proportion of participants transfused displays a grouping of trials with a risk ratio around 0.5 for receiving a transfusion in the restrictive transfusion arm (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>), which is consistent with the overall observation that participants in the restrictive arm were transfused approximately half as often as those in the liberal arm. As expected, there were no studies in which participants in the restrictive arm were transfused more than the liberal arm.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Quantity of RBCs transfused</HEADING>
<P>Twelve trials reported the quantities of blood transfused. The use of a restrictive transfusion trigger resulted in an average saving of 1.30 units of RBCs per transfused participant (mean difference (MD) -1.30, 95% CI -1.85 to -0.75; <LINK REF="CMP-006.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.5</LINK>).

Heterogeneity between these trials was moderate and significant (Chi² = 21.25, df = 8 (P = 0.0007); I² = 62%). It is possible that participants were counted in more than one category of this composite outcome because these disorders are clinically inter-related (for example, a participant could have angina that might lead to pulmonary oedema).</P>

Heterogeneity between these trials was statistically significant (Chi² = 11.95, df = 5 (P = 0.04); I² = 58%).

Heterogeneity between these trials was not statistically significant (Chi² = 19.00, df = 13 (P = 0.12); I² = 32%). Combining pneumonia with wound infections in the same analysis group has been the norm historically, but this was primarily due to a lack of sufficient data to separate these analyses.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-10-11 17:14:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified 31 randomized controlled trials that compared outcomes in participants allocated to receive transfusions of red blood cells (RBCs) at different haemoglobin concentration thresholds. These trials were undertaken between 1956 and 2016 and enrolled 12,587 participants across diverse patient populations. In the past four years, the number of participants in published trials evaluating transfusion thresholds has doubled.</P>
<P>The results of the meta-analyses indicated that restrictive transfusion strategies led to a reduction of more than one-third (43%) in the number of participants receiving at least one unit of blood, a red blood cell (RBC) transfusion requirement that was approximately 1.3 units lower, and a haemoglobin concentration that was around 1.32 g/dL lower than in the liberal transfusion groups. Most importantly, the meta-analyses provided no evidence that restrictive transfusion policies harmed the participants or that they benefited from the use of liberal transfusion policies, within the parameters defined in the trials. Put another way, there was no evidence of an impact on clinically important outcomes when following a restrictive RBC transfusion policy compared with a liberal RBC transfusion policy. These findings may encourage the wider adoption of restrictive transfusion strategies, which would contribute to preserving blood supply.</P>
<P>Given the significant increase (a doubling) in the number of participants enrolled in transfusion threshold trials since this Cochrane Review was last published, this review has sufficient power to allow the primary outcome to be changed to 30-day mortality. This increase also provided the opportunity to explore subgroups of participants with different underlying diseases, to ascertain whether the effects of RBC transfusion by haemoglobin thresholds are consistent across clinical specialities. This is important because there are pathophysiological reasons to postulate why transfusion might impact clinical outcomes differently in different patient populations, due to factors such as duration of anaemia (short term in critical illness versus long-term transfusion dependence in bone marrow failure) or presence or not of an underlying restriction in cardiac function. Overall, across nearly all subgroups, the results indicated that risk of death and other adverse events were not impacted by either liberal or restrictive transfusion thresholds. Transfusion strategy did not influence the risk of cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, or stroke, although heterogeneity was observed in the trials that evaluated congestive heart failure (P = 0.01; I² = 57%).</P>
<P>In two subgroups of participant &#8211; those with acute blood loss and those with acute myocardial infarction, mortality may be influenced by a liberal or restrictive transfusion strategy, though the test for differences in 30-day mortality between the subgroups was not significant (P = 0.13; I² = 41.2%). To be specific, in three trials (N = 1522) in participants with gastrointestinal bleeding (included in the acute blood loss or trauma grouping), a restrictive transfusion strategy was associated with a 35% lower risk of 30-day mortality than a liberal transfusion strategy. The mechanism responsible for this significantly reduced risk of death may be due to a lower risk of rebleeding under restrictive transfusion regimens (risk ratio (RR) 0.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.43 to 0.97; <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>.4). The reason for this effect is not known, but may reflect higher vascular pressures following transfusion in the liberal transfusion group compared with the restrictive transfusion group. Participants enrolled with acute myocardial infarction constituted the other subgroup with apparently different results for 30-day mortality. Two small trials included these participants (N = 154) for which the 30-day mortality was 3.88 times higher in the restrictive transfusion group than in the liberal transfusion group (95% CI 0.83 to 18.13). These findings only provide a signal, since the results were not statistically significant and were based on a small number of participants.</P>
<P>Studies that used a restrictive threshold of 7 g/dL enrolled approximately half of the trial participants, and the other half used 8 g/dL as the restrictive threshold for transfusion. Most participants in the 7 g/dL restrictive transfusion threshold trials were based in critical care settings. The specialties were more varied in trials that tested an 8 g/dL restrictive transfusion threshold and included orthopaedic and cardiac surgery, gastrointestinal bleeding, and acute myocardial infarction. However, there was no apparent difference in the risk of death at 30 days between the two strata.</P>
<P>We compared 30-day mortality in trials where the difference between the liberal and restrictive transfusion thresholds was at least 2 g/dL with those trials where the difference was less than 2 g/dL. Again, there was no evidence of dose-effect of RBC transfusion by different trigger levels of haemoglobin concentration on clinical outcomes.</P>
<P>In this review, we compared the risk of infection in three ways but did not find evidence of a reduced risk of infection associated with restrictive transfusion. We combined pneumonia with wound infection (because they were the most common infections) and also examined sepsis or bacteraemia, and pneumonia (alone); the comparative risks of infection between the two transfusion strategies were nearly identical for all of these analyses. These results varied significantly from our prior analyses that had reported an elevated risk of infection in the liberal transfusion group (<LINK REF="REF-Rohde-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rohde 2014</LINK>). The change may be due to the incorporation of information from a recently reported cardiac surgery trial that had a large number of infections distributed equally between the liberal and restrictive transfusion strategies (<LINK REF="STD-Murphy-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 2015</LINK>). Future trials may contribute to the power needed to examine subgroups.</P>
<P>Four trials assessed functional recovery, which used different measures, so meta-analysis was not appropriate.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-10-10 00:08:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laura E  Prescott">
<P>With the expanding number of trials, the completeness of the evidence is increasing, and clinical trials have now evaluated many of the most common clinical specialities in which RBCs are transfused. Thus, the findings from this review are widely applicable to most clinical subgroups. However, we lack knowledge about the safety of different transfusion thresholds in groups of patients who frequently receive transfusion, but trials have not included. These understudied groups include those people with acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction, neurological injury/traumatic brain injury, acute neurological disorders, stroke, thrombocytopenia, cancer, haematological malignancies, and bone marrow failure.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-10-10 12:29:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Overall, the quality of the evidence across the trials is good and shows improvement over time. The number of trials and participants enrolled has increased substantially, and the precision of the effect of transfusion has improved since the 2012 update of this review. We found relatively little heterogeneity for each clinical outcome across all analyses. However, we observed a significant amount of heterogeneity in the analyses evaluating the proportion of participants transfused, quantity of RBCs transfused, and differences in haemoglobin/haematocrit concentrations. It is conventional practice not to pool studies when there is such a large amount of heterogeneity; however, we chose to present the pooled results for these transfusion outcomes for several reasons. Firstly, the impact of restrictive transfusion on the proportion of participants transfused only varied by the magnitude of the reduction in transfusion, not the direction. In all of the trials, participants in the restrictive transfusion group received fewer transfusions, although the amount varied because the transfusion protocols were different and the clinical specialties required different frequencies of transfusion. Secondly, we expected the heterogeneity because of the variety of specialities for the clinical trials, including age; degree of comorbidities; and importantly, the policies for standard transfusion practice, which in turn reflect speciality-specific guidelines and recommendations. At one extreme, nearly all participants, if not all, with leukaemia and cancer were transfused (<LINK REF="STD-DeZern-2016" TYPE="STUDY">DeZern 2016</LINK>). Transfusion risk in participants in critical care, <LINK REF="STD-H_x00e9_bert-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Hébert 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-H_x00e9_bert-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hébert 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lacroix-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lacroix 2007</LINK>, or with acute blood loss, <LINK REF="STD-Villanueva-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Villanueva 2013</LINK>, was about 50% at the time of the studies.</P>
<P>In summary, we have chosen to present the pooled results for outcomes of transfusion because we are evaluating the effect of restrictive transfusion practice, and all study estimates for changes in transfusion are consistently in the same direction, and the substantial heterogeneity reflects the diversity in the strength of the estimates, rather than the efficacy of the policy. The reasons for the diversity in the strength of the trial estimates lies in the known and expected clinical specialities and the different practice guidelines used by different specialties. The subgroup explorations for transfusion outcomes reported earlier demonstrated these differences. The recognised differences in transfusion risk and amount by clinical specialities are a further justification for the more detailed analysis of all outcomes by clinical subgroups in this review, which we prespecified.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-10-11 17:14:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We performed extensive searches in an attempt to identify all eligible trials irrespective of publication status. Inspection of the funnel plots did not identify a major risk of publication bias (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>).</P>
<P>'Risk of bias' evaluations revealed varying methodological issues between trials. We applied Cochrane methodology for defining high or low risk of bias to all trials, but acknowledged a number of challenges, including how to assign a single level of bias for multiple outcomes, for example, incomplete data or blinding (masking). Blinding the use of transfusion at the bedside is difficult to achieve unless study personnel are assigned to each participant, which would be an expensive procedure. The importance of blinding will differ according to the choice of primary trial outcome. For example, mortality is a hard endpoint and less open to bias than other functional outcomes.</P>
<P>Outcome assessment by observers who are blind to the treatment group is probably the most rigorous practical approach. Fourteen of the trials reviewed here reported this approach. Maintaining the integrity of the randomisation process becomes important if the trial is not to over-estimate the benefit of the intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). Some studies in this review did not report the methods used to conceal the allocation sequence from the treating clinicians. Ten trials used centralised allocation, and eight others used randomisation codes in sealed envelopes.</P>
<P>It is important to acknowledge limitations that apply to the findings of this review. The randomized trials may not have adequately evaluated some clinical outcomes specifically relevant to the use of RBC transfusions. Different grades of severity of cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure or stroke, or risk of overall infection, will occur in participants and may present in ways that are not always clinically overt and so are more subjective in interpretation. This is important because RBC transfusions may have both harmful and beneficial effects on the risk of these outcomes, for example, balancing prothrombotic tendencies against protective mechanisms to limit restrictions in myocardial oxygen delivery. Future studies need to establish robust definitions of all outcomes. The identified trials only evaluated the effect of transfusion in participants in hospital and not in outpatients in whom function and fatigue may be more important endpoints. Despite the large number of participants included in these trials, there remains inadequate power for many outcomes. Finally, a core rationale for RBC transfusion is to improve tissue and cellular oxygenation, but technologies for monitoring this directly are not available routinely; therefore, haemoglobin concentration is applied as a surrogate marker of need for transfusion, but it may not be a reliable biomarker.</P>

<P>The results of this review are consistent with other recent published systematic reviews. <LINK REF="REF-Holst-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holst 2015</LINK> recently identified 31 trials, with a total of 9813 randomized participants. We included 31 trials in our review, including a large, recently published trial in cardiac surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Murphy-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 2015</LINK>), and a small pilot study in participants with haematological malignancies (<LINK REF="STD-DeZern-2016" TYPE="STUDY">DeZern 2016</LINK>), but unlike Holst, we excluded studies in neonates (in whom the physiological responses to anaemia are considered very different from children and adults). The authors of <LINK REF="REF-Holst-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holst 2015</LINK> reported that restrictive transfusion strategies were associated with a reduction in the number of RBC units transfused and number of participants being transfused, with no effect on outcomes, including mortality, overall morbidity, and myocardial infarction. Restrictive compared with liberal transfusion strategies were not associated with risk of death (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.01; 5707 participants), overall morbidity (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.12; 4517 participants), or fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction (RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.66 to 2.49; 4730 participants). The inclusion of trials with unclear or high risk of bias did not affect results.</P>
<P>A number of systematic reviews have specifically examined participant subgroups. A review by Fominskiy aimed to assess the effect of liberal and restrictive RBC transfusion strategies on mortality in perioperative and critically ill adult participants through a meta-analysis of relevant trials (<LINK REF="REF-Fominskiy-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fominskiy 2015</LINK>). Seventeen studies enrolled 7552 participants in perioperative settings, while 10 trials enrolled 3469 participants in critically ill settings. Participants in the perioperative period in the liberal transfusion strategy group had lower all-cause mortality when compared with those allocated to the restrictive transfusion strategy group (odds ratio (OR) 0.81, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.00; P = 0.05; I² = 25%; number needed to treat for additional beneficial outcome = 97). There was no difference in mortality among critically ill participants receiving a liberal transfusion strategy when compared with the restrictive transfusion strategy (OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.23; P = 0.07; I² = 34%). The interpretation of systematic reviews that report only subgroups of the wider trial literature should be approached with some caution, to ensure that the patterns of findings are not inappropriately selective.</P>
<P>The results of these trials need to be viewed against large observational studies that compared clinical outcomes at varying haemoglobin levels in transfused and non-transfused participants, finding conflicting results. In a study of 2202 participants undergoing coronary bypass surgery, the liberal transfusion group had a higher incidence of myocardial infarction than the conservative transfusion group (<LINK REF="REF-Spiess-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spiess 1998</LINK>). In a study of 8787 hip fracture participants, there was no difference in short- or long-term mortality between participants transfused and not transfused (<LINK REF="STD-Carson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 1998</LINK>). In a study of 4470 intensive care unit participants, mortality was reduced in those receiving transfusion of up to six units of blood (<LINK REF="REF-H_x00e9_bert-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hébert 1997</LINK>). A retrospective study of 78,974 Medicare beneficiaries found that blood transfusion was associated with a lower short-term mortality rate among elderly patients with acute myocardial infarction if the haematocrit on admission was 30% or lower, and that blood transfusion may be effective with a haematocrit level as high as 33% on admission (<LINK REF="REF-Wu-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2001</LINK>). A study of 310,311 participants 65 years of age or older who underwent major non-cardiac surgery found a 1.6% increase in 30-day postoperative mortality for each 1% decrease in preoperative haematocrit (<LINK REF="REF-Wu-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2007</LINK>). Another study of 239,286 participants 65 years of age or older who underwent major non-cardiac surgery found intraoperative blood transfusion was associated with a reduction in mortality in those with preoperative haematocrit levels of less than 24%, or in those with blood loss exceeding 500 mL (<LINK REF="REF-Wu-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2010</LINK>). The main limitation of these observational studies is that there may be residual confounding by indication, despite the extensive statistical adjustment of the results. It is possible that differences in participant characteristics between those that were transfused and non-transfused may not have been identified or adequately adjusted for. This point is emphasised by the fact that a randomized controlled trial and an observational study (<LINK REF="STD-H_x00e9_bert-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hébert 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-H_x00e9_bert-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hébert 1997</LINK> respectively) in intensive care participants, performed by the same group of investigators, came to opposite conclusions. Even more convincing is how different - and potentially biased - the results of the meta-analyses of observational data are; <LINK REF="REF-Chatterjee-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chatterjee 2013</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Marik-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marik 2008</LINK> found a large increase in risk of death associated with transfusion. In contrast, the results of the meta-analysis of clinical trials performed in this review showed no increased risk of death with liberal transfusion thresholds compared with restrictive transfusion thresholds. Despite recent assertions to the contrary (<LINK REF="REF-Benson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Concato-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Concato 2000</LINK>), we believe that adequately powered, rigorously performed, randomized clinical trials are the only way of overcoming these limitations.</P>
<P>The transfusion policies reviewed here represent fairly small modifications to routine clinical practice. They are consistent with the recommendations of published clinical practice guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-AAGBI-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAGBI 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ASA-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">ASA 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-BCTMAG-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">BCTMAG 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Carson-2012a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carson 2012a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Napolitano-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Napolitano 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NBUGI-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">NBUGI 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Retter-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Retter 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-STSBCGTF-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">STSBCGTF 2011</LINK>). The transfusion triggers (in terms of haemoglobin levels) were most often in the range of 7 g/dL to 10 g/dL. In fact, the 'restrictive' transfusion triggers in some trials were equivalent to the 'liberal' triggers used in other trials. Nevertheless, the trials documented significant reductions in the risk of RBC transfusion and worthwhile blood conservation. These effects are similar to what has been documented in meta-analyses of trials of blood-sparing techniques, such as cell salvage, <LINK REF="REF-Carless-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carless 2010a</LINK>, and antifibrinolytic drugs, <LINK REF="REF-Henry-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henry 2011</LINK>. Adoption of a conservative transfusion threshold appears to be as effective as these technologies in avoiding the need for transfusion and is likely to cost less.</P>
<P>Some guidelines have recommended RBC transfusion for symptoms or haemodynamic instability, rather than for a specific trigger haemoglobin level (<LINK REF="REF-AAGBI-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAGBI 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ASA-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">ASA 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Napolitano-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Napolitano 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NBUGI-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">NBUGI 2001</LINK>). A pilot study involving 84 participants tested this approach to transfusion (<LINK REF="STD-Carson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 1998</LINK>), as well as a trial involving 2016 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Carson-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2011</LINK>), and a 110-participant trial in acute myocardial infarction (<LINK REF="STD-Carson-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2013</LINK>), in which participants could be transfused if they exhibited symptoms or had a haemoglobin concentration less than 8 g/dL. These studies found no difference in functional recovery, mortality, or morbidity in participants in the restrictive (symptomatic) transfusion group in the orthopaedic surgery trials (<LINK REF="STD-Carson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carson-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2011</LINK>); though in the trial involving participants with acute myocardial infarction (<LINK REF="STD-Carson-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2013</LINK>), there was a tendency toward worse outcomes in the restrictive transfusion group.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-10-11 15:24:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Analysis of the published evidence shows that transfusing at a restrictive strategy of 7 g/dL to 8 g/dL, compared with a liberal haemoglobin threshold of 9 g/dL to 10 g/dL, across a broad range of hospitalised patients does not adversely affect clinical outcomes, including 30-day mortality, cardiac morbidity, and infection. Evidence of a possible exception came from two small trials in participants with acute myocardial infarction, which suggested the possibility of increased 30-day mortality with a restrictive transfusion threshold of 8 g/dL. Given there is no evidence of additional benefit of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion at higher haemoglobin concentration thresholds (9 g/dL to 10 g/dL), and that blood for transfusion is a costly and a scarce biological resource with finite risks, a restrictive transfusion trigger policy (7 g/dL to 8 g/dL) could be widely adopted. A restrictive transfusion policy is not associated with increased adverse events and reduces the risk of exposure to RBC transfusion and the total number of units transfused. There is insufficient evidence to evaluate the effect of the different strategies on functional recovery.</P>
<P>There was mixed evidence for adverse events associated with restrictive transfusion policies in two subsets of participants only. Firstly, as mentioned above, for two small trials that recruited participants with acute myocardial infarction, there was a raised risk for 30-day mortality with restrictive transfusion, although in participants undergoing cardiac surgery, the risk of 30-day mortality was not elevated. Secondly, in participants with acute blood loss from gastrointestinal bleeding, there may be a lower risk of 30-day mortality with restrictive transfusion, but this requires confirmation. There were very limited data for participants with acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction, neurological injury/traumatic brain injury, acute neurological disorders, stroke, thrombocytopenia, cancer, haematological malignancies, and bone marrow failure. Many people in the latter categories will be transfusion-dependent for prolonged periods of time and if concomitant bone marrow failure occurs will have a very different pathophysiology to other patient groups.</P>
<P>The trial interventions were split equally on the haemoglobin concentration used to define the restrictive transfusion group. About half of the trials used a 7 g/dL threshold, and the other half used a restrictive transfusion threshold of 8 g/dL to 9 g/dL. Therefore, it is unclear whether a 7 g/dL threshold could be used in most adult patients or only in critical care patients where most of those trials were conducted. Our clinical impression is that most adult patients would probably tolerate the lower 7 g/dL threshold, but specific trial data do not exist for some patient populations, and it is possible that an 8 g/dL threshold might improve function or reduce cardiovascular events. Thus, it is reasonable for clinicians to use an 8 g/dL threshold in settings where trial data for a 7 g/dL threshold are not available, such as orthopaedic surgery and in patients with cardiovascular disease.</P>
<P>In countries where there are concerns about the microbiological screening and safety of donated blood, the existing data constitute a stronger basis for avoiding liberal RBC transfusion in many clinical settings. The benefits of minimising allogeneic RBC transfusion are likely to be greatest where there is doubt about the safety of the blood supply.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-10-11 17:14:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further randomized trials should not be aimed at addressing the safety of RBC transfusion policies within the range of haemoglobin thresholds tested in the trials identified in this review or in unselected groups of patients across broad clinical settings. Rather, additional trials should be targeted to address specific research questions, where the strength of evidence-based recommendations has significant uncertainty, as highlighted in this review. Subsets of patients where there is currently no adequately powered randomized controlled trial data to inform optimal RBC transfusion treatment include those with acute cardiovascular disease, neurological disorders including (traumatic) brain injury, and haematological and other malignancies. Outcomes of importance in trials would be mortality, but also functional and bleeding endpoints, specifically in transfusion-dependent participants with cancer and haemological malignancies. We believe that in these clinical groups, the clinical goals and pathophysiology preclude generalisation from the completed studies included in this review. Trials are also needed to evaluate lower haemoglobin concentrations such as 6.0 g/dL, especially in countries with suboptimal blood safety and inadequate blood supply. Further research is needed to identify methods to measure oxygen delivery to vital organs directly. All trials should be large enough to measure the impact of lower thresholds on clinical outcomes and should apply consistent definitions for all clinical outcomes, such as myocardial infarction and ischaemic heart disease.</P>

<P>The following differences applied in this (2016) version of the review.</P>
<UL>
<LI>The primary outcome has changed in this version of the review from 'the proportion of patients 'at risk' who were transfused with red blood cells', to '30-day mortality'. Previously, 30-day mortality was a secondary outcome. Now the proportion of participants 'at risk' who were transfused with red blood cells is a secondary outcome. The primary outcome was changed because mortality is a more clinically relevant outcome and the number of participants enrolled in trials provided sufficient power to examine this outcome. Sample size calculations assuming baseline 30-day mortality of 9% for restrictive transfusion, 90% power, alpha level of 0.05, indicate that to detect a 15%, 20%, or 25% relative decrease in mortality with the use of liberal transfusion, a study needs to enrol 17,500, or 9600, or 6000 participants, respectively.</LI>
<LI>We added one new exclusion criterion: we excluded trials that were not designed to include any clinical outcomes relevant to this review.</LI>
<LI>We added a new sensitivity analysis: registered studies versus unregistered studies.</LI>
<LI>We separated blinding of participants and personnel from blinding of outcome assessment.</LI>
