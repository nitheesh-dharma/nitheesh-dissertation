<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-02-13 09:46:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We reviewed the evidence that mechanically pushing air into the lungs through a mask helps clear mucus, improves breathing overnight, reduces respiratory failure and improves exercise tolerance.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>As cystic fibrosis worsens, breathing becomes difficult, indicating the start of respiratory failure (too much carbon dioxide and not enough oxygen in the blood). As respiratory failure progresses, people may become breathless and have problems clearing mucus. Respiratory failure eventually results in death.</P>
<P>Non-invasive ventilation administers room air or oxygen through a mask and has been used to help people with more severe cystic fibrosis to clear their airways of mucus and improve breathing during sleep; it may also help with exercise. It is not certain exactly how this works, but it might reduce fatigue in the respiratory muscles, stop the airways from closing during prolonged exhalation and reduce the effort needed to maintain ventilation and oxygen levels. Treatment has been recommended when breathing muscles are weak, when a person has difficulty clearing mucus using other airway clearance techniques or when there are high levels of carbon dioxide in the blood during sleep or during exercise.</P>
<P>This is an update of a previously published review.</P>
<P>
<B>Search date</B>
</P>
<P>Evidence is current to 08 August 2016.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>This review includes 10 trials (191 people with cystic fibrosis) - seven single-treatment sessions and a two-week trial, a six-week trial and a three-month trial. Six single-treatment trials, the two-week trial and the three-month trial compared non-invasive ventilation with other airway clearance techniques. Two single-treatment trials and the six-week trial looked at non-invasive ventilation for overnight breathing support compared to oxygen or normal room air. One single-treatment trial compared non-invasive ventilation with no additional treatment during an exercise test.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Single-treatment trials of non-invasive ventilation for airway clearance showed that this may be easier with non-invasive ventilation and people with cystic fibrosis may prefer it to other methods. We could not find evidence that non-invasive ventilation increased the amount of mucus coughed up, but it did improve some measures of lung function, at least in the short term. The two-week trial did not demonstrate clear benefits between groups. The original three-month trial report stated an improvement in lung clearance index. One person in one of these trials reported pain on respiratory muscle testing.</P>
<P>The three trials comparing overnight support from non-invasive ventilation measured lung function, quality of life and carbon dioxide levels; they showed it is effective, safe and acceptable. We found no clear differences between non-invasive ventilation and oxygen or room air, except for exercise performance which improved with non-invasive ventilation compared to room air after six weeks. Two trials reported side effects. In the first trial, one person found the mask uncomfortable. In the second trial, one person in the room air group had collapsed lungs and two people could not tolerate increased pressure when breathing in.</P>
<P>The trial comparing the effects of non-invasive ventilation to no treatment on exercise capacity found no clear differences between groups.</P>
<P>Non-invasive ventilation may help alongside other airway clearance techniques, particularly when people with cystic fibrosis have difficulty coughing up mucus and during sleep. Long-term trials are needed with enough people to show the clinical effects of non-invasive ventilation on airway clearance, during sleep and exercise training in severe disease.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The benefits of non-invasive ventilation have largely been demonstrated in single-treatment sessions with only small numbers of people. There is limited evidence of some longer-term improvement in lung function in one trial. Our results from the trials of overnight breathing support differed from those in the original analyses, this is likely due to the small numbers of participants and some statistical issues. We judged only the six-week trial to be free from any bias. In the remaining trials, we thought there were low or unclear chances of the results being affected because data were either reported only partially or not at all. We were not sure if the way in which participants were put into the different treatment groups would affect the results of the trials.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-12-06 14:30:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Non-invasive ventilation may be a means to temporarily reverse or slow the progression of respiratory failure in cystic fibrosis by providing ventilatory support and avoiding tracheal intubation. Using non-invasive ventilation, in the appropriate situation or individuals, can improve lung mechanics through increasing airflow and gas exchange and decreasing the work of breathing. Non-invasive ventilation thus acts as an external respiratory muscle. This is an update of a previously published review.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-01-23 15:04:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Three reviewers independently assessed trials for inclusion criteria and methodological quality, and extracted data. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-02-20 09:03:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Ten trials met the inclusion criteria with a total of 191 participants. Seven trials evaluated single treatment sessions, one evaluated a two-week intervention, one evaluated a six-week intervention and one a three-month intervention. It is only possible to blind trials of airway clearance and overnight ventilatory support to the outcome assessors. In most of the trials we judged there was an unclear risk of bias with regards to blinding due to inadequate descriptions. The six-week trial was the only one judged to have a low risk of bias for all other domains. One single intervention trial had a low risk of bias for the randomisation procedure with the remaining trials judged to have an unclear risk of bias. Most trials had a low risk of bias with regard to incomplete outcome data and selective reporting.</P>
<P>Six trials (151 participants) evaluated non-invasive ventilation for airway clearance compared with an alternative chest physiotherapy method such as the active cycle of breathing techniques or positive expiratory pressure. Three trials used nasal masks, one used a nasal mask or mouthpiece and one trial used a face mask and in one trial it is unclear. Three of the trials reported on one of the review's primary outcome measures (quality of life). Results for the reviews secondary outcomes showed that airway clearance may be easier with non-invasive ventilation and people with cystic fibrosis may prefer it. We were unable to find any evidence that non-invasive ventilation increases sputum expectoration, but it did improve some lung function parameters.</P>
<P>Three trials (27 participants) evaluated non-invasive ventilation for overnight ventilatory support compared to oxygen or room air using nasal masks (two trials) and nasal masks or full face masks (one trial). Trials reported on two of the review's primary outcomes (quality of life and symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing). Results for the reviews secondary outcome measures showed that they measured lung function, gas exchange, adherence to treatment and preference, and nocturnal transcutaneous carbon dioxide<I>.</I> Due to the small numbers of participants and statistical issues, there were discrepancies in the results between the RevMan and the original trial analyses. No clear differences were found between non-invasive ventilation compared with oxygen or room air except for exercise performance, which significantly improved with non-invasive ventilation compared to room air over six weeks.</P>
<P>One trial (13 participants) evaluated non-invasive ventilation on exercise capacity (interface used was unclear) and did not reported on any of the review's primary outcomes. The trial found no clear differences between non-invasive ventilation compared to no non-invasive ventilation for any of our outcomes.</P>
<P>Three trials reported on adverse effects. One trial, evaluating non-invasive ventilation for airway clearance, reported that a participant withdrew at the start of the trial due to pain on respiratory muscle testing. One trial evaluating non-invasive ventilation for overnight support reported that one participant could not tolerate an increase in inspiratory positive airway pressure. A second trial evaluating non-invasive ventilation in this setting reported that one participant did not tolerate the non-invasive ventilation mask, one participant developed a pneumothorax when breathing room air and two participants experienced aerophagia which resolved when inspiratory positive airway pressure was decreased.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-01-23 14:45:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Non-invasive ventilation may be a useful adjunct to other airway clearance techniques, particularly in people with cystic fibrosis who have difficulty expectorating sputum. Non-invasive ventilation, used in addition to oxygen, may improve gas exchange during sleep to a greater extent than oxygen therapy alone in moderate to severe disease. The effect of NIV on exercise is unclear. These benefits of non-invasive ventilation have largely been demonstrated in single treatment sessions with small numbers of participants. The impact of this therapy on pulmonary exacerbations and disease progression remain unclear. There is a need for long-term randomised controlled trials which are adequately powered to determine the clinical effects of non-invasive ventilation in cystic fibrosis airway clearance and exercise.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-02-16 13:19:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-02-16 13:19:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common life-limiting autosomal recessively genetically inherited disease in Caucasian populations, with a carrier rate of 1 in 25 and an incidence of 1 in 2,500 live births (<LINK REF="REF-UK-CF-Trust-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">UK CF Trust 2011</LINK>). Although this is a multisystem disease, the primary cause of death in CF is respiratory failure. Respiratory failure can be defined as the inability of the respiratory pump and lungs to maintain adequate gas exchange and is characterised by abnormalities of arterial blood gas tensions (<LINK REF="REF-Davidson-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davidson 2016</LINK>).</P>
<P>In CF, severe airway obstruction and inflammatory bronchiectatic processes results in sputum retention, an increase in breathlessness, hyperinflation, ventilation perfusion mismatch, a decrease in respiratory muscle strength, and an inability to maintain arterial oxygenation within normal limits. When this occurs, reflex hypoxic vasoconstriction results in elevation of the blood pressure within the pulmonary circulation, right ventricular strain and, eventually, cor pulmonale.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-03-29 14:10:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>With non-invasive mask ventilation, positive pressure ventilatory assistance can be delivered in the form of inspiratory pressure support (pressure pre-set) systems which deliver a variable volume according to a pre-set inspiratory pressure. Alternatively, a set tidal volume (volume pre-set) system may be used which delivers a fixed tidal volume irrespective of the airway pressure required to generate this volume. The earliest trials of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) employed volume pre-set equipment. However, later trials have used pressure pre-set devices, primarily due to simplicity and the comfort of the individual. The NIV machines entrain room air and additional oxygen may be entrained into the ventilatory tubing, or directly into the mask.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-01-23 15:02:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Non-invasive ventilation may be beneficial in acute respiratory failure in CF and could have a role to play in the management of chronic respiratory failure by acting as a bridge to transplantation as it may reverse or stabilise hypercapnia and hypoxaemia by improving alveolar ventilation, reducing respiratory muscle fatigue, or both (<LINK REF="REF-Hodson-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodson 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Piper-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Piper 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yankaskas-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yankaskas 1999</LINK>). The exact mechanisms by which NIV induces these changes may be different in acute and chronic disease and consequently different outcome measures may be necessary to reflect adequately the efficacy of NIV in acute and chronic respiratory failure in CF.</P>
<P>Clinically, NIV has been used as an adjunct to airway clearance techniques in people with CF and moderate to severe disease. The exact mechanisms by which NIV may assist airway clearance are unclear, but it is postulated that decreased respiratory muscle fatigue and prevention of airway closure during prolonged expirations may ultimately lead to an increase in effective alveolar ventilation, better compliance with airway clearance and increased sputum clearance (<LINK REF="STD-Holland-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Holland 2003</LINK>). Furthermore, recent guidelines state that NIV should be used for airway clearance in people with CF if there is respiratory muscle weakness or fatigue; where desaturation is present during airway clearance techniques; or when an individual has difficulty clearing secretions with other airway clearance techniques (<LINK REF="REF-Bott-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bott 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>In people with CF, NIV has also been used during sleep when decreases in respiratory neuromuscular output exaggerate these changes and lead to nocturnal hypoventilation before daytime respiratory failure becomes evident (<LINK REF="REF-Ballard-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballard 1996</LINK>). While the addition of nocturnal oxygen improves hypoxaemia and may have favourable effects on cor pulmonale, it has not been shown to affect the progression of disease in CF (<LINK REF="REF-Zinman-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zinman 1989</LINK>). There is also some evidence that the use of oxygen therapy may be at the expense of worsening hypercapnia (<LINK REF="STD-Gozal-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gozal 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Milross-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Milross 2001</LINK>). The use of NIV has been proposed as a means to temporarily reverse this process by assisting nocturnal ventilation, thereby slowing the progression of respiratory failure. The aim of NIV is to reduce hypoventilation and improve gas exchange by increasing minute ventilation and reducing the work of breathing without the associated complication of endotracheal intubation.</P>
<P>Finally, NIV has also been used during exercise in people with CF. There is a reasoned argument for using NIV during exercise to decrease dyspnoea and increase oxygenation resulting in an improvement in exercise tolerance; however there is no objective evidence to support this at present (<LINK REF="REF-Bott-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bott 2009</LINK>).</P>

<P>In a <I>post hoc</I> change short-term trials were defined as those with a duration less than three months.

<P>In order to assess the risk of bias in the included trials (yes, no or unclear), the authors (as identified above) then assessed the methodological quality of each included trial based on a method described by Jüni (<LINK REF="REF-J_x00fc_ni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jüni 2001</LINK>). In particular, the authors examined details of the method of randomisation used, the method used to conceal allocation, whether the trial was blinded, whether assessors were independent or involved in the delivery of the interventions and if the number of participants lost to follow up or subsequently excluded from the trial were recorded. The authors assessed whether the primary investigators had made any statement regarding intention-to-treat analyses.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2016-07-19 13:26:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>The authors combined data from all trials using the RevMan software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). For continuous variables they calculated the mean difference (MD) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI). For count data from cross-over trials, they used Poisson regression to analyse the data and they have presented the results as a relative rate. The authors carried out these analyses in Stata (<LINK REF="REF-Stata-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stata 2001</LINK>) and present the results in RevMan (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>There were no binary data in any of the trials included in this review.

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2017-02-13 09:53:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Eight of the 10 trials included in this review were cross-over in design. When conducting a meta-analysis combining results from cross-over trials the authors would have liked to have used the methods recommended by Elbourne (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>) and also by Curtin (<LINK REF="REF-Curtin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curtin 2002</LINK>). However, due to restrictions on the data that were available, the authors treated the cross-over trials as if they were parallel trials, except for the Milross trial where further individual participant data was provided by the trial authors (<LINK REF="STD-Milross-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Milross 2001</LINK>). Elbourne states that this approach will produce conservative results, as it does not take into account within-patient correlation (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). Also each participant will appear in both the treatment and control group, so the two groups will not be independent. This may explain discrepancies found between original trial analyses and data presented in the review (<LINK TAG="ANALYSES_AND_DATA" TYPE="SECTION">Data and analyses</LINK>). Where the authors have found discrepancies, both data from the original analyses and the statistical analysis for the review are detailed in the results. Another possible reason for discrepancies is that the methods used to analyse data were not always identical between the original trial report and the review. The authors note where this is the case in the text of the <LINK TAG="INTERVENTION_EFFECTS" TYPE="SECTION">Effects of interventions</LINK> section.</P>
<P>Although three trials evaluated NIV as a method of overnight ventilation involving overnight sleep trials in groups of participants which were similar in terms of age, lung function, body mass index and resting arterial blood gases, the authors did not pool the results as the control group interventions were sufficiently different in the three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Gozal-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gozal 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Milross-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Milross 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Young-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Young 2008</LINK>) and also one of these was six weeks in duration as compared to a single intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Young-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Young 2008</LINK>).</P>

<P>When assessing the risk of bias of the included trials from blinding, it should be noted that it is difficult to blind physiotherapy trials. In fact, for this intervention it would not have been possible to blind either the participants or the clinicians administering treatment to the intervention. It would only have been possible to blind the outcome assessors.</P>
<P>We judged two trials to have a low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Holland-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Holland 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez-Hortal-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez Hortal 2016</LINK>). The Holland trial employed an independent data collector who was blinded to the treatment order to obtain all measurements (<LINK REF="STD-Holland-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Holland 2003</LINK>). There is evidence of blinding in the Rodriguez Hortal trial as pulmonary laboratory technicians (who measured the lung function tests) were blinded to physiotherapy treatment; furthermore, research nurses, who took vital signs, were blinded to treatment. A physiotherapist supervised and conducted all monthly treatment sessions and weekly phone calls; it is unclear if the 6MWT was assessed by the research physiotherapist, however we still judge this trial to have a low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez-Hortal-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez Hortal 2016</LINK>).</P>
<P>We judged there to be an unclear risk of bias in five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Fauroux-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Fauroux 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gozal-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gozal 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kofler-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kofler 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Placidi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Placidi 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Young-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Young 2008</LINK>). Fauroux stated that participants' subjective impressions were evaluated by individuals who were not involved in the trial and were unaware of the treatment regimen; but it was not reported who was responsible for collecting and weighing secretions or performing lung function testing, therefore the trial is still judged to have an unclear risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Fauroux-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Fauroux 1999</LINK>). Gozal stated that while participants were aware of the intervention being administered; all were reportedly unaware of the purpose of the trial with participants and sleep technicians blinded to the results until completion of the third night (<LINK REF="STD-Gozal-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gozal 1997</LINK>). Data collection was not described at all by one trial as it was only reported as an abstract (<LINK REF="STD-Kofler-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kofler 1998</LINK>). One trial reported that physiotherapists collected sputum and the technician was blinded to physiotherapy treatment, but it is not reported who was responsible for weighing sputum or collating cough information induced by the treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Placidi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Placidi 2006</LINK>). There is evidence of blinding in the Young trial only for participants receiving either oxygen or room air, so we judge the risk of bias for this to be unclear (<LINK REF="STD-Young-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Young 2008</LINK>).</P>

Sleep latency was reported in two single-night trials (n = 19) (<LINK REF="STD-Gozal-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gozal 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Milross-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Milross 2001</LINK>) and one six-week trial (n = 8) (<LINK REF="STD-Young-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Young 2008</LINK>). After one night, there was no statistical difference in sleep latency with NIV compared to supplemental oxygen, MD 2.93 min (95% CI -0.32 to 6.19); this was also true after six weeks, MD -5.00 min (95% CI -19.17 to 9.17) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.15" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.15</LINK>).</P>
<P>When comparing NIV to room air, the two single-night trials showed no statistical difference in sleep latency between the groups, MD -2.63 min (95% CI -7.37 to 2.11); again, this was also not significant at six weeks, MD -3.00 min (95% CI -19.88 to 13.88) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.17" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.17</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">d. Nocturnal oxygen levels</HEADING>
<P>The Gozal and Young trials (n = 14) reported mean SpO&#8322; (<LINK REF="STD-Gozal-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gozal 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Young-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Young 2008</LINK>). Our analysis of the Gozal data showed no statistically significant difference in mean SpO&#8322; between NIV and supplemental oxygen during either REM sleep, MD -2.00% (95% CI -4.88 to 0.88) or NREM sleep, MD -1.00% (95% CI -2.79 to 0.79) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.16" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.16</LINK>); although the original trial reported SpO&#8322; to be significantly lower during REM and NREM sleep on the NIV night (<LINK REF="STD-Gozal-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gozal 1997</LINK>). When Young (n = 8) compared NIV to oxygen for six weeks, the mean SpO&#8322; for TST was not statistically significant between groups, MD -1.00 % (95% CI -3.62 to 1.62) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.16" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.16</LINK>). Young also reported nocturnal hypoxia, defined as SpO&#8322; below 90% (<LINK REF="STD-Young-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Young 2008</LINK>) and showed no significant difference between NIV and oxygen for TST with SpO&#8322; below 90%, MD 13.00 % (95% CI -12.95 to 38.95) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.16" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.16</LINK>). Milross (n = 13) reported the proportion of time spent with SpO&#8322; over 90% during TST, REM and NREM (<LINK REF="STD-Milross-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Milross 2001</LINK>). Analysing these data using GIV, there were no statistically significant differences between NIV and supplemental oxygen either during TST, MD -2.54 min (95% CI -9.59 to 4.50); in REM sleep, MD 0.65 min (95% CI -8.94 to 10.25); or in NREM sleep, MD -0.84 min (95% CI -7.95 to 6.26) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.17" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.17</LINK>).</P>
<P>Comparing NIV versus room air, our analysis of data from the Gozal trial showed mean SpO&#8322; to be significantly greater in the NIV group during both REM sleep, MD 9.00% (95% CI 2.91 to 15.09) and NREM sleep, MD 5.00% (95% CI 0.69 to 9.31) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.18" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.18</LINK>); although this difference was not significant in the primary trial analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Gozal-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gozal 1997</LINK>). In contrast to this, the Young trial showed no significant difference in mean SpO&#8322; for TST between NIV and room air at six weeks, MD 3.00 (95% CI -1.04 to 7.04) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.18" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.18</LINK>). When analysing data from the Milross trial for the comparison of NIV to room air, we found that SpO&#8322; was greater than 90% for significantly more time in the NIV group during TST, MD 27.58 min (95% CI 7.83 to 47.33); during REM sleep, MD 34.53 min (95% CI 15.00 to 54.06); and during NREM sleep, MD 26.21 min (95% CI 6.24 to 46.18) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.19" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.19</LINK>). The original trial reported that SpO&#8322; was over 90% for significantly less time during TST and REM sleep on the room air night versus the oxygen or NIV night and that there was no significant difference in percentage of time spent with SpO&#8322; over 90% in NREM during the NIV night or the oxygen night and the room air night (<LINK REF="STD-Milross-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Milross 2001</LINK>).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-01-24 12:07:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>A total of 10 trials are included in the review. Six trials focused on the role of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) as a method of airway clearance (<LINK REF="STD-Dwyer-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Dwyer 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fauroux-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Fauroux 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holland-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Holland 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kofler-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kofler 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Placidi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Placidi 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez-Hortal-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez Hortal 2016</LINK>); four of these were single sessions (<LINK REF="STD-Fauroux-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Fauroux 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holland-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Holland 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kofler-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kofler 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Placidi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Placidi 2006</LINK>), one took place during a two-week exacerbation period (<LINK REF="STD-Dwyer-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Dwyer 2015</LINK>) and one over a three-month period (<LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez-Hortal-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez Hortal 2016</LINK>). Three trials looked at the role of NIV in overnight ventilation; two were single-night trials (<LINK REF="STD-Gozal-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gozal 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Milross-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Milross 2001</LINK>) and one lasted six weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Young-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Young 2008</LINK>). The final trial focused on the role of NIV on exercise capacity for a single intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Lima-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Lima 2014</LINK>). The review authors recognise that short-term studies may not allow the participants in the studies sufficient time to familiarise themselves with NIV and this is an important consideration for future trials.</P>
<P>In a single physiotherapy session the use of NIV led to easier airway clearance in participants with stable moderate to severe disease and most participants preferred to use NIV for airway clearance treatment. We were unable to find any evidence that NIV increases sputum expectoration or improves lung function. There is some evidence that the introduction of NIV to airway clearance preserved muscle strength and improved expiratory muscle strength. No deleterious effects on small airway function were observed. In terms of airway clearance over a longer period of time, e.g. among people hospitalised for an acute exacerbation of cystic fibrosis (CF), the use of NIV as an adjunct to the airway clearance regimen offers no clear benefit compared to no NIV. A more recent trial has used the lung clearance index (LCI) to explore the effect of NIV on ventilation inhomogeneity and this may be a potentially useful outcome to explore the effect of airway clearance and also improve understanding of mechanisms of action.</P>
<P>In terms of overnight ventilatory support in a single nocturnal treatment session, NIV offers benefits over oxygen or room air. Nocturnal hypoventilation is an early marker of respiratory deterioration in advanced CF and can lead to the development of daytime hypercapnia. By attenuating the decrease in ventricular tachycardia and improving ventilation during sleep NIV decreases hypoventilation in people with moderate to severe lung disease. Nocturnal oxygen saturation (SpO&#8322;) may be increased by NIV and oxygen or oxygen alone, but the increase in SpO&#8322; with NIV and oxygen is likely to occur without a concomitant increase in transcutaneous carbon dioxide (TcCO&#8322;), as seen when people receive oxygen alone. The respiratory rate on the NIV night was significantly lower in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep than on the room air or oxygen nights. In the trial by Gozal, four out of six participants reported that they preferred oxygen therapy overnight to NIV and oxygen (<LINK REF="STD-Gozal-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gozal 1997</LINK>). Milross found only one participant in the group of 13 who was unable to tolerate sufficiently high pressures to improve nocturnal ventilation (<LINK REF="STD-Milross-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Milross 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>In terms of a longer period of overnight ventilation (six weeks), NIV further demonstrated an improvement in nocturnal hypercapnic levels as well as a meaningful clinically important difference in peak exercise capacity and exertional dyspnoea when compared to room air. Young identified the improvement of peak exercise capacity as important since it is a predictor of survival in adults and children with CF (<LINK REF="STD-Young-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Young 2008</LINK>). However, this six-week intervention did not lead to a change in sleep architecture, lung function or awake hypercapnic levels. With regard to preference, four participants preferred oxygen as a long-term therapy, three preferred NIV and none selected air as their preferred long-term therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Young-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Young 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>In terms of exercise capacity, one study reported that the distance walked increased significantly with NIV during a single session comparing NIV to no NIV while walking (<LINK REF="STD-Lima-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Lima 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Overall, the results from included studies demonstrate that NIV improves the physiological markers of early respiratory failure following a single nocturnal treatment session, with improvements in exercise tolerance, selected aspects of quality of life and nocturnal carbon dioxide levels when used over a longer period. Nocturnal respiratory support with NIV has important implications for the people with CF and advanced lung disease and may attenuate the early effects and progression of respiratory failure. Further investigations over longer time periods are warranted to determine if these changes will be sustained or have any influence on clinical outcomes. Which subgroups benefit most from NIV intervention also needs to be established.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-01-24 12:09:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>The included trials covered all ranges of disease severity and status and also all ages, so the results are likely applicable to the CF population in general. It is notable that there was limited use of important primary outcomes such as mortality, but this was likely due to the length of studies in this review. Longer-term studies are required to fully determine the effect on the review's primary outcomes. It is important to note that in the longest included trial, Young did not address the issue of NIV in combination with oxygen as opposed to NIV alone. The combination of NIV and oxygen is more commonly considered in clinical practice in people with CF and severe lung disease (<LINK REF="STD-Young-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Young 2008</LINK>).</P>

<P>None of the trials were double-blinded. However, this quality issue must be considered in the context of the difficulty of blinding NIV trials. It was clear in one trial that the outcome measurements were performed by an independent assessor, who was not involved in the delivery of the interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Holland-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Holland 2003</LINK>). In a further trial it was clear that the majority of outcomes were measured by an independent assessor (<LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez-Hortal-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez Hortal 2016</LINK>).</P>
<P>These quality issues affect the internal validity of the trials. The external validity of these trials is limited by the fact that six of the trials in the review only assess the efficacy of a single-treatment session of NIV and do not study the longer-term efficacy or safety of NIV.</P>

<P>We have found some limited evidence to support the use of NIV as a clinical treatment in people with CF. NIV may be a useful adjunct to other airway clearance techniques, particularly in people with CF who have difficulty expectorating sputum or where fatigue or respiratory muscle weakness is an issue. The trials in this review demonstrate that when used together with overnight oxygen, NIV improves gas exchange during sleep to a greater extent than oxygen therapy alone in people with moderate to severe CF. Use of NIV over a six-week period provided benefits over oxygen and room air for those people with CF who experience daytime hypercapnia in terms of exercise tolerance, dyspnoea and nocturnal gas exchange; this effect of NIV has been demonstrated in only one clinical trial. In children with stable disease, one trial of a single session of NIV increased functional capacity.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-01-24 12:15:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>There is a need for long-term multicentre randomised controlled trials which are adequately powered to assess the impact of NIV on quality of life and clinical disease progression when used as an adjunct to airway clearance or as a method of overnight ventilation or to increase functional exercise capacity. At the protocol stage and when conducting short-term trials the power of the trial should be considered. There is also a need to further establish the role of NIV in exercise in CF and which subgroups would benefit most from NIV intervention. Although it is impossible to double blind any future trials, it is important to undertake blind assessment of the participants to ensure good quality trials. Future trials should use outcome measures which are considered important by people with CF such as health-related quality of life and dyspnoea. Future trials must also assess the impact of NIV use on both people with CF and their carers in terms of practical difficulties, such as inconvenience, noise, intrusiveness and travel restrictions.</P>
<P>In the Young trial despite the benefits outlined above, nocturnal hypoxaemia persisted in the NIV group and in the oxygen group. Therfore further research is needed to establish if a combination of NIV and oxygen is more effective in the long term.<BR/>
