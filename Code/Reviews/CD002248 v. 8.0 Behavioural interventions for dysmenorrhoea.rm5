<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-08-25 09:57:25 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Dysmenorrhoea is a very common complaint that refers to painful menstrual cramps in the uterus (womb). When the pain is due to a recognised medical condition such as endometriosis it is called secondary dysmenorrhoea. When the pain is of unknown cause it is called primary dysmenorrhoea. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or the contraceptive pill have been used as treatment for period pain but more women are looking for non-drug therapies. Behavioural therapies assume that psychological (the mind) and environmental factors interact with, and influence, physical processes, for example stress might influence period pain. Behavioural therapies focus on both physical and psychological coping strategies for symptoms such as pain rather than focusing on medical solutions for any underlying causes of the symptoms. An example of a behavioural therapy is using relaxation to help a woman cope with painful period cramps. This review found that progressive muscle relaxation with or without imagery and relaxation may help with spasmodic (acute, cramping pain) symptoms of period pain. Also that pain management training and relaxation plus biofeedback may help with period pain in general. The results are not conclusive due to the small number of women in the trials and the poor methods used in some of the trials.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Dysmenorrhoea refers to the occurrence of painful menstrual cramps of uterine origin and is a common gynaecological condition with considerable morbidity. The behavioural approach assumes that psychological and environmental factors interact with, and influence, physiological processes. Behavioural interventions for dysmenorrhoea may include both physical and cognitive procedures and focus on both physical and psychological coping strategies for dysmenorrhoeic symptoms rather than modification of any underlying organic pathology. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the effectiveness of any behavioural interventions for the treatment of primary or secondary dysmenorrhoea when compared to each other, placebo, no treatment, or conventional medical treatments for example non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).</P>

<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Five trials involving 213 women were included. <BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Behavioural intervention vs control: </B>One trial of pain management training reported reduction in pain and symptoms compared to a control. Three trials of relaxation compared to control reported varied results, two trials showed no difference in symptom severity scores however one trial reported relaxation was effective for reducing symptoms in menstrual sufferers with spasmodic symptoms. Two trials reported less restriction in daily activities following treatment with either relaxation of pain management training compared to a control. One trial also reported less time absent from school following treatment wit pain management training compared to a control. </P>
<P>
<B>Behavioural intervention vs other behavioural interventions</B>: Three trials showed no difference between behavioural interventions for the outcome of improvement in symptoms. One trial showed that relaxation resulted in a decrease in the need for resting time compared to the relaxation and imagery. </P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-08-25 09:58:20 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The aetiology of primary dysmenorrhoea has been the source of considerable debate. Until quite recently, many medical and gynaecological texts ascribed the source of primary dysmenorrhoea as emotional or psychological problems. Dysmenorrhoea was attributed to a variety of ca such as anxiety, emotional instability, a faulty outlook on sex and menstruation, or imitation of the mother's feelings about menstruation (<LINK REF="REF-Jeffcoate-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jeffcoate 1975</LINK>). It has also been attributed to psychoanalytic principles such as rejection of the feminine role or failure to conceive resulting in a frustrated "weeping" uterus (<LINK REF="REF-Ylikorkala-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ylikorkala 1978</LINK>). Experimental and clinical research has identified physiological reasons for dysmenorrhoea; the over-production of uterine prostaglandins, which are associated with uterine contractions (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenwaks-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenwaks 1980</LINK>), and the over-production of vasopressin, a hormone that also stimulates the contraction of muscular tissue (<LINK REF="REF-Stromberg-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stromberg 1984</LINK>).</P>
<P>Since the implication of physiological factors in the aetiology of dysmenorrhoea, conventional treatment has focused on medical therapy. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which work as prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors, and oral contraceptive pills, which inhibit ovulation thus reducing myometrial activity, are now considered standard treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Dawood-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dawood 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dawood-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dawood 1990</LINK>). The efficacy of these conventional treatments is high, however the failure rate is still around 20 to 25% (<LINK REF="REF-Dawood-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dawood 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Henzl-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henzl 1985</LINK>). Therefore there is a need for alternatives to the conventional medical treatments.</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-08-10 15:39:09 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Julie A Brown">
<P>Behavioural interventions have been shown to be effective in managing pain in fields as diverse as osteoarthritis and cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Bradley-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradley 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Syrjala-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Syrjala 1995</LINK>). A recent National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Development Conference also found behavioural and relaxation approaches useful in the treatment of chronic pain (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-Panel-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH Panel 1996</LINK>). The behavioural approach assumes that psychological and environmental factors interact with and influence physiological processes. Research has demonstrated that life stress can influence dysmenorrhoea, which lends some evidence to the behavioural approach for this type of disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Marini-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marini 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Siegel-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siegel 1979</LINK>). A variety of interventions are labelled as behavioural and it is difficult to provide a single definition. Behavioural interventions are primarily aimed at modifying an individual's behaviour but can also be aimed at modifying thoughts or cognitions in order to subsequently change behaviour. Behavioural interventions for dysmenorrhoea may include both physical and cognitive procedures such as biofeedback, desensitization based procedures, Lamaze exercises, hypnotherapy, and relaxation training (<LINK REF="REF-Denny-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Denny 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lewis-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 1983</LINK>). These type of interventions focus on physical and psychological coping strategies for dysmenorrhoeic symptoms rather than modification of any underlying organic pathology. Case studies suggest that behavioural interventions may be effective in treating dysmenorrhoea, although it is difficult to evaluate these types of studies due to small numbers of participants and poor methodology (<LINK REF="REF-Denny-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Denny 1981</LINK>).</P>

<BR/>Each type of behavioural intervention was analysed separately. Statistical analysis was performed in accordance with the guidelines for statistical analysis developed by the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group. It was intended for outcomes to be pooled statistically. However due to the small number of trials and variety of interventions this was not possible. Heterogeneity between the results of different studies was to have been examined by inspecting the scatter in the data points and the overlap in their confidence intervals and, more formally by checking the results of the chi-squared tests.</P>
<P>A priori, it was planned to perform sensitivity analyses on results to look at the possible contribution of:<BR/>(1) differences in methodological quality, trials of high quality only compared to all trials<BR/>(2) differences in methods of assessing dysmenorrhoeic pain, use of VAS compared to other scales<BR/>However these analyses were not possible as only five trials were included, an inadequate number for these type of analyses.</P>
<P>For dichotomous data (for example, proportion of participants with a specific adverse side effect), results for each study were expressed as an odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals and combined for meta-analysis with RevMan software using the Peto-modified Mantel-Haenszel method.</P>
<P>Continuous differences between groups in the meta-analysis (for example, pain relief on a visual analogue scale) was shown as a weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval. A fixed effects model was used.</P>

<BR/>Results of the search</B>
<BR/>Thirteen trials were initially identified. Three were excluded (<LINK REF="STD-Hubbell-1949" TYPE="STUDY">Hubbell 1949</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Israel-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Israel 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lundquist-1947" TYPE="STUDY">Lundquist 1947</LINK>) as they included exercise which is an intervention to be considered by another Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Bolton-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bolton 2003</LINK>). A further three trials were excluded as their participants were not women with dysmenorrhoea (<LINK REF="STD-Pearce-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Pearce 1982</LINK>; Peters 1991; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Zak-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Van Zak 1994</LINK>). Two were excluded for failing to mention whether they were randomised (<LINK REF="STD-Mathur-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Mathur 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sigmon-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Sigmon 1988</LINK>): data were sought from the authors but no reply was received. Therefore five trials were included in the review (see Included Studies table) (<LINK REF="STD-Amodei-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Amodei 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bennink-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Bennink 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chesney-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Chesney 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hart-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Hart 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Quillen-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Quillen 1982</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Types of participants</B>
<BR/>Three of the included studies categorised the type of dysmenorrhoea as congestive (dull, aching pain) or spasmodic (acute, colicky pain) using the Menstrual Symptoms Questionnaire (<LINK REF="STD-Amodei-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Amodei 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bennink-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Bennink 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Quillen-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Quillen 1982</LINK>). These labels were developed as subgroups of primary dysmenorrhoea, although only two of these trials also mentioned excluding organic causes of dysmenorrhoea (<LINK REF="STD-Bennink-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Bennink 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Quillen-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Quillen 1982</LINK>). One of these trials also only included women with spasmodic dysmenorrhoea (<LINK REF="STD-Bennink-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Bennink 1982</LINK>). One trial specified women with primary dysmenorrhoea with no other inclusion or exclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Hart-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Hart 1981</LINK>), and the last mentioned women with menstrual discomfort (<LINK REF="STD-Chesney-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Chesney 1975</LINK>). The trials included women of various ages the overall range was 16 to 44 years of age. Common exclusion criteria were use of oral contraceptives or intrauterine devices and use of additional medication. Three trials mention the source of women; they were all recruited using advertisements from the local community or were college students (<LINK REF="STD-Amodei-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Amodei 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bennink-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Bennink 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hart-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Hart 1981</LINK>). All trials took place in the USA.</P>
<P>
<B>Types of interventions</B>
<BR/>A number of different behavioural interventions were considered by the five trials. Relaxation by itself or in combination with other treatments was investigated by three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Amodei-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Amodei 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bennink-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Bennink 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chesney-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Chesney 1975</LINK>); other investigated treatments were biofeedback (<LINK REF="STD-Bennink-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Bennink 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hart-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Hart 1981</LINK>); pain management (<LINK REF="STD-Quillen-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Quillen 1982</LINK>); and coping skills (<LINK REF="STD-Amodei-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Amodei 1987</LINK>). The duration of treatment varied from one to six months.</P>
<P>
<B>Types of outcomes</B>
<BR/>The primary outcome in all five trials was pain, pain relief, or relief of symptoms. This was measured and reported in a variety of ways (see Included Studies table for more details).</P>

<P>See Quality Table (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Randomisation and allocation concealment</B>
<BR/>All five trials were stated they were randomised. All received an allocation concealment score of B due to lack of information regarding how randomisation was performed and concealed (<LINK REF="STD-Amodei-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Amodei 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bennink-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Bennink 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chesney-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Chesney 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hart-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Hart 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Quillen-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Quillen 1982</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Blinding</B>
<BR/>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Chesney-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Chesney 1975</LINK>) reported it was double blind, however blinding status was unclear as the trial only stated that both the treatment providers and women were unaware of the purpose or hypothesis of the trial and did not state whether they were blind to their treatment assignment. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Amodei-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Amodei 1987</LINK>) was single blind (therapist only). In the remaining three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bennink-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Bennink 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hart-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Hart 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Quillen-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Quillen 1982</LINK>) no specific information on blinding was reported.</P>
<P>
<B>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</B>
<BR/>The inclusion and exclusion criteria were clearly defined by all the trials. Many trials used the Menstrual Symptoms Questionnaire to place women in sub-categories of congestive or spasmodic dysmenorrhoea either for inclusion or exclusion, or for diagnostic purposes (<LINK REF="STD-Amodei-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Amodei 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bennink-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Bennink 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chesney-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Chesney 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Quillen-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Quillen 1982</LINK>). It is unclear how valid and clinically useful these categories are (<LINK REF="REF-Webster-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Webster 1979</LINK>). Most of the included trials made no mention of the women excluded from the trial. In one trial of relaxation therapy 7 out of 79 women were excluded, either post recruitment or randomisation (it is unclear which), due to the use of an OCP (<LINK REF="STD-Chesney-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Chesney 1975</LINK>). A trial on pain management training gave specific details on those excluded at recruitment: 14/38 women did not start the trial due to parity, secondary dysmenorrhoea, OCP use, concomitant medication or inability to obtain a physician's statement (<LINK REF="STD-Quillen-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Quillen 1982</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Intention-to-treat and withdrawals</B>
<BR/>None of the published trials stated they performed an intention to treat analysis. Two trials made no mention of withdrawals or dropouts (<LINK REF="STD-Amodei-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Amodei 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bennink-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Bennink 1982</LINK>). One of these trials reported two studies, no mention of withdrawals was made for either study, however in study one the size of the degrees of freedom in the statistical analysis suggested that not all women completed all measures (<LINK REF="STD-Amodei-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Amodei 1987</LINK>). In one trial of relaxation therapy 7/79 women were excluded due to the use of an OCP, then a further 3/72 (4.2%) failed to complete treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Chesney-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Chesney 1975</LINK>). In another study of biofeedback training 3/14 women (21.4%) dropped out of the trial; the authors of the trial stated their reasons for withdrawal as unrelated to the nature of the study (<LINK REF="STD-Hart-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Hart 1981</LINK>). One trial on pain management had a large number of dropouts from the original 24 women, 8 dropped out during the trial (33.3%) 4 in the control group gave no reason, as did one in the treatment group, one in the group failed to complete treatment due to illness and two had delayed periods. Of those remaining another 8/16 did not complete the 18 month follow-up as they were either not contactable, using oral contraceptives or pregnant (<LINK REF="STD-Quillen-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Quillen 1982</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>Trial design</B>
<BR/>Two trials were of factorial design (<LINK REF="STD-Bennink-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Bennink 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hart-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Hart 1981</LINK>). The other trials did not explicitly state trial design.<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>Sample size</B>
<BR/>All trials included in the review were of relatively small sample sizes. Sizes range from 14 to 72 women randomised in each trial.</P>
<P>
<B>Baseline comparison of groups</B>
<BR/>Pre-treatment symptom severity scores (SSS) for the different treatment groups were presented by three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Chesney-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Chesney 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hart-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Hart 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bennink-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Bennink 1982</LINK>), all of these trials showed no significant differences in baseline scores. Two trials compared Menstrual Symptom Questionnaire (MSQ) scores at baseline and showed no difference (<LINK REF="STD-Amodei-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Amodei 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Quillen-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Quillen 1982</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Consistency of treatment and compliance to treatment schedules</B>
<BR/>Trials that involve specific behavioural interventions can be particularly difficult to administer consistently to all the participants in the trial. Only two of the included trials clearly mention attempts to ensure treatment was consistent (<LINK REF="STD-Amodei-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Amodei 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hart-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Hart 1981</LINK>). One of these trials had a number of therapists providing treatment but gave them a few hours of training and detailed manuals to follow (<LINK REF="STD-Amodei-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Amodei 1987</LINK>). The other trial had weekly meetings for the 10 therapists providing treatment to help maintain consistency and also only used male therapists to try and control for a possible gender effect (<LINK REF="STD-Hart-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Hart 1981</LINK>). Scheduling problems with this trial meant that not all participants received the same number of treatments, 16 treatments per participant were intended but the actual number of treatments ranged from 9 to 15. The other trials appear to be consistent in their approach to treatment but there was a lack of reported information to clearly assess this consistency.</P>
<P>There was no mention of any checks to ensure participants complied to their assigned treatment schedule by two of the included trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bennink-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Bennink 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Quillen-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Quillen 1982</LINK>). The other trials used various means to monitor compliance. For the biofeedback trial all the therapy sessions were monitored, although home practice sessions were not monitored (<LINK REF="STD-Hart-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Hart 1981</LINK>). Two trials that included a relaxation treatment group asked participants to maintain records of relaxation practice (<LINK REF="STD-Amodei-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Amodei 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chesney-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Chesney 1975</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Outcome assessment</B>
<BR/>Four of the included trials used the Symptom Severity Scale (SSS), a 15 point rating scale developed by <LINK REF="STD-Chesney-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Chesney 1975</LINK>, in most cases this scale was well described (<LINK REF="STD-Amodei-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Amodei 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bennink-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Bennink 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chesney-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Chesney 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hart-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Hart 1981</LINK>). One trial used the Moo's Menstrual Distress questionnaire (MDQ) (<LINK REF="STD-Quillen-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Quillen 1982</LINK>).</P>
<P>Timing of outcome measures was typically the menstruation following treatment although one trial also carried out a follow-up 18 months after treatment, which meant many of the original participants were uncontactable (<LINK REF="STD-Quillen-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Quillen 1982</LINK>).</P>
<P>Outcome measures were usually well reported by the trials. One trial used the MDQ but only reported a small set of the measures, those with large differences between the two groups (<LINK REF="STD-Quillen-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Quillen 1982</LINK>).</P>

The primary outcome in all five trials was pain, pain relief, or relief of symptoms, although this was measured and reported in a variety of ways.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-08-25 11:20:53 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The aim of this review was to investigate the effectiveness of any behavioural interventions for the treatment of primary or secondary dysmenorrhoea when compared to each other, placebo, no treatment or conventional medical treatments (e.g. NSAIDs). A meta-analysis combining results from all the trials was not feasible due to differences in the measurement, timing and reporting of outcomes. In addition a number of trials failed to report data on all the outcomes they claimed to measure. This may be a result of trials only reporting 'significant' results and is a form of publication bias that may impact on the overall results of this review. Due to difficulties with the available data results were reported as dichotomous, continuous or descriptive data separately.<BR/>
<BR/>Only five relevant trials were identified and included in this review. Interventions included relaxation training with and without imagery, relaxation plus biofeedback, biofeedback with EMG training, and pain management sessions.</P>
<P>The trials in this review had variable quality ratings. None of the trials were clear about how treatment allocation was concealed. Only one of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Chesney-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Chesney 1975</LINK>) was double blind and one was single blind (<LINK REF="STD-Amodei-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Amodei 1987</LINK>). To be successful in maintaining blinding, the women entering the trial need to be unsure of the treatment being offered. This was unclear in the two trials that mentioned blinding. Double blinding in behavioral interventions is also generally considered impossible, as the treatment provider needs to physically deliver the treatment. As a result, it is probably impossible to perform a true double blind trial of a behavioural intervention although blinding of the participant and outcome assessors should be used if possible. Most of the trials in this review used waiting list controls. An important aspect when using waiting list as controls is the women's previous experience with treatment. Previous treatment of the women was not mentioned in any of the trials in this review.</P>
<P>Women with different levels of severity of dysmenorrhoea were included in the trials and different ways of assessing pain or pain relief were also used. Follow-up length and the timing of outcome assessment also differed.</P>
<P>Overall, the trials in this review had small sample sizes and were of poor methodological quality. Therefore no strong conclusion can be made due to the small size of the trials and other methodological considerations. There were also methodological problems associated with the initial diagnosis of dysmenorrhoea .The use of the Menstrual Symptom Questionnaire (MSQ) to diagnose categories of congestive (dull, aching pain) or spasmodic (acute, colicky pain) dysmenorrhoea are categories that are no longer widely used in experimental trials due to limited validity. There were problems associated with quantifying and grading the pain of dysmenorrhoea in the included trials. The assessment instruments used in quantifying dysmenorrhoea are based on women's self report and as such are subject to obvious bias. In addition all the trials categorised pain using different scales.</P>
<P>Overall there were few withdrawals from treatment, but reporting of adverse events was not conducted by any of the studies therefore it is clear that the data presented in the studies does not reflect a comprehensive assessment of adverse events.</P>
<P>Treatment providers perform behavioural therapies with variation. Treatment is often individually tailored to each participants set of symptoms. Even if this is not the case, different therapists vary the duration of treatment, the frequency of treatments, timing of treatments in the cycle and the number of treatments performed. These are all factors that make it difficult to assess the overall efficacy of behavioural interventions. The impact of these factors on treatment outcome is not clear.</P>
<P>In the trials included in this review, there were many differences in treatment schedules. Many treatments were scheduled during menses, however other trials carried out interventions anytime in the menstrual cycle. These different approaches could affect the measurement of outcomes.</P>
<P>Menstrual pain is highly predictable and has a brief episodic course so seems well-suited to behavioural interventions that can be self-managed. While the trials in this review failed to demonstrate a clear efficacy of behavioural interventions their usefulness should be further evaluated.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-08-25 11:21:22 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is some evidence from five RCTs that behavioural interventions may be effective for dysmenorrhoea. However results should be viewed with caution as they varied greatly between trials due to inconsistency in the reporting of data, small trial size, poor methodological quality and age of the trials.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The trials included in this study that look at behavioural interventions that are all at least 20 years old therefore more recent trials would be useful. Comparisons with other standard medical treatments such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories would also be useful. Any future trials would need to be randomised controlled trials with adequate sample sizes. Objective pain outcome measures such as the visual analogue scale should also be used to standardised outcome trials. </P>
