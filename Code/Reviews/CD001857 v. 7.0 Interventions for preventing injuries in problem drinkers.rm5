<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Action with problem drinkers can cut risk of injury</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Drinking too much alcohol can be dangerous, and injuries (both intentional and unintentional) are one of the most important ways in which excess alcohol use can result in harm. Are there ways of working with people known to be "problem drinkers" that can reduce the number of these injuries? The reviewers found 17 studies of programs that reported whether working with problem drinkers reduced injuries. Several different approaches were evaluated, the most common being brief counseling by health workers. The evidence from these studies suggests that action with problem drinkers is effective in reducing both injuries and events that lead to injury (such as falls, motor vehicle crashes, and suicide attempts). However, more research is needed to calculate the level of effectiveness accurately and to determine which type of program works best.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Alcohol consumption has been linked with injuries through motor vehicle crashes, falls, drowning, fires and burns, and violence. In the US, half of the estimated 100,000 deaths attributed to alcohol each year are due to intentional and unintentional injuries. The identification of effective interventions for the reduction of unintentional and intentional injuries due to problem drinking is, therefore, an important public health goal.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effect of interventions for problem drinking on subsequent injury risk.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-08-08 16:28:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Karen Blackhall">
<P>We searched 12 twelve computerized databases: MEDLINE (1966 to 2002), EMBASE (1982 to 2002), CENTRAL (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2002, Issue 2), PsycINFO (1967 to 2002), CINAHL (1982 to10/96), ERIC (1966 to12/96), Dissertation Abstracts International (1861 to11/96), IBSS (1961 to 2002), ISTP (1982 to 2002) and three specialized transportation databases (Transport 1988 to 2002/03). Bibliographies of relevant trials were searched and authors were contacted. Government agencies were also contacted for further information and grey literature. Most of the electronic and bibliographic database searches were last run in May 2002.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomized controlled trials of interventions among participants with problem drinking, which are intended to reduce alcohol consumption or to prevent injuries or their antecedents, and which measured injury-related outcomes.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors extracted data on participants, interventions, follow-up, allocation concealment, and outcomes, and independently rated allocation concealment quality.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Of 23 eligible trials identified, 22 had been completed and 17 provided results for relevant outcomes. Completed trials comparing interventions for problem drinking to no intervention reported reduced motor-vehicle crashes and related injuries, falls, suicide attempts, domestic violence, assaults and child abuse, alcohol-related injuries and injury emergency visits, hospitalizations and deaths. Reductions ranged from 27% to 65%. Because few trials were sufficiently large to assess effects on injuries, individual effect estimates were generally imprecise. We did not combine the results quantitatively because the interventions, patient populations, and outcomes were so diverse. The most commonly evaluated intervention was brief counseling in the clinical setting. This was studied in seven trials, in which injury-related deaths were reduced: relative risk (RR) 0.65; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.21 to 2.00. However, this reduction may have been due to chance. The majority of trials of brief counseling also showed beneficial effects on diverse non-fatal injury outcomes.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Interventions for problem drinking appear to reduce injuries and their antecedents (e.g. falls, motor vehicle crashes, suicide attempts). Because injuries account for much of the morbidity and mortality from problem drinking, larger studies are warranted to evaluate the effect of treating problem drinking on injuries.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-06-09 12:35:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Alcohol consumption has been linked with injuries and deaths incurred through motor vehicle crashes, falls, drowning, fires and burns, and violence (<LINK REF="REF-NCIPC-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCIPC 2001</LINK>). In the United States, alcohol consumption contributes to 38% of motor vehicle crash fatalities, 40% of deaths in residential fires, and 25% to 50% of adolescent and adult deaths associated with water recreation (<LINK REF="REF-NCIPC-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCIPC 2001</LINK>). A strong association has been found between alcoholism and domestic violence (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Farrell-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Farrell 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Cunradi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cunradi 2002</LINK>). Even moderate alcohol consumption has been associated with increases in injuries and deaths from trauma (<LINK REF="REF-Andreasson-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andreasson 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Vinson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinson 1995</LINK>). Problem drinkers who do not meet definitions for alcohol dependence are responsible for the majority of alcohol-related morbidity and mortality in the general population (<LINK REF="REF-IOM-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">IOM 1990</LINK>). In the United States, the burden of alcohol-related diseases and injuries on emergency department is now three times greater than previously reported, with alcohol-related visits to emergency departments from 1992-2001, averaging 7.6 million visits per year (<LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2004</LINK>). Nearly half of the global burden of alcohol-related mortality is attributable to unintentional and intentional injury (<LINK REF="REF-Rehm-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rehm 2003</LINK>). Based on estimates of global injury mortality and its contributors (<LINK REF="REF-Rehm-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rehm 2003</LINK>), alcohol-related injuries world-wide may cause several million deaths each year.</P>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-06-09 12:35:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Numerous randomized controlled trials have evaluated a diverse range of interventions to reduce alcohol dependence, abuse or consumption: pharmacotherapy; individual, couple, and group counseling; exercise; acupuncture; controlled drinking; brief educational interventions (alcohol intake assessment and provision of information and advice); and other in- and out-patient therapies and combinations of treatments. Most such trials have measured effects of treatment on alcohol consumption and maintenance of abstinence. Many trials have also evaluated the effects of treatment on a wide variety of negative consequences linked directly or indirectly to drinking (e.g. hospitalizations, social or occupational maladjustment) (<LINK REF="REF-Babor-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Babor 1994</LINK>). Because of the increased risk of injuries associated with problem drinking, we undertook a systematic review to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions for problem drinking in preventing injuries.</P>

<P>One researcher first reviewed titles and abstracts to identify potentially relevant trials, using the selection criteria of study design, participants and interventions. Studies that clearly failed to meet these three inclusion criteria were excluded. Those that met these criteria or could not be definitely excluded were obtained in full text, to exclude those that did not meet at least these first three inclusion criteria. We contacted the corresponding authors of all remaining studies to identify additional potentially relevant trials and to request further details to determine eligibility (if required). If studies met the first three inclusion criteria but did not report collecting injury-related outcome measures (selection criterion four), we asked the authors to provide any unpublished data on such outcomes. We attempted to contact additional authors (by mail, telephone, and Internet search) when corresponding authors were deceased or could not be traced.</P>

<P>Two reviewers independently extracted data and rated the quality of allocation concealment for each eligible study. We extracted data on: the number and description of participants, type of intervention, duration of follow-up, method of allocation concealment, and outcomes evaluated. We assessed the quality of allocation concealment as follows: an 'A' rating signified adequate measures to conceal allocation (e.g. central randomization; serially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes); a 'B' rating signified unclear adequacy of allocation concealment (e.g. no mention of allocation concealment, or insufficient description of allocation concealment, such as "sealed envelopes" ); and a 'C' rating signified inadequately concealed allocation (e.g. alternation; open list of random numbers) (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). There was 100% agreement in the allocation concealment ratings. Studies that would have received a 'C' rating based on the use of quasi-random allocation were ineligible under our inclusion criteria.</P>

<P>Of the 7014 published and unpublished studies identified by our search strategies in the original review, 569 (8.1%) were potentially relevant, based on title or abstract. After full text review, nine trials met all four inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Brown-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 1980</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Reis-1982a" TYPE="STUDY">Reis 1982a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Reis-1982b" TYPE="STUDY">Reis 1982b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Walsh-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1992</LINK>, Öjehagen 1993, <LINK REF="STD-Mann-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Mann 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Barber-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Barber 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sitharthan-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Sitharthan 1996</LINK>). An additional 314 met the first three inclusion criteria. For 23 of these 314 trials (7%), we could not determine whether injury-related outcomes had been measured, because all authors were either untraceable or deceased. The authors of 119 (41%) of the remaining 291 studies responded to our requests for further information. From these responses, we identified an additional nine eligible completed studies (<LINK REF="STD-Gallant-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Gallant 1968</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Landrum-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Landrum 1981</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-McCrady-et-al-1982" TYPE="STUDY">McCrady et al 1982</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Fitzgerald-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Fitzgerald 1985</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Potamianos-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Potamianos 1986</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kuchipudi-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Kuchipudi 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-WHO-BISG-1996" TYPE="STUDY">WHO BISG 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Toteva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Toteva 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sitharthan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sitharthan 1997</LINK>). Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-McCrady-et-al-1982" TYPE="STUDY">McCrady et al 1982</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1992</LINK>) were subsequently excluded because their 'injury' outcome measures were found to include other outcomes not specifically related to injury (i.e. criminal behavior and alcohol-related illness, respectively) that could not be separated from the injury data. The injury-related data for three studies were published in government reports (<LINK REF="STD-Reis-1982a" TYPE="STUDY">Reis 1982a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Reis-1982b" TYPE="STUDY">Reis 1982b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Landrum-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Landrum 1981</LINK>) and we obtained unpublished injury data from the authors of four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Barber-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Barber 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gallant-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Gallant 1968</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Fitzgerald-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Fitzgerald 1985</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kuchipudi-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Kuchipudi 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>The updated database searches identified 52 potentially eligible studies for full-text review; five eligible trials were found, one of which had been in progress at the time of the original review. Review of bibliographies identified one additional trial. Thus, six trials met all inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Gentilello-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gentilello 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Monti-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Monti 1999</LINK>, Fleming 1997, <LINK REF="STD-Fleming-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Fleming 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kristenson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kristenson 2002</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Longabaugh-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Longabaugh 2001</LINK>).

We identified one eligible study in progress (written communication: Bohn M, University of Wisconsin Medical School, Madison, Wisconsin, May 5, 2004). A trial previously identified as in progress did not collect injury-related outcomes as planned because the available motor vehicle crash records were insufficient; this trial was therefore excluded as ineligible (<LINK REF="STD-Wells_x002d_Parker-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Wells-Parker 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>A total of 23 eligible trials have therefore been identified (See Table of included studies and List of on-going studies), of which 22 have been completed, 17 have reported results for injury-related outcomes, and 16 have reported numerical data for the relevant outcomes.</P>

<P>In the trial by Fitzgerald and Mulford (<LINK REF="STD-Fitzgerald-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Fitzgerald 1985</LINK>), the number of subjects differed markedly between the two study groups at Center A. The author notes that originally the study had two experimental groups at Center A, 'hospital-initiated telephone aftercare' and 'patient-initiated telephone aftercare', in addition to a 'no aftercare' control group. Because 42 of 43 subjects randomly assigned to 'patient-initiated aftercare' did not in fact initiate any contacts, all 43 patients were combined with the control group in the analysis. Random allocation to the first experimental group was maintained. The author states that there was little impact on their effect estimates regardless of whether these subjects were included or excluded from the control group (personal communication, HA Mulford, September 1997).</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2008-06-09 17:11:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>The 23 completed trials evaluated a diverse group of interventions, patient populations, and injury outcomes. The most common intervention studied was brief counseling for problem drinking, which was evaluated in nine trials. The data from these trials, when available, have been combined quantitatively where appropriate. Due to the diversity of interventions, populations, and outcomes studied in the other trials, no attempt was made to combine their results. Effects of intervention on abstinence, alcohol consumption, and alcohol-impaired driving are shown in the notes section of the Table of included studies.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Mortality</HEADING>
<P>Eight completed trials collected injury mortality outcomes. Twenty-seven total deaths were reported in the seven trials for which data were available (<LINK REF="STD-Fleming-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fleming 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gallant-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Gallant 1968</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kristenson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kristenson 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kuchipudi-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Kuchipudi 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mann-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Mann 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-_x00d6_jehagen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Öjehagen 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Walsh-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>Four trials compared intervention to no intervention. Three of these reported a reduced risk of death in the intervention group compared to the control group, although all effect estimates were imprecise due to small numbers. At 48-month follow-up, <LINK REF="STD-Fleming-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fleming 2002</LINK> reported one suicide per 392 subjects in the intervention group and two motor vehicle crash deaths per 382 subjects in the control group (RR=0.49; 95% CI 0.04 to 5.35). <LINK REF="STD-Mann-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Mann 1994</LINK> reported 3/220 accidental and violent deaths in the experimental group and 5/127 in the control group: relative risk (RR) 0.35; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08 to 1.43). <LINK REF="STD-Kuchipudi-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Kuchipudi 1990</LINK> reported 3/59 suicides and violent deaths in the intervention group and 5/55 in the control group (RR=0.56; 95% CI 0.08 to 1.43). The fourth trial reported more deaths in the intervention than the control group. <LINK REF="STD-Kristenson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kristenson 2002</LINK> reported one suicide per 365 persons in the intervention group and no injury deaths per 382 persons in the control group (p=0.55, Fisher's exact test). Combining data from the three trials of brief counseling that reported effects on injury-related deaths (<LINK REF="STD-Fleming-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fleming 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kristenson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kristenson 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kuchipudi-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Kuchipudi 1990</LINK>), the relative risk of death among 1555 total subjects was reduced with intervention (RR=0.65; 95% CI 0.21 to 2.00).</P>
<P>The other three completed trials reporting injury mortality data compared different treatment modalities, without any 'no intervention' control group. There were too few events in each of these three trials (none in <LINK REF="STD-Gallant-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Gallant 1968</LINK>, two in <LINK REF="STD-Walsh-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 1991</LINK>, five in <LINK REF="STD-_x00d6_jehagen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Öjehagen 1997</LINK>) to identify differences in the effects of specific treatment modalities on injury deaths. At 9 years follow-up, <LINK REF="STD-_x00d6_jehagen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Öjehagen 1997</LINK> reported three suicides among 36 participants who received one year of multi-modal behavioural therapy versus two suicides among 36 participants who received a year of psychiatric therapy (RR=1.50; 95% CI 0.27 to 8.45), although the effect estimate was imprecise due to small numbers.<BR/>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Non-fatal injuries</HEADING>
<P>Eighteen completed trials collected data on non-fatal injuries and their antecedents. The results from trials collecting non-fatal injury outcomes due to specifically identified causes (violence, falls, motor vehicle crashes) are summarized separately below.</P>
<P>Eleven trials collected data on non-fatal injuries due to all causes. Results, however, were available from only six of these trials: <LINK REF="STD-Kuchipudi-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Kuchipudi 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Fitzgerald-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Fitzgerald 1985</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Monti-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Monti 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Longabaugh-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Longabaugh 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gentilello-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gentilello 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Fleming-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Fleming 1999</LINK>. Three of the six trials specifically assessed alcohol-related injuries (<LINK REF="STD-Longabaugh-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Longabaugh 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Monti-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Monti 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Fitzgerald-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Fitzgerald 1985</LINK>); the remainder looked at injuries regardless of relationship to alcohol use.</P>
<P>In five of the six trials, the intervention for problem drinking reduced the risk of injuries or accidents compared to no intervention. In four of the trials, a reduction in injury risk occurred, despite the fact that there were no beneficial effects of treatment on abstinence (<LINK REF="STD-Kuchipudi-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Kuchipudi 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Fitzgerald-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Fitzgerald 1985</LINK>) or on alcohol consumption (<LINK REF="STD-Monti-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Monti 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Longabaugh-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Longabaugh 2001</LINK>) (see Notes in Table of Included Studies). Three of these reported specifically on alcohol-related injuries. <LINK REF="STD-Fitzgerald-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Fitzgerald 1985</LINK> reported a reduction in drinking-related injuries and accidents with telephone aftercare contacts (RR=0.73; 95% CI 0.34 to 1.58). <LINK REF="STD-Monti-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Monti 1999</LINK> found a significantly reduced risk of self-reported alcohol-related injury at 6-month follow-up among adolescents who received a brief intervention in the emergency department (21% versus 50%, adjusted OR=0.25; 95% CI 0.09 to 0.69). <LINK REF="STD-Longabaugh-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Longabaugh 2001</LINK> compared a motivational interview with a booster session to standard care and reported fewer mean total injuries (0.67 versus 0.72; p=0.17, one-tailed) and alcohol-related injuries (0.165 v. 0.240 mean injuries, p = 0.04, one-tailed). However, mean alcohol-related injuries after a motivational interview alone (without a booster session) were not different from mean alcohol-related injuries after standard care (data not provided, p &gt; 0.40, one-tailed). Total injuries and injuries treated by a doctor did not differ among any of the three groups (data not shown, p&gt;0.05). <LINK REF="STD-Kuchipudi-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Kuchipudi 1990</LINK> reported the beneficial effect of a motivational intervention on injury-related hospitalizations (2/59 vs 3/55; RR=0.62; 95% CI: 0.11, 3.58). In the fifth trial (<LINK REF="STD-Gentilello-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gentilello 1999</LINK>), both injury risk and alcohol consumption were reduced with intervention. At one-year follow-up, <LINK REF="STD-Gentilello-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gentilello 1999</LINK> found that a brief motivational intervention reduced the risk of injury requiring emergency treatment or hospital admission (adjusted hazard ratio 0.53, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.07). At three year follow-up, the risk of injury resulting in hospital readmission was also reduced (adjusted hazard ratio 0.52, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.29). Alcohol consumption was substantially reduced at 12-month follow-up (-21.8 (3.7) versus -6.7 (5.8) drinks/week, p=0.03).</P>
<P>In the sixth trial, <LINK REF="STD-Fleming-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Fleming 1999</LINK> implemented a brief motivational interview among adults aged <U>&gt;</U> 65 years and reported that there were "no significant changes" in accidents or injuries (data were not reported), although alcohol consumption was significantly reduced with intervention.</P>
<P>Other trials also measured the effect of the experimental intervention on accidents (<LINK REF="STD-Brown-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 1980</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Walsh-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Potamianos-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Potamianos 1986</LINK>) or injuries (<LINK REF="STD-WHO-BISG-1996" TYPE="STUDY">WHO BISG 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Toteva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Toteva 1996</LINK>), but we were unable to obtain these data.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Non-fatal violence</HEADING>
<P>Seven completed trials collected data on non-fatal violence, but data were available for only four of the trials.</P>
<P>All three trials evaluating intervention versus no intervention suggested a reduction in non-fatal violence with intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Barber-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Barber 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Fitzgerald-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Fitzgerald 1985</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Fleming-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fleming 2002</LINK>). Barber and Crisp, using the "Pressure to Change" approach for partners of heavy drinkers, reported a reduction in 'domestic violence' (4/16 vs 3/7; RR=0.58; 95% CI 0.17 to 1.95). Fitzgerald and Mulford reported a reduction in suicide attempts with telephone aftercare contacts (4/125 vs 11/167; RR=0.48; 95% CI 0.15, 1.51). A motivational interview administered to injured problem drinkers resulted in fewer instances of arrest for assault, battery, and/or child abuse than did standard care (<LINK REF="STD-Fleming-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fleming 2002</LINK>; 8 events/1568 person-years v 11/1528 person-years; RR=0.71; 95% CI 0.29, 1.76). Two of the three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Fleming-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fleming 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Barber-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Barber 1995</LINK>) showed a beneficial effect on drinking-related outcomes as well as on injuries. The reduction in mean drinks per week did not persist to 48 month follow-up in Fleming et al (2002), although the reduction in binge drinking episodes did. <LINK REF="STD-Fitzgerald-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Fitzgerald 1985</LINK> found little difference in abstinence rates between the two groups (21% versus 22%).</P>
<P>The fourth trial (<LINK REF="STD-Sitharthan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sitharthan 1997</LINK>) reported a reduced risk of committing assault after cognitive behavioral therapy compared to cue exposure therapy (0/25 vs 5/27; RR=infinity; 95% CI: 0.91, infinity) (CI shown is based on the odds ratio approximation), p=0.06. Sitharthan, however, found a greater reduction in alcohol consumption with cue exposure therapy.</P>
<P>Other completed trials measured the effect of intervention on aggressive behavior (<LINK REF="STD-Potamianos-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Potamianos 1986</LINK>), assaults (<LINK REF="STD-Sitharthan-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Sitharthan 1996</LINK>), and criminal and domestic violence (<LINK REF="STD-Toteva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Toteva 1996</LINK>), but data were not available.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Landrum-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Landrum 1981</LINK> assessed three different interventions for persons convicted of DUI (driving under the influence), compared to no intervention. Monthly probation alone, structured rehabilitation alone, and these two interventions combined were each associated with a reduced risk of motor vehicle crashes: RR=0.76 (95% CI 0.51 to 1.13), RR=0.85 (0.57 to 1.26), and RR=0.90 (0.60 to 1.35), respectively. Monthly probation and structured rehabilitation had stronger effects on motor vehicle crash injuries (RR=0.47; 95% CI 0.20 to 1.11 and RR=0.58; 95% CI 0.26 to 1.32, respectively), while the combination of probation and rehabilitation appeared to have no effect on crash-related injuries (RR=1.06; 95% CI 0.52 to 2.17). However, all effect estimates were imprecise. (Proportions with crashes and injuries in each group are shown in the Table of included studies.) Despite apparently differential effects on crashes and injuries, all four groups had similar rates of DUI repeat arrests (32%, 33%, 31%, and 33%, respectively), with the lowest repeat arrest rate in the intervention group that showed the smallest effect on crashes and related injuries (i.e. probation plus rehabilitation).</P>
<P>In a study of DUI first offenders (<LINK REF="STD-Reis-1982a" TYPE="STUDY">Reis 1982a</LINK>), in-class education about drink driving reduced the cumulative accident rate (0.084 compared to 0.101 in controls), but there appeared to be little effect from home study (cumulative accident rate=0.098); the overall p value for the three groups was 0.58. In-class education also had a stronger effect on alcohol consumption and on DUI arrest recidivism than did home study (see Table of included studies).</P>
<P>In a study of DUI multiple offenders (<LINK REF="STD-Reis-1982b" TYPE="STUDY">Reis 1982b</LINK>), only educational counseling combined with disulfiram therapy appeared to reduce the cumulative incidence of alcohol-related crashes and injuries (0.055) compared to no intervention (0.076). The cumulative incidence of alcohol-related crashes and injuries was higher in the groups receiving bi-weekly contacts (Cumulative incidence=0.086) and educational counseling alone (0.087) than in controls, despite the fact that counseling alone was as effective as counseling with disulfiram in reducing DUI arrest recidivism.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Fleming-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fleming 2002</LINK> measured motor vehicle crashes for 48 months after administering a brief intervention to injured problem drinkers. Compared to a no-intervention group, the intervention group had fewer motor vehicles crashes resulting in fatal or non-fatal injuries or property damage (87/1568 person-years v. 105/1528 person-years, RR=0.81; 95% CI 0.61 to 1.06). Effects were greater on motor vehicle crashes with injuries (20/1568 person-years v. 33/1528, RR=0 .59; 95% CI 0.34 to 1.02) than on motor vehicle crashes with property damage only (67/1568 person-years v. 72/1528 person-years, RR=0.91; 95% CI 0.66 to 1.26).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-06-09 17:17:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Injury is a major public health problem worldwide, and alcohol is a significant contributor. The reduction of unintentional and intentional injuries due to problem drinking is, therefore, an important public health goal. Although these data are not conclusive, they do indicate that interventions for problem drinking may be effective in reducing injuries and injury deaths. In the thirteen trials that compared interventions for problem drinking to control interventions and provided outcome data, nearly all interventions showed a beneficial effect on injury-related outcomes. The estimated effect sizes were typically large, with reductions in alcohol- or drinking-related injuries ranging from 27% to 65%. Because the trial sample sizes were generally small, however (few of the trials having been designed to measure effects on injuries), the precision of most estimates was low. However, two recent studies were large enough to demonstrate statistically significant reductions in alcohol-related injuries (<LINK REF="STD-Longabaugh-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Longabaugh 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Monti-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Monti 1999</LINK>). The results indicate that interventions to reduce problem drinking have beneficial effects on the incidence of injuries, particularly alcohol-related injuries, and interventions could have an important effect on injury deaths.</P>
<P>Although reduced alcohol consumption would seem a likely mechanism for any beneficial effects of treatment on injuries, this review does not provide strong support for this mechanism. Among trials reporting beneficial effects on injuries or injury antecedents, five trials reported reduced alcohol consumption or increased abstinence (<LINK REF="STD-Reis-1982a" TYPE="STUDY">Reis 1982a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Reis-1982b" TYPE="STUDY">Reis 1982b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Barber-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Barber 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gentilello-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gentilello 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Fleming-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fleming 2002</LINK>), but four showed no effect on these outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Fitzgerald-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Fitzgerald 1985</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kuchipudi-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Kuchipudi 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Monti-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Monti 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Longabaugh-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Longabaugh 2001</LINK>). In two of four completed trials that compared different treatment modalities and provided data on injury outcomes, there were significantly greater declines in alcohol consumption with one therapeutic modality compared to the other(s) (<LINK REF="STD-Sitharthan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sitharthan 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Walsh-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 1991</LINK>). In both trials, however, the treatments that were associated with reduced injury risk were not the treatments associated with reductions in alcohol consumption. It is possible that these paradoxical results can be explained by chance, reflecting the nearly universally imprecise effect estimates, or by measurement error in the assessment of the drink- or injury-related outcomes. It is also possible that beneficial effects on injuries are mediated by other aspects of treatment for problem drinking (e.g. receipt of medical attention and social support).</P>
<P>Similarly, the evidence does not establish that reported reductions in unintentional injuries are due to decreases in driving while impaired by alcohol. Reis (<LINK REF="STD-Reis-1982a" TYPE="STUDY">Reis 1982a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reis-1982b" TYPE="STUDY">Reis 1982b</LINK>) found significant reductions in DUI recidivism rates in both of his trials, <LINK REF="STD-Gentilello-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gentilello 1999</LINK> et al reported reduced DUI violations, and <LINK REF="STD-Monti-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Monti 1999</LINK> et al reported reductions in self-reported drinking and driving. On the other hand, <LINK REF="STD-Landrum-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Landrum 1981</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Fleming-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fleming 2002</LINK> reported minimal or no effects on DUI incidence with intervention, and <LINK REF="STD-Kuchipudi-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Kuchipudi 1990</LINK> found an increase in DUI rates with intervention.</P>
<P>The availability of research examining brief clinical interventions for problem drinkers is increasing. In fact, all six trials identified during the May 2002 update evaluated such interventions. Five of the seven trials that evaluated brief interventions for problem drinking, and provided results, reported reductions in injury outcomes, but akin to trials identified for the original review, the mechanisms for these reductions are unclear. <LINK REF="STD-Gentilello-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gentilello 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Fleming-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fleming 2002</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Fleming-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Fleming 1999</LINK> found significant decreases in alcohol consumption; however, <LINK REF="STD-Fleming-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Fleming 1999</LINK> found no reduction in injury outcomes. Furthermore, the two trials that reported significant reductions in alcohol-related injury outcomes did not find reductions in alcohol consumption (<LINK REF="STD-Monti-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Monti 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Longabaugh-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Longabaugh 2001</LINK>), nor did <LINK REF="STD-Kuchipudi-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Kuchipudi 1990</LINK> et al find any effect on abstinence despite finding reductions in injury hospitalizations and deaths. Brief interventions also had mixed effects on hazardous drinking behavior associated with injury risk: <LINK REF="STD-Gentilello-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gentilello 1999</LINK> reported reduced DUI violations and Monti reported reductions in drinking and driving, but <LINK REF="STD-Fleming-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fleming 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kuchipudi-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Kuchipudi 1990</LINK> found no or adverse effects on DUI incidence with intervention. Recently a need for medical interventions for people with alcohol problems, particularly in emergency department settings, has been emphasized (<LINK REF="REF-Hungerford-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hungerford 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2004</LINK>). Increased research on emergency department interventions for problem drinkers should help to identify characteristics of effective interventions for different age, sex, and other populations, as well as the mechanisms for the beneficial effects of such treatment on injury outcomes.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2008-06-09 17:15:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>We limited our critique of the quality of the included studies to an assessment of the quality of allocation concealment because this appears to be the most important criterion for assessing the validity of a randomized trial (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). Unfortunately, we were able to determine this criterion accurately in only a small proportion of the trials reviewed. Few trials reported allocation concealment in detail, and among the others, very few researchers provided us with sufficient information to assess this criterion adequately. We cannot, therefore, draw firm conclusions about quality for most of the trials.</P>
<P>The aim of our systematic review was to make explicit the randomized evidence on what appears to be a promising approach to tackling the problem of alcohol-related injuries. A key finding of the review is that the trials that we found reported imprecise effect estimates, and often had methodological weaknesses, indicating that this promising approach requires further research. We considered the possibility of combining the available data from these trials in a meta-analysis to increase the precision of the effect estimates. However, for the most part, this would have involved combining markedly heterogeneous groups of participants, interventions, and outcomes. In such circumstances, a meta-analysis can produce inappropriate, and even misleading, conclusions (<LINK REF="REF-Bailar-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bailar 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Lancet-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lancet 1997</LINK>). We did attempt to quantitatively combine results from the seven trials of brief interventions. However, this was possible only for deaths, because the diversity of non-fatal injury outcomes measured (i.e. falls, motor vehicle crashes with injuries, self-reported injuries, accidents and injuries, injury-related visits to the ED, injuries treated by a doctor, injury-related hospitalizations) precluded meaningful combination.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2008-06-09 17:12:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Publication bias is an important threat to the validity of systematic reviews. Such bias may arise if outcome data are selectively omitted from published reports because the results fail to reach significance. To avoid the effects of this type of bias we wrote to the authors of all identified trials that met our first three inclusion criteria, asking them whether they collected any data on injuries or their antecedents, and to provide such data if available. Nine additional completed trials, long-term follow-up of another completed trial, and one trial still in progress, were identified by this approach. However, we were able to obtain unpublished injury-related data from only four of the completed trials. The difficulties involved in extracting unpublished data and other information for systematic reviews have been reported previously (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1997</LINK>). More than half of the authors of studies that met our first three inclusion criteria were deceased or untraceable or did not respond to our requests for information. While it is likely that some did not respond because they did not measure injury outcomes, the inability to identify all unpublished data might have biased our results.</P>

<P>Previous reviews have shown that interventions for problem drinking can reduce alcohol consumption (<LINK REF="REF-Freemantle-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freemantle 1993</LINK>) and driving under the influence of alcohol (<LINK REF="REF-Wells_x002d_Parker-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wells-Parker 1995</LINK>). This review indicates that interventions for problem drinking are likely to reduce the incidence of injuries and their antecedents, but current data are insufficient to draw firm conclusions, particularly in terms of effects on violent injuries. Because injuries account for a large proportion of the morbidity and mortality due to problem drinking, further studies are warranted to evaluate the effect that treating problem drinking may have on injuries and to investigate how any beneficial effects on injuries are mediated.</P>
