This involved changes to the outcomes and the risk of bias domains. This resulted in changes in the findings and conclusions of the review.</P>
<P>The intervention 'primary closure with a biliary stent' was considered to be very different from 'primary closure without a biliary stent'. Hence the intervention 'primary closure with biliary stent' was excluded from the review. 'Primary closure with a biliary stent' should be considered in a separate review. The current team of authors do not plan to conduct a review on 'Primary closure with a biliary stent'.</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-05-21 17:01:09 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi Selvan Gurusamy">
<P>The liver has various functions. Production of bile is one of these functions. Bile is necessary for digestion of fat and removal of certain waste byproducts from the liver. The bile produced in the liver is stored temporarily in the gallbladder. On eating fatty food, the gallbladder releases the bile into the small bowel. The common bile duct is the tube through which bile flows from the liver to the gallbladder, and from there to the small bowel. Stones can obstruct the flow of bile from the gallbladder into the small bowel. Usually such stones are formed in the gallbladder and migrate into the common bile duct. Obstruction of the flow of bile can lead to jaundice. Such stones are usually removed using an endoscope (by introducing an instrument equipped with a camera through the mouth and into the small intestine) before keyhole removal of gallstones (laparoscopic cholecystectomy) or as a part of the keyhole removal of gallstones (laparoscopic common bile duct exploration). Laparoscopic common bile duct exploration can only be performed in highly specialised centres and so endoscopic removal of common bile duct stones is the commonly used method to treat stones in the common bile duct. However, when such endoscopic treatment fails the patient has to be subjected to open common bile duct exploration. This involves exploring the common bile duct using instruments or a camera, or both, which are introduced into the common bile duct usually through a cut in the common bile duct. After the stones are removed, the hole in the common bile duct has to be stitched. Traditionally, surgeons have used a T-tube through the cut in the common bile duct. The T-tube is shaped like the English letter 'T' as the name indicates. The top part of the letter 'T' is inside the common bile duct while the long bottom part of the letter 'T' is brought out of the tummy through a small cut and is connected to a bag. This tube is inserted with the intention of preventing the build-up of bile in the common bile duct due to temporary swelling, which is common after any cut in any part of the body. The build-up of bile along with the swelling can potentially prevent healing of the bile duct resulting in leakage of bile from the common bile duct into the tummy. Uncontrolled bile leak into the abdominal cavity can be life-threatening if this is not recognised and treated appropriately. In addition to acting as a drain, draining the bile from the common bile duct to the exterior, dye can be injected into the T-tube and an X-ray used to demonstrate any residual stones. Once the absence of residual stones is confirmed, the T-tube is removed. However, surgeons are concerned about the tiny hole which the T-tube leaves on removal. This tiny hole in the common bile duct normally heals without a trace, but in some patients bile can leak through the hole and cause the very problem that the T-tube was meant to prevent. Thus the use of a T-tube after open common bile duct exploration is a controversial issue. We attempted to answer the question whether primary closure (stitching the cut in the bile duct without a T-tube) is better than using a T-tube after open exploration of the common bile duct by reviewing all the available information in the literature from randomised clinical trials. Randomised clinical trials are special types of clinical studies which provide the most valid answers if performed correctly.</P>
<P>We identified a total of six trials including 359 participants of whom 178 had primary closure and 181 patients had T-tube drainage after open exploration of the common bile duct. All six trials were at high risk of bias (risk of overestimating the benefits and underestimating the harms of the intervention or the control). There was no significant difference in mortality (12 deaths per 1000 participants in the T-tube drainage group versus 6 deaths per 1000 participants in the primary closure group) or in the serious complication rate after surgery between the two groups (approximately 145 complications per 1000 participants in the T-tube drainage group versus 66 complications per 1000 participants in the primary closure group). Although the number of deaths and complication rates in the primary closure group appeared to be less than half those in the T-tube group, there is a possibility that this was not a true observation but rather a difference that occurred by chance (similar to there being one chance in eight of flipping a coin and having it come up heads or tails three times in a row). For this reason we cannot be sufficiently confident that a true effect exists, and we term such a difference as not being statistically significant. None of the trials reported quality of life or the time taken for patients to return to work. The average operating time was significantly longer in the T-tube drainage group than in the primary closure group (by about 30 minutes). The average hospital stay was significantly longer in the T-tube group than in the primary closure group (by about five days). Use of a T-tube appears to increase the cost without providing any benefit to the patients. Further randomised trials with low risk of bias (low chance of arriving at the wrong conclusions because of prejudice by healthcare providers, researchers, or patients) and low risk of random errors (arriving at wrong conclusions because of chance) are necessary to confirm whether the use of T-tubes is justified anymore. Until the results from such trials are available, we discourage the routine use of T-tube after open common bile duct exploration.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-05-21 17:00:28 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi Selvan Gurusamy">
<P>We included six trials randomising 359 participants, 178 to T-tube drainage and 181 to primary closure. All trials were at high risk of bias. There was no significant difference in mortality between the two groups (4/178 (weighted percentage 1.2%) in the T-tube group versus 1/181 (0.6%) in the primary closure group; RR 2.25; 95% CI 0.55 to 9.25; six trials). There was no significant difference in the serious morbidity rate between the two groups (24/136 (weighted serious morbidity rate, 145 events per 1000 patients) in the T-tube group versus 9/136 (weighted serious morbidity rate, 66 events per 1000 patients) in the primary closure group; RaR 2.19; 95% CI 0.98 to 4.91; four trials). Quality of life and return to work were not reported in any of the trials. The operating time was significantly longer in the T-tube drainage group compared with the primary closure group (MD 28.90 minutes; 95% CI 17.18 to 40.62 minutes; one trial). The hospital stay was significantly longer in the T-tube drainage group compared with the primary closure group (MD 4.72 days; 95% CI 0.83 days to 8.60 days; five trials).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-05-21 17:00:49 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi Selvan Gurusamy">
<P>T-tube drainage appeared to result in significantly longer operating time and hospital stay compared with primary closure without any apparent evidence of benefit on clinically important outcomes after open common bile duct exploration. Based on the currently available evidence, there is no justification for the routine use of T-tube drainage after open common bile duct exploration in patients with common bile duct stones. T-tube drainage should not be used outside well designed randomised clinical trials. More randomised trials comparing the effects of T-tube drainage versus primary closure after open common bile duct exploration may be needed. Such trials should be conducted with low risk of bias and assessing the long-term beneficial and harmful effects of T-tube drainage, including long-term complications such as bile stricture and recurrence of common bile duct stones.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-05-26 07:37:50 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi Selvan Gurusamy">
<P>About 5% to 25% of the adult western population have gallstones (<LINK REF="REF-GREPCO-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">GREPCO 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-GREPCO-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">GREPCO 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bates-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bates 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Halldestam-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halldestam 2004</LINK>). The annual incidence of gallstones is about 1 in 200 people (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 1992</LINK>). Only 2% to 4% of people with gallstones become symptomatic with biliary colic (pain), acute cholecystitis (inflammation), obstructive jaundice, or gallstone pancreatitis in a year (<LINK REF="REF-Attili-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Attili 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Halldestam-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halldestam 2004</LINK>). Cholecystectomy (removal of gallstones) is the preferred option in the treatment of symptomatic gallstones (<LINK REF="REF-Strasberg-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strasberg 1993</LINK>) and every year 1.5 million cholecystectomies are performed in the United States and 60,000 in the United Kingdom (<LINK REF="REF-Dolan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dolan 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-HES-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">HES 2011</LINK>). Approximately 80% of cholecystectomies are performed laparoscopically (keyhole) (<LINK REF="REF-Ballal-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballal 2009</LINK>). The reported proportion of patients with common bile duct (CBD) stones at the time of cholecystectomy varies between 5% (<LINK REF="REF-Kama-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kama 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hemli-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hemli 2004</LINK>) and 11% (<LINK REF="REF-Pitluk-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pitluk 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Duensing-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duensing 2000</LINK>). Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is currently preferred over open cholecystectomy for elective cholecystectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Livingston-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Livingston 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ballal-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballal 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Keus-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keus 2010</LINK>). Although laparoscopic common bile duct exploration can be performed successfully in the majority of the patients (<LINK REF="REF-Hemli-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hemli 2004</LINK>), choledocholithiasis is one of the important causes of conversion to an open procedure (<LINK REF="REF-Bingener_x002d_Casey-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bingener-Casey 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Livingston-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Livingston 2004</LINK>). Endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP) has decreased the indications for common bile duct exploration (<LINK REF="STD-Williams-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1994</LINK>), but open common bile duct exploration is still an important procedure if ERCP fails or where expertise for laparoscopic exploration of the common bile duct is not available.</P>
<P>After the common bile duct exploration is performed and the stones removed, the choice is made between primary duct closure and T-tube drainage (<LINK REF="STD-Lygidakis-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Lygidakis 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Payne-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Payne 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1994</LINK>). Recently, biliary stent insertion has also been used as an alternative to T-tube drainage (<LINK REF="REF-Isla-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Isla 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kim-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Griniatsos-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griniatsos 2005</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>The authors assessed the risk of bias in the trials independently, without masking of the trial names and following the instructions in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) and the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Module (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2013</LINK>). Due to the risk of overestimation of intervention effects in randomised trials with high risk of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wood-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lundh-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lundh 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Savovic-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Savovic 2012</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Savovic-2012a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Savovic 2012a</LINK>), we assessed the influence of risk of bias on the trial results using the following domains.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Allocation sequence generation</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk of bias: sequence generation was achieved using computer random number generation or a random number table. Drawing lots, tossing a coin, shuffling cards, and throwing dice are adequate if performed by an independent adjudicator.</LI>
<LI>Uncertain risk of bias: the trial was described as randomised, but the method of sequence generation was not specified.</LI>
<LI>High risk of bias: the sequence generation method was not, or might not be, random. Quasi-randomised studies, those using dates, names, or admittance numbers in order to allocate patients, were inadequate and were excluded for the assessment of benefits but not for assessing harms.</LI>

<LI>Low risk of bias: allocation was controlled by a central and independent randomisation unit, sequentially numbered opaque and sealed envelopes, or similar, so that intervention allocations could not have been foreseen in advance of, or during, enrolment.</LI>
<LI>Uncertain risk of bias: the trial was described as randomised, but the method used to conceal the allocation was not described so that intervention allocations might have been foreseen in advance of, or during, enrolment.</LI>
<LI>High risk of bias: if the allocation sequence was known to the investigators who assigned participants, or if the study was quasi-randomised. Quasi-randomised studies were excluded for the assessment of benefits but not for assessing harms.</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Incomplete outcome data</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk of bias: the underlying reasons for missing data were unlikely to make treatment effects depart from plausible values, or proper methods had been employed to handle missing data.</LI>
<LI>Uncertain risk of bias: there was insufficient information to assess whether the missing data mechanism in combination with the method used to handle missing data were likely to induce bias on the estimate of effect.</LI>
<LI>High risk of bias: the crude estimate of effects (eg, complete case estimate) were clearly biased due to the underlying reasons for missing data, and the methods used to handle missing data were unsatisfactory.</LI>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Selective outcome reporting</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk of bias: pre-defined or clinically relevant and reasonably expected outcomes were reported on.</LI>
<LI>Uncertain risk of bias: not all pre-defined or clinically relevant and reasonably expected outcomes were reported on, or were not reported fully, or it was unclear whether data on these outcomes were recorded or not.</LI>
<LI>High risk of bias: one or more clinically relevant and reasonably expected outcomes were not reported on; data on these outcomes were likely to have been recorded.</LI>

</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Statistical methods</HEADING>
<P>We performed the meta-analyses according to the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) and the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Module<I> </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2013</LINK>). We used the software package Review Manager 5 for statistical analyses (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2012</LINK>). For dichotomous variables, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) if there were two or more trials for an outcome. For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean difference (MD) and the standardised mean difference (SMD) if different assessment scales were used, with 95% confidence intervals. For count data outcomes such as serious adverse events, the rate ratio was calculated using the methods shown in section 9.4.8 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). For such a calculation, one needs the time over which the patients were exposed to the risk of serious morbidity in each of the groups. We considered that both groups were exposed to the risk of serious morbidity for the same time period, which is a reasonable assumption considering that the patients were followed up for the same time in both groups.</P>
<P>We used a random-effects model (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>) and a fixed-effect model (<LINK REF="REF-DeMets-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeMets 1987</LINK>) for meta-analysis in the presence of two or more trials included in the outcomes. In the case of a discrepancy between the two models, we reported both results; otherwise we reported the results of the fixed-effect model. Heterogeneity was explored by a Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test with significance set at P &lt; 0.10, and the quantity of heterogeneity was measured by the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>The analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis (<LINK REF="REF-Newell-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newell 1992</LINK>) whenever possible. Otherwise we adopted the 'available-patient analysis' (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We did not impute any data for post-randomisation dropouts for any of the continuous outcomes. In the absence of summary information such as means and standard deviations for continuous outcomes, we used the median for the meta-analysis and imputed the standard deviation from P values according to the instructions given in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Intervention</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) (See Sensitivity analysis below). If it was not possible to calculate the standard deviation from the P value or the confidence interval, we imputed the standard deviation as the highest standard deviation in the other trials included under that outcome, fully recognising that this form of imputation would decrease the weight of the study for the calculation of mean differences and bias the effect estimate to no effect in the case of standardised mean differences (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Trial sequential analysis</HEADING>
<P>Trial sequential analysis (TSA) was applied because cumulative meta-analyses are at risk of producing random errors due to sparse data and repetitive testing of the accumulated data (<A HREF="http://www.ctu.dk/tsa">www.ctu.dk/tsa</A>). To minimise random errors, we calculated the required information size (that is, the number of participants needed in a meta-analysis to detect or reject a certain intervention effect). The required information size calculation should also account for the heterogeneity or diversity present in the meta-analysis. The underlying assumption of trial sequential analysis is that testing for significance may be performed each time a new trial is added to the meta-analysis. We added the trials according to the year of publication, and if more than one trial was published in a year the trials were added alphabetically according to the last name of the first author. On the basis of the required information size, trial sequential monitoring boundaries were constructed. These boundaries determine the statistical inference one may draw regarding the cumulative meta-analysis that has not reached the required information size; if the trial sequential monitoring boundary is crossed before the required information size is reached, firm evidence may perhaps be established and further trials may turn out to be superfluous. On the other hand, if the boundary is not surpassed it is most probably necessary to continue doing trials in order to detect or reject a certain intervention effect.   </P>
<P>We performed trial sequential analysis (<LINK REF="REF-CTU-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">CTU 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thorlund-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorlund 2011</LINK>) for binary outcomes and continuous outcomes in which at least two trials were present to determine if further trials were necessary for the outcome. We performed trial sequential analysis using an alpha error of 5%, beta error of 20%, control event proportion obtained from the results, and a relative risk reduction of 20% for binary outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Brok-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wetterslev-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wetterslev 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brok-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thorlund-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorlund 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wetterslev-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wetterslev 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thorlund-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorlund 2010</LINK>). For continuous outcomes, we conducted trial sequential analysis using an alpha error of 5%, beta error of 20%, the variance of the included trials, and a minimal clinically important difference of one day for hospital stay.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Reporting bias</HEADING>
<P>We planned to use a funnel plot to explore reporting bias (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Macaskill-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macaskill 2001</LINK>) in the presence of at least 10 trials. We planned to use asymmetry in the funnel plot of study size against treatment effect to identify bias. We also planned to perform the linear regression approach described by Egger (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>) to determine the funnel plot asymmetry.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analysis</HEADING>

<UL>
<LI>Trials at low risk of bias compared to those at high risk of bias.</LI>
<LI>Trials in which routine antibiotic prophylaxis was used compared to those in which routine antibiotic prophylaxis was not used.</LI>
<LI>Trials in which patients underwent open common bile duct exploration in the presence of acute cholecystitis compared to those in which patients underwent open common bile duct exploration in the absence of acute cholecystitis.</LI>
</UL>
<P>We planned to use the test for subgroup differences available through RevMan.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analysis</HEADING>
<P>We planned to perform a sensitivity analysis by imputing the outcomes for binary outcomes under different scenarios, namely best-best analysis, worst-worst analysis, best-worst analysis, and worst-best analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Gurusamy-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurusamy 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2013</LINK>) for any significant binary outcomes. We also performed a sensitivity analysis by excluding the trials in which the median or standard deviation was imputed for the continuous outcomes. Both these sensitivity analyses were planned a priori (<LINK REF="REF-Gurusamy-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurusamy 2007</LINK>). We also performed post hoc sensitivity analyses by considering the complications for which the severity could not be determined as 'mild' complications (best-best scenario) and then we considered these 'mild' complications as severe complications (worst-worst scenario). For example, bile leaks are post-operative complications some of which resolve spontaneously without any prolongation of hospital stay, and hence were categorised as 'mild' adverse events. Other bile leaks need radiological or endoscopic interventions and hence were classified as 'serious' adverse events. If the trial authors did not report the way the bile leaks were treated, it was not possible to determine their severity. So we performed two analyses: one excluding the bile leaks which resolved spontaneously and those for which the treatment was not reported, and another analysis including the bile leaks for which the treatment was not reported.</P>

No subgroup analysis was performed for the outcome 'morbidity (severity unknown)' as this was not one of the outcomes chosen a priori. The Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test for subgroup differences was not significant for the subgroup analysis of peri-operative mortality or serious morbidity (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). However, it should be noted that the rate of serious morbidity was higher in the T-tube group than the primary closure group in the subgroup of trials in which antibiotic prophylaxis was used (rate ratio 3.26; 95% CI 1.21 to 8.79; P = 0.02; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 9%). The Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test for subgroup differences was significant for hospital stay, by both the fixed-effect model and random-effects model (P &lt; 0.00001 for fixed-effect model, P &lt; 0.007 for random-effects model) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>). The hospital stay was significantly longer in the T-tube group than the primary closure group in the subgroup of trials in which routine prophylaxis was used. In the subgroup of trials in which antibiotics were used selectively and in which antibiotic use was not reported, there were no significant differences between the two groups and the mean effect estimate was to either side of the line of no effect; the trial in which an antibiotic was used selectively favoured the T-tube group and the trial in which the antibiotic use was not reported favoured the primary closure group (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-05-26 07:37:54 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi Selvan Gurusamy">
<P>This review has shown that T-tube drainage after open choledochotomy appeared to increase the operating time and hospital stay compared to primary closure, without any evidence of difference in serious complications. One of the reasons for considering the use of T-tube drainage is to decompress the common bile duct in the presence of distal obstruction of the common bile duct (<LINK REF="STD-Williams-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1994</LINK>). This is to avoid bile leak and bile peritonitis. One patient in the primary closure group developed biliary peritonitis (treatment not stated) (<LINK REF="STD-Makinen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Makinen 1989</LINK>). None of the other patients in the primary closure group developed biliary peritonitis or bile leak requiring re-operation or other interventions. On the other hand, four patients developed bile leak or biliary peritonitis in the T-tube group after removal; one requiring a re-operation and three requiring percutaneous drainage (<LINK REF="STD-Williams-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marwah-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Marwah 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ambreen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Ambreen 2009</LINK>). One patient developed peritubal leakage and died of necrotizing fascitis (<LINK REF="STD-Marwah-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Marwah 2004</LINK>). Another patient required laparotomy and repositioning of the T-tube for biliary peritonitis following T-tube dislodgement (<LINK REF="STD-Payne-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Payne 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>Another reason for considering the use of T-tube drainage is to allow the possibility of extracting residual stones through the T-tube tract (<LINK REF="STD-Williams-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1994</LINK>). However, no retained stones were detected after operative choledochoscopy (<LINK REF="REF-Menzies-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Menzies 1992</LINK>). Even if patients develop symptomatic retained stones, ERCP and endoscopic sphincterotomy can be used for the treatment. Before the advent of ERCP, percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage and open exploration were the only options available for the treatment of such patients. So, T-tube drainage and extraction of stones may have been appropriate in the past while it has become redundant with the currently available treatments.</P>
<P>The definitions used for serious morbidity in this review were those used by The International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) and are used by regulatory authorities such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), and Japan Society of Quality Assurance (JSQA) in the US, Europe, and Japan respectively (<LINK REF="REF-ICH_x002d_GCP-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICH-GCP 1997</LINK>) in determining the adverse events related to a pharmacological intervention. While it is not mandatory to report surgical interventions using these definitions, we have used these definitions in the absence of any other universal definitions for complications. Serious adverse events of the ICH-GCP classification roughly correspond to grade III or grade IV complications in the Clavien-Dindo classification (<LINK REF="REF-Dindo-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dindo 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clavien-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clavien 2009</LINK>), the only validated classification systems for assessing surgical interventions. Inevitably, some information will be lost by using such classifications, which pool complications together. However, unless such an approach is followed it is difficult to power trials related to surgery using any meaningful outcomes to the patients. There was no significant difference in the rates of serious morbidity between the two intervention groups. A subgroup analysis of patients included in the trials in which antibiotic prophylaxis was used revealed that the T-tube group may have significantly higher morbidity rates than the primary closure group.</P>
<P>The post-operative hospital stay was significantly longer in the T-tube group than the primary closure group. There was significant heterogeneity in the results. Only one of the six trials reported a shorter post-operative hospital stay in the T-tube group than the primary closure group (not statistically significant) (<LINK REF="STD-Makinen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Makinen 1989</LINK>). In this trial, antibiotics were used only in patients with acute cholecystitis. There is some evidence that antibiotics are useful in open elective biliary tract surgery (including cholecystectomies and other operations on the bile duct) although this evidence is not recent and the evidence is generally poor (<LINK REF="REF-Meijer-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meijer 1990</LINK>). Clinical practice guidelines generally advocate antibiotic prophylaxis after biliary tract surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Mangram-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mangram 1999</LINK>). Although further investigation is necessary on this front, the selective use of antibiotics only in patients with acute cholecystitis may be a potential reason for the differences in the results noted in this trial (<LINK REF="STD-Makinen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Makinen 1989</LINK>). The evidence from the other four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Payne-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Payne 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marwah-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Marwah 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ambreen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Ambreen 2009</LINK>) cannot be ignored because of the information from this one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Makinen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Makinen 1989</LINK>) when a potential reason for the difference exists.</P>
<P>The reason for the longer hospital stay in the T-tube group is not clear. The reports did not state whether the patients stayed in the hospital until maturation of the tract and removal of the T-tube. The mean and the standard deviation of the hospital stay were reported in four of the five trials that reported hospital stay (<LINK REF="STD-Payne-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Payne 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Makinen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Makinen 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marwah-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Marwah 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ambreen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Ambreen 2009</LINK>). The standard deviation suggests that at least some of the patients in these four trials were discharged from hospital before the T-tube was removed. This suggests that the patients did not wait in the hospital till the T-tube was removed. One other potential reason for the longer hospital stay in the T-tube group is serious morbidity. While there was no significant difference in the serious morbidity rates between the two intervention groups, this may be due to lack of evidence of effect rather than lack of effect. In the absence of any other explanation for the prolonged post-operative hospital stay, one has to conclude that the longer hospital stay in the T-tube group than in the primary closure group is likely due to higher morbidity.</P>
<P>A longer hospital stay is detrimental to both the patient (particularly in a private healthcare funding set-up) and the healthcare provider (particularly in a state-funded or insurance company funded healthcare funding set-up). In addition to the longer hospital stay, the other costs in the T-tube group include the cost of the T-tube, increased operating time (although reported in only trial, T-tube group is likely to result in a longer operating time than primary closure since T-tube drainage involves additional surgical steps), the cost of a T-tube cholangiogram, and the cost of removal of the T-tube. Unless these costs can be offset by decreased complications, the costs associated with the use of a T-tube cannot be justified. With five of the six trials showing increased morbidity rates in the T-tube group compared with the primary closure group (not statistically significant), there appears to be little justification in the use of a T-tube after open common bile duct exploration.</P>
<P>It appears that the T-tube has a significant potential to harm the patients and increase the costs for the healthcare funder without any notable benefit based on the information obtained from the trials included in this review. There is additional corroborative information. We identified five non-randomised studies comparing T-tube to primary closure following common bile duct exploration (<LINK REF="STD-De-Roover-1989" TYPE="STUDY">De Roover 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sheen-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Sheen 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sorensen-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sorensen 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xu-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Joshi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Joshi 2010</LINK>) from the search strategy. All these studies reported complications related to T-tube drainage such as biliary peritonitis (0/11 (0%) (<LINK REF="STD-De-Roover-1989" TYPE="STUDY">De Roover 1989</LINK>); 0/15 (0%) (<LINK REF="STD-Sheen-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Sheen 1990</LINK>); 0/17 (0%) (<LINK REF="STD-Sorensen-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sorensen 1994</LINK>); 4/171 (2.3%) (<LINK REF="STD-Xu-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 2002</LINK>); 1/16 (6.3%) (<LINK REF="STD-Piecuch-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Piecuch 2004</LINK>); and 4/31(12.9%) (<LINK REF="STD-Joshi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Joshi 2010</LINK>)), biliary pancreatitis (2/17 (11.8%) (<LINK REF="STD-Sorensen-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sorensen 1994</LINK>); 1/16 (6.3%) (<LINK REF="STD-Piecuch-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Piecuch 2004</LINK>)), and dislodgement of the T-tube (3/31 (9.7%)) (<LINK REF="STD-Joshi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Joshi 2010</LINK>). In contrast, in the primary closure group none of the patients had biliary peritonitis (0/11 (0%) (<LINK REF="STD-De-Roover-1989" TYPE="STUDY">De Roover 1989</LINK>); 0/15 (0%) (<LINK REF="STD-Sheen-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Sheen 1990</LINK>); 0/10 (0%) (<LINK REF="STD-Sorensen-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sorensen 1994</LINK>); 0/215 (0%) (<LINK REF="STD-Xu-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 2002</LINK>); 0/36 (0%) (<LINK REF="STD-Piecuch-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Piecuch 2004</LINK>); 0/40 (0%) (<LINK REF="STD-Joshi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Joshi 2010</LINK>)) or biliary pancreatitis (0/10 (0%)) (<LINK REF="STD-Sorensen-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sorensen 1994</LINK>). In addition, in another Cochrane review, which included 295 patients from three trials, we found that T-tube drainage had a longer operating time and longer post-operative hospital stay than primary closure of the common bile duct without stent in laparoscopic common bile duct exploration, without significantly affecting the serious morbidity rates (<LINK REF="REF-Gurusamy-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurusamy 2013</LINK>). In that Cochrane review of primary closure versus T-tube closure in patients undergoing laparoscopic common bile duct exploration, fewer patients developed biliary complications requiring intervention after primary closure (not statistically significant) (<LINK REF="REF-Gurusamy-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurusamy 2013</LINK>), as in the case of this review. The purpose of T-tube drainage is the same whether the patients undergo open or laparoscopic common bile duct exploration. Thus, there is corroborative evidence that supports the findings of the present review.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-05-21 17:04:05 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi Selvan Gurusamy">
<P>The results of this review are applicable only in patients undergoing open common bile duct exploration. The advent of ERCP has decreased the indications for open common bile duct exploration (<LINK REF="STD-Williams-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1994</LINK>). However, open common bile duct exploration is indicated in failed ERCP in places where expertise is not available for laparoscopic exploration of the common bile duct. Williams et al (<LINK REF="STD-Williams-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1994</LINK>) specifically mention inclusion of six patients with failed ERCP. This trial also found primary closure to be safe. Thus, failed ERCP need not be a contra-indication for primary closure provided that there is no outflow obstruction. However, further trials are necessary. None of the trials mentioned whether ampullary dilatation was performed as a part of surgery. However, three trials specifically mentioned that they excluded patients with outflow obstruction from their trial (<LINK REF="STD-Makinen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Makinen 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marwah-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Marwah 2004</LINK>). One trial mentioned that bile flow into the duodenum was confirmed by flushing the common bile duct (<LINK REF="STD-Ambreen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Ambreen 2009</LINK>). Choledochoscopy or a cholangiogram that confirms the absence of bile duct outflow obstruction is a pre-requisite for primary closure.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-05-21 17:04:12 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi Selvan Gurusamy">
<P>Although the risk of bias in the included trials was high and the overall quality of evidence was very low, one has to put this into perspective. This is currently the best available evidence. The previous routine use of T-tube was based on clinical opinion and the fact that a significant proportion of the patients had to undergo major re-operations in the case where stones were left in the bile duct. The advent of ERCP appears to have made the use of T-tubes redundant. However, one cannot be completely dogmatic and conclude that there is no need for further research on this topic. The trials were at high risk of bias (for example, outcomes such as hospital stay and return to work can be biased because of lack of blinding and absence of any criteria for discharge from hospital or return to work, and a surgeon favouring primary closure might have discharged the patient from hospital earlier or may have advised the patient that he or she can return to work earlier) and new trials are necessary for this comparison as shown by the trial sequential analyses. Until such new trials with low risks of bias show that T-tube use is safe and effective, the use of T-tubes after open common bile duct exploration should be confined to randomised clinical trials. Such randomised trials should include quality of life and return to work as these outcomes are useful to determine whether a T-tube is beneficial to the patient and whether it is cost-effective.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-05-21 17:04:19 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi Selvan Gurusamy">
<P>We have followed the Cochrane methodology for performing the review. One potential bias was that we imputed the mean and standard deviation from median and other measures such as the P value or inter-quartile range. This may have introduced an error in the effect estimate. The sensitivity analysis by excluding the trials in which the imputation was performed did not change the results. The alternative to this imputation is to present the information as presented by the authors, but the interpretation of that information can be even more confusing.</P>

<B>Trial sequential analysis of mortality </B>
<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was calculated to 140,645 patients, based on the proportion of patients in the control group with the outcome of 0.5%, a relative risk reduction of 20%, an alpha of 5%, a beta of 20%, and a diversity of 0%. After accruing 359 patients in the six trials, only 0.26% of the DARIS has been reached. Accordingly, the trial sequential analysis does not show the required information size and the trial sequential monitoring boundaries. As shown, the conventional boundaries have also not been crossed.</P>

<B>Trial sequential analysis of duration of hospital stay</B>
<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was 20,538 patients, based on a minimal relevant difference (MIRD) of one day, a variance (VAR) of 25.59, an alpha (a) of 5%, a beta (b) of 20%, and a diversity (D<SUP>2</SUP>) of 96.09%. After accruing 333 patients in the five trials, only 1.62% of the DARIS has been reached. Accordingly, the trial sequential analysis does not show the required information size and the trial sequential monitoring boundaries. As shown, the conventional boundary has been crossed for longer stay favouring primary closure.</P>
