<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-11-03 15:42:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Amblyopia, commonly known as &#8220;lazy eye&#8221;, is the term used to describe a type of reduced vision that develops in childhood. Amblyopia is relatively common, affecting approximately 2% of children. If treated while the visual system is still maturing amblyopia can usually be reversed and normal vision restored. In most cases amblyopia only affects one eye so even quite severe amblyopia may go unnoticed by parents or caregivers. Screening programmes have, therefore, been set up to test children&#8217;s vision, in each eye separately, in order to detect the condition while the child is young and treatment is still possible. This review was designed to examine the evidence to see if such screening programmes are effective in reducing the prevalence of untreated amblyopia. The review found that there is currently not enough evidence to determine whether or not screening programmes reduce the proportion of older children and adults with amblyopia. The authors concluded that there is, therefore, a need for some robust evaluation of the screening programmes that are in place to see if they are truly effective or not. Any such evaluation would have to also look at how much screening programmes cost and what effect untreated amblyopia has on quality of life.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Amblyopia is a reversible deficit of vision that has to be treated within the sensitive period for visual development. Screening programmes have been set up to detect this largely asymptomatic condition and refer children for treatment while an improvement in vision is still possible. The value of such programmes and the optimum protocol for administering them remain controversial.</P>

<P>The lack of data from randomised controlled trials makes it difficult to analyse the impact of existing screening programmes on the prevalence of amblyopia. The absence of such evidence cannot be taken to mean that vision screening is not beneficial; simply that this intervention has not yet been tested in robust trials. To facilitate such trials normative data on age-appropriate vision tests need to be available and a consensus reached regarding the definition of amblyopia. In addition, the consequences of living with untreated amblyopia have yet to be quantified and a cost-benefit analysis carried out. </P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Introduction</HEADING>
<P>Amblyopia (lazy eye) can be defined as a reduction in vision with no demonstrable abnormality of the visual pathway that is not immediately resolved by refractive correction. It develops during maturation of the visual pathway and is reversible during the first seven to eight years of life. This is known as the 'critical period'. In some situations the critical period may be extended (<LINK REF="REF-Simmers-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simmers 1999</LINK>). The developing visual system relies on good quality visual images. Amblyopia can develop when the image coming into one or both eyes is either blurred or obscured. It develops through an abnormal binocular cortical interaction and results in a loss of acuity, contrast sensitivity, and/or positional disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Levi-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levi 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Amblyopia is usually classified by cause:<BR/>(1) strabismic when it is due to the presence of a squint;<BR/>(2) anisometropic where the refractive error is significantly greater for one eye than the other (a difference of more than or equal to 0.75 dioptre is generally thought to be significant);<BR/>(3) meridional where there is a significant degree of astigmatism (more than or equal to 1.00 dioptre) ;<BR/>(4) stimulus deprivation where, for example, a cataract or ptosis (droopy lid) obscures the visual axis;<BR/>(5) ametropic where the refractive error is such that neither eye receives a good quality image.</P>
<P>It is not uncommon for the types to co-exist.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Epidemiology</HEADING>
<P>Amblyopia is a common cause of reduced visual acuity. Estimates of the prevalence of amblyopia vary between 2% and 5%. Factors that contribute to the range of estimates include the population studied and the definition of amblyopia applied. It is, however, widely accepted that in the general population the incidence is between 2% and 2.5% (<LINK REF="REF-von-Noorden-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">von Noorden 1996</LINK>). For the purposes of this review, in order to be able to include as many trials as possible, amblyopia was defined as visual acuity of worse than 6/9 Snellen or 0.2 LogMAR in the affected eye or eyes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Screening</HEADING>
<P>Untreated amblyopia can have a negative impact in adult life. Some career choices have specific visual acuity requirements. The number of careers barred to adults with reduced vision increases with the severity of the deficit (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 1999</LINK>) and a national surveillance study in 2002 in the UK found that only 35% (36/102) of people who lost the vision in their non-amblyopic were able to continue in paid employment (<LINK REF="REF-Rahi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rahi 2002</LINK>). A minimum lifetime risk of 1.2% of serious visual impairment through loss of acuity in the eye with the better vision, for example from trauma, age-related retinal changes (ARMD) and circulation problems (retinal vein and artery occlusions etc.) has been estimated (<LINK REF="REF-Rahi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rahi 2002</LINK>). Screening programmes have therefore been introduced to detect amblyopia during the assumed critical period while treatment is possible.</P>
<P>Vision screening programmes for amblyopia rely on the reduced visual acuity associated with the condition as a marker for the disease. Any screening programme aiming to detect amblyopia this way will, inevitably, also pick up children with other causes of reduced vision, for example uncorrected refractive error.</P>
<P>Currently there are a variety of recommendations for vision screening programmes and a number of different approaches to providing the service. Protocols vary not only from country to country but within countries. The battery of tests carried out usually includes monocular visual acuity testing with an age-appropriate test, plus or minus assessment of extra-ocular muscle function, binocular status, and colour vision assessment. Protocols vary with regard to the vision and binocular function test used, threshold for referral, and age at which children are screened. The type of personnel carrying out the testing varies, for example doctors, nurses, orthoptists, as does the setting. Some screening programmes are conducted in a community setting. This type of programme allows early screening to take place but makes achieving a high coverage rate more difficult. They may have unacceptably high false positive and recall rates because the participants are too young to co-operate with testing. To overcome this some programmes are set up to screen children during their first year at school. Whilst this should improve the percentage reached by screening and decrease the number of false positives it is possible that later treatment of any detected amblyopia may not have such good outcomes.</P>
<P>Most screening programmes for amblyopia are to be found in the developed world and urban areas of the developing world. They can be part of the government health care system or private, commercially driven schemes.</P>
<P>Screening has a role not only in detection of the target condition but also in improving equity of access to care. This review considered screening programmes for children with amblyopia. Studies that included screening for refractive error, for example photorefraction studies and fundus screening programmes, have not been included in this review. Vision screening for myopia in schools is considered in another review (<LINK REF="REF-Powell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powell 2004</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Presentation and diagnosis</HEADING>
<P>Some types of amblyopia present because they are associated with signs, for example strabismus or ptosis. However, 'straight-eyed' (anisometropic) amblyopia may not be noticed by the parent or the child as it commonly affects only one eye and has no visible signs. Affected children are therefore detected as a result of vision screening programmes.</P>
<P>There are four main steps in the diagnosis of amblyopia:<BR/>1. monocular visual acuity assessment using an age-appropriate vision test;<BR/>2. refraction. Although autorefraction is relatively quick and easy to perform, retinoscopy is recommended. In young children a topical drug such as cyclopentolate hydrochloride is required to paralyse accommodation as most young children are unable to maintain distance fixation during testing;<BR/>3. fundus and media examination to exclude any pathology;<BR/>4. rechecking the visual acuity with the glasses correction in place.</P>
<P>During the critical period some improvement in visual acuity is expected after wearing the appropriate spectacle correction. This is traditionally a period of about six weeks but evidence suggests that improvement continues up to twelve weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Moseley-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moseley 2002</LINK>). The diagnosis is made if a visual acuity deficit persists after the refractive error has been corrected for a period.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Treatment options</HEADING>
<P>Screening is intended to reduce the prevalence of a condition and has to facilitate referral for treatment. The impact of vision screening will therefore depend partly on the success of subsequent treatment for amblyopia. Treatment for amblyopia broadly consists of a combination of spectacle correction, patching or 'penalisation' of the better-seeing eye using drugs or lenses. Treatment options and the management plan will depend on the type of amblyopia diagnosed. Factors affecting the outcome of treatment include the age of the patient and the density of the amblyopia. Compliance with treatment prescribed is also very important so available treatment has to be acceptable to the patient and their parents.</P>
<P>The effectiveness of various interventions for amblyopia is being examined in a series of Cochrane reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Antonio_x002d_Santos-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Antonio-Santos 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shotton-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shotton 2008</LINK>). Citations for the others will be provided in updates to this review as they reach publication.</P>
<P>Treatment outcomes can be quantified by measuring the change in acuity in the amblyopic eye either as:<BR/>1. the number of lines change in visual acuity at the end of treatment;<BR/>2. the proportion of the visual acuity deficit that has been corrected (<LINK REF="REF-Stewart-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 2003</LINK>); or<BR/>3. final visual acuity on an age specific test.</P>
<P>A final visual acuity of 6/9 Snellen or 0.2 LogMAR or better is generally agreed to represent the restoration of normal vision.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Rationale for a systematic review</HEADING>
<P>Amblyopia is a commonly occurring, usually monocular condition that needs to be treated within the critical period for visual development in order for treatment to be effective. School-entry and preschool screening programmes have therefore been introduced to detect amblyopia while the condition is still amenable to treatment. Uncertainty regarding the value of such screening programmes exists (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Snowden-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Snowden 1997</LINK>). A major review of vision screening in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Snowden-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Snowden 1997</LINK>) highlighted the need for good quality research into the natural history of amblyopia and the outcomes of treatment for the condition. There is a need to examine existing evidence to establish the impact of vision screening and subsequent treatment on the prevalence of amblyopia and to consider the possible harms that might arise from this intervention.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The primary objective of this review was to evaluate the impact of vision screening on the prevalence of amblyopia in comparable screened versus unscreened populations. Subgroup analyses were planned to determine the effect of the type of personnel conducting the testing, the age at screening, and the visual acuity threshold at which participants are referred for further evaluation. Secondary objectives were to report available evidence regarding the disability associated with living with uncorrected amblyopia and to document reports of the potential harms and costs associated with screening. </P>

<P>Two authors independently assessed the titles and abstracts identified by the searches to establish whether any met the inclusion criteria for this review. Full text copies of potentially eligible studies were obtained and, where necessary, trial authors were contacted. No trials met the inclusion criteria and, therefore, none were assessed for quality and no data were extracted or analysed.</P>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Assessment of methodological quality</HEADING>
<P>We will assess the methodological quality of included studies by examining four main sources of bias:<BR/>1. selection bias: controlled by randomisation and allocation concealment;<BR/>2. detection bias: whether or not examiners responsible for measuring outcomes were masked to the group allocation of participants;<BR/>3. attrition bias: how participants lost to follow up were accounted for. We will consider whether follow-up rates for groups were similar and whether all participants were analysed as randomised, that is, whether an intention to treat analysis was performed;<BR/>4. performance bias: - the masking of participants and care providers to the group allocation.</P>
<P>Each parameter will be graded as (A) yes, requirements met; (C) no, requirements not met; or (B) unable to determine. Clarification will be sought from trial authors of studies graded B. We will exclude in sensitivity analyses studies graded B or C to examine whether they have an impact on the size and direction of effect.</P>

<BR/>If appropriate a meta-analysis was to be carried out using the RevMan 5.0 software. The fixed-effect model will be used if there are fewer than three trials to analyse. If more trials are included the random-effects model will be used.</P>
<P>It is anticipated that there will be two sets of data: screening versus no screening (intervention versus no treatment), and one screening protocol compared to another. These will be analysed separately.</P>
<P>We anticipate that within each group the proportion of participants with and without amblyopia would be reported as an outcome measure, that is, dichotomous data. We will use the risk ratio as the measure of effect. For continuous data we will present the weighted mean difference.

<P>The electronic searches retrieved 197 references from <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, 655 references from MEDLINE and 979 references from EMBASE. After deduplication the search identified a total of 1449 references. After independent review of the titles and abstracts by two review authors, three papers were retrieved in full. Two of these papers (<A HREF="http://mail.google.com/mail/Williams%202002">Williams 2002</A>; <A HREF="http://mail.google.com/mail/Williams%202003">Williams 2003</A>) were from a single study comparing intensive screening from eight months of age with a one-off vision screen at 37 months. In addition, in theory, all participants would have been screened again at school entry. All participants who were identified as having amblyopia, at any point, were referred for treatment. The authors were contacted but data were not available for children who had missed screening completely. This study was excluded. The third paper (<LINK REF="STD-Rasmussen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Rasmussen 2000</LINK>) described a randomised trial of screening for strabismus and was not designed as a trial of screening for amblyopia. In addition, the participants were screened using a stereoacuity test and visual acuity data were not reported. This study was therefore also excluded.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-11-03 15:58:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The primary aim of vision screening children at preschool and school entry is to reduce the prevalence of amblyopia by referring children for treatment while the condition is still amenable to treatment. This review was designed to evaluate the evidence available from randomised controlled trials on the effectiveness of current screening practices in achieving this. At present there are no data available from such trials reporting prevalence rates of amblyopia in screened versus unscreened populations. A small selection of papers identified by the electronic searches and some from their citation lists which describe current practice will therefore be discussed. These studies cannot be regarded as having been systematically retrieved and assessed for bias in the same way that randomised controlled trials would have been.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Prevalence of amblyopia in screened cohorts</HEADING>
<P>The electronic searches did not find any randomised controlled trials designed to evaluate the impact of vision screening on the proportion of amblyopia. The evidence available is from observational studies of screened populations.</P>
<P>The lack of a universally-accepted definition of amblyopia makes data from published studies of screened populations difficult to compare. Setting the definition as visual acuity of worse than 6/9 Snellen studies have reported estimates of between 0.63% and 1.81% (<LINK REF="REF-Bray-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bray 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jensen-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jensen 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2003</LINK>). A summary of the estimates from individual papers, together with the definition of amblyopia, used can be found in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Jensen-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jensen 1986</LINK> also reported more severe acuity deficits. In 1986 0.73% of the study population had a best-corrected uniocular visual acuity of 6/18 Snellen or worse. They compared this to the 3.2% reported by <LINK REF="REF-Knudtzon-1941" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knudtzon 1941</LINK> prior to the introduction of vision screening and concluded that screening has had a significant impact on the incidence of dense amblyopia.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Coverage rates</HEADING>
<P>Screening children before school entry presents challenges in terms of the coverage achieved. In general, programmes conducted at school entry or as part of other healthcare checks report reaching a much higher percentage of the target population. In Scandinavia, where preschool vision screening is carried out when the child attends for other general health checks, coverage is reported to be 99% (<LINK REF="REF-Kvarnstrom--2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kvarnstrom 2001</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>In Newcastle, UK a prospective comparative evaluation found that only 58% (916/1582) of children invited for preschool screening attended compared to an estimate of more than 95% for the local school-entry vision screening programme (<LINK REF="REF-Bray-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bray 1996</LINK>). Where a large percentage of the population remains unscreened the potential benefits of a screening programme are significantly reduced. An intention-to-screen analysis carried out by the ALSPAC team, who conducted a prospective trial in the UK, demonstrated that obtaining only 67% coverage, as they did, reduced the benefit attributable to early screening to a level undetectable by a study of that size (<LINK REF="STD-Williams-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2003</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">What is the optimum age to screen for amblyopia?</HEADING>
<P>One of the dilemmas when designing a vision screening programme is that whilst screening at school entry is likely to improve coverage there is a concern that visual outcomes may not be as favourable as if the detection and treatment had occurred earlier.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Williams-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2003</LINK>, as part of the ALSPAC study, compared the outcomes of treatment for a cohort of children screened preschool (at 37 months) to those who were screened at school entry. This study did report slightly better outcomes in the preschool group (mean visual acuity of 0.14 LogMAR, Standard Deviation(SD) 0.18) compared to the school-entry group (mean 0.2 LogMAR, SD 0.23). A subgroup analysis revealed that this beneficial effect was statistically significant only for 'straight-eyed' amblyopia (0.06 compared to 0.12). For amblyopia associated with squint no such beneficial effect existed (0.27 compared to 0.29).</P>
<P>In Newcastle a randomised controlled trial of glasses and occlusion therapy for amblyopia identified at screening found no significant difference in outcome between participants whose treatment began at 48.1 months and the control group who did not commence treatment until twelve months later. In both groups the mean visual acuity six months after the control group had been treated was 0.170 LogMAR (SD 0.15 intervention group and 0.13 in control group) (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2003</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Threshold applied for failure</HEADING>
<P>The threshold applied for failing vision screening appears to vary depending on local or national practice patterns as well as on the test used and the age at screening. The lack of age-related normative data adds to the difficulty of interpreting results. In most countries there appears to be no standardisation.</P>
<P>In Sweden, however, there is a countrywide protocol. In the past the failure threshold for four year olds was 0.8 decimal (6/7.5 Snellen) but it was observed that many children who were being referred did not require any treatment. This led to a change in referral criteria. Now children with marginally reduced vision at four years of age are re-examined at five. A paper evaluating the new programme in one city area of Sweden found that only 50% (16/32) of children re-tested at five needed treatment and none of these had amblyopia as defined by this review by the age of seven to eight years (<LINK REF="REF-Hard-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hard 2002</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Who should conduct screening for amblyopia?</HEADING>
<P>Recommendations regarding who should carry out screening for amblyopia vary. In America practice varies from state to state and preschool vision screening is carried out by a variety of professional, volunteer and lay personnel (<LINK REF="REF-Ciner-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ciner 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ehrlich-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ehrlich 1983</LINK>). In Sweden nurses carry out a vision screen as part of other healthcare surveillance checks (<LINK REF="REF-Hard-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hard 2002</LINK>). In some places trials of home vision screening kits for parents have been conducted (<LINK REF="REF-Ehrlich-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ehrlich 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yazawa-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yazawa 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the UK orthoptists have been shown to compare favourably with other screening personnel. In a comparative trial in Newcastle estimates of 100% sensitivity and 97.1% specificity were calculated for orthoptists undertaking vision screening in three year olds. Health visitors achieved better specificity at 100% but managed a sensitivity of only 50% (<LINK REF="REF-Jarvis-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jarvis 1991</LINK>). In a retrospective study in Cornwall orthoptists were reported to achieve a sensitivity of approximately 90% and a specificity of 99% (<LINK REF="REF-Wormald-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wormald 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>In addition, <LINK REF="REF-Bray-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bray 1996</LINK> reported a statistically significant reduction in the age at presentation for anisometropic amblyopia, microtropia (squint measuring 10 prism dioptres or less) and pure refractive error when screening was conducted by orthoptists compared to health visitor and GP screening. Current recommendations in the UK are therefore that a visual assessment should be carried out by orthoptists on all children between the ages of four and five (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 2003</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Economic data</HEADING>
<P>There is very little data available on the costs involved in screening for amblyopia. One German study estimated the cost per orthoptic screening test to be 15.39 Deutschmarks (DM) compared to DM 71.20 for examination by an ophthalmologist. The total cost of screening in all German kindergartens was estimated to be DM 6.1 million. The cost effectiveness ratio was calculated to be DM 1.421 per case detected. A sensitivity analysis showed that prevalence and sensitivity had a significant impact on the cost-effectiveness ratio (<LINK REF="REF-Konig-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Konig 2000</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-11-03 15:49:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The optimum protocol for carrying out screening remains unclear. Some evidence on the outcomes of orthoptic treatment following screening is available. There seems to be no detrimental effect in terms of visual outcome to leaving screening until school entry and this appears to improve the coverage achieved (<LINK REF="REF-Bray-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bray 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2003</LINK>). At present there is insufficient evidence from good quality trials to allow the impact of screening for amblyopia on the prevalence to be accurately measured.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There is a clear need for more reliable evidence of the effectiveness of vision screening programmes in reducing the prevalence of amblyopia. To facilitate this process normative values for commonly-used vision tests need to be available and a consensus reached as to what level of visual acuity deficit constitutes amblyopia in the context of age at testing and vision test used. Data of current screening practices including costs, coverage, and positive predictive values need to be collected. The introduction of new screening programmes may provide opportunities to conduct randomised controlled trials to allow this intervention to be evaluated.</P>
<P>Although the objective of this review was to assess the impact of screening on the prevalence of amblyopia it is probable that screening for amblyopia will also detect children with reduced vision resulting from other causes such as uncorrected refractive error or anomalies, for example nystagmus or cataract. It would be useful to collect data to ascertain the percentages of other conditions detected. This may be particularly important to children who would not have access to eye care professionals in the absence of screening. More evidence is needed to elucidate the implications of living with uncorrected amblyopia and the effects of the early provision of glasses on the development of refractive error. </P>
