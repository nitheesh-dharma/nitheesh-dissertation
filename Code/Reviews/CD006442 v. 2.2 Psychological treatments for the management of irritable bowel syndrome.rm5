<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Psychological treatments for the management of irritable bowel syndrome</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>In this review, the effectiveness of psychological therapies for adult patients with irritable bowel syndrome was evaluated. Studies involving cognitive behavioural therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy and relaxation therapy or stress management were reviewed. Although it is difficult to draw conclusions because of differences between studies and quality issues, the results suggest that cognitive behavioural therapy and interpersonal psychotherapy may be effective immediately after finishing treatment. It is unclear whether the effects of these therapies are sustained thereafter. These results have to be interpreted with caution as the quality of the studies was sub-optimal. Physicians should be aware of the limitations of these therapies and should choose an appropriate therapy based on the individual patient's characteristics. <BR/>

<P>Psychological interventions may be slightly superior to usual care or waiting list control conditions at the end of treatment although the clinical significance of this is debatable. Except for a single study, these therapies are not superior to placebo and the sustainability of their effect is questionable. The meta-analysis was significantly limited by issues of validity, heterogeneity, small sample size and outcome definition. Future research should adhere to current recommendations for IBS treatment trials and should focus on the long-term effects of treatment.<BR/>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-11-04 14:19:27 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic functional gastrointestinal disorder with an estimated prevalence in Europe of up to 24% in women and 19% in men (<LINK REF="REF-Drossman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drossman 1997</LINK>). It is characterized by recurrent episodes of abdominal pain and altered bowel habit including diarrhoea and constipation occurring in the absence of organic disease. For research purposes IBS is defined by diagnostic criteria, the most recent of which are the Rome lll criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Longstreth-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Longstreth 2006</LINK>). A third to a half of all IBS patients seek medical help (<LINK REF="REF-Drossman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drossman 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Drossman-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drossman 1988</LINK>). Most patients are managed in primary care, but 5 to 10% of patients are eventually referred to a specialist. Of all gastroenterologist referrals, 25 to 70% are eventually diagnosed with IBS (<LINK REF="REF-Drossman-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drossman 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mitchell-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitchell 1987</LINK>). IBS is estimated to cost up to &#8364;1600 per patient per year annually in health care costs (<LINK REF="REF-Ricci-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ricci 2002</LINK>). It also results in significant impairments in functional status, higher levels of disability and increased frequency of physician visits (<LINK REF="REF-Drossman-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drossman 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Whitehead-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitehead 1996</LINK>). </P>
<P>Several pathophysiological mechanisms underlying IBS have been proposed, including disturbance in intestinal motility and enhanced visceral sensitivity. IBS symptom generation is considered to be due to a disordered regulation of the motor and sensory functioning of the enteric nervous system and the central nervous system, the so-called "brain gut axis" (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2006</LINK>). Although studies have reported an association between polymorphism of the serotonin transporter 5-HTT and certain IBS subtypes, no unique genetic background for IBS has been identified (<LINK REF="REF-Spiller-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spiller 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Park-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Park 2005</LINK>). Psychological factors also appear to be involved in IBS illness experience, illness behaviour and clinical outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Bennett-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 1998</LINK>). Epidemiological studies show that anxiety and depression are more common in IBS patients consulting for their symptoms compared to controls. These patients also report a higher number of major life events (<LINK REF="REF-Drossman-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drossman 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Drossman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drossman 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Drossman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drossman 1999</LINK>). Drossmann and colleagues integrated these pathways in a 'biopsychosocial model' (<LINK REF="REF-Drossman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drossman 1997</LINK>). This model describes early life factors (genetic predisposition and environmental influences) interacting with psychosocial factors and physiological functioning via the central and enteric nervous system, thereby influencing gastrointestinal symptomatology, patient response and illness outcome (e.g. amount of drugs used, physician visits, daily functioning and quality of life).</P>
<P>A recent review of the extensive literature on pharmacotherapy concluded that in general the efficacy of drug therapies for IBS is weak (<LINK REF="REF-Quartero-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quartero 2005</LINK>). No clear evidence for benefit from bulking agents or antidepressants was found. Antispasmodic agents may provide some benefit for improving abdominal pain and global symptom assessment. A complicating factor in IBS research is placebo response, which ranges from 0 to 84% (<LINK REF="REF-Spiller-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spiller 1999</LINK>). Although IBS does have a female predominance, and gender specific mechanisms and features are reported, current management of IBS is the same for men and women (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Due to the limited benefits of pharmacological therapy, and in response to the psychological dimension of IBS, there has been growing interest in the use of psychological treatments. A wide range of psychotherapeutic interventions are utilised for the treatment of IBS, including cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), interpersonal psychotherapy (IPP), hypnotherapy and relaxation techniques. <BR/>
<BR/>Cognitive behavioural therapy refers to the combination of cognitive and behavioural treatment modalities. Cognitive therapy teaches patients to identify associations between thoughts and physical symptoms and to modify dysfunctional beliefs (<LINK REF="REF-Beck-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beck 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Beck-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beck 1998</LINK>). Behavioural therapy uses behaviour modification for the treatment of health problems by changing the sick role behaviours that accompany and influence the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Lipsey-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipsey 1993</LINK>). Cognitive and behavioural treatment modalities are often combined and include techniques such as systemic desensitization, problem solving therapy, social skills training, imagery and home work exercises. Cognitive behavioural therapy is often combined with forms of relaxation therapy and biofeedback. Interpersonal or psychodynamic psychotherapy is a short-term highly-structured type of psychotherapy focusing on those interpersonal events which seem to be most important in the onset and maintenance of the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Blanchard-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blanchard 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vandereycken-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vandereycken 2003</LINK>). Relaxation therapy helps patients by reducing the physiological effects of stress and anxiety. Relaxation techniques include progressive muscular relaxation, forms of biofeedback, yoga and meditation. Hypnotherapy uses suggestion of relaxation and relaxation techniques when a patient is in the hypnotic state, a state of heightened suggestibility (<LINK REF="REF-Drossman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drossman 1999</LINK>). </P>
<P>Both cognitive behavioral therapy and interpersonal psychotherapy have been shown to be effective for treating anxiety and depression (<LINK REF="REF-Shapiro-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shapiro 1995</LINK>). Cognitive behavioural therapy has been found to be effective for the treatment of patients with unexplained physical symptoms and chronic fatigue syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Butler-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Butler 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Speckens-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Speckens 1995</LINK>). In a meta-analysis, cognitive behavioural therapy was found to be effective for chronic pain (<LINK REF="REF-Morley-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morley 1999</LINK>). </P>
<P>The mechanisms by which psychological therapies might alleviate IBS symptoms point to various pathways that can be related to the biopsychosocial model described above. Disease management can be enhanced by alleviating anxiety, depression and other psychosocial contributors of disease. Adaptation of malfunctional illness behaviour and coping strategies might be beneficial. Finally, IBS symptomatology can be influenced by directly influencing biological systems that mediate gut function (<LINK REF="REF-Lackner-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lackner 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Naliboff-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naliboff 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Whorwell-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whorwell 1991</LINK>). </P>
<P>It has been suggested that specific patient characteristics might predict the success of psychological interventions. For example, stress management might be appropriate in patients experiencing aggravation of symptoms under conditions of extra burden or in patients experiencing major life events, whereas cognitive behavioural therapy might be justified in patients with inadequate coping strategies (<LINK REF="STD-Fernandez-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fernandez 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fernandez-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fernandez 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the past twenty years, a variety of studies have investigated the effect of psychological treatments in IBS patients. Unfortunately, most of these studies investigated small patient groups, lack validity and are difficult to reproduce. A number of (mainly narrative) reviews have tried to summarize the effectiveness of psychological treatments for IBS (<LINK REF="REF-Lackner-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lackner 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Blanchard-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blanchard 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Blanchard-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blanchard 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Drossman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drossman 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klein-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Talley-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Talley 1996</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Lackner-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lackner 2004</LINK> concluded that psychological treatments as a class of interventions were effective in reducing symptoms compared to a pooled group of control conditions (<LINK REF="REF-Lackner-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lackner 2004</LINK>). The effectiveness of specific psychotherapeutic approaches and the contribution of placebo interventions in symptom reduction is unclear. None of the previous reviews included non English articles and since the publication of the latest review, some new randomised controlled trials have been published. </P>
<P>The objective of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of the different types of psychological interventions for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. We also sought to identify the role of the placebo effect, which is substantial in IBS, and might account for a high rate of effectiveness of psychological therapies.<BR/>

<I>Study selection</I>
<BR/>Two authors (IZ and NdW) independently screened the abstracts of all studies identified by the search strategy for eligibility. Full text articles were obtained for all potentially eligible studies. These were independently reviewed by the same two authors to determine eligibility. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion and consensus.</P>
<P>Exclusion criteria were as follows:<BR/>1. Not an RCT;<BR/>2. Inappropriate patient group (patients younger than 16, diagnosis of functional bowel disorders not specified as IBS);<BR/>3. Intervention did not involve psychological treatment;<BR/>4. No control group (placebo, mock intervention or standard care);<BR/>5. Cross-over studies which did not report results for the first phase of treatment;<BR/>6. Duplicated trials; and<BR/>7. Mixed interventions in which no data on effectiveness of psychological intervention could be extracted.</P>
<P>No restriction in duration or severity of symptoms was applied. </P>
<P>
<I>Data extraction </I>
<BR/>Data extraction was performed by two independent authors (IZ and NdW) or by the national contact person. Extracted data included the number of patients, intervention type, group or individual psychotherapy, presence of a treatment protocol, patient group (mean age, gender, duration of complaints, presence of DSM diagnosis, setting, criteria for diagnosis, subtype of IBS, severity of IBS, previous treatment), co-interventions, follow-up period, cross-over design and outcomes measured. Standard data extraction forms were used and collected for entry into RevMan at the Julius Center in Utrecht (Netherlands). Any disagreements over data extraction were resolved by discussion and consensus. Data that could only be estimated from graphics were not included in the meta-analysis. Where essential data were missing, the author of the article was contacted and requested to provide additional information. </P>
<P>
<I>Quality assessment</I>
<BR/>Methodological quality was independently assessed by two authors (IZ and NdW) using a standard assessment form. A methodology expert (GvdH) was consulted for specific queries. For non-English language papers identified from local databases quality assessment was done by the national contact person and, after any necessary translation by one of the authors. Quality assessment criteria included: method of randomisation (described and appropriate, inappropriate, or unclear), allocation concealment (adequate, unclear, or inadequate), description of loss to follow-up, blinding of patients and blinding of outcome measurement. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion and consensus. </P>
<P>
<I>Statistical Analysis</I>
<BR/>The RevMan 4.2 software was used for the statistical analyses. For the dichotomous outcome 'adequate relief' proportions of patients experiencing adequate relief in the psychological treatment and control group were entered in Review Manager. For dichotomous outcomes (e.g. adequate relief) the relative risk (RR), relative risk reduction (1-RR) and risk difference (RD) along with 95% confidence intervals were calculated using a random effects model. For the continuous outcomes 'improvement of symptoms', 'abdominal pain' and 'improvement of quality of life' the change score and standard deviation were entered. If pre- and post-treatment data were provided instead of change scores, the change score and standard deviation were calculated manually. After entering these data, standardized mean differences with 95% confidence intervals were calculated using the random-effects model to allow comparison between studies with different rating scales. If data were not completely reported, the authors of the trial were contacted to retrieve additional data or results were calculated manually using information given in the study. For all outcomes, only those patients for whom follow-up data were available were included. Some studies reported their results with an opposite scale direction. The results of these studies were multiplied by -1. If studies comprised two psychological intervention groups, results of both groups were pooled for the analysis of overall effectiveness. The chi-square test was used to assess heterogeneity. Analyses were performed for post treatment outcome (2 and 3 months) and long term follow-up (6 months, 9 months, 12 months and 15 months follow-up from baseline). Both a proof of practice analysis, including all data extractable, regardless of validity, and a proof of principle analysis were performed. The proof of principle analysis included only those studies reporting adequate allocation concealment.</P>

<I>Design</I>
<BR/>All studies were randomised controlled trials. Some studies used matched pairing as the method of randomisation (<LINK REF="STD-Blanchard1992_x0028_Stdy1_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Blanchard1992(Stdy1)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Blanchard1992_x0028_Stdy2_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Blanchard1992(Stdy2)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greene-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Greene 1994a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Keefer-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Keefer 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Neff-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Neff 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lynch-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Lynch 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Payne-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Payne 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tkachuk-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tkachuk 2003</LINK>). In these studies couples or triads of patients were matched based on specific characteristics (for example age, sex or predominant symptoms) and then randomly assigned to one of the treatment conditions.<BR/>
<BR/>
<I>Sample size</I>
<BR/>The sample sizes ranged from 15 (<LINK REF="STD-Keefer-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Keefer 2001</LINK>) to 257 (<LINK REF="STD-Creed-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Creed 2003</LINK>).<BR/>
<I>
<BR/>Setting</I>
<BR/>Although the source of study subjects was often unclear, most studies were carried out in a secondary or tertiary care setting. Four studies were carried out wholly or in part in a primary care setting (<LINK REF="STD-Blanchard1992_x0028_Stdy1_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Blanchard1992(Stdy1)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Blanchard1992_x0028_Stdy2_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Blanchard1992(Stdy2)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Blanchard-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Blanchard 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 2005</LINK>). In ten studies patients were recruited in part by advertisement (<LINK REF="STD-Blanchard1992_x0028_Stdy2_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Blanchard1992(Stdy2)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Blanchard1992_x0028_Stdy1_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Blanchard1992(Stdy1)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Blanchard-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Blanchard 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Blanchard-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Blanchard 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boyce-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Boyce 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Drossman-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Drossman 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greene-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Greene 1994a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Keefer-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Keefer 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-vanderVeek-2007" TYPE="STUDY">vanderVeek 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vollmer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Vollmer 1998</LINK>).</P>

<I>Participants</I>
<BR/>The mean age of participants ranged from 30.9 (<LINK REF="STD-Taneja-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Taneja 2004</LINK>) to 49.2 years (<LINK REF="STD-Blanchard-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Blanchard 2007</LINK>). Treatment duration and follow up time varied from 6 weeks to 12 months.<BR/>
<BR/>
<I>Interventions</I>
<BR/>Seventeen studies compared cognitive behavioral therapy to either a control or placebo intervention. Four of these studies used cognitive therapy as treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Blanchard-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Blanchard 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greene-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Greene 1994a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Payne-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Payne 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vollmer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Vollmer 1998</LINK>) whereas seven used behavioural therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Heymann_x002d_M_x00f6_nnikes2000" TYPE="STUDY">Heymann-Mönnikes2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Neff-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Neff 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lynch-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Lynch 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boyce-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Boyce 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Corney-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Corney 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fernandez-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fernandez 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fernandez-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fernandez 2006</LINK>).

In ten studies, the main intervention was a form of stress management or relaxation therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Blanchard-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Blanchard 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fernandez-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fernandez 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fernandez-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fernandez 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Keefer-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Keefer 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boyce-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Boyce 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shaw-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taneja-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Taneja 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Berndt-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Berndt 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-vanderVeek-2007" TYPE="STUDY">vanderVeek 2007</LINK>). Three studies used interpersonal psychotherapy as the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Guthrie-1991a" TYPE="STUDY">Guthrie 1991a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Creed-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Creed 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Svedlund-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Svedlund 1983</LINK>). In five studies, therapy was provided in a group setting (<LINK REF="STD-Berndt-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Berndt 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Blanchard-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Blanchard 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tkachuk-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tkachuk 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vollmer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Vollmer 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-vanderVeek-2007" TYPE="STUDY">vanderVeek 2007</LINK>). In 21 studies the psychological interventions were delivered on an individual basis. Control conditions differed between studies. Control conditions defined as 'usual care' and 'waiting list conditions' were analysed together as it was often unclear whether or not patients in the waiting list groups received any medication.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-11-05 09:10:27 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Psychological interventions as a group are superior to usual care or being placed on a waiting list, but not to placebo, for improvement of symptoms and reduction in abdominal pain at the end of treatment. Cognitive behavioural therapy is better than usual care or waiting list for improving symptoms and quality of life at three months, but is not superior to placebo. Interpersonal psychotherapy is better than usual care or waiting list for adequate relief, symptom score and quality of life at 3 months. Relaxation or stress management is better than usual care or waiting list for improving symptoms, abdominal pain and quality of life at 2 months. Adequate relief as an outcome measure was only used in studies of interpersonal psychotherapy and in one CBT trial. Using this measure the intervention was superior to usual care or waiting list and placebo. The clinical significance of these positive effects is debatable since confidence intervals often approach zero. The sustained benefit of psychological interventions is questionable. The few follow-up studies with usable data show a trend towards loss of treatment effect over time. Unfortunately, most long term follow up studies had a cross-over design and could not be included in the meta-analysis. </P>
<P>This meta-analysis has a number of limitations. Categorising psychological interventions can be difficult. Psychological interventions in this review were classified as cognitive behavioural therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy or relaxation, which is in line with earlier reviews. However, this classification has been contested. One problem is the diversity in content of cognitive behavioural treatment formats, causing considerable heterogeneity in the CBT group. Although stress management and progressive muscular relaxation are often part of CBT treatment packages, it was decided to analyze those studies which only used relaxation therapy as the intervention separately, as these trials did not include cognitive therapy. An important issue in studying psychological interventions is the ability to standardize the treatment procedure under study. Only 11 of 24 studies described a treatment manual. Even if a manual is available, the level of adherence with the treatment procedure is unknown.<BR/>
<BR/>Placebo response in IBS trials is high. Placebo response, defined as an inert treatment effect that is generated not from the treatment itself but from its suggestive effect, heavily depends on the patient's belief that the therapy will be effective. Although the high placebo response in functional disease may be evidence in favor of psychological interventions, it poses another challenge in the evaluation of psychological interventions: the need to evaluate the extent to which they provide any effect beyond that provided by placebo. Placebo response occurs as part of all therapeutic interventions, and may result from consultation, the relationship with the physician, or from strong confidence in the therapeutic effect of an intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Bowers-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bowers 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Garcia_x002d_Alonso-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia-Alonso 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kaptchuk-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaptchuk 2008</LINK>). In therapeutic trials it is not possible to completely separate the effect of the actual intervention from the placebo effect. Optimal placebo comparison in trials of psychological interventions is an unresolved issue. Fake (sham or mock) interventions, which copy the therapeutic relation, but omit the actual intervention, only partly cover the placebo effect. Waiting list comparison is inadequate, as the process of waiting is likely to negatively affect outcome. The problems arising from placebo comparison in the psychological treatment trials described above are illustrated in this meta-analysis; placebo interventions were heterogeneous, varying from pseudomeditation to psychoeducation. In the latter case, it is debatable whether the placebo intervention was completely void of any active treatment element. Furthermore, as the placebo response tends to diminish after approximately 12 weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Spiller-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spiller 1999</LINK>), it is unfortunate that few studies provided long term follow up data. </P>
<P>Various sources of heterogeneity were apparent. Some were identified using the standard assessment form, for example duration and severity of disease, source of patients, gender and presence of psychiatric and psychosocial comorbidity. Some studies recruited patients by advertisement, others included patients in tertiary care. These patients may be more amenable to psychological treatment and unrepresentative of IBS patients seeking help in primary care. Severity of symptoms differed between studies, as did the proportion of males and females. Subgroup analyses proved impractable because of small patient numbers. The efficacy of treatment might be highly dependent on the clinician administrating the therapy. Although some studies performed subgroup analyses to detect intertherapist variability, these data are not available for each study. Often only a small subset of patients from the primary identified patient group was randomized, resulting in possible selection bias.</P>
<P>Adequate relief and satisfactory relief are currently accepted as the primary outcome measures in IBS treatment trials (<LINK REF="REF-Bijkerk-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bijkerk 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Irvine-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irvine 2006</LINK>). As the majority of studies were published before 1995, only a small subset of studies in this review used this outcome. A variety of rating scales were used to assess abdominal pain and total symptom scores in the included studies and most of these scales have not been validated. The IBS Severity Scoring System, the preferred instrument for IBS symptom assessment was used in a minority of trials (<LINK REF="REF-Bijkerk-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bijkerk 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Irvine-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irvine 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-vanderVeek-2007" TYPE="STUDY">vanderVeek 2007</LINK>). In assessing quality of life, we had intended to analyse the results for the SF-36 dimension 'general health'. However, the 'physical symptoms' dimension had to be used because the results for 'general health' were not always reported. It should be emphasized that this meta-analyis is significantly limited by the presence of heterogeneity. Future studies should follow the published recommendations for IBS treatment trials, thereby allowing pooling of results with minimal heterogeneity. </P>
<P>Most of the studies included in this meta-analysis are of low methodological quality. Randomisation was described and adequate in 7 studies (<LINK REF="STD-Blanchard-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Blanchard 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boyce-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Boyce 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Creed-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Creed 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Drossman-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Drossman 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heymann_x002d_M_x00f6_nnikes2000" TYPE="STUDY">Heymann-Mönnikes2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-vanderVeek-2007" TYPE="STUDY">vanderVeek 2007</LINK>), and adequate allocation concealment was described in only 4 studies (<LINK REF="STD-Blanchard-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Blanchard 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boyce-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Boyce 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Creed-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Creed 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Drossman-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Drossman 2003</LINK>). As with all psychological treatment trials, the blinding of patients and therapists is difficult or even unfeasible. Although several studies outcome measurement as being blinded, blinding was never fully adequate. The number of dropouts in the included studies was high. Dropouts were replaced in certain trials (<LINK REF="STD-Blanchard-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Blanchard 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Payne-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Payne 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shaw-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 1991</LINK>). Due to the low methodological quality of the included trials, the results of this meta-analysis should be interpreted with caution and viewed as a 'proof of practice' analysis. A separate proof of principle analysis including 3 studies which reported adequate allocation concealment was performed for the outcomes symptom score, abdominal pain and quality of life. Only one positive finding was found, a slight improvement in quality of life for the comparison between psychotherapy as a group compared to usual care at the end of treatment. </P>
<P>Although this meta-analysis provides a systematic comparison of the different psychological treatments for IBS, it is not without methodological problems. Some included studies reported change scores, whereas others reported baseline and end of treatment scores. It was decided to calculate change scores for all continuous outcomes to analyse treatment effect as there were differences in baseline scores between treatment groups in several trials. A limitation of this approach is that the standard deviation calculated is an estimation of the real standard deviation. The calculation of this standard deviation takes into account the difference in patient numbers at different assessment time points. However, Review Manager does not allow these differences in patient numbers to be incorporated in the analysis. Using the baseline number of patients might have caused some differences in the weight given to studies in the analyses. </P>
<P>The results of this meta-analysis are not consistent with earlier reviews. Comparison with the narrative reviews of <LINK REF="REF-Talley-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Talley 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Blanchard-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blanchard 2005</LINK> is not feasible since their conclusions are not based on the calculation of overall treatment effects but on the opinions of the authors. <LINK REF="REF-Lackner-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lackner 2004</LINK> concluded that psychological treatments as a class of interventions are effective in reducing symptoms compared to a pooled group of control interventions. This conclusion is based on the outcome '50% reduction of symptoms' and an odds ratio of 12 (95% CI 5.56-25.96) in favour of psychological treatments compared to pooled controls was reported. Although this outcome is often used in studies, adequate symptom relief is the accepted standard for primary outcome assessment in IBS treatment trials (<LINK REF="REF-Irvine-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irvine 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Camilleri-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Camilleri 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bijkerk-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bijkerk 2003</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Lackner-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lackner 2004</LINK> moderated this conclusion by stressing the low methodological quality of the included studies and the possible bias caused by patient selection and small samples. <LINK REF="REF-Lackner-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lackner 2004</LINK> did not perform a meta-analysis for specific psychological treatments and did not distinguish between placebo and control conditions in the analyses. Furthermore, the trials of highest methodological quality in the current meta-analysis were not included in the <LINK REF="REF-Lackner-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lackner 2004</LINK> study, nor were non-English articles (<LINK REF="STD-Blanchard-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Blanchard 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boyce-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Boyce 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Creed-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Creed 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Berndt-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Berndt 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Drossman-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Drossman 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-vanderVeek-2007" TYPE="STUDY">vanderVeek 2007</LINK>). Nonetheless, if these studies are added to a meta-analysis of '50% reduction of symptoms' it results in an OR of 7 (95% CI 4.09 to 12.31), considerably less than the benefit found by <LINK REF="REF-Lackner-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lackner 2004</LINK>. This analysis includes eleven studies, of which nine are from the same research institute, all using the same unvalidated outcome.</P>

<P>In conclusion, psychological therapies may be superior to usual care at the end of treatment, although the clinical significance of this benefit is doubtful. Psychological therapies in general are not superior to placebo. The long-term sustainability of the treatment effects of psychological therapies is questionable. The results of this meta-analysis should be interpreted with caution due to the low methodological quality of the included studies, variability in outcome definitions and small sample sizes which resulted in considerable heterogeneity. Future research should follow current recommendations for IBS treatment trials and should focus on the longer term effects of treatment and placebo. </P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-11-04 14:19:27 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Although many psychological treatment trials have been performed, only a small subset satisfactorily addresses issues of validity, sample size and outcome assessment. There is a need for large studies of high validity to assess the true effect of psychological interventions for irritable bowel syndrome. Future research should focus on improving validity by specifying randomization procedures and demonstrating adequate allocation concealment. Treatments should be standardized by providing a treatment manual and monitoring adherence to it. Although the design of appropriate control and placebo conditions is a generic problem for psychological research, efforts should be made to use placebo techniques which generate equal expectations of improvement to the active treatment. A standardised control condition, for example 'care as usual' is preferable to the waiting list condition which was used in the majority of trials in this meta-analysis. As nonspecific effects are known to be largest in the first phase of treatment trials, follow-up of both treatment and control groups should be extended. This might reveal whether the effectiveness of psychological treatments is attributable to the psychological element of treatment or to nonspecific treatment effects. Preferably, all trials should include adequate or satisfactory relief as primary outcomes and a common scale for symptom measurement (e.g. IBS Severity Scoring System) should be adopted. As the IBS patient group is extremely heterogeneous, one might consider recruitment based on specific patient characteristics. For example, patients experiencing major life events might be recruited to a stress management trial whereas patients with coping problems would be more suitable to a CBT study. In this way, the therapeutic utility of IBS treatments could be more precisely defined and treatments could be individualized for specific IBS patient subgroups.</P>
