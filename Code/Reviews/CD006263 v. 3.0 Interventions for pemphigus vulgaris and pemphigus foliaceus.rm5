<TITLE>Interventions for pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceus</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-11-09 13:08:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review of clinical trials aimed to find out which is the most effective and safest treatment option for pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceus.</P>
<P>Pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceus are rare diseases characterised by fragile blisters and sores on the skin and mucosa. They are auto-immune diseases which are caused by the body making an antibody against the person's own skin. These diseases are chronic and are not currently curable. Pemphigus vulgaris and foliaceus are managed with drugs which suppress the immune system. The aim of treatment is to suppress blister formation. Systemic glucocorticoids are the cornerstone of management in pemphigus, however adjuvant immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory agents are commonly used. There are many treatments available, however it is not known which is the most effective or safest treatment option, or which is the best combination.</P>
<P>This review included data from 11 clinical trials involving 404 participants. The studies had very small numbers of participants, so can provide only limited information. Ten different active treatments were studied, including prednisolone, pulsed oral dexamethasone, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, dapsone, mycophenolate, plasma exchange, topical epidermal growth factor and traditional Chinese medicine.</P>
<P>This review found insufficient information to conclude which is the most effective and safest treatment plan. We found that mycophenolate mofetil appears to be more effective than azathioprine in controlling disease, although no difference was seen in remission. We found that taking azathioprine and cyclophosphamide decreased the amount of glucocorticoids required. Topical epidermal growth factor decreased time required for lesions to heal by 6 days (median). We found no difference in withdrawal due to adverse events in any study, although differing adverse event profiles were observed for each intervention. We were not able to conclude which treatments are superior overall.</P>
<P>Multiple treatments are available for pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceus and there is a variation in dosage plan and combination of drugs used, which makes choice of treatment schedule complex. In addition, response to treatment can vary between individuals. Treatments need to be chosen after careful consideration of the potential benefits and side effects, in the context of the individual's other medical conditions. This review found insufficient information to conclude which is the most effective and safest treatment regimen. Further studies are required to determine the optimal treatment regimen, especially to assess the optimal glucocorticoid dose, the role of adjuvant immunosuppressive medications, and long-term adverse events to improve harm:benefit analyses.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-11-10 09:17:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<P>Eleven studies with a total of 404 participants (337 pemphigus vulgaris, 27 pemphigus foliaceus and 40 not specified ) were identified. The quality of included studies was not high, the majority of studies did not report allocation concealment, and power was limited by very small sample sizes. Interventions assessed included prednisolone dose regimen, pulsed dexamethasone, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, dapsone, mycophenolate, plasma exchange, topical epidermal growth factor and traditional Chinese medicine. Ten studies included participants with newly diagnosed or newly active recurrent disease, and one trial included participants in maintenance phase.</P>
<P>There was sufficient data for 4 meta-analyses, each pooling results of two studies only. For the majority of interventions, results were inconclusive. We found some interventions to be superior for certain outcomes, although we were unable to conclude which treatments are superior overall. Mycophenolate was more effective in achieving disease control than azathioprine (1 study; n=40; RR 0.72; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.99, NNT 3.7). There was evidence of a steroid-sparing benefit of azathioprine (1 study; n=57; MWD -3919 mg prednisolone; 95% CI -6712 to -1126) and cyclophosphamide (1 study; n=54; MWD -3355 mg prednisolone; 95% CI -6144 to -566) compared to glucocorticoids alone. Topical epidermal growth factor decreased time to control (1 study; n=20; HR 2.35; 95% CI 1.62 to 3.41).</P>

<P>Pemphigus is a group of rare autoimmune blistering diseases characterised by widespread blistering and erosions of the skin and mucous membranes. It is a chronic and potentially life threatening condition.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Epidemiology</HEADING>
<P>Pemphigus is rare and the incidence has been estimated between 1 to 16 new cases per million people per year (<LINK REF="REF-Pisanti-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pisanti 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chams_x002d_Davatchi-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chams-Davatchi 2005</LINK>). The disease most commonly starts in adulthood, and the distribution is equal in men and women. Pemphigus occurs in all races, however, it appears to be associated with certain HLA class II alleles, which are inherited molecules involved in the immune response (<LINK REF="REF-Tron-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tron 2005</LINK>). There is a form of endemic pemphigus foliaceus (fogo selvagem, or "wild fire" in Portuguese) in Brazil (<LINK REF="REF-Quinteiro-Ribeiro-05" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quinteiro Ribeiro 05</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Cause</HEADING>
<P>Pemphigus is an acquired auto-immune blistering disease, in which the immune system becomes dysregulated and produces antibodies against normal skin components. The mechanisms leading to immune dysregulation and auto-immunity are complex and incompletely understood, and are beyond the scope of this review.</P>
<P>In pemphigus, the body makes auto-antibodies (IgG) against desmogleins, which are adhesion proteins in the skin. They form part of desmosomes which act to bind together the cells in the epidermis, the outermost layer of the skin. Auto-antibodies against both desmoglein 1 and desmoglein 3 may occur; desmoglein 1 is located in the upper epidermis and is found only in the skin, desmoglein 3 is found in the lower epidermis, and is found both in the skin and in mucous membranes. Antigen-specific T cell responses are also involved in the pathogenesis of pemphigus (<LINK REF="REF-Hertl-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hertl 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Deposition of these antibodies is thought to cause separation of epidermal cells (keratinocytes) leading to the formation of fragile blisters and superficial erosions.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Classification</HEADING>
<P>Pemphigus is divided into three main subtypes:<BR/>pemphigus vulgaris (PV),<BR/>pemphigus foliaceus (PF),<BR/>paraneoplastic pemphigus (PNP).</P>
<P>Pemphigus vulgaris is the most common type of pemphigus and accounts for approximately 70% of cases. It is characterised by the presence of IgG against desmoglein 3, although antibodies against desmoglein 1 are also commonly present (<LINK REF="REF-Salato-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salato 2005</LINK>). The classification of PV also includes the rare variant pemphigus vegetans.</P>
<P>Pemphigus foliaceus accounts for approximately 20% of cases. It is caused by IgG to desmoglein 1 only. Rare subtypes of PF include pemphigus erythematosus and pemphigus herpetiformis (<LINK REF="REF-Burns-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burns 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is some overlap between PV and PF: features may co-exist in the same person, or evolve from one form to the other (<LINK REF="REF-Sami-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sami 2001</LINK>). The auto-antibody profile has been reported to correlate with clinical phenotype (<LINK REF="REF-Ding-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ding 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Amagai-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amagai 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jamora-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jamora 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Paraneoplastic pemphigus is the rarest type of pemphigus and is associated with the worst prognosis. It is a distinct variant of pemphigus associated with internal malignancy. Management is focused on treatment of the underlying malignancy (<LINK REF="REF-Anhalt-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anhalt 1990</LINK>). Due to its distinct aetiology, prognosis and management, paraneoplastic pemphigus will not be considered in this review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Clinical features</HEADING>
<P>Pemphigus is characterised by blistering of the skin and/or mucous membranes. As blister formation occurs within the epidermis, fragile blisters are easily ruptured and rapidly evolve into superficial erosions.</P>
<P>In pemphigus vulgaris, both mucous membranes and skin are involved. The majority of cases present with non-healing oral erosions; cutaneous involvement usually follows after a delay of several months.</P>
<P>Pemphigus foliaceus, in contrast, does not affect mucous membranes, and presents with cutaneous blistering and erosions. Blister formation is more superficial than in PV, so erosions are more prominent than blisters.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Impact</HEADING>
<P>PV and PF are chronic and potentially life-threatening conditions. Chronic blistering can result in pain, dehydration, secondary infection and in rare instances, death. Mucosal involvement may cause pain, difficulty swallowing, weight loss, nose bleeds and hoarseness. Side-effects from treatment are common. Pemphigus may have a significant impact on quality of life and the psychological impact of diagnosis of a serious incurable disease may be profound. Knowledge of prognostic factors is limited, but PF has been reported to have a more benign prognosis than PV (<LINK REF="REF-Goon-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goon 2001</LINK>). Involvement limited to the mucosa in PV is associated with a better prognosis than mucosal and cutaneous involvement (<LINK REF="REF-Mourellou-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mourellou 1995</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Diagnosis</HEADING>
<P>Diagnosis of pemphigus requires a combination of clinical features, histopathology and immunofluorescence studies. Histopathology involves taking a skin biopsy for examination under a microscope. Light microscopy of lesional biopsies shows intraepidermal acantholysis (loss of cohesion between epidermal cells) and vesicle (blister) formation. In PV vesicle formation is suprabasal (lower epidermis) and in PF vesicle formation is subcorneal (upper epidermis) (<LINK REF="REF-Burns-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burns 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Due to the difficulty in differentiating PV and PF from other bullous diseases, confirmation of the diagnosis with immunofluorescence studies is required. Direct immunofluorescence looks for auto-antibodies in the skin, and indirect immunofluorescence looks for auto-antibodies in the blood. Direct immunofluorescence of perilesional skin shows intercellular epidermal deposition of IgG with or without C3 in both PV and PF. Indirect immunofluorescence on monkey oesophageal cells shows antibodies to keratinocyte cell surface antigen in PV. Enzyme-Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay (ELISA) and immuno-blotting techniques are additional diagnostic tests which allow identification of auto-antibodies to specific epidermal proteins. Antibody titre has been reported to correlate with disease activity in some, but not all people (<LINK REF="REF-Fitzpatrick-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fitzpatrick 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cheng-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheng 2002</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Management</HEADING>
<P>The aim of management in pemphigus is to induce and maintain remission. This entails suppression of blister formation, healing of erosions and ultimately withdrawal of treatment. Ideally effective disease control is established while minimising any adverse effects of treatment. A diverse group of interventions have been reported in pemphigus.</P>
<P>Systemic glucocorticoids are the cornerstone of management in pemphigus. Introduction of glucocorticoids in the 1950's was accompanied by a reduction in mortality from 75% to 30% (<LINK REF="REF-Bystryn-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bystryn 1984</LINK>). However, the high-dose and prolonged courses of systemic glucocorticoids required for disease control are associated with significant adverse effects (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenberg-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenberg 1976</LINK>). There is considerable variation in the glucocorticoid regimen used. Continuous administration is most common, however it has been argued that adjuvant high dose pulsed therapy may achieve more rapid disease control while reducing the cumulative glucocorticoid dose (<LINK REF="REF-Werth-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Werth 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Toth-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toth 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Steroid-sparing adjuvant medications are widely used in the treatment of pemphigus. A large number of steroid-sparing adjuvants have been described, and these have been broadly classified into immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory groups (<LINK REF="REF-Bystryn-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bystryn 1996</LINK>). The rationale for their use is to increase efficacy of treatment, as well as a theoretical advantage of reducing the cumulative glucocorticoid dose and thereby reducing adverse events. These agents are slow-acting, so their role is in maintenance therapy rather than in inducing remission (<LINK REF="REF-Harman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harman 2003</LINK>). Despite their widespread use, it is not known if steroid-sparing agents are beneficial, and they are associated with significant adverse effects themselves. It is not known which is the preferable steroid-sparing agent.</P>
<P>A diverse number of other interventions have been tested for pemphigus. Biological therapies targeting specific molecules in the inflammatory cascade have been applied to pemphigus (<LINK REF="REF-Arin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arin 2005</LINK>) and it is plausible that these therapies may be effective, although clinical experience is limited. Topical and intralesional glucocorticoid usage have been used in mild disease or as an adjunct. Use of intravenous immunoglobulin and plasmapheresis have been reported in refractory cases (<LINK REF="REF-Jolles-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jolles 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Engineer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Engineer 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Turner-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 2000</LINK>). Certain drugs and foods have been found to be acantholytic in vitro, and it has been suggested that cessation of these may be therapeutic (<LINK REF="REF-Ruocco-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruocco 2001</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-10-19 13:15:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Pemphigus is a serious disease which can be difficult to treat, and there is no consensus among experts regarding treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Mimouni-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mimouni 2003</LINK>). There are many unresolved questions regarding management of pemphigus (<LINK REF="REF-Martin-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin 2008</LINK>). Despite advances in management, the mortality rate is currently estimated at 5 to 10%, and the major morbidity and mortality in pemphigus is due to complications of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Bystryn-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bystryn 1996</LINK>). Systemic glucocorticoids are the mainstay of treatment, however the optimal regimen has not been established. Steroid-sparing adjuvant medications are widely used, however it is not known if they are beneficial, nor which agent is preferable. The role of other systemic therapies and topical agents is not known.</P>

<P>Two authors (LM and AA) independently assessed the quality of included studies, and we resolved any differences through discussion with a third author (DM). Quality assessment included an evaluation of the following components for each study meeting the selection criteria:<BR/>(a) the method of generation of the randomisation sequence;<BR/>(b) the method of allocation concealment - it was be considered 'adequate' if the assignment could not be foreseen. This was coded in the 'Risk of bias' table as A - adequate, B - unclear, C - inadequate, D - not used;<BR/>(c) who was blinded / not blinded (participants, clinicians, outcome assessors);<BR/>(d) how many participants were lost to follow up in each arm;<BR/>(e) whether participants were analysed in the groups to which they were originally randomised (intention to treat).</P>
<P>In addition, we assessed the following:<BR/>(f) baseline assessment of the participants for age, sex, duration and severity of disease;<BR/>(g) aims, interventions (including drug doses and duration of treatment) and outcome measures clearly defined;<BR/>(h) use and appropriateness of statistical analyses.</P>
<P>We recorded the information in the table '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' and described the quality of each study based on a summary of these components.

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2008-11-10 09:56:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<P>We summarised information from included trials in tables and narrative form. We expressed results as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and difference in means (MWD) with 95% CI for continuous outcomes. We presented 'Number needed to treat' (NNT) for dichotomous outcomes which reached statistical significance. For time to event outcomes, we expressed results as hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence intervals.<BR/>
<BR/>We inspected adverse events reported in included studies. We only included withdrawal due to adverse events in the analysis and discussed other adverse events in the results section.<BR/>
<BR/>We assessed short-term benefit with the outcome 'disease control' and long-term benefit with the outcome 'remission'.</P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2008-10-15 09:56:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<P>Internally controlled trials were not pooled with studies of other designs. In studies in which multiple relapses per participant were reported, only one relapse per participant was included in the analysis. Where there were multiple intervention groups within a trial, pair-wise comparisons were made of similar active interventions versus another active intervention. Care was taken to ensure than the same group of participants was not included twice within a meta-analysis. Where there were multiple observations on each participant, such as for the outcome antibody titre, only the baseline and longest follow-up data from each trial were analysed. Non-independent hazard ratios were calculated by specifying the variance estimators allowing for intra class correlations.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Dichotomous data</HEADING>
<P>For the dichotomous outcomes, remission, control and relapse, we conducted an intention-to-treat analysis. Participants with missing outcome data were regarded as treatment failures and included in the analysis. For the dichotomous outcomes of death and withdrawal due to adverse events, an available case analysis was conducted. The conditional outcome 'relapse after remission' was re-defined as a composite outcome 'relapse after remission or unable to achieve remission'.</P>

<P>Where it was not possible to perform a meta-analysis, for example where reported outcomes were dissimilar to outcomes prespecified in the protocol for this review (<LINK REF="REF-Martin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin 2006</LINK>), data was summarised for each trial narratively in the results section. Studies with differing definitions of 'remission' were summarised in narrative form, as these definitions were too heterogeneous for a meta-analysis.

One study was a left-right comparison trial of a topical agent (<LINK REF="STD-Tabrizi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Tabrizi 2007</LINK>), and the remaining 10 examined systemic interventions. Duration of follow-up was generally adequate, ranging from nine months to five years, although in two studies the duration of follow-up was unclear (<LINK REF="STD-Guillaume-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Guillaume 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Luo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Luo 2003</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Sample sizes</HEADING>
<P>The sample sizes of included studies were small, ranging from 19 to 120 participants. The small sample sizes are understandable, given the rarity of pemphigus which makes recruitment for large studies difficult, however small sample sizes decrease the power of studies.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Azathioprine</HEADING>
<P>Azathioprine was evaluated in three studies, including comparisons with glucocorticoids alone (prednisolone) (<LINK REF="STD-Chams_x002d_Davatchi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chams-Davatchi 2007</LINK>), cyclophosphamide (<LINK REF="STD-Chams_x002d_Davatchi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chams-Davatchi 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rose-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rose 2005</LINK>) and mycophenolate (<LINK REF="STD-Beissert-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Beissert 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chams_x002d_Davatchi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chams-Davatchi 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Azathioprine was less effective than mycophenolate in achieving disease control based on one study with 40 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Beissert-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Beissert 2006</LINK>). The effect of azathioprine on disease control compared to cyclophosphamide was inconclusive (<LINK REF="STD-Rose-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rose 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Azathioprine appears to have a steroid-sparing effect compared to prednisolone alone, based on one study with 57 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Chams_x002d_Davatchi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chams-Davatchi 2007</LINK>). Azathioprine appears to have a superior steroid-sparing effect compared to cyclophosphamide based on one study with 51 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Chams_x002d_Davatchi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chams-Davatchi 2007</LINK>). Azathioprine appears to have a superior steroid-sparing effect compared to mycophenolate based on 2 studies with 92 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Beissert-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Beissert 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chams_x002d_Davatchi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chams-Davatchi 2007</LINK>). The clinical relevance of this steroid-sparing effect is not certain.</P>
<P>The effect of azathioprine on other outcomes including remission, death, relapse, or withdrawal due to adverse events was inconclusive. The effect of azathioprine on severity score, time to disease control, antibody titre and quality of life was not assessed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Cyclophosphamide</HEADING>
<P>Cyclophosphamide was evaluated in three studies, including comparisons with glucocorticoids alone (prednisolone and prednisone) (<LINK REF="STD-Chams_x002d_Davatchi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chams-Davatchi 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chrysomallis-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Chrysomallis 1994</LINK>), azathioprine (<LINK REF="STD-Chams_x002d_Davatchi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chams-Davatchi 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rose-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rose 2005</LINK>), cyclosporine (<LINK REF="STD-Chrysomallis-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Chrysomallis 1994</LINK>) and mycophenolate <LINK REF="STD-Chams_x002d_Davatchi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chams-Davatchi 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Cyclophosphamide appears to have a steroid-sparing effect compared to prednisolone alone based on one study with 54 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Chams_x002d_Davatchi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chams-Davatchi 2007</LINK>). Cyclophosphamide appears to have a superior steroid-sparing effect compared to mycophenolate based on one study with 54 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Chams_x002d_Davatchi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chams-Davatchi 2007</LINK>). Cyclophosphamide appears to have an inferior steroid-sparing effect compared to azathioprine (<LINK REF="STD-Chams_x002d_Davatchi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chams-Davatchi 2007</LINK>). The clinical relevance of this steroid-sparing effect is not certain.</P>
<P>The effect of cyclophosphamide on other outcomes including remission, death, disease control, relapse, withdrawal due to adverse events was inconclusive. The effect of cyclophosphamide on severity score, time to disease control, antibody titre and quality of life was not assessed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Mycophenolate</HEADING>
<P>Mycophenolate was evaluated in two studies, including comparisons with prednisolone alone (<LINK REF="STD-Chams_x002d_Davatchi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chams-Davatchi 2007</LINK>), azathioprine (<LINK REF="STD-Beissert-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Beissert 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chams_x002d_Davatchi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chams-Davatchi 2007</LINK>), and cyclophosphamide (<LINK REF="STD-Chams_x002d_Davatchi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chams-Davatchi 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Mycophenolate appears more effective than azathioprine in inducing disease control based on one study with 40 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Beissert-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Beissert 2006</LINK>). However mycophenolate had an inferior steroid-sparing effect compared to azathioprine based on one study with 51 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Chams_x002d_Davatchi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chams-Davatchi 2007</LINK>).

<P>Topical epidermal growth factor was evaluated in one study compared with control (<LINK REF="STD-Tabrizi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Tabrizi 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Topical epidermal growth factor appears to hasten lesion healing by a median of 6 days, based on one study with 20 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Tabrizi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Tabrizi 2007</LINK>). The long-term safety of this intervention is not known.</P>

<P>Initial prednisolone dose comparing 1mg/kg to 0.5mg/kg per day was evaluated in one study of 22 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Ratnam-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ratnam 1990</LINK>). The effect of prednisolone dose was inconclusive on all reported outcomes including death, disease control, relapse and withdrawal due to adverse events.

<P>Pulsed oral dexamethasone was evaluated in one study of 20 participants with new onset disease or disease activity (<LINK REF="STD-Mentink-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Mentink 2006</LINK>). The effect of pulsed oral dexamethasone was inconclusive on all reported outcomes including remission (defined as cessation of systemic treatment), death, relapse and withdrawal due to adverse events. Subjective inspection of the data demonstrated increased adverse events in the pulsed dexamethasone group.

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2008-11-03 10:54:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<P>Overall, the evidence regarding interventions for pemphigus is inconclusive and incomplete. There are many therapeutic interventions in use which have not been evaluated in well-designed controlled trials. These include a number of systemic immunomodulatory agents, including biological agents which have recently been developed. Oral glucocorticoids have a central role in management, however there are no randomised controlled trials evaluating glucocorticoids, and the use of glucocorticoids is established from case series (<LINK REF="REF-Bystryn-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bystryn 1984</LINK>). Of the trials which have been conducted, sample sizes were small and insufficient to yield definitive results. There are a large number of potential interventions in pemphigus for which the efficacy has not been adequately studied.</P>
<P>There is little known regarding disease prognosis, and response to treatment can vary between individuals. The majority of randomized controlled trials in pemphigus included newly diagnosed participants, and while there was a spectrum of disease severity in included studies, there is insufficient information to guide treatment according to disease severity. There are no trials of participants with recalcitrant disease, and evidence from these studies may not be applicable to this population. For example, no benefit was demonstrated for pulsed oral dexamethasone in newly diagnosed participants, however the role of pulsed glucocorticoids in recalcitrant disease has not been assessed. Studies used complex dose regimens to escalate and taper therapy, so results may not be applicable to other regimens of the same intervention.</P>
<P>Potential modalities to reduce the risk of adverse events were not evalualated in the included studies, including assessment of thiopurinemethyltransferase (TPMT) activity to assess the risk of myelosuppression with azathioprine. Use of adjuvant medications to reduce adverse events, such as bisphosphonates for prevention of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis varied between studies. This review did not examine the cost of interventions.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2008-10-15 12:30:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<P>In general the quality of evidence in included studies was poor. Allocation concealment, the most important determinant of study quality, was unclear in the majority of studies. Very few studies were blinded, making assessment of outcome open to bias.</P>
<P>Sample sizes of included studies were too small to establish statistically significant differences in the primary endpoints. Sample size calculations were not performed for the majority of studies, and other studies did not meet recruitment targets. Although small sample sizes are understandable given the rarity of the disease, the consequence is that trials were inadequately powered to establish definitive results.</P>
<P>Reporting of outcomes varied between studies. A number of studies had poor reporting of important outcomes, including clinical response and adverse events. Duration of follow-up was variable, limiting the capacity to conduct long-term risk-benefit analyses. In particular, duration of follow-up was inadequate to assess long-term adverse events such as fracture from glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis or secondary malignancy with cytotoxic agents.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2008-11-10 10:54:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<P>This review was intentionally broad in including all interventions for pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceus and a large number of outcomes. We aimed to collate and evaluate the available body of evidence. Although we were unable to establish the optimal treatment strategy, we were able to delineate areas for further research, and in the future it may be possible to refine the clinical questions assessed in this systematic review.</P>
<P>This review included only randomized controlled trials and excluded studies of other designs. We excluded one randomized controlled trial (<LINK REF="STD-Auad-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Auad 1986</LINK>) due to insufficient reporting of outcomes. Although it would be preferable to include available information from this study, outcomes of interest were not reported, presumably related to the pre-consort date of publication. Data from ongoing trials was not available for inclusion in this review.</P>
<P>In this review we combined data together for people with pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceus, although it is not known whether these two diseases have the same response to treatment. We initially intended to perform subgroup analyses for pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceus, however this was not performed, as there were insufficient participant numbers to make this worthwhile.</P>
<P>We analysed data from studies with differing routes and doses of an intervention and differing assays for antibody titre. The impact of this could be assessed in sensitivity analyses, however there were too few trials assessing the same intervention to make this worthwhile. There was considerable variation among included studies in outcomes reported and definitions of treatment endpoints. We analysed data from studies with differing definitions of disease control and relapse. We excluded definitions of remission which differed from that specified in the protocol for this review (<LINK REF="REF-Martin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin 2006</LINK>). Sensitivity analyses were conducted to look at the impact of a composite endpoint for conditional remission compared to an available case analysis; these showed no substantial difference in results.</P>
<P>This review incorporated a broad range of outcomes, including surrogate outcomes and biomarkers, the clinical value of which is not known. Cumulative glucocorticoid dose is a surrogate for glucocorticoid-induced adverse effects, although the translation of milligrams of glucocorticoid saved to clinical adverse events avoided is difficult to quantify. Similarly, the clinical relevance of change in serum antibody titre is not known.</P>
<P>There was missing data for several studies in this review which we were not able to obtain from authors. Where possible we conducted an intention-to-treat analysis, although in some cases there was only sufficient information to conduct an available case analysis. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to look at the impact of differing values of the correlation coefficient r for the imputed standard deviation difference for antibody titre (<LINK REF="STD-Luo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Luo 2003</LINK>), which showed no substantial difference in results.</P>
<P>Where studies included comparisons of multiple interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Chams_x002d_Davatchi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chams-Davatchi 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chrysomallis-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Chrysomallis 1994</LINK>), pair-wise comparisons were undertaken as specified in the protocol for this review (<LINK REF="REF-Martin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin 2006</LINK>). Statistical methods to compensate for multiple comparisons were not used.</P>
<P>This review only analysed withdrawal due to adverse events. We observed no difference in withdrawal due to adverse events for any intervention. However there were differences in adverse event profiles between interventions. Withdrawal due to adverse events does not reflect long-term safety of an intervention.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2008-11-10 10:54:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<P>No other systematic reviews have been conducted on interventions for pemphigus, however guidelines for the management of pemphigus vulgaris have been published which incorporate recommendations from all levels of evidence (<LINK REF="REF-Harman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harman 2003</LINK>).The guidelines conclude that there is 'fair evidence' to support use of adjuvant azathioprine, mycophenolate and cyclophosphamide, and 'poor evidence' on pulsed glucocorticoids, dapsone, cyclosporine, plasmapheresis, and topical therapies.</P>
<P>The findings of included studies were in agreement with results of 3 non-randomised controlled trials. A retrospective non-randomised controlled series on initial glucocorticoid dose compared initial doses of 1mg/kg/day or 2mg/dg/day prednisone in 28 participants, with groups assigned according to disease severity (<LINK REF="STD-Fernandes-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Fernandes 2001</LINK>). This study reported no difference in clinical response, and higher incidence of adverse events in the 2mg/kg/day group, particularly infection and death. A non-randomised controlled trial on pulsed glucocorticoids comparing oral prednisone or pulsed intravenous betamethasone in twenty participants with pemphigus vulgaris observed no difference in time to resolution of disease (<LINK REF="STD-Femiano-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Femiano 2002</LINK>). A non-randomised controlled trial of pulsed cyclophosphamide and methylprednisolone versus oral prednisolone and azathioprine in 123 participants with pemphigus vulgaris showed no difference in clinical response, remission or adverse events (<LINK REF="STD-Shahidi_x002d_Dadras-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Shahidi-Dadras 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>This review found insufficient evidence to determine the role of adjuvant immunosuppressive agents in pemphigus. While adjuvant immunosuppressants are widely used to minimize glucocorticoid-related adverse effects in other fields of medicine, such as rheumatology and transplantation medicine, their use in pemphigus is controversial and opinions vary among experts. This review demonstrated a steroid-sparing effect for azathioprine and cyclophosphamide compared to prednisolone alone, however no difference was seen in clinical endpoints.</P>
<P>The mortality rate observed in the plasma-exchange study is higher than the complication rate reported in studies of plasma-exchange for other indications (<LINK REF="REF-Reimann-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reimann 1990</LINK>). The participants included in this study had a severe baseline disease, and it is not possible to know whether the high mortality observed was due to the disease or to treatment. (<LINK REF="STD-Guillaume-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Guillaume 1988</LINK>).</P>

<P>The optimal therapeutic strategy for pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceus is not known. Multiple potential therapeutic modalities are available and multiple regimens are in use, making choice of treatment schedule complex. Few randomised controlled trials have been conducted, and those performed were limited by small sample sizes.</P>
<P>Systemic glucocorticoids have a central role in the management of pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceus, although the optimal dose regimen is not known. Adjuvant pulsed glucocorticoids did not appear beneficial in a small study in participants with new onset disease, although their role in recalicitrant disease has not been assessed.</P>
<P>The role of immunomodulatory adjuvants has not been established. There is evidence of a steroid<B>-</B>sparing role for azathioprine and cyclophosphamide, although there was no benefit observed in clinical endpoints. The optimal adjuvant has not been established. Mycophenolate showed superior disease control compared to azathioprine, although azathioprine and cyclophosphamide showed superior steroid-sparing capacity compared to mycophenolate. The effects of cyclosporine, dapsone, plasma-exchange and traditional Chinese medicine is unclear.</P>
<P>Topical epidermal growth factor appears to decrease time required for healing of erosions, however the long-term safety of this intervention is not known.</P>
<P>No difference was observed in death or withdrawal due to adverse events, although interventions have differing adverse event profiles and these small studies are not sufficient to address safety comparisons of these drugs. Careful consideration of potential benefits and potential adverse events in context of the individual's comorbidities is required.</P>
