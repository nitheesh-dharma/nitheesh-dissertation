<P>No randomized controlled trials to compare 'open surgery' with 'keyhole surgery' in pregnant women for non-malignant tumors of the ovary.</P>
<P>A small number of women have tumors of the ovaries diagnosed during pregnancy. Most of these tumors are not malignant, and if they are small then treatment can be left until after the birth. However, if the tumour is larger that 6 cm in diameter, it is suggested that it is better to operate and remove them during pregnancy, as they may interfere with the birth of the baby. Surgical procedures for these non-malignant tumors of the ovary in pregnancy can be performed by open surgery (laparotomy) or keyhole surgery (laparoscopy) techniques. Historically, open surgery has been used, but new keyhole surgery seems attractive in that it appears to require a shorter hospital stay and there is a quicker return to normal activities for women. However, the infusion of gas into the abdomen during the key-hole procedure may have adverse effects on the baby, and an additional gasless technique is also under study. This review aimed to address the question of which surgical technique might be better as all have benefits and risks to the mother and the baby. There were no randomized controlled trials identified that compared the effects of using keyhole surgery for benign tumors of the ovary during pregnancy on maternal and fetal health. There was some evidence available from case series studies, but more research is needed on the potential benefits and harms associated with this new surgical technique in pregnancy.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>The surgical management of ovarian tumors in pregnancy is similar to that of non-pregnant women. The procedures include resection of the tumor (enucleation), removal of an ovary or ovaries (oophorectomy), or surgical excision of the fallopian tube and ovary (salpingo-oophorectomy). The procedure can be done by open surgery (laparotomy) or keyhole surgery (laparoscopy) technique. The benefits of laparoscopic surgery include shorter hospital stay, earlier return to normal activity, and reduced postoperative pain. However, conventional laparoscopic surgery techniques required the infusion of gas carbon dioxide in the peritoneum to distend the abdomen and displace the bowel upward to create the room for surgical manipulation. Serious complications such as abnormally high levels of carbon dioxide in the circulating blood (hypercarbia) and perforation of internal organs have also been reported. These serious complication may be harmful to the fetus. </P>

<P>The practice of laparoscopic surgery for benign ovarian tumour during pregnancy is associated with benefits and harms. However, the evidence for the magnitude of these benefits and harms is drawn from case series studies, associated with potential bias. The results and conclusions of these studies must therefore be interpreted with caution.</P>
<P>The available case series studies of laparoscopic surgery for benign ovarian tumour during pregnancy provide limited insight into the potential benefits and harms associated with this new surgical technique in pregnancy. Randomized controlled trials are required to provide the most reliable evidence regarding the benefits and harms of laparoscopic surgery for benign ovarian tumour during pregnancy. </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-07-31 09:37:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>Ultrasound scanning during early pregnancy has increased the number of ovarian tumors identified. The ovarian tumor can be classified as benign or malignant. During pregnancy, ovarian tumors are mostly benign. Most women present with the problem of discrepancy between the uterine size and gestational age, palpable mass, and abdominal pain. The serous cystadenoma and dermoid cyst are the two most common pathologies found (<LINK REF="REF-Hess-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hess 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jacob-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacob 1990</LINK>). Ovarian tumor in pregnancy requiring surgical intervention has an incidence ranging from 0.0004% to 0.36% (<LINK REF="REF-Graber-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graber 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sherard-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sherard 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wang-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 1999</LINK>). The surgical procedure is similar to that of non-pregnant women. Elective surgical removal is recommended for any mass larger than 6 cm in diameter that continues to exist into the second trimester, unless the mass is suspected to be a uterine fibroid (leiomyoma) (<LINK REF="REF-Hess-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hess 1988</LINK>). There are the risks of torsion, rupture or leakage of the cysts as pregnancy advances.</P>
<P>The surgical treatment performed is resection of the tumor (enucleation), removal of an ovary or ovaries (oophorectomy), or surgical excision of the fallopian tube and ovary (salpingo-oophorectomy). The surgery can be done by open surgery (laparotomy) or keyhole surgery (laparoscopy) technique (<LINK REF="REF-Pittaway-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pittaway 1994</LINK>). Laparoscopic surgery involves using an endoscope inserted into or through the abdominal wall to view abdominal, or pelvic organs, or both, while operating with instruments introduced through separate small incisions.</P>
<P>Laparoscopic surgery has been extensively used as a treatment for many diseases. It has been performed successfully in pregnancy for many conditions, for example removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) (<LINK REF="REF-Pucci-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pucci 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soper-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soper 1992</LINK>), removal of the appendix (appendectomy) (<LINK REF="REF-Schreiber-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schreiber 1990</LINK>), and ovarian torsion (<LINK REF="REF-Lang-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lang 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shalev-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shalev 1990</LINK>). In case of suspected malignant ovarian tumor, the laparoscopic surgery should be avoided due to the risk of port site metastasis and inadequate surgical staging (<LINK REF="REF-Agostini-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agostini 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morice-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morice 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morice-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morice 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The benefits of laparoscopic surgery include shorter hospital stay, earlier return to normal activity, and reduced postoperative pain (<LINK REF="REF-Mais-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mais 1995</LINK>). However, conventional laparoscopic surgery techniques required the infusion of gas carbon dioxide in the peritoneum to distend the abdomen and displace the bowel upward to create the room for surgical manipulation. Serious complications such as hypercarbia and perforation of internal organs have also been reported. Many reports recommend clinicians avoid using the gas carbon dioxide to inflate the abdomen, as animal studies suggest that it increases intra-abdominal pressure which leads to the decrease of the uterine blood flow which can be hazardous to the fetus (<LINK REF="REF-Jansen-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jansen 1979</LINK>). A further animal study confirmed this finding and reported decreased uterine blood flow from using the gas carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum (<LINK REF="REF-Curet-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curet 1996</LINK>). Thus, the new method of the gasless laparoscopic technique has been suggested (<LINK REF="REF-Akira-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akira 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bunyavejchevin-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bunyavejchevin 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Since the 1990s, there have been many reports exploring the relative merits and potential risks of laparoscopic surgery for benign ovarian tumors in pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Lin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nezhat-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nezhat 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yamada-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yamada 2004</LINK>). Evidence for the safety of the laparoscopic technique during pregnancy has not been fully evaluated.</P>

<P>We planned to carry out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>).

If there is clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differ between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity is detected, we planned to use random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary if an average treatment effect across trials is considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary will be treated as the average range of possible treatment effects and we will discuss the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect is not clinically meaningful we will not combine trials.</P>

<DISCUSSION>
<P>There were no randomized controlled trials identified that compared the effects of using laparoscopic surgery for benign ovarian tumor during pregnancy on maternal and fetal health and the use of healthcare resources.</P>
<P>There are risks and benefits for both laparoscopic surgery and laparotomy in pregnancy, current sources of information are limited to only case series reports (<LINK REF="REF-Loh--1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loh 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oguri-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oguri 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Patacchiola-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patacchiola 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>To confirm the safety of laparoscopic treatment for benign ovarian tumour during pregnancy, there is a need for methodologically rigorous studies to provide direct evidence about the relative benefits and harms of and for laparoscopic surgery for benign ovarian tumor compared to laparotomy in pregnancy. This information is best obtained from randomized controlled trials, as this methodology limits the potential for bias and provides the most reliable evidence regarding the benefits and harms of both forms of surgery.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-07-03 10:36:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The practice of laparoscopic surgery for benign ovarian tumour during pregnancy are associated with benefits and risks. However, the evidence for the magnitude of these benefits and harms is drawn from case series studies, associated with potential bias. The results and conclusions of these studies must therefore, be interpreted with caution.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The available case series studies of laparoscopic surgery for the benign ovarian tumour during pregnancy provide limited insight into the potential benefits and harms associated with this new surgical technique in pregnancy. Randomized controlled trials are required to provide the most reliable evidence regarding the benefits and harms of laparoscopy surgery for the benign ovarian tumour during pregnancy. Outcomes of interest could be those listed in this review. </P>
