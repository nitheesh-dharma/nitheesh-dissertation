<P>Inducing labour with intravenous prostaglandin is effective but has adverse effects. Induction of labour is common when continuing the pregnancy poses a greater risk to the mother or her unborn child. Prostaglandins, produced naturally by the body, can ripen the cervix and stimulate contractions. This review found that giving prostaglandins intravenously during the third trimester of pregnancy is effective in inducing labour, but is more expensive and causes more adverse effects than oxytocin (another hormone for inducing labour).</P>

<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Thirteen trials (1165 women) were included in the review.</P>
<P>The use of intravenous prostaglandin was associated with higher rates of uterine hyperstimulation both with changes in the fetal heart rate (relative risk (RR) 6.76, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23 to 37.11) and without (RR 4.25, 95% CI 1.48 to 12.24) compared to oxytocin. Use of prostaglandin was also associated with significantly more maternal side-effects (gastrointestinal, thrombophlebitis and pyrexia, RR 3.75, 95% CI 2.46 to 5.70) than oxytocin. Prostaglandin was no more likely to result in vaginal delivery than oxytocin (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.18).</P>
<P>No significant differences emerged from subgroup analysis or from the trials comparing combination oxytocin/prostaglandin F2 alpha and oxytocin or extra-amniotic versus intravenous prostaglandin E2.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2010-05-08 22:54:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Induction of labour is a common obstetric practice performed when continuing the pregnancy is felt to be of greater risk to the physical or mental wellbeing of either the mother or her unborn child. </P>
<P>Prostaglandins are produced naturally by the body and are implicated in the onset and progression of spontaneous labour (<LINK REF="REF-Johnston-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnston 1993</LINK>). Prostaglandins are capable not only of inducing cervical ripening but also stimulating uterine contractions resulting in labour, hence they may be more efficient than other agents such as oxytocin which rely mainly on stimulating uterine contractions. The use of prostaglandins for cervical ripening appears to reduce analgesic requirements, operative delivery and non-delivery within 12 to 24 hours at the expense of increased uterine hyperstimulation and maternal gastrointestinal side-effects in up to 7% of cases (<LINK REF="REF-Keirse-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keirse 1993</LINK>). The two most widely used types of prostaglandins are prostaglandin E2 and prostaglandin F2 alpha. Routes of administration include oral, extra-amniotic and intravenous. Despite no evidence of increased fetal side-effects (<LINK REF="STD-Lindmark-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Lindmark 1976</LINK>), use of intravenous prostaglandin has diminished in recent years because of perceived high rates of maternal gastrointestinal and cutaneous side-effects compared to intravenous oxytocin (<LINK REF="REF-MacKenzie-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacKenzie 1999</LINK>). </P>
<P>This review is one of a series of reviews of methods of labour induction using a standardised protocol. For more detailed information on the rationale for this methodological approach, please refer to the currently published protocol (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2000</LINK>).</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine, from the best available evidence, the effectiveness and safety of intravenous prostaglandin for third trimester cervical ripening and induction of labour.</P>

<P>Intravenous prostaglandin compared with placebo/no treatment or any other method above it on a predefined list of methods of labour induction.

<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2008-08-13 12:21:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Clinically relevant outcomes for trials of methods of cervical ripening/labour induction have been prespecified by two authors of labour induction reviews (Justus Hofmeyr and Zarko Alfirevic). Differences were settled by discussion.</P>
<P>Five primary outcomes were chosen as being most representative of the clinically important measures of effectiveness and complications. Subgroup analyses were limited to the primary outcomes:</P>
<P>(1) vaginal delivery not achieved within 24 hours;<BR/>(2) uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate (FHR) changes;<BR/>(3) caesarean section;<BR/>(4) serious neonatal morbidity or perinatal death (e.g. seizures, birth asphyxia defined by trialists, neonatal encephalopathy, disability in childhood);<BR/>(5) serious maternal morbidity or death (e.g. uterine rupture, admission to intensive care unit, septicaemia).</P>
<P>Perinatal and maternal morbidity and mortality are composite outcomes. This is not an ideal solution because some components are clearly less severe than others. It is possible for one intervention to cause more deaths but less severe morbidity. However, in the context of labour induction at term this was unlikely. Composite outcomes also provide heightened sensitivity to a change in the incidence of these rare events. The incidence of individual components was explored as secondary outcomes (<I>see</I> below).</P>
<P>Secondary outcomes relate to measures of effectiveness, complications and satisfaction:</P>
<P>Measures of effectiveness:<BR/>(6) cervix unfavourable/unchanged after 12 to 24 hours;<BR/>(7) oxytocin augmentation.</P>
<P>Complications:<BR/>(8) uterine hyperstimulation without FHR changes;<BR/>(9) uterine rupture;<BR/>(10) epidural analgesia;<BR/>(11) instrumental vaginal delivery;<BR/>(12) meconium stained liquor;<BR/>(13) Apgar score less than seven at five minutes;<BR/>(14) neonatal intensive care unit admission;<BR/>(15) neonatal encephalopathy;<BR/>(16) perinatal death;<BR/>(17) disability in childhood;<BR/>(18) maternal side-effects (all);<BR/>(19) maternal nausea;<BR/>(20) maternal vomiting;<BR/>(21) maternal diarrhoea;<BR/>(22) other maternal side-effects;<BR/>(23) postpartum haemorrhage (as defined by the trial authors);<BR/>(24) serious maternal complications (e.g. intensive care unit admission, septicaemia but excluding uterine rupture);<BR/>(25) maternal death.</P>
<P>Measures of satisfaction:<BR/>(26) woman not satisfied;<BR/>(27) caregiver not satisfied.</P>
<P>While all the above outcomes were sought, only those with data appear in the analysis tables.</P>
<P>The terminology of uterine hyperstimulation is problematic (Curtis 1987). In the reviews we used the term 'uterine hyperstimulation without FHR changes' to include uterine tachysystole (more than five contractions per 10 minutes for at least 20 minutes) and uterine hypersystole/hypertonus (a contraction lasting at least two minutes) and 'uterine hyperstimulation with FHR changes' to denote uterine hyperstimulation syndrome (tachysystole or hypersystole with fetal heart rate changes such as persistent decelerations, tachycardia or decreased short term variability).</P>
<P>Outcomes were included in the analysis if reasonable measures were taken to minimise observer bias and data were available for analysis according to original allocation.</P>

<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-08-13 12:23:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A strategy was developed to deal with the large volume and complexity of trial data relating to labour induction. Many methods have been studied, in many different categories of women undergoing labour induction. Most trials are intervention-driven, comparing two or more methods in various categories of women. Clinicians and parents need the data arranged by category of woman, to be able to choose which method is best for a particular clinical scenario. To extract these data from several hundred trial reports in a single step would be very difficult. We therefore developed a two-stage method of data extraction. The initial data extraction was done in a series of primary reviews arranged by methods of induction of labour, following a standardised methodology. The data will then be extracted from the primary reviews into a series of secondary reviews, arranged by category of woman.</P>
<P>To avoid duplication of data in the primary reviews, the labour induction methods have been listed in a specific order, from one to 25. Each primary review includes comparisons between one of the methods (from two to 25) with only those methods above it on the list. Thus, the review of intravenous oxytocin (4) will include only comparisons with intracervical prostaglandins (3), vaginal prostaglandins (2), or placebo (1). Methods identified in the future will be added to the end of the list. The current list is as follows:</P>
<OL>
<LI>placebo/no treatment;</LI>
<LI>vaginal prostaglandins;</LI>
<LI>intracervical prostaglandins;</LI>
<LI>intravenous oxytocin;</LI>
<LI>amniotomy;</LI>
<LI>intravenous oxytocin with amniotomy;</LI>
<LI>vaginal misoprostol;</LI>
<LI>oral misoprostol;</LI>
<LI>mechanical methods including extra-amniotic Foley catheter;</LI>
<LI>membrane sweeping;</LI>
<LI>extra-amniotic prostaglandins;</LI>
<LI>intravenous prostaglandins;</LI>
<LI>oral prostaglandins;</LI>
<LI>mifepristone;</LI>
<LI>oestrogens with/without amniotomy;</LI>
<LI>corticosteroids;</LI>
<LI>relaxin;</LI>
<LI>hyaluronidase;</LI>
<LI>castor oil, bath, and/or enema;</LI>
<LI>acupuncture;</LI>
<LI>breast stimulation;</LI>
<LI>sexual intercourse;</LI>
<LI>homeopathic methods;</LI>
<LI>nitric oxide;</LI>
<LI>buccal or sublingual misoprostol;</LI>
<LI>hypnosis.</LI>
</OL>
<P>The primary reviews will be analysed by the following subgroups:</P>
<OL>
<LI>previous caesarean section or not;</LI>
<LI>nulliparity or multiparity;</LI>
<LI>membranes intact or ruptured;</LI>
<LI>cervix favourable, unfavourable or undefined.</LI>
</OL>
<P>The secondary reviews will include all methods of labour induction for each of the categories of women for which subgroup analysis has been done in the primary reviews, and will include only five primary outcome measures. There will thus be six secondary reviews of methods of labour induction in the following groups of women:</P>
<OL>
<LI>nulliparous, intact membranes (unfavourable cervix, favourable cervix, cervix not defined);</LI>
<LI>nulliparous, ruptured membranes (unfavourable cervix, favourable cervix, cervix not defined);</LI>
<LI>multiparous, intact membranes (unfavourable cervix, favourable cervix, cervix not defined);</LI>
<LI>multiparous, ruptured membranes (unfavourable cervix, favourable cervix, cervix not defined);</LI>
<LI>previous caesarean section, intact membranes (unfavourable cervix, favourable cervix, cervix not defined);</LI>
<LI>previous caesarean section, ruptured membranes (unfavourable cervix, favourable cervix, cervix not defined).</LI>
</OL>
<P>Each time a primary review is updated with new data, those secondary reviews which include data which have changed will also be updated.</P>
<P>The trials included in the primary reviews were extracted from an initial set of trials covering all interventions used in induction of labour (<I>see</I> above for details of search strategy). The data extraction process was conducted centrally. This was co-ordinated from the Clinical Effectiveness Support Unit (CESU) at the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, UK, in co-operation with the Pregnancy and Childbirth Group of The Cochrane Collaboration. This process allowed the data extraction process to be standardised across all the reviews.</P>
<P>The trials are initially reviewed on eligibility criteria, using a standardised form and the basic selection criteria specified above. Following this, data were extracted to a standardised data extraction form which was piloted for consistency and completeness. The pilot process involved the researchers at the CESU and previous review authors in the area of induction of labour.</P>
<P>Information was extracted regarding the methodological quality of trials on a number of levels. This process was completed without consideration of trial results. Assessment of selection bias examined the process involved in the generation of the random sequence and the method of allocation concealment separately. These were then judged as adequate or inadequate using the criteria described in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> for the purpose of the reviews.</P>
<P>We examined performance bias with regards to whom was blinded in the trials i.e. participant, caregiver, outcome assessor or analyst. In many trials the caregiver, assessor and analyst were the same party. We sought details of the feasibility and appropriateness of blinding at all levels.</P>
<P>Predefined subgroup analyses are: previous caesarean section or not; nulliparity or multiparity; membranes intact or ruptured, and cervix unfavourable, favourable or undefined. Only those outcomes with data will appear in the analysis tables.</P>
<P>Individual outcome data are included in the analysis if they meet the prestated criteria in 'Types of outcome measures'. Included trial data are processed as described in the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 1999</LINK>). Data extracted from the trials are analysed on an intention-to-treat basis (when this was not done in the original report, re-analysis is performed if possible). Where data are missing, clarification is sought from the original authors. If the attrition was such that it might significantly affect the results, these data are excluded from the analysis. This decision rests with the review authors of primary reviews and is clearly documented. Once missing data become available, they will be included in the analyses.</P>
<P>We extracted data from all eligible trials to examine how issues of quality influence effect size in a sensitivity analysis. In trials where reporting is poor, methodological issues are reported as unclear or clarification sought.</P>
<P>Due to the large number of trials, double data extraction was not feasible and agreement between the three data extractors is therefore assessed on a random sample of trials.</P>
<P>Once the data have been extracted, they were distributed to individual review authors for entry onto the Review Manager computer software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 1999</LINK>), checked for accuracy, and analysed as above using the RevMan software. For dichotomous data, relative risks and 95% confidence intervals are calculated, and in the absence of heterogeneity, results are pooled using a fixed-effect model.</P>
<P>The predefined criteria for sensitivity analysis include all aspects of quality assessment as mentioned above, including aspects of selection, performance and attrition bias.</P>
<P>Primary analysis is limited to the prespecified outcomes and subgroup analyses. In the event of differences in unspecified outcomes or subgroups being found, these are analysed post hoc, but clearly identified as such to avoid drawing unjustified conclusions.</P>

<P>Two trial reports (<LINK REF="REF-Kanhai-1988a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanhai 1988a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kanhai-1988b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanhai 1988b</LINK>) contained preliminary data that were published subsequently. However, this work reported data collected from women who had suffered intrauterine fetal death and were therefore not suitable for inclusion (<I>see</I> 'Characteristics of excluded studies'). A further trial (<LINK REF="STD-Spellacy-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Spellacy 1972</LINK>) contained data included in another report (<LINK REF="STD-Spellacy-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Spellacy 1973</LINK> - <I>see</I> included trials) and hence was excluded.</P>
<P>In a further nine trials, primary or secondary outcome data were either not reported directly or were not extractable (<LINK REF="STD-Bremme-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Bremme 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Calder-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Calder 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Le-Maire-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Le Maire 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lindmark-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Lindmark 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lipshitz-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Lipshitz 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reichel-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Reichel 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosa-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Rosa 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scher-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Scher 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spellacy-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Spellacy 1971</LINK>). The trial reported by Thomsen (<LINK REF="STD-Thomsen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Thomsen 1987</LINK>) consisted of design details only with no results. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Heerden-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Van Heerden 1992</LINK>) reported a comparison of induction of labour with intravenous oxytocin and intravenous prostaglandin (if required) immediately or after 24 hours in women presenting with ruptured membranes. No appropriate data were available.</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Amano-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Amano 1999</LINK>) reported a comparison of nulliparous women with unfavourable cervices randomised to either laminara tents or oral prostaglandin E2 and those with favourable cervices being randomised to intravenous oxytocin or intravenous prostaglandin F2 alpha. It was not possible to extract outcome data by actual method of induction. The trial reported by Anderson et al (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1972</LINK>) was described as a double blind study with women being assigned to receive intravenous oxytocin, intravenous prostaglandin E2 or F2 alpha, however the administration protocol for prostaglandin E2 was changed after 21 women had been recruited because of poor response. The women do not appear to have been allocated in a random fashion to each of the three treatment arms. One further study (<LINK REF="STD-Brandel-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Brandel 1998</LINK>) is reported as a randomised controlled trial, however no details are given about the method of randomisation, in addition, significantly more women were assigned to receive intravenous prostaglandin E2 (n = 43) than intravaginal prostaglandin (n = 36) implying selection bias.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Included trials</HEADING>
<P>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Iskander-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Iskander 1978</LINK>) compared extra-amniotic prostaglandin E2 with intravenous prostaglandin E2 in 40 women. Naismith et al (<LINK REF="STD-Naismith-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Naismith 1972</LINK>) report a trial comparing intravenous oxytocin and prostaglandin E2 against intravenous oxytocin alone in 20 nulliparous women. All other included trials report a comparison of either prostaglandin E2 or F2 alpha with intravenous oxytocin (<I>see</I> 'Characteristics of included studies').</P>
<P>Two trials randomised women to receive either intravenous oxytocin, prostaglandin E2 or F2 alpha as part of a three armed study (<LINK REF="STD-Gowenlock-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Gowenlock 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Naismith-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Naismith 1973</LINK>).

<P>Two studies utilised random lot drawing using pre-prepared cards (<LINK REF="STD-Naismith-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Naismith 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Naismith-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Naismith 1973</LINK>) and three studies used random number tables (<LINK REF="STD-Spellacy-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Spellacy 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vroman-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Vroman 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wildemeersch-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Wildemeersch 1976</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Blinding</HEADING>
<P>No attempt was made at blinding in five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Gowenlock-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Gowenlock 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Iskander-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Iskander 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moller-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Moller 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Naismith-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Naismith 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rangarajan-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Rangarajan 1971</LINK>). Under those circumstances, there is a real possibility of bias, both in the clinical decision-making and assessment of outcomes. A clinician with a prior belief that a new treatment is effective and safe might be less likely to perform a caesarean section in case of fetal distress or slow labour. On the other hand, a clinician who is anxious about possible risks of the new treatment may be more likely to intervene. In eight studies, adequate concealment of allocation sequence and blinding to both clinician and woman was achieved by preparation of coded drug boxes (<LINK REF="STD-Baxi-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Baxi 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Beazley-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Beazley 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Calder-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Calder 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Naismith-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Naismith 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spellacy-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Spellacy 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vakhariya-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Vakhariya 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vroman-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Vroman 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wildemeersch-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Wildemeersch 1976</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Intravenous prostaglandin versus intravenous oxytocin - all women</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(i) Primary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>There were no significant differences in women failing to achieve a vaginal delivery within 24 hours in either the prostaglandin group (10.2%) or the oxytocin group (11.8% relative risk (RR) 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61 to 1.18). Significantly more episodes of uterine hypertonus associated with fetal heart rate (FHR) changes were seen in the intravenous prostaglandin group (RR 6.76, 95% CI 1.23 to 37.11). It is, however, surprising that no episodes of FHR changes in association with uterine hyperstimulation were seen in the oxytocin group. Caesarean section was performed for 4.9% of women receiving prostaglandin compared to 3.3% of women receiving oxytocin (RR 1.52, 95% CI 0.84 to 2.78). No serious maternal morbidity was reported in 449 women receiving intravenous prostaglandin or 441 women receiving oxytocin. There were four reports of serious adverse neonatal outcomes accounted for by four perinatal deaths in 491 women receiving prostaglandin compared to no perinatal deaths in 483 women treated with oxytocin (RR 3.59, 95% CI 0.60 to 21.54). Two perinatal deaths were in women treated with prostaglandin E2 (<LINK REF="STD-Beazley-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Beazley 1970</LINK>), one was an intrapartum death in a woman induced for a prolonged pregnancy and a previous stillbirth and the second was a neonatal death occurring after delivery of a depressed infant (five minute Apgar score three) with the cord tightly around the neck. Two neonatal deaths occurred in women treated with prostaglandin F2 alpha, one occurred in an infant delivered by caesarean section for fetal heart bradycardia in association with uterine hyperstimulation (<LINK REF="STD-Spellacy-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Spellacy 1973</LINK>) and one was attributed to fulminating group B haemolytic streptococcus infection in a term infant born after a six hour labour, the membranes being ruptured two hours prior to delivery (<LINK REF="STD-Baxi-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Baxi 1980</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(ii) Other outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Significantly more women (10.7%) receiving prostaglandin developed uterine hyperstimulation without FHR changes than those receiving oxytocin (2.5% RR 4.25, 95% CI 1.48 to 12.24). Maternal side-effects were more common in women treated with prostaglandin compared to those receiving oxytocin (RR 3.75, 95% CI 2.46 to 5.70) including nausea (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.74 to 5.41), vomiting (RR 1.88, 95% CI 0.91 to 3.86) and diarrhoea (RR 4.66, 95% CI 0.23 to 95.88). Significantly more women (9.2%) treated with prostaglandin developed thrombophlebitis compared to oxytocin (0.3% RR 10.67, 95% CI 3.3 to 34.45). Similarly more women (37.0%) in the prostaglandin group developed a pyrexia compared to those receiving oxytocin (11.4% RR 3.25, 95% 1.59 to 6.62).</P>
<P>No other significant differences were found. As stated above four perinatal deaths were encountered in women treated with prostaglandin compared to none amongst women treated with oxytocin (RR 3.59, 95% CI 0.60 to 21.54).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Currently available data indicate that the use of intravenous prostaglandins to induce labour is associated with significantly higher rates of maternal side-effects (gastrointestinal disturbance, thrombophlebitis and pyrexia) compared with oxytocin. There is no evidence to suggest that intravenous prostaglandins are more efficient in inducing labour, indeed they are associated with higher rates of uterine hyperstimulation both with and without fetal heart rate (FHR) changes (although it is surprising that no episodes of hyperstimulation with FHR changes were reported amongst 191 women receiving oxytocin).</P>
<P>It is of concern that four perinatal deaths occurred in infants of women treated with prostaglandin and none in women treated with oxytocin however the death reported by Baxi (<LINK REF="STD-Baxi-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Baxi 1980</LINK>) was secondary to beta haemolytic streptococcae infection and respiratory distress. It should be stressed that these deaths constitute only a trend and are not statistically significant. Use of intravenous prostaglandins was not associated with lower Apgar scores than intravenous oxytocin, however none of the included trials reported data on admissions to neonatal intensive care units, umbilical cord blood sampling or long term neurological sequelae and so these excess deaths must be interpreted with caution. The data are not robust enough to allow comparisons of severe adverse maternal outcomes. </P>
<P>Analysis of trials reporting the use of prostaglandin E2 and/or prostaglandin F2 alpha gave similar findings. As stated in the methodology, analysis was not performed according to individual infusion dosage regime and this compromises the heterogeneity of included trials.</P>
<P>Insufficient data exist to assess the combination of intravenous prostaglandins with oxytocin or to compare extra-amniotic prostaglandin with intravenous prostaglandin.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-08-14 10:04:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Intravenous prostaglandin is more expensive than intravenous oxytocin and the existing data do not support its use as it is no more successful than oxytocin and is associated with higher rates of maternal side-effects and episodes of uterine hyperstimulation. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-08-14 10:04:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Large scale randomised trials (recruiting thousands of women) would be needed to answer the concerns over fetal wellbeing and rare adverse maternal outcomes. In the absence of compelling advantages associated with the use of intravenous prostaglandins it is to be doubted that such trials should ever take place.</P>
