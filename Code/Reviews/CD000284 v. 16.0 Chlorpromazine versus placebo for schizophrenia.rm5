<P>For previous plain language summary please see <A HREF="03">Appendix 3</A>.</P>
<P>People with schizophrenia often hear voices or see things (hallucinations) and have strange beliefs (delusions). The main treatment for these symptoms of schizophrenia is antipsychotic drugs. Chlorpromazine was one of the first drugs discovered to be effective in the treatment of schizophrenia during the 1950s. It remains one of the most commonly used and inexpensive treatments even today. However, being an older drug (&#8216;typical&#8217; or first generation) it also has serious side effects, such as blurred vision, a dry mouth, tremors or uncontrollable shaking, depression, muscle stiffness and restlessness.</P>
<P>An update search was carried out in 2012 and the review now includes 55 studies that assess the effects of chlorpromazine in treating schizophrenia compared with no active treatment (&#8216;dummy&#8217; treatment or placebo). Evidence was, in the main, rated by the review authors as low quality. There is some evidence to suggest that chlorpromazine reduces relapse and improves people&#8217;s mental health, symptoms and functioning. However, the side effects of chlorpromazine are severe and debilitating. Chlorpromazine causes sleepiness and sedation. It also causes movement disorders (such as tremors and uncontrollable shaking), considerable weight gain and lowering of blood pressure with accompanying dizziness.</P>
<P>Chlorpromazine is low-cost and widely available. Despite its many side effects, chlorpromazine is likely to remain a benchmark drug and one of the most widely used treatments for schizophrenia worldwide.</P>
<P>It should be noted that the quality of evidence from the 55 included studies was low and in addition to this, 315 studies were excluded because of flaws in the reporting of information or data and in research design and methods. Larger, better conducted and reported trials should focus on important outcomes such as quality of life, levels of satisfaction, relapse, hospital discharge or admission and number of violent incidents.</P>

</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-06-12 11:42:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group&#8217;s Trials Register (15 May 2012). We also searched references of all identified studies for further trial citations. We contacted pharmaceutical companies and authors of trials for additional information.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing chlorpromazine with placebo for people with schizophrenia and non-affective serious/chronic mental illness irrespective of mode of diagnosis. Primary outcomes of interest were death, violent behaviours, overall improvement, relapse and satisfaction with care.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-12-03 12:54:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We independently inspected citations and abstracts, ordered papers, re-inspected and quality assessed these. We analysed dichotomous data using risk ratio (RR) and estimated the 95% confidence interval (CI) around this. We excluded continuous data if more than 50% of participants were lost to follow-up. Where continuous data were included, we analysed this data using mean difference (MD) with a 95% confidence interval. We used a fixed-effect model.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-09-30 10:21:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We inspected over 1100 electronic records. The review currently includes 315 excluded studies and 55 included studies. The quality of the evidence is very low. We found chlorpromazine reduced the number of participants experiencing a relapse compared with placebo during six months to two years follow-up (n=512, 3 RCTs, RR 0.65 CI 0.47 to 0.90), but data were heterogeneous. No difference was found in relapse rates in the short, medium or long term over two years, although data were also heterogeneous. We found chlorpromazine provided a global improvement in a person's symptoms and functioning (n=1164, 14 RCTs, RR 0.71 CI 0.58 to 0.86). Fewer people allocated to chlorpromazine left trials early ( n=1831, 27 RCTs, RR 0.64 CI 0.53 to 0.78) compared with placebo. There are many adverse effects. Chlorpromazine is clearly sedating (n=1627, 23 RCTs, RR 2.79 CI 2.25 to 3.45), it increases a person's chances of experiencing acute movement disorders (n=942, 5 RCTs, RR 3.47 CI 1.50 to 8.03) and parkinsonism (n=1468, 15 RCTs, RR 2.11 CI 1.59 to 2.80). Akathisia did not occur more often in the chlorpromazine group than placebo. Chlorpromazine clearly causes a lowering of blood pressure with accompanying dizziness (n=1488, 18 RCTs, RR 2.38 CI 1.74 to 3.25) and considerable weight gain (n=165, 5 RCTs, RR 4.92 CI 2.32 to 10.43).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-12-03 12:54:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The results of this review confirm much that clinicians and recipients of care already know but aim to provide quantification to support clinical impression. Chlorpromazine's global position as a 'benchmark' treatment for psychoses is not threatened by the findings of this review. Chlorpromazine, in common use for half a century, is a well-established but imperfect treatment. Judicious use of this best available evidence should lead to improved evidence-based decision making by clinicians, carers and patients.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-12-03 12:54:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-12-03 12:54:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Approximately 24 million people currently suffer from schizophrenia (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1998</LINK>), the majority of whom live in low- or middle-income countries. Chlorpromazine remains one of the most commonly used and inexpensive treatments for people with schizophrenia (<LINK REF="REF-Odejide-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Odejide 1982</LINK>), despite its well-documented adverse effects and the advent of a new generation of antipsychotic drugs. It is one of the essential drugs listed by the World Health Organization (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2003</LINK>). Chlorpromazine is commonly prescribed in India, and in South East Asia, the older generation of antipsychotics are used to treat the majority of people with schizophrenia (<LINK REF="REF-Chong-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chong 2004</LINK>). In 2003, chlorpromazine was the most frequently prescribed of the first generation 'typical' antipsychotic drugs in the UK at a time when the 'typical' group of antipsychotics accounted for 44% of all antipsychotic prescriptions (<LINK REF="REF-PPA_x002c_-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">PPA, 2003</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-11-04 09:54:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Chlorpromazine, a drug developed in 1951 for reducing allergic reactions (an antihistamine) began to be used as part of a cocktail of drugs in order to induce a state of 'artificial hibernation' for surgical procedures (<LINK REF="REF-Laborit-1951" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laborit 1951</LINK>). Its ability to reduce psychic stress led researchers to demonstrate its effectiveness for treating certain psychiatric disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Delay-1952" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delay 1952</LINK>). Chlorpromazine was hailed as a major discovery for schizophrenia, an illness for which few treatment options existed (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 1978</LINK>). The impact of this drug has been so great, that according to one author, it has been heralded as the second revolution in psychiatry (the first being psychoanalysis) (<LINK REF="REF-Grozier-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grozier 1973</LINK>). Chlorpromazine is the first of many drugs to be classed as a 'neuroleptic' (literally translated: to grasp the nerve), a term coined by two of its first protagonists (<LINK REF="REF-Delay-1952" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delay 1952</LINK>). Early trials of chlorpromazine for schizophrenia indicated, that in comparison with placebo, it hastened clinical recovery, facilitated improvements in social functioning and was effective at preventing relapse.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-11-04 09:54:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The antipsychotic effect of chlorpromazine results from its action on particular areas within specific cells of the brain (<LINK REF="REF-Sedvall-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sedvall 1995</LINK>). It is thought to affect how receptive these cells are to dopamine. However, chlorpromazine is not specific to one site of action within the body. Consequently, it is known to cause adverse effects ranging from dry mouth, blurred vision and urinary retention as well as restlessness, tremors, facial rigidity, shuffling gait and repetitive movements of the face and/or trunk which can be difficult to reverse (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1992</LINK>). Chlorpromazine has also been linked to depressive symptoms that may be caused by the drug itself (neuroleptic dysphoria, <LINK REF="REF-Awad-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Awad 1993</LINK>). In addition, the use of chlorpromazine has been associated with a potentially fatal disturbance of blood pressure, temperature and muscle control (neuroleptic malignant syndrome, <LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-12-03 12:54:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are questions relating to the differential response to drugs between certain groups of people with schizophrenia. For example, there may be differences in the effects of treatment for men and women (<LINK REF="REF-Hambrecht-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hambrecht 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kendler-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kendler 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Szymanski-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Szymanski 1995</LINK>), for children, adults or the elderly (<LINK REF="REF-Kaplan-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaplan 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rosen-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosen 1990</LINK>), or for people who are experiencing their first episode as opposed to those with a longer illness duration (<LINK REF="REF-Hill-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hill 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Szymanski-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Szymanski 1996</LINK>). When prescribing drugs for schizophrenia dosage is important in order to obtain optimal response with minimal adverse effects (<LINK REF="REF-Bollini-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bollini 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kane-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kane 1985</LINK>). There also remains debate about the applicability of research findings to the 'real world' of clinicians (<LINK REF="REF-Jenicek-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jenicek 1990</LINK>). For example, trials undertaken on highly selected groups of people with schizophrenia may be of very limited use in the 'everyday' situation. We attempted to investigate whether, for the primary outcomes of interest (see: <LINK TAG="METHODS" TYPE="SECTION">Methods</LINK>, <LINK TAG="CRIT_OUTCOMES" TYPE="SECTION">Types of outcome measures</LINK>), a real difference exists for those with diagnoses of schizophrenia made with operational 'checklists' as opposed to those with less rigorous diagnoses. A final question we posed was whether the effects of chlorpromazine were different between patients treated recently (1990-2002) to those treated in earlier decades (1951-1989).</P>
<P>New trials often use chlorpromazine as the 'benchmark' or 'control' drug rather than a placebo when a new treatment is being evaluated. The aim of this review is to evaluate this 'benchmark' in comparison to placebo. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 1998, Issue 1 of The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Thornley-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thornley 1998a</LINK>) and updated in 2003 (<LINK REF="REF-Thornley-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thornley 2003</LINK>) and 2007 (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2007</LINK>).</P>

<P>For this 2012 update, two members of the Enhance Reviews team extracted data from included studies. In addition, Jun Xia (JX) extracted data for all Chinese studies. We extracted data presented only in graphs and figures whenever possible. In the previous versions of the review, when further information was necessary, we contacted authors of studies in order to obtain missing data or for clarification. If studies were multi-centre, where possible, we extracted data relevant to each component centre separately.</P>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.2 Scale-derived data</HEADING>
<P>We included continuous data from rating scales only if:<BR/>a. the psychometric properties of the measuring instrument have been described in a peer-reviewed journal (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>); and<BR/>b. the measuring instrument had not been written or modified by one of the trialists for that particular trial.</P>
<P>Ideally, the measuring instrument should either be i. a self-report or ii. completed by an independent rater or relative (not the therapist). We realise that this is not often reported clearly; we have noted whether or not this is the case in <LINK TAG="STUDY_DESCRIPTION" TYPE="SECTION">Description of studies</LINK>.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.3 Endpoint versus change data</HEADING>
<P>There are advantages of both endpoint and change data. Change data can remove a component of between-person variability from the analysis. On the other hand, calculation of change needs two assessments (baseline and endpoint), which can be difficult in unstable and difficult to measure conditions such as schizophrenia. We decided primarily to use endpoint data, and only use change data if the former were not available. We combined endpoint and change data in the analysis as we used mean differences (MD) rather than standardised mean differences throughout (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>, Chapter 9.4.5.2).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.4 Skewed data</HEADING>
<P>Continuous data on clinical and social outcomes are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data, we aimed to apply the following standards to all data before inclusion:</P>
<P>a) standard deviations (SDs) and means are reported in the paper or obtainable from the authors;</P>
<P>b) when a scale starts from the finite number zero, the SD, when multiplied by two, is less than the mean (as otherwise the mean is unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>));</P>
<P>c) if a scale started from a positive value (such as the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS, <LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>) which can have values from 30 to 210), we modified the calculation described above to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skew is present if 2 SD &gt; (S-S min), where S is the mean score and S min is the minimum score.</P>
<P>Endpoint scores on scales often have a finite start and end point and these rules can be applied. We entered skewed endpoint data from studies of fewer than 200 participants in additional tables rather than into an analysis. Skewed data pose less of a problem when looking at the mean if the sample size is large; we entered such endpoint data into syntheses.</P>
<P>When continuous data are presented on a scale that includes a possibility of negative values (such as change data), it is difficult to tell whether data are skewed or not, we entered skewed change data into analyses regardless of the size of the study.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.5 Common measure</HEADING>
<P>To facilitate comparison between trials, we intended to convert variables that can be reported in different metrics, such as days in hospital (mean days per year, per week or per month) to a common metric (e.g. mean days per month).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.6 Conversion of continuous to binary</HEADING>
<P>Where possible, we made efforts to convert outcome measures to dichotomous data. This can be done by identifying cut-off points on rating scales and dividing participants accordingly into 'clinically improved' or 'not clinically improved'. It is generally assumed that if there is a 50% reduction in a scale-derived score such as the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS, <LINK REF="REF-Overall-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1962</LINK>) or the PANSS (<LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>), this could be considered as a clinically significant response (<LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005a</LINK>).

<P>For binary outcomes we calculated a standard estimation of the risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI).

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2015-09-30 10:21:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Cluster trials</HEADING>
<P>Studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice), but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Authors often fail to account for intra-class correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) whereby P values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This causes type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>We did not include any cluster trials in this review. If we had, where clustering was not accounted for in primary studies, we would have presented data in a table, with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. Where clustering was incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we would have presented these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjusted for the clustering effect.</P>
<P>In subsequent versions of this review we will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) for their clustered data and to adjust for this by using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a 'design effect'. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the ICC [Design effect=1+(m-1)*ICC] (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC was not reported it was assumed to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>If cluster studies have been appropriately analysed taking into account ICCs and relevant data documented in the report, synthesis with other studies would have been possible using the generic inverse variance technique.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Cross-over trials</HEADING>
<P>A major concern of cross-over trials is the carry-over effect. It occurs if an effect (e.g. pharmacological, physiological or psychological) of the treatment in the first phase is carried over to the second phase. As a consequence, on entry to the second phase the participants can differ systematically from their initial state despite a wash-out phase. For the same reason cross-over trials are not appropriate if the condition of interest is unstable (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). As both effects are very likely in severe mental illness, we only used data of the first phase of cross-over studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Studies with multiple treatment groups</HEADING>
<P>Where a study involved more than two treatment arms, if relevant, we presented the additional treatment arms in the comparisons. If data were binary, we simply added these and combined within the two-by-two table. If data were continuous, we combined data following the formula in section 7.7.3.8 (Combining groups) of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systemic reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Where the additional treatment arms were not relevant, we did not reproduce these data.</P>

<P>At some degree of loss of follow-up, data must lose credibility (<LINK REF="REF-Xia-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xia 2009</LINK>). We chose that, for any particular outcome, should more than 50% of data be unaccounted for, we did not reproduce these data or use them within analyses.

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">3.2 Standard deviations</HEADING>
<P>If standard deviations (SDs) were not reported, we first tried to obtain the missing values from the authors. If not available, where there are missing measures of variance for continuous data, but an exact standard error (SE) and confidence intervals (CIs) available for group means, and either P value or T value available for differences in mean, we can calculate them according to the rules described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systemic reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). When only the SE is reported, SDs are calculated by the formula SD=SE * square root (n). Chapters 7.7.3 and 16.1.3 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systemic reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) present detailed formulae for estimating SDs from P values, T or F values, CIs, ranges or other statistics. If these formulae do not apply, we would calculate the SDs according to a validated imputation method which is based on the SDs of the other included studies (<LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2006</LINK>). Although some of these imputation strategies can introduce error, the alternative would be to exclude a given study&#8217;s outcome and thus to lose information. We did not impute any SDs, if we had we would have examined the validity of the imputations in a sensitivity analysis excluding imputed values.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">3.3 Last observation carried forward</HEADING>
<P>We anticipated that in some studies the method of last observation carried forward (LOCF) would be employed within the study report. As with all methods of imputation to deal with missing data, LOCF introduces uncertainty about the reliability of the results (<LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2007</LINK>). Therefore, where LOCF data have been used in the trial, if less than 50% of the data have been assumed, we reproduced these data and indicated that they are the product of LOCF assumptions.</P>

<P>Reporting biases arise when the dissemination of research findings is influenced by the nature and direction of results (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>). These are described in Section 10 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook</I> <I>for Systemic reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We are aware that funnel plots may be useful in investigating reporting biases but are of limited power to detect small-study effects. We did not use funnel plots for outcomes where there were 10 or fewer studies, or where all studies were of similar sizes. In other cases, where funnel plots were possible, we sought statistical advice in their interpretation.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2013-12-03 12:54:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We understand that there is no closed argument for preference for use of fixed-effect or random-effects models. The random-effects method incorporates an assumption that the different studies are estimating different, yet related, intervention effects. This often seems to be true to us and the random-effects model takes into account differences between studies even if there is no statistically significant heterogeneity. There is, however, a disadvantage to the random-effects model: it puts added weight onto small studies, which often are the most biased ones. Depending on the direction of effect, these studies can either inflate or deflate the effect size. We chose the fixed-effect model for all analyses. The reader is, however, able to choose to inspect the data using the random-effects model.</P>

<P>The original searches in 1995 yielded over 600 references, and after initial appraisal we selected 201 studies for further inspection of the full papers. An additional 50 papers were also identified from the reference lists. We were able to include 45 relevant studies. For the July 2002 update, we found 106 citations and were able to include just one additional study, and four additional reports of already included studies. In addition, May and Baker's files of reports of chlorpromazine studies, kindly supplied by Dr Pargiter of Hobart, Tasmania, were handsearched by BT, CA and JR. These files yielded 37 more records that met the review criteria. Three of these reports were previously unknown studies that could be included. Thirty-four were excluded. We are very grateful to Dr Pargiter, who kept those files for so long and then, knowing that they could at last be usefully employed, donated them. For the January 2007 update search, we found 317 references from 142 studies. We were able to include one additional study (<LINK REF="STD-Xiong-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Xiong 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>The May 2012 update search identified a total of 21 new relevant studies. Five trials met the inclusion criteria for this review and there are now 55 studies included in the latest version of this review (see <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). A total of 315 studies are now excluded. There are no studies awaiting assessment and no ongoing studies have been identified.</P>

<P>We included 55 studies.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Methods</HEADING>
<P>Four included studies were cross-over trials (<LINK REF="STD-Baker-1959" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 1959</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Letemendia-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Letemendia 1967</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nishikawa-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Nishikawa 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shepherd-1956" TYPE="STUDY">Shepherd 1956</LINK>), two had a factorial design (<LINK REF="STD-Hamilton-1960" TYPE="STUDY">Hamilton 1960</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hogarty-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Hogarty 1973</LINK>), and the remainder were parallel studies. All studies were either stated to be randomised or implied randomisation.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Length of trials</HEADING>
<P>The most common study length was six to 12 weeks but the range was considerable with two trials being just over 24 hours in duration, whilst the two longest were over a period of three years.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Participants</HEADING>
<P>It was reported in all trials that the participants suffered from schizophrenia (with the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Vaughan-1955" TYPE="STUDY">Vaughan 1955</LINK> who randomised people with mental illnesses who were 'chronic and intractable' with motor restlessness, psychomotor agitation, and excitement and <LINK REF="STD-Hankoff-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Hankoff 1962</LINK> who did not clearly state the diagnoses but included psychiatric outpatients who were 'schizophrenic and non-schizophrenic', with the majority having schizophrenia). Only 14 of the 55 trials described the diagnostic criteria used, or the symptoms required for people to be included. Otherwise, entry to most included studies was on a clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia. A total of 5506 participants are now included in this review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">4. Setting</HEADING>
<P>Most studies were hospital-based with only a few of the studies being undertaken in the community.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">5. Study size</HEADING>
<P>The mean number of participants was 99, ranging from 21 (<LINK REF="STD-Payne-1960" TYPE="STUDY">Payne 1960</LINK>) to 838 (<LINK REF="STD-Prien-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Prien 1968</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">6. Intervention</HEADING>
<P>6.1 Chlorpromazine: The doses of chlorpromazine in these studies ranged from 25 mg/day (<LINK REF="STD-Reschke-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Reschke 1974</LINK>) to 2400 mg/day (<LINK REF="STD-Dean-1958" TYPE="STUDY">Dean 1958</LINK>). The mean dose was 574 mg/day (SD 446).</P>
<P>6.2 Placebo: All trials compared chlorpromazine with placebo or no treatment. <LINK REF="STD-Kurland-1961" TYPE="STUDY">Kurland 1961</LINK> used a 'positive' placebo (phenobarbital) and a 'negative' placebo, the results of which were combined in this review. <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1968a" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1968a</LINK> randomised participants to placebo and a no-drug group, which were also combined in this review. <LINK REF="STD-Prien-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Prien 1968</LINK>, however, randomised to a placebo group and a 'routine conventional hospital treatment' group. These groups were not combined because the latter had the opportunity to receive any medication that the treating physicians felt appropriate (presumably including chlorpromazine). <LINK REF="STD-Prien-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Prien 1968</LINK> also included two arms, one with lower doses and the other with higher doses. We pooled data from these arms in the main analysis and conducted subgroup analyses.</P>
<P>6.3 Other drug treatment arms: Thirty-eight of the trials also included at least one more drug treatment arm in addition to placebo and chlorpromazine. Data were not included from these treatment arms.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">7. Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The following outcomes were reported by the included studies: death, relapse, global impression, mental state, behaviour, leaving the study early and adverse effects. None of the included studies attempted to quantify levels of satisfaction, or quality of life and there is no evidence of any direct economic evaluation of chlorpromazine. Most outcomes analysed were dichotomous, and presented as such, or were ordinal data that could be dichotomised.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">7.1 Outcome scales</HEADING>
<P>The following scales provided continuous data for the analysis.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">7.1.2 Mental state</HEADING>
<P>i. Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Overall-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1962</LINK>)<BR/>A brief rating scale used to assess the severity of a range of psychiatric symptoms, including psychotic symptoms. The original scale has 16 items, but a revised 18-item scale is commonly used. Each item is defined on a seven-point scale varying from 'not present' to 'extremely severe', scoring from zero to six or one to seven. Scores can range from zero to 126, with high scores indicating more severe symptoms. <LINK REF="STD-Tetreault-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Tetreault 1969</LINK> reported data from this scale.</P>
<P>ii. Global impression<BR/>4.7.2.1 Clinical Global Impression (<LINK REF="REF-Guy-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guy 1976</LINK>)<BR/>A rating instrument commonly used in studies on schizophrenia that enables clinicians to quantify severity of illness and overall clinical improvement. A seven-point scoring system is usually used with low scores indicating decreased severity and/or greater recovery. <LINK REF="STD-Borison-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Borison 1991</LINK> reported data from this scale.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">7.1.3 Behaviour</HEADING>
<P>i. Modified Rosenthal Rating Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenthal-1963" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenthal 1963</LINK>)<BR/>A scale for nurses to rate the behaviour of psychiatric patients. Lower scores indicate improved behaviour. <LINK REF="STD-Tetreault-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Tetreault 1969</LINK> reported data from this scale.</P>
<P>ii. Parkside Behaviour Rating Scale (<LINK REF="STD-Schmidt-1957" TYPE="STUDY">Schmidt 1957</LINK>)<BR/>A rating scale in which six behavioural characteristics are rated on a five-point scale. The worst possible behaviour would carry a rating of six points, as against a maximum of 30 points for unproblematic behaviour. <LINK REF="STD-Baker-1959" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 1959</LINK> reported data from this scale.</P>
<P>iii. Fergus Falls rating scale (<LINK REF="REF-Lucero-1951" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucero 1951</LINK>)<BR/>The L-M Fergus Falls Behavior Rating Scale is a method of rating the behaviour of patients in mental hospitals, which measures 11 aspects of behaviour, and the changes in one patient over a length of time. <LINK REF="STD-Ramu-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Ramu 1999a</LINK> reported data from this scale.<BR/>

<P>i. Extrapyramidal Bilan scale (<LINK REF="STD-Tetreault-1969a" TYPE="STUDY">Tetreault 1969a</LINK>)<BR/>A nine-item rating scale for use by neurologists, to measure severity of symptoms such as facial mask, tremor, rigidity, akathisia, dystonia, dyskinesia and others. Each item can be scored from zero to three, such that the overall score can range from zero (no symptoms) to a possible 27 (severe symptoms of all types). <LINK REF="STD-Tetreault-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Tetreault 1969</LINK> reported data from this scale.</P>

<P>We have now excluded 315 studies. The studies listed in the 'Excluded studies' section had to be inspected in hard copy in order to make the final decision. Nearly half were not randomised, did not imply randomisation or did not describe the allocation procedure used. In several studies, participants were not suffering from schizophrenia. Another sizeable proportion of the trials did not compare chlorpromazine with placebo, but in combination with other treatments. A few were chlorpromazine withdrawal studies investigating the effects of instigation of treatment, which are not relevant to this review. We will include these withdrawal studies in a later review. Eighty-eight studies had no usable outcomes. Either data did not have clear clinical implications, for example EEG recordings, or genuinely relevant clinical data were not adequately reported.

Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Cole-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Cole 1964</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hall-1955" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1955</LINK>) described some form of allocation concealment (sealed envelopes). For the other 53 studies, readers are given little assurance that bias was minimised during the allocation procedure, yet 24 (24/53, 45%) reported that the participants allocated to each treatment group were very similar. One study, <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 2000</LINK>, reported that participants were randomly assigned in blocks of six and <LINK REF="STD-Weckowicz-1960" TYPE="STUDY">Weckowicz 1960</LINK> reported that participants were divided into three matched groups.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Comparison: CHLORPROMAZINE versus PLACEBO</HEADING>
<P>We categorised outcomes as short term (up to eight weeks), medium term (nine weeks to six months) and long term (six months to two years).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.1 Death</HEADING>
<P>We found only one small trial (n=14) that specifically reported mortality (<LINK REF="STD-Baker-1959" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 1959</LINK>); there were no deaths in either the chlorpromazine or placebo group (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). We found no reports of death in any study and currently over 5506 people have been included in trials relating to this review (of which 1741 were given chlorpromazine).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.2 Relapse</HEADING>
<P>We found short-term (n=74, 2 RCTs) and medium-term (n=809, 4 RCTs) data did not show a significant difference in rates of relapse (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>), but with significant heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP>=78% and 96%, respectively). Removing the studies with results that were causing this heterogeneity, as judged by visual inspection (<LINK REF="STD-Prien-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Prien 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spohn-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Spohn 1977</LINK>) eliminates this heterogeneity. We found longer-term data (six months to two years) favoured the chlorpromazine group (n=512, 3 RCTs, RR 0.65 CI 0.47 to 0.90), but the two long-term studies lasting two to five years (<LINK REF="STD-Hogarty-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Hogarty 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nishikawa-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Nishikawa 1982</LINK>) showed no difference (n=394, 2 RCTs), again with significant heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 72% and 84%, respectively). In this case, the larger trials (<LINK REF="STD-Hogarty-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Hogarty 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prien-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Prien 1968</LINK>) show a better effect for chlorpromazine and it may well be that the smaller trials are the outlying ones. However, <LINK REF="STD-Prien-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Prien 1968</LINK> includes a high-dose treatment arm (2000 mg/day of chlorpromazine), which may explain some of the heterogeneity in the results, see the subgroup analysis (<LINK REF="CMP-001.23" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.23</LINK>) below.</P>

<P>We found short-term global state data ('no overall improvement' - psychiatrist-rated ; <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>) significantly favoured chlorpromazine (n=728, 13 RCTs, RR 0.61 CI 0.46 to 0.82) compared with placebo. Medium-term data up to six months also favoured chlorpromazine (n=1164, 14 RCTs, RR 0.71 CI 0.58 to 0.86). There was significant heterogeneity at both short term and medium term (I<SUP>2</SUP>=69% and 81%, respectively). There were no obviously outlying trials for this outcome at short term, so none were removed from the analysis. For medium term, removal of the largest trial, <LINK REF="STD-Prien-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Prien 1968</LINK>, restores homogeneity, an effect that does not appear in the subgroup analysis for high versus low dose, see the subgroup analysis (<LINK REF="CMP-001.23" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.23</LINK>) below, and again, it may be the smaller trials that are outliers.</P>
<P>Nurse-rated global state 'no overall improvement' scores (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>) were equivocal at short-term assessment in one small study (<LINK REF="STD-Weckowicz-1960" TYPE="STUDY">Weckowicz 1960</LINK>) (n=29, RR 0.91 CI 0.65 to 1.27).

Similar data were recorded in continuous form in only one small study (<LINK REF="STD-Borison-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Borison 1991</LINK>) and results were equivocal (n=19, 1 RCT; <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>).</P>

<P>We found estimates by psychiatrists for the severity of illness (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>) were equivocal at short-term assessments (n=44, 1 RCT) however, medium-term data showed significantly greater improvement in the chlorpromazine group (n=694, 3 RCTs, RR 0.80 CI 0.74 to 0.86) compared with placebo. Nurse-rated severity of illness scores (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>) also favoured the chlorpromazine group (medium term, n=66, 2 RCTs, RR 0.63 CI 0.45 to 0.90) compared with placebo.</P>

The short-term studies showed some heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 51%). When we analyse the data using random-effects, the result becomes non-significant (n=1065, 17 RCTs, RR 0.80 CI0.58 to 1.10). Removing the study with results that were causing this heterogeneity, as judged by visual inspection (<LINK REF="STD-Cole-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Cole 1964</LINK>, which used very high doses of chlorpromazine in one arm of the trial) eliminates this heterogeneity. However, we did not find any significant differences in attrition rates from the comparatively large studies (<LINK REF="STD-Engelhardt-1960" TYPE="STUDY">Engelhardt 1960</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hogarty-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Hogarty 1973</LINK>, n=492), which were conducted for up to two years.

<P>Chlorpromazine is clearly sedating (n=1627, 23 RCTs, RR 2.79 CI 2.25 to 3.45). There is also evidence that chlorpromazine increases a person's chances of experiencing fits (n=695, 3 RCTs, RR 3.11 CI 1.05 to 9.18) and weakness (n=92, 3 RCTs, RR 3.33 CI 1.02 to 10.88). Convulsions did not occur more frequently in the chlorpromazine group than placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Gwynne-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Gwynne 1962</LINK>, n=52; <LINK REF="CMP-001.18" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.18</LINK>).</P>

<P>We found no significant differences in blood problems such as agranulocytosis and leucopenia (n=394, 7 RCTs), or rashes and itching (n=1313, 13 RCTs). Liver problems, mainly jaundice were also not significant (n=249, 4 RCTs). Further data from early trials suggest that chlorpromazine may well cause photosensitivity (n=799, 6 RCTs, RR 6.04 CI 3.22 to 11.32), and eye opacities or pigment problems (n=657, 2 RCTs, RR 3.09 CI 1.87 to 5.11) when large dosages of chlorpromazine are used.

<P>Chlorpromazine clearly causes a lowering of blood pressure with accompanying dizziness (n=1488, 18 RCTs, RR 2.38 CI 1.74 to 3.25). Chlorpromazine is constipating, when compared with placebo (n=1117, 10 RCTs, RR 2.05 CI 1.33 to 3.15). We found data that urinary problems (n=926, 5 RCTs), and also blurred vision were not significantly different between chlorpromazine and placebo. We found that chlorpromazine does cause dry mouth (n=1015, 7 RCTs, RR 4.56 CI 2.35 to 8.85). Chlorpromazine increases participants&#8217; weight (n=165, 5 RCTs, RR 4.92 CI 2.32 to 10.43). We found significantly more participants given chlorpromazine experienced nausea (n=1024, 5 RCTs, RR 2.07 CI 1.14 to 3.73). Salivation occurred significantly more frequently in the chlorpromazine group (n=830, 3TCTs, RR 3.37 CI 1.07 to 10.57). We found no clear evidence that chlorpromazine precipitates the frequency of amenorrhoea, menorrhagia or lactation problems. (See <LINK REF="CMP-001.20" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.20</LINK>).</P>

<P>Few studies reported outcomes for only men or women. The only primary outcome for which data were available for comparison is 'Behaviour deteriorated/disturbed/uncooperative' (<LINK REF="CMP-001.21" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.21</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Schiele-1961" TYPE="STUDY">Schiele 1961</LINK> included only men (n=40) and three studies report the same outcome for women alone (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1970b" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1970b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fleming-1959" TYPE="STUDY">Fleming 1959</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Somerville-1960" TYPE="STUDY">Somerville 1960</LINK>, total n=158).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.3 Acutely ill people (&lt; one month in duration) versus people who have been ill for longer</HEADING>
<P>Limited data were available for a few primary outcomes (<LINK REF="CMP-001.22" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.22</LINK>). We found that people who were chronically ill were more likely to have improved for short- and medium-term global improvement, and disturbed behaviour compared with those whose illnesses were acute. No difference was found for rates of relapse between acute and chronic participants. Results of randomised trials were equally significant for all subgroups. However, these analyses are severely limited by the lack of studies in the acutely ill groups and no firm conclusion can be made.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.4 High dose (&gt; 501 mg/day) versus low doses (1-500 mg/day)</HEADING>
<P>For the outcome of relapse between nine weeks and six months, the high-dose arm of <LINK REF="STD-Prien-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Prien 1968</LINK> reports statistically significantly more favourable results for the chlorpromazine group, compared with the low-dose group of studies (P &lt; 0.005). However, for the low-dose subgroup there remains significant heterogeneity that is not explained by the exclusion of the high-dose arm of <LINK REF="STD-Prien-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Prien 1968</LINK>. For the short- and medium-term outcome 'no global improvement', there is no clear difference between studies using high-dose chlorpromazine to low dose. Higher dosages of chlorpromazine did not confer an advantage in reducing behavioural disturbances, compared with the low-dose group (<LINK REF="CMP-001.23" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.23</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.5 People diagnosed according to any operational criteria versus those who have not been diagnosed using operational criteria</HEADING>
<P>For relapse in short-term studies, the any operational criteria group had a better outcome but the sample size is too small to enable conclusions to be made. Relapse in medium-term studies favoured participants diagnosed with operational criteria (P &lt; 0.04). Global impression 'not improved' revealed no differences in the short and medium term.

<P>It has come to our attention that Dr Richard Borison and Dr Bruce Diamond have been convicted of theft, making false statements and violations of state racketeering law in the USA. At this point, it seems that the crimes were to do with criminal diversion of funds, rather than falsifying study data (http://www.the-scientist.com/yr1998/oct/notebook_981026.html). Nevertheless, we temporarily removed studies with either of these authors from the analyses to see if this made a substantive difference to the findings. <LINK REF="STD-Borison-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Borison 1991</LINK> presented usable data on mental state (average endpoint score on BPRS), the removal of this study did not result in a substantive change in the findings. <LINK REF="STD-Borison-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Borison 1991</LINK> is the reports one unique outcome for global state (average endpoint score on Clinical Global Impression (CGI)), so removal of the study results in the deletion of the complete outcome.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-09-30 10:21:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The summary below reflects the outcomes chosen for the <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>, and considered the main findings of this review that can support evidence-based decision making.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Death</HEADING>
<P>It may be surprising that there were no more deaths reported among over 5000 people with schizophrenia who were randomised to chlorpromazine or placebo. The lifetime incidence of suicide for people suffering from schizophrenia is 10% to 13% (<LINK REF="REF-Caldwell-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caldwell 1992</LINK>). Furthermore, the use of large doses of neuroleptic has been associated with sudden death (<LINK REF="REF-Jusic-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jusic 1994</LINK>), but there are no records of such events within this review. The fact that there are none may reflect the fact that either trial-care is more vigilant than routine care or that death is an under-reported outcome.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Relapse</HEADING>
<P>Chlorpromazine reduced the number of participants experiencing a relapse compared with placebo during six months to two years follow-up, but not in the short, medium or long term over two years, although data were heterogeneous. The removal of <LINK REF="STD-Prien-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Prien 1968</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Spohn-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Spohn 1977</LINK> did restore homogeneity in the short- and medium-term studies. The <LINK REF="STD-Prien-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Prien 1968</LINK> study was different because of the very large dosages of chlorpromazine that were employed, although it had two arms, one with lower doses and another with higher doses, and these two arms were pooled in the analysis. An 86% efficacy was found for the high-dose arm in preventing relapse and a 68% efficacy for the low-dose arm; the confidence intervals only minimally overlap, so there is a potential impact of <LINK REF="STD-Prien-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Prien 1968</LINK> on this outcome.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Global state</HEADING>
<P>The best-quality data would need to be reported from six months onwards, and trials only reported on this outcome at short- and medium-term follow-ups. The efficacy of chlorpromazine for improving global state is 39% for short-term data and 29% for medium term, but the data are heterogenous. Considering that there was very little antipsychotic treatment that preceded the advent of chlorpromazine, such an efficacy can be considered nothing less than revolutionary for those with very serious mental illnesses.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">4. Leaving the study early</HEADING>
<P>The finding that using chlorpromazine results in more people staying in the study could be seen as heartening. Perhaps a genuine decrease in the distressing symptoms of schizophrenia leads to an increased concordance with medication despite the unpleasant side effects of this drug. On the other hand, this apparent willingness to comply may be due partly to sedation and hypotension. These effects (the former being linked to emotive terms such as the 'chemical straitjacket') may decrease a person's ability to make his/her own decisions.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">5. Mental state</HEADING>
<P>In spite of 45 years of research on this benchmark anti-psychotic treatment, very little can be said from trials regarding its direct effect on mental state in general or specific symptoms of schizophrenia.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">6. Satisfaction with care</HEADING>
<P>No studies reported on this outcome, so it is not possible to make any conclusions as to participants&#8217; satisfaction with chlorpromazine treatment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">7. Behaviour</HEADING>
<P>There are more data regarding behaviour. No difference in the occurrence of behaviour judged to be disturbed or deteriorated was found in both short- and medium-term analyses, but the medium-term result is based on heterogeneous data (I<SUP>2</SUP>=90%). Other measures of behaviour 'unchanged' and the modified Rosenthal scale and the Fergus Falls scale did not result in any significant differences. Continuous endpoint data (<LINK REF="STD-Baker-1959" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 1959</LINK>) derived from the Parkside Behaviour Rating Scale did favour chlorpromazine but there were only seven participants in each group and we can have no real confidence in this finding.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">8. Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>Clinicians will not be surprised that chlorpromazine produces acute movement disorders, parkinsonism, fits, tremor, rigidity, weakness and sleepiness. This Cochrane review, however, is a rare report of the best available and quantitative data on this compound that is now over half a century old. Estimates of the incidence of movement disorders such as tardive dyskinesia, however, are not available from this review, as these necessitate a long follow-up period that was only attempted in a few trials. Evidence supporting a link between chlorpromazine and akathisia is much less convincing than that for acute movement disorders, such as oculogyric crisis, and parkinsonism. This suggests that chlorpromazine may be less potent a cause of this unpleasant adverse effect than other compounds.</P>
<P>Taking chlorpromazine commonly causes people to become sleepy. This is an effect that, at times, may be welcomed by clinicians, but not necessarily by those with schizophrenia. Short-term sedation can be advantageous for clinicians trying to manage people with very disturbed behaviour. Sedation often helps to bring a difficult and dangerous situation under control and gives time for antipsychotic measures to be effective.</P>
<P>In addition, chlorpromazine has a tendency to cause other adverse effects such as jaundice, photosensitivity, eye opacities, low blood pressure, constipation, urinary retention, blurred vision and dry mouth. The worrying data regarding eye opacities is all derived from one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Prien-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Prien 1968</LINK>). This large trial, however, used up to two grams of chlorpromazine a day and it is likely that the lower doses more usual in current practice would result in less risk of this adverse effect. Chlorpromazine frequently causes weight increase.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">9. Cost of care</HEADING>
<P>Again, no studies reported on this outcome, so it is not possible to make any conclusions about the cost of chlorpromazine treatment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">10. Subgroup analyses</HEADING>
<P>As was likely from the start, the power to detect a real difference between studies in any one of the subgroup analyses was very low. Only subsets of already limited lists of trials were available. The wide confidence intervals could be hiding true differences in effect between the groups. The only suggestions of statistically significant differences were for acutely ill versus chronically ill for the outcomes of global improvement and behaviour, and for high-dose versus low-dose studies (relapse between nine weeks and six months). It is important to remember that this is now a non-randomised comparison between studies, rather than within a study, and that this is one of many statistical tests that were undertaken on this dataset. Further complicating matters is the fact that the other outcomes within this particular subgroup analysis did not clearly support or refute this difference between high and low doses. <LINK REF="STD-Prien-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Prien 1968</LINK> is an unusual study. Using two grams of chlorpromazine per day would be unacceptable in most situations today, a view supported by some of the findings of this review (n=657, 2 RCTs, RR eye opacities from two grams chlorpromazine per day, 3.09 CI 1.9 to 5.1).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Applicability</HEADING>
<P>The 55 included studies in this version of this review include many people who would be recognisable in everyday practice. There are those with strictly diagnosed illnesses, very likely to suffer from schizophrenia, and people whose illness was diagnosed using less rigorous criteria. The results of the subgroup analyses on diagnostic rigour (see <LINK TAG="INTERVENTION_EFFECTS" TYPE="SECTION">Effects of interventions</LINK> section 2.5) also support the assertion that the results are widely applicable.</P>
<P>The dose of chlorpromazine in the studies included in this review could be considered high (mean 574.1 mg/day SD 445) but, again, these levels are probably common for people with persistent schizophrenia across the globe.</P>
<P>Although the outcomes that have been used in this review are accessible to both clinicians and recipients of care, generalising to treatment in community settings, could be problematic. Most studies were undertaken in hospital, whereas the great majority of people with schizophrenia are in the community.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Homogeneity</HEADING>
<P>Some results are difficult, or impossible, to interpret because of heterogeneity. The test for homogeneity is based on I<SUP>2</SUP> analysis, and is often fairly weak, as the number of studies is small. However, the results of such tests, when statistically significant, suggest caution when adding trial data together.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-12-03 12:54:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The quality of the current evidence is very low based on GRADE (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2008</LINK>). The majority of studies did not report the method of randomisation, and only two trials described method of allocation concealment. Although most studies were reported to be double blind, it was not clear in many whether or not the assessors were blinded to treatment group of participants.  Forty-eight out of the 55 included studies were rated as high risk of bias for selective reporting. Studies frequently presented both dichotomous and continuous data in graphs, or just reported statistical measures of probability (P values). This often made it impossible to acquire raw data for synthesis. It was also common to use P values as a measure of association between intervention and outcomes instead of showing the strength of the association. Although P values are influenced by the strength of the association, they also depend on the sample size of the groups. It is sometimes possible to extract raw data from P values, but their exact values are needed. In the reviewed studies this was not possible, because they were reported as 'P &lt; 0.05' or 'P &gt; 0.05'. Frequently, continuous data were presented without providing standard deviations or standard errors (33/55 trials) or no data were presented at all (11/55 trials). In this way a lot of potentially informative data were lost. In some studies it seemed that attempts had been made to use the original trials as vehicles for answering a host of other questions about schizophrenia. As a consequence, data from the randomised parts of the studies became buried beneath copious subgroup analyses.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Adding the old to the new</HEADING>
<P>This work includes studies that span nearly five decades of evaluative studies within psychiatry. It is possible that the rigour of these experiments has changed over time, as have the participants and even the formulation of the drug; it was thought that introduction of impurities in early formulations of chlorpromazine led to jaundice. There is some empirical evidence that the quality of schizophrenia trial reporting has not changed much over time (<LINK REF="REF-Thornley-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thornley 1998</LINK>) or, if it has changed, it may even have declined (<LINK REF="REF-Ahmed-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahmed 1998</LINK>). We have found no time-related differences in reporting of studies within this review and no suggestion of a change of the effect size over time. Synthesis of the results of studies seems justified.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Failing to identify old trials</HEADING>
<P>We identified trials by meticulous searching, including handsearching old files (2002 update) that covered the drug's development over its first two decades. Nevertheless, for this compound formulated so long ago, publication biases may be difficult to avoid. We did not detect any overt asymmetry of the funnel plots.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. For people with schizophrenia</HEADING>
<P>Many people with schizophrenia and their non-professional carers recognise psychotic symptoms as phenomena generated by a damaging and pernicious illness and may see the effect of chlorpromazine, as demonstrated within this review, as positive. Others may consider these data as supporting well-publicised objections to the use of drugs: drugs potent in their ability to cause unpleasant adverse effects, and to potentially erode a person's ability to make informed decisions.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. For clinicians</HEADING>
<P>This review will confirm much that clinicians already know, but it does provide some quantification to support clinical impression. Chlorpromazine is a sedating drug, prone to cause a variety of movement problems and increased weight. Evidence suggests that chlorpromazine reduces relapse and facilitates global improvement.</P>
<P>The adverse effect of sedation can, in certain clinical situations (especially in the short term), be a useful adjunct to any antipsychotic properties that chlorpromazine may have. For example, someone acutely disturbed and violent, perhaps because of false beliefs, may well benefit from a certain amount of sedation while the antipsychotic effects of treatment begin to work.</P>
<P>Chlorpromazine is a low-cost and widely available choice for the clinician. Despite its many adverse effects chlorpromazine is likely to remain one of the most widely used treatments for schizophrenia worldwide.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. For managers or policy makers</HEADING>
<P>Chlorpromazine is widely available and inexpensive. It is understandable that it remains one of the essential drugs listed by the WHO for treating people with serious mental illnesses. However, some of chlorpromazine's adverse effects could be expensive in terms of human suffering and cost of treatment. It could, therefore, prove better to use a more costly drug if the latter was equally potent, but had a more favourable adverse effects profile.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-12-03 12:54:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. More trials comparing chlorpromazine with placebo?</HEADING>
<P>Even though chlorpromazine has been used as an antipsychotic drug for decades, there are still a surprisingly small number of well-conducted randomised, placebo-controlled trials measuring its efficacy and potential to cause adverse effects. The use of chlorpromazine for millions of people is based on clinical experience rather than the poorly reported trials that involve, in total, only a few thousand participants. Clinicians and researchers are mainly satisfied with the current levels of understanding, and, therefore new studies evaluating chlorpromazine versus placebo will be very rare. However the chlorpromazine story is incomplete. Questions remain regarding the effect of this drug on mental state, long-term movement disorders and vision. One or more large, methodologically sound randomised, placebo-controlled trials could help answer these questions. With the advent of new drugs, however, the day for studies comparing chlorpromazine with placebo has passed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Placebo-controlled studies of other treatments</HEADING>
<P>Having shown that chlorpromazine is a benchmark treatment of psychotic symptoms, and knowing that allowing schizophrenia to go untreated may be damaging (<LINK REF="REF-Birchwood-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Birchwood 1997</LINK>), the question may well be raised as to whether any placebo-controlled studies of new antipsychotic drugs are justified. However, the marked level of improvement in the placebo groups in this review would seem to indicate that short-term studies of those with schizophrenia using a placebo group are justified and would be unlikely to be damaging to those with psychotic illnesses. Using a placebo comparison in the longer term would seem more problematic and difficult to justify.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Future trials</HEADING>
<P>So much more could have been learnt about the effects of chlorpromazine if the studies in this review had clearly described the method of allocation, the integrity of blinding, especially for the more subjective outcomes, and the reasons for early withdrawal.</P>
<P>Concrete and simple outcomes are of interest. For example, clearly reporting improvement, 'number of violent incidents', 'relapse' (giving some description of criteria), 'hospital discharge or admission', and 'presence of delusions or hallucinations' would have been helpful, and simple reporting of levels of satisfaction and quality of life would have been most informative. Chlorpromazine has been in use for decades, yet clinicians still have no trial-based data indicating how people with schizophrenia perceive the value of this drug in the short, medium and long term.</P>
<P>If rating scales are to be employed, a concerted effort should be made to agree on which measures are the most useful. Studies within this review reported on so many scales that, even if results had not been poorly reported, they would have been difficult to synthesise in a clinically meaningful way.</P>

We hope that Dr Pargiter feels that the eventual use of these data justified the decades of storage of these precious files. We are indebted to people such as Dr Pargiter, who see that people who agreed to be randomised so long ago did not agree to have their data lost or forgotten.</P>
<P>Enhance Reviews provided support for the 2012 update of this review in the data extraction, analysis and write-up of results.</P>
<P>Jun Xie screened full texts and extracted data for all Chinese studies.</P>

<P>Methods - summary statistic<BR/>I think it would be helpful if you were to include in your review additional measures of effect size. While you report the relative risk and number needed to treat, many of us not in medical or epidemiological fields tend to use effect size analysis (Cohen 1983), in standard deviation, units to evaluate strength of effect. For binary outcomes, we also tend to use the difference in the percentage of those having the desired outcome in the experimental treatment minus the percentage having the desired effect in the control treatment. Using your study to illustrate, if the percentage of the placebo treated group showing symptomatic remission is 40 and the NNT is 7, then the percentage of drug treated participants showing symptom remission is 52.5 (100/(7+1)=.125+.40 =.525). Then the effect size is 12.5 percent, or a small to moderate effect size. I think that adding this type of layman-accessible translation will enhance the utility and breadth of appeal of your analysis.</P>
<P>Results - sensitivity analysis<BR/>Are there differences between early (first and second) episode patients and those with a more chronic course? I think it reasonable to expect a higher proportion of placebo remissions in early episodes, and perhaps a different (smaller or larger) effect size for the drugs. In looking through the titles of the articles included in your review, it seems that most studies are of the more chronic group. If you can segregate the early episode studies form the more chronic ones, I think the field could learn a great deal about whether the drug has different effects at these different stages of illness. In relation to the Rappaport (1978) first episode study, you might consider a comment on the portion of the placebo treated group that appeared to do better without drugs. If there is such a subgroup, this would be important to know.</P>
<P>Results and conclusions - the interaction of drug effects and study design<BR/>From what we know of the conventional antipsychotic effect, there is a dopamine blocking action that appears correlated with the effect. The body responds to this blocking by generating additional dopamine receptors. Subsequent withdrawing of antipsychotics can thus increase the likelihood of a subsequent episode of psychosis to be greater than if drugs were never given (Chouinard 1978, Chouinard 1980, Warner 1985). In relation to study design, this effect can operate in a number of ways, potentially introducing bias into study results. If the study is of first episode patients and the control group does not receive antipsychotics, then there is no problem. Warner (1985) calls this design 'initial assignment'. But if, while waiting for participants to be collected, early recruits are given medication that for some of them (subsequently assigned to the control group) is later withdrawn, effect size estimates, particularly those using 'relapse' as the dependent variable, will be biased in favour of the drug treated group. This is due to the increased likelihood of 'supersensitivity' psychosis (Chouinard 1978, Chouinard 1980) associated with drug withdrawal. Warner (1985) calls this design 'drug withdrawal'. These issues become more complex when studying a more chronic population (virtually all of whom have been previously medicated). Certainly a sudden drug withdrawal will insert this bias, but most studies you cite seem to use 'wash-out periods' of varying lengths. The real question here is whether the length of the wash out period is sufficient to conduct a fair test. If it's not, there is a bias favouring the drug treatment group in the design. If there is a way, in your analysis, to control for length of wash-out period, it might produce 'clean' estimates of drug-effect for chronically ill people. It would also help to clarify empirically whether the length of the wash-out period is a significant issue (by whether the effect size changes when length of wash-out is included as a control variable).</P>

<P>The reviewers would first like to thank Dr Bola for his detailed comment and patience. It has taken us a shamefully long time to address the issues he raised.</P>
<P>Methods - summary statistic<BR/>We have taken advice on this comment as regards the use of an additional effect size statistic. The two statisticians consulted suggested that accessibility is best served by the NNT statistic and the effect size adds little. Although it is now well recognised that there are difficulties with the NNT in meta-analysis it is still thought to be of use. The reviewers have tried to reword were necessary and clarify the numbers without decreasing readability.</P>
<P>Results - sensitivity analysis<BR/>Dr Bola highlighted that we had not completed the review. We had intended to undertake several additional sensitivity analyses. One of these was to compare, for primary outcomes, if any clear differences were suggested for the effect of chlorpromazine compared with placebo, when a group of people whose illnesses were not chronic were included in the study, as against people with more chronic illnesses. We too expected to see a difference but data were so limited that nothing could be said with confidence. For the outcome of medium term relapse the results of the <LINK REF="STD-Rappaport-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Rappaport 1978</LINK> study (acutely ill people) are different from the synthesised findings of three studies dealing with a more chronic population. This difference was not, however, statistically significant. The other outcomes in this sensitivity analysis do not show any suggestion of a difference. We agree that it would have been important to know with certainty if a portion of the placebo treated group that appeared to do better without drugs. This review generates some hypotheses that could be worth testing. The data are very far from being strong enough to all any clear conclusions to be drawn.</P>
<P>Results and conclusions - the interaction of drug effects and study design<BR/>We completely accept Dr Bola's comment about the possible interaction of length of washout and effect of chlorpromazine. There is just not enough data to be able to control for this in the current analyses. Taking this into account, along with the other potential biases that could be operating, often favouring the chlorpromazine group, gives all the more reason to treat the current estimates of the size of the effect of this drug with caution.</P>

<P>Comment #1: The authors mention in the abstract of this huge review ((55 trials and 5,506 patients) without any reservation that akathisia didn&#8217;t occur more often in the chlorpromazine group than in the placebo group. The largest trial that contributed data to this outcome even found significantly less akathisia in the active group than in the placebo group, relative risk 0.57, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.88. Since we know that antipsychotics cause akathisia and that placebo cannot cause akathisia, this result speaks volumes about how flawed trials in schizophrenia generally are. What was seen in the placebo group were cold turkey symptoms caused by withdrawal of the antipsychotics the patients had received before randomisation.</P>
<P>Comment #2: I [Professor Gøtzsche] believe this fundamental problem renders the review unreliable</P>
<P>Comment #3 : I [Professor Gøtzsche] refer readers to another review. The most reliable placebo controlled trials are those of first episode schizophrenia where none of the patients have ever received drugs before. There is a Cochrane review that approaches this ideal, but even this review is biased, as the trials are not limited to first episode patients; the review includes studies &#8220;with a majority of first and second episode schizophrenia spectrum disorders&#8221; (4). The authors of that Cochrane review pointed out that the available evidence doesn&#8217;t support a conclusion that antipsychotic treatment in an acute early episode of schizophrenia is effective. They felt this was worrying given the widespread use of antipsychotics in the acute treatment of early episode schizophrenia-type psychoses, and also because the use of antipsychotics for millions of people with an early episode appears based on the trials for those with multiple previous episodes (which we know are highly flawed). What does this mean for use of antipsychotics more generally, also for multiple episodes of psychoses? Doesn&#8217;t it mean that we don&#8217;t have the evidence to support using antipsychotics at all? In fact, despite the trials being flawed by the cold turkey design, what was seen in recent placebo controlled trials in submissions to the FDA was only a 6 point improvement on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) (5,6), far below the minimally relevant clinical effect on this scale, which is about 15 points (7).</P>

<P>Response #1: Thank you for this comment. The abstract is accurate in that we found, for akathisia, for these trials RR was 0.78 (CI 0.54 to 1.11, 9 RCTs, n=1164). Professor Gøtzsche says that &#8220;we know that that antipsychotics cause akathisia and that placebo cannot cause akathisia.&#8221; Antipsychotics can cause akathisia, but these symptoms are well recognised to also occur in people who have never been on medication. Even a cursory search of the literature highlights study after study illustrating this odd fact <SUP>1&#8211;3.</SUP> It is indeed possible that the akathisia people displayed in these trials was due to preceding medications, but also a whole raft of other factors that are not speculated upon in a balanced argument. Professor Gøtzsche goes on to say that his statement &#8220;speaks volumes&#8221; about how flawed trials in schizophrenia generally are&#8221;. Professor Gøtzsche&#8217;s statement is poorly-supported and - even if it had been supported &#8211; generalising his perception of nine trials conducted between 1961 and 1970 to all of trials in schizophrenia is unscientific and not appropriate.</P>
<P>Response #2: The authors of the review make effort to provide a balanced appraisal of the best available evidence and have made efforts within the review to be transparent. Every one of the studies has been rated in detail regarding risk of bias and pre-defined outcomes given particular scrutiny for the Summary of Findings table. Professor Gøtzsche has selected one outcome which he finds fault with, speculates as to its cause, generalises to all of trials relevant to people with schizophrenia, and dismisses the review. We feel this is unwarranted.</P>
<P>Response #3: There is much in this comment that does not relate to this review. Important for this review is the statement &#8220;The most reliable placebo controlled trials are those of first episode schizophrenia where none of the patients have ever received drugs before.&#8221; Professor Gøtzsche does not explain what he means by reliable. It seems likely that he is suggesting the explanatory exploration of the effects of medications &#8211; and is right in saying that trials in the group of people who have not had any medication before may help this exploration. It does not, however, help exploration of the effects of drugs for the great majority of people who have the illness in real-world circumstances. Professor Gøtzsche goes on to make statements about another review which we also feel are equally unwarranted but are not relevant to this evidence within the Chlorpromazine versus placebo review. Professor Gøtzsche is right in saying that the Chlorpromazine versus placebo review was &#8220;huge&#8221;. He has chosen to comment on one outcome amongst hundreds, has not evidence to support his speculative interpretation of the finding and then used this as a basis for developing the argument across another review and well beyond. His final statements are a rallying call and not relevant to the Chlorpromazine versus placebo review and consistent with his recent statements to the press where he advertises his book attempting to discredit all psychiatry drugs (<A HREF="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-3234334/Prescription-pills-Britain-s-biggest-killer-effects-drugs-taken-insomnia-anxiety-kill-thousands-doctors-hand-like-Smarties.html">Daily Mail</A>) to which others have reacted (<A HREF="http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/mediacentre/pressreleases2015/responseprescriptionpills.aspx">Royal College of Psychiatrists 2015</A>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Chlorpromazine versus placebo for schizophrenia</HEADING>
<P> Schizophrenia is a long-term illness with a worldwide lifetime prevalence of about one per cent. Many people who suffer from schizophrenia live with considerable disability. Chlorpromazine was one of the first drugs discovered to be effective in its treatment back in the 1950s - and is still used extensively today.This review updates the information available from trials in which chlorpromazine was compared with placebo. In addition it attempts to look at outcomes in smaller sub-groups of people, by sex, by age, by length of illness, by dose of chlorpromazine, by criteria of diagnosis or by whether they were diagnosed before or after 1990. This update adds five studies giving a total of 55 studies and the included data have been divided as to whether they refer to short, medium or long-term treatment. When looking at chlorpromazine versus placebo for schizophrenia since the first review in 1995, 370 trials have been considered but 315 have been excluded, many because of flaws in the research methods or the reporting of the data. This is a shame and much opportunity has been lost to report outcomes of interest to the reviewers and others.Chlorpromazine has been shown to improve both a person&#8217;s symptoms and functioning in 14 trials containing 1164 people. Chlorpromazine reduces relapse in the short, medium and long term. Many trials, however, have demonstrated that chlorpromazine has a number of adverse effects when compared with placebo important ones being movement disorders, sleepiness, skin sensitivity to sunlight, low blood pressure and constipation. The main weakness of these trials is that the majority are conducted on people who are in hospital. The results, therefore, may, at best, be only partially applicable to people in the community.(Plain language summary prepared for this review by Janey Antoniou of RETHINK, UK <A HREF="http://www.rethink.org">www.rethink.org</A>).</P>

<P>1. Study selection<BR/>We (BT, CEA and JR) independently inspected citations from the searches and identified relevant abstracts. GA independently re-inspected a random 10% sample to ensure reliability. Where disputes arose, we acquired the full report for more detailed scrutiny. We (BT and JR) obtained and inspected full reports of the abstracts meeting the review criteria. Again, a random 10% of reports were re-inspected by CEA and GA in order to ensure reliable selection. Where it was not possible to resolve disagreement by discussion, an attempt was made to contact the authors of the study for clarification. For the 2007 update, we independently inspected and selected citations from the search results.</P>
<P>2. Assessment of methodological quality<BR/>We (BT, JR) assessed the methodological quality of included trials in this review using the criteria described in The Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>). It is based on the evidence of a strong relationship between allocation concealment and direction of effect (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). When disputes arose as to which category a trial should be allocated, again we attempted resolution by discussion. When this was not possible, we did not enter the data and added the trial to the list of those awaiting assessment until further information could be obtained. The categories are defined below:</P>
<P>A. Low risk of bias (adequate allocation concealment)<BR/>B. Moderate risk of bias (some doubt about the results)<BR/>C. High risk of bias (inadequate allocation concealment).</P>
<P>In addition, for the first version of this review, we rated studies using the Jadad Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>) but this was not applied for the updates, as it was found to add little to the initial version. The reliability of quality-rating was checked by CEA and GA who re-rated a 10% sample of the selected studies.</P>
<P>3. Data management<BR/>3.1. Data extraction<BR/>We (BT and JR) independently extracted data and, where further clarification was needed we contacted the authors of trials to provide missing data. CEA and GA independently checked a 10% sample for reliability. Any disagreements were discussed and decisions documented. For the 2007 update, JR independently extracted data and contacted authors of trials for missing data.</P>
<P>4. Data synthesis<BR/>4.1 Data types: We assessed outcomes using continuous (e.g. average changes on a behaviour scale), categorical (e.g. one of three categories on a behaviour scale, such as 'little change', 'moderate change' or 'much change') or dichotomous measures, e.g. either 'no important change' or 'important change' in a person's behaviour. RevMan software does not currently support categorical data, so we only presented these in the text of the review.</P>
<P>4.2 Binary data<BR/>For binary outcomes we calculated the relative risk (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) based on the fixed-effect model. Relative Risk is more intuitive (<LINK REF="REF-Boissel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boissel 1999</LINK>) than odds ratios and odds ratios tend to be interpreted as RR by clinicians (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2000</LINK>). This misinterpretation then leads to an overestimate of the impression of the effect. When the overall results were significant we calculated the number needed to treat (NNT) and the number needed to harm (NNH). Where people were lost to follow-up at the end of the study, we assumed that they had had a poor outcome and once they were randomised we included them in the analysis (intention-to-treat /ITT analysis).</P>
<P>Where possible, we attempted to convert outcome measures to binary data. This can be done by identifying cut-off points on rating scales and dividing participants accordingly into "clinically improved" or "not clinically improved". It was generally assumed that if there had been a 50% reduction in a scale-derived score such as the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS, <LINK REF="REF-Overall-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1962</LINK>) or the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS, <LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>), this could be considered as a clinically significant response (<LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005</LINK>b). It was recognised that for many people, especially those with chronic or severe illness, a less rigorous definition of important improvement (e.g. 25% on the BPRS) would be equally valid. If individual patient data were available, we used the 50% cut-off for the definition in the case of non-chronically ill people and 25% for those with chronic illness. If data based on these thresholds were not available, we used the primary cut-off presented by the original authors.</P>
<P>4.3 Continuous data<BR/>4.3.1 Normal distribution<BR/>Continuous data on outcomes in trials relevant to mental health issues are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data we applied the following standards to continuous final value endpoint data before inclusion: (a) standard deviations and means were reported in the paper or were obtainable from the authors; (b) when a scale started from zero, the standard deviation, when multiplied by two, should be less than the mean (otherwise the mean is unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution, <LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>); In cases with data that are greater than the mean we entered these into 'Other data' table as skewed data. If a scale starts from a positive value (such as PANSS, which can have values from 30 to 210) the calculation described above in (b) should be modified to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skewness is present if 2SD&gt;(S-Smin), where S is the mean score and Smin is the minimum score.</P>
<P>For change data (mean change from baseline on a rating scale) it is impossible to tell whether or not data are non-normally distributed (skewed) unless individual patient data are available. After consulting the ALLSTAT electronic statistics mailing list, we presented change data in RevMan graphs to summarise available information. In doing this, we assumed either that data were not skewed or that the analysis could cope with the unknown degree of skew.</P>
<P>4.3.2 Final endpoint value versus change data<BR/>Where both final endpoint data and change data were available for the same outcome category, we only presented endpoint data. We acknowledge that by doing this much of the published change data may be excluded, but argue that endpoint data is more clinically relevant and that if change data were to be presented along with endpoint data, it would be given undeserved equal prominence.</P>
<P>4.4 Rating scales: A wide range of instruments are available to measure mental health outcomes. These instruments vary in quality and many are not valid, and are known to be subject to bias in trials of treatments for schizophrenia (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>). Therefore we only included continuous data from rating scales if the measuring instrument had been described in a peer-reviewed journal.</P>
<P>4.5 Cross-over design<BR/>We expected that some trials would use a cross-over design. In order to exclude the potential additive effect in the second or later stages in these trials we only analysed data from the first stage.</P>
<P>4.6 Cluster trials<BR/>Studies increasingly employ "cluster randomisation" (such as randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Firstly, authors often fail to account for intra class correlation in clustered studies, leading to a "unit of analysis" error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) whereby P values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This causes type 1 errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Where clustering was not accounted for in primary studies, we presented the data in a table, with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. in subsequent versions of this review we will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intra-class correlation co-efficients of their clustered data and to adjust for this using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Where clustering has been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we will also present these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjusted for the clustering effect.</P>
<P>We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a "design effect". This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the intraclass correlation co-efficient (ICC) [Design effect=1+ (m-1)*ICC] (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC was not reported it was assumed to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>If cluster studies had been appropriately analysed taking into account intra-class correlation coefficients and relevant data documented in the report, synthesis with other studies would have been possible using the generic inverse variance technique.</P>
<P>5. Investigation for heterogeneity<BR/>Firstly, we considered all the included studies within any comparison to judge for clinical heterogeneity then we visually inspected the graphs to investigate the possibility of statistical heterogeneity. This was supplemented using, primarily, the I-squared statistic. This provides an estimate of the percentage of variability due to heterogeneity rather than chance alone. Where the I-squared estimate was greater than or equal to 75%, we interpreted this as indicating the presence of high levels of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). If heterogeneity was found, we re-analysed the data using a random-effects model to see if this made a substantial difference. If it did, we did not add the studies responsible for heterogeneity to the main body of homogeneous trials, but summated and presented them separately and investigated reasons for heterogeneity.</P>
<P>6. Addressing publication bias<BR/>We undertook funnel plots (trial affect versus trial size) for outcomes where more than five trials reported usable data and no clear asymmetry was apparent.</P>
<P>7. Sensitivity analysis<BR/>We anticipated that this would be a large review in comparison to many within the field of mental health. As a result this gave an opportunity for several sensitivity analyses to be undertaken. These sensitivity analyses are listed (see: in Objectives). BT, CEA and JR selected relevant trials at the data extraction stage of the review. The synthesised results of the groups of trials were inspected for overlap of the 95% confidence intervals.</P>
<P>8. General<BR/>Where possible we presented data so that results shown to the left of the line of no effect favoured chlorpromazine.</P>
