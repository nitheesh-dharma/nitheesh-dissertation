<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-07-13 15:46:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>
<B>What is the aim of this review?</B>
<BR/>The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out whether taking antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplements slows down the progression of AMD and prevents visual loss. Cochrane researchers collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found 19 studies.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>Key messages</B>
<BR/>Taking an antioxidant multivitamin supplement may slow down the progression of AMD. Most benefit will be seen in people who have a higher chance of progression. Although vitamin supplements are generally regarded as safe, the studies included in this review did not provide good evidence as to safety as they were generally too small.</P>
<P>
<B>What was studied in the review?</B>
<BR/>AMD is a condition of the central area (macula) of the back of the eye (retina). The macula degenerates with age. In some people, this deterioration happens more quickly, and is associated with a particular appearance at the back of the eye. In its earliest stage (early AMD), yellow spots (drusen) can be seen under the retina by an eye health professional on examining the eye. The affected person will probably be unaware that they a problem. As AMD progresses, it can lead to the loss of the cells in the back of the eye, which are needed for vision. This is known as geographic atrophy. Sometimes, new (harmful) blood vessels grow in the macula. These new blood vessels may bleed and cause scarring. This is known as neovascular or wet AMD. Any damage to the macula can affect vision, particularly central vision. Neovascular AMD and geographic atrophy are known as late AMD.</P>
<P>It is possible that antioxidant vitamins may help to protect the macula against this deterioration and loss of vision. Vitamin C, E, beta-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, and zinc are examples of antioxidant vitamins commonly found in vitamin supplements.</P>
<P>The Cochrane researchers only looked at the effects of these supplements in people with AMD. There is another Cochrane Review on the effects of these supplements in people who do not already have AMD.</P>
<P>
<B>What are the main results of the review?</B>
<BR/>The Cochrane researchers found 19 relevant studies. Ten studies were from Europe, six from USA, two from China, and one from Australia. These studies compared multivitamin supplements, zinc, vitamin E and lutein and zeaxanthin with placebo.</P>
<P>&#8226;Taking antioxidant vitamins plus zinc probably slows down the progression to late AMD and vision loss (moderate-certainty evidence). This may result in a small improvement in quality of life (low-certainty evidence).<BR/>&#8226;Taking lutein alone (or combined with zeaxanthin) may have little or no effect on progression to late AMD and vision loss (low-certainty evidence).<BR/>&#8226;Taking vitamin E alone may have little or no effect on the progression to late AMD and vision loss (low-certainty evidence).</P>
<P>Although vitamin supplements are generally regarded as safe, the studies included in this review did not provide good evidence as to safety as they were generally too small and adverse effects were reported inconsistently.</P>
<P>
<B>How up-to-date is this review?</B>
<BR/>The Cochrane researchers searched for studies that had been published up to 29th March 2017.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-05-16 21:11:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>We included 19 studies conducted in USA, Europe, China, and Australia. We judged the trials that contributed data to the review to be at low or unclear risk of bias.</P>
<P>Nine studies compared multivitamins with placebo (7 studies) or no treatment (2 studies) in people with early and moderate AMD. The duration of supplementation and follow-up ranged from nine months to six years; one trial followed up beyond two years. Most evidence came from the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) in the USA. People taking antioxidant vitamins were less likely to progress to late AMD (odds ratio (OR) 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.58 to 0.90; 2445 participants; 3 RCTs; moderate-certainty evidence). In people with very early signs of AMD, who are at low risk of progression, this would mean that there would be approximately 4 fewer cases of progression to late AMD for every 1000 people taking vitamins (1 fewer to 6 fewer cases). In people at high risk of progression (i.e. people with moderate AMD) this would correspond to approximately 8 fewer cases of progression for every 100 people taking vitamins (3 fewer to 13 fewer). In one study of 1206 people, there was a lower risk of progression for both neovascular AMD (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.82; moderate-certainty evidence) and geographic atrophy (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.10; moderate-certainty evidence) and a lower risk of losing 3 or more lines of visual acuity (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.96; 1791 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Low-certainty evidence from one study of 110 people suggested higher quality of life scores (National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire) in treated compared with the non-treated people after 24 months (mean difference (MD) 12.30, 95% CI 4.24 to 20.36).<BR/>
<BR/>Six studies compared lutein (with or without zeaxanthin) with placebo. The duration of supplementation and follow-up ranged from six months to five years. Most evidence came from the AREDS2 study in the USA. People taking lutein or zeaxanthin may have similar or slightly reduced risk of progression to late AMD (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.01; 6891 eyes; low-certainty evidence), neovascular AMD (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.02; 6891 eyes; low-certainty evidence), and geographic atrophy (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.05; 6891 eyes; low-certainty evidence). A similar risk of progression to visual loss of 15 or more letters was seen in the lutein and control groups (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.05; 6656 eyes; low-certainty evidence). Quality of life (measured with Visual Function Questionnaire) was similar between groups in one study of 108 participants (MD 1.48, 95% -5.53 to 8.49, moderate-certainty evidence).<BR/>
<BR/>One study, conducted in Australia, compared vitamin E with placebo. This study randomised 1204 people to vitamin E or placebo, and followed up for four years. Participants were enrolled from the general population; 19% had AMD. The number of late AMD events was low (N = 7) and the estimate of effect was uncertain (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.31 to 6.05, very low-certainty evidence). There were no data on neovascular AMD or geographic atrophy.There was no evidence of any effect of treatment on visual loss (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.47, low-certainty evidence). There were no data on quality of life.<BR/>
<BR/>Five studies compared zinc with placebo. The duration of supplementation and follow-up ranged from six months to seven years. People taking zinc supplements may be less likely to progress to late AMD (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.98; 3790 participants; 3 RCTs; low-certainty evidence), neovascular AMD (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.93; 2442 participants; 1 RCT; moderate-certainty evidence), geographic atrophy (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.10; 2442 participants; 1 RCT; moderate-certainty evidence), or visual loss (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.00; 3791 participants; 2 RCTs; moderate-certainty evidence). There were no data reported on quality of life.</P>
<P>Very low-certainty evidence was available on adverse effects because the included studies were underpowered and adverse effects inconsistently reported.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-04-24 15:37:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>People with AMD may experience some delay in progression of the disease with multivitamin antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplementation. This finding was largely drawn from one large trial, conducted in a relatively well-nourished American population. We do not know the generalisability of these findings to other populations. Although generally regarded as safe, vitamin supplements may have harmful effects. A systematic review of the evidence on harms of vitamin supplements is needed. Supplements containing lutein and zeaxanthin are heavily marketed for people with age-related macular degeneration but our review shows they may have little or no effect on the progression of AMD. </P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-11-21 15:01:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a disease affecting the central area of the retina (macula). In the early stages of the disease, lipid material accumulates in deposits underneath the retinal pigment epithelium. These deposits are known as drusen, and can be seen as pale yellow spots on the retina. The pigment of the retinal pigment epithelium may become disturbed, with areas of hyperpigmentation and hypopigmentation. In the later stages of the disease, the retinal pigment epithelium may atrophy completely. This loss can occur in small focal areas, or can be widespread (geographic). In some cases, new blood vessels grow under the retinal pigment epithelium and occasionally, into the subretinal space (exudative or neovascular AMD). Haemorrhage can occur, which often results in increased scarring of the retina.</P>
<P>In general, the early stages of the disease are asymptomatic. In the later stages, there may be considerable distortion of vision and complete loss of visual function, particularly in the central area of vision. Population-based studies suggest that in older people (80 years and above), approximately one in three people have early signs of the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Klein-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 1992</LINK>). The estimated prevalence of late AMD is 1.4% (95% Credible Interval (CrI), 1.0% to 2.0%) at 70 years of age, 5.6% (95% CrI, 3.9% to 7.7%) at age 80, and 20% (95% CrI, 14% to 27%) at age 90 (<LINK REF="REF-Rudnicka-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rudnicka 2012</LINK>). It is the most common cause of blindness and visual impairment in industrialised countries (<LINK REF="REF-Bunce-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bunce 2010</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-11-21 15:05:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Photoreceptors in the retina are subject to oxidative stress throughout life, due to combined exposures to light and oxygen. It has been proposed that antioxidants may prevent cellular damage in the retina by reacting with free radicals produced in the process of light absorption (<LINK REF="REF-Christen-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Christen 1996</LINK>). Antioxidants are any vitamin or mineral that is known to have antioxidant properties in vivo, or that has been shown to be an important component of an antioxidant enzyme present in the retina. The following vitamins and minerals are usually considered to be 'antioxidant': vitamin C, vitamin E, carotenoids, selenium, and zinc.</P>
<P>There are a number of non-experimental studies that have examined the possible association between antioxidant micronutrients and AMD, although few studies have examined supplementation specifically. Data on vitamin intake in observational studies should be considered cautiously, as people who have a diet rich in antioxidant vitamins and minerals, or who choose to take supplements regularly, are different in many ways from those who do not; these differences may not be adequately controlled by statistical analysis. The results of these observational studies have been inconclusive.</P>

<P>We included trials in which antioxidant vitamin or mineral supplementation, alone or in combination, was compared with placebo or no intervention. Antioxidants were defined as any vitamin or mineral that was known to have antioxidant properties in vivo, or that was known to be an important component of an antioxidant enzyme present in the retina. The following were considered: vitamin C, vitamin E, carotenoids (including the macular pigment carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin), selenium, and zinc.</P>
<P>The overall objective of the review was to assess the impact of antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplements on the progression of AMD. Trials in this area fall into two broad categories: those evaluating a single vitamin or mineral (for example, vitamin E or zinc), and those investigating a multivitamin formulation (for example, Ocuguard). The following comparisons were considered in this review.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Multivitamin formulation versus placebo. All the formulations which include two or more antioxidant vitamins or minerals fall into this category.</LI>
<LI>Single-component formulations versus placebo. Currently, only vitamin E, zinc and lutein have been studied as single formulations, however, in principle any of the antioxidant vitamins or minerals could be assessed as individual components.</LI>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2016-11-21 17:05:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used the risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes where possible. As one of the main large trials reported odds ratios (OR) and their confidence intervals only (derived from repeated measures logistic regression), we used the OR as the measure of effect for analyses that included this trial (<LINK REF="STD-AREDS-2001" TYPE="STUDY">AREDS 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>For continuous outcomes, we used the mean difference (MD) where possible, and the standardised mean difference (SMD) when visual acuity was measured on different scales. In this case, we corrected for differences in direction between Snellen and logMAR scales by multiplying the Snellen decimal values by -1. Where possible, we checked for skewness using methods outlined in Chapter 9 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2011</LINK>). </P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2017-04-24 10:58:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The main study design method in this area is the parallel-group randomised controlled trial. Cluster-randomised trials are unlikely, but would still be considered. Cross-over studies would not be appropriate in this area because of the uncertain and complex natural history of AMD. Currently, no such studies have been identified, but if they are in the future, we will only use data from the first phase.</P>
<P>As the intervention is applied to the individual, the unit of randomisation is the individual person. As people have two eyes, it is possible for there to be a unit of analysis issue if eyes are reported, rather than results for the person. For each included trial we documented whether the unit of analysis was the same as the unit of randomisation and noted any implications for the analysis. For studies reporting right and left eyes separately, we extracted data for the right eye. <BR/>

<P>The data included in the review represent an 'available case analysis'. The majority of the data in the current review came from two large trials with high (over 95%) follow-up.</P>

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2016-11-21 15:37:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We assessed heterogeneity by looking at the forest plots to see whether the effect measures for the different studies were in the same direction and of a similar order of effect. An I² statistic value of 50% or more was taken to indicate considerable inconsistency of results, such that a pooled result may be inaccurate and should not be reported.</P>
<P>The main clinical heterogeneity was the type of supplement. This was incorporated into the analysis strategy by considering the formulations by type.</P>

<BIAS_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2016-04-21 15:41:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In future versions of this review, when sufficient trials are included in the meta-analyses (10 or more), we plan to examine the funnel plot to assess whether there is any evidence that smaller studies are reporting larger effects, which may indicate publication bias.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2017-03-01 11:32:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We planned to pool data using a random-effects model (because it was likely that the effects of antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplementation may vary in different population groups) but with the proviso that if there were three or fewer trials we would use the fixed-effects model. In the event most of our analyses fell into the latter category and so we largely used a fixed-effects model. </P>

<P>We assessed the certainty of the evidence (GRADE) for each outcome using customised software (<LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro 2014</LINK>). JE did the initial assessment, which was checked by JL. We considered risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias when judging the certainty of the evidence (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>The 'Summary of findings' tables include an estimate of the risk of each outcome in the general population. We used data from AREDS to estimate the risk in the control group in low risk (AREDS category 2) and high risk (AREDS category 4) populations.</P>

Overall, we considered the trials to be at low risk of bias for the main types of bias, in particular, selection bias (allocation sequence generation and concealment) and performance and detection bias. This is because all trials, except <LINK REF="STD-Berrow-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Berrow 2013</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-CARMIS-2011" TYPE="STUDY">CARMIS 2011</LINK>, had a placebo control.

<P>There were several different strategies for dealing with eyes. <LINK REF="STD-AREDS2-2013" TYPE="STUDY">AREDS2 2013</LINK> reported by eye. The study reports hazard ratios adjusted for one or two eyes per person. We have extracted data on eyes only. The confidence intervals for effect estimates from this study, as reported in this review, are therefore narrower than they should be as they do not take into account within-person correlation. As all confidence intervals around effect estimates from this study include 1 (no effect), this lack of adjustment does not make any difference to the conclusions of the review. Some studies reported findings on right eyes and left eyes separately (<LINK REF="STD-Veterans-LAST-study-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Veterans LAST study 2004</LINK>) or selected a trial eye (<LINK REF="STD-CLEAR-2013" TYPE="STUDY">CLEAR 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-LISA-2011" TYPE="STUDY">LISA 2011</LINK>).

<P>There was only one trial investigating vitamin E alone (<LINK REF="STD-VECAT-2002" TYPE="STUDY">VECAT 2002</LINK>). This trial randomised 587 participants to vitamin E supplementation and 592 to placebo, and followed them up for an average of four years. Over 80% of the participants in this trial had no signs of AMD. One eye per person was included in the trial.</P>
<P>The number of late AMD events was low (4/494 in vitamin E and 3/504 in placebo group) and therefore, the estimate of effect was very uncertain (RR 1.36, 0.31 to 6.05). We judged this to be very low-certainty evidence as there were only 7 events (downgraded two levels for imprecision) and only 19% of the study population had AMD (downgraded one level for indirectness). There were no data on neovascular AMD or geographic atrophy.</P>
<P>There was no evidence of any effect of treatment on visual acuity; 59 people in the vitamin E group and 57 people in the placebo group lost more than nine letters of acuity (equivalent to 2 or more lines) on the Bailey-Lovie chart (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.47). We downgraded for imprecision and indirectness giving low-certainty evidence.</P>

<P>Four trials investigated the effect of zinc supplementation (<LINK REF="STD-AREDS-2001" TYPE="STUDY">AREDS 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holz-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Holz 1993</LINK> (published in abstract form only); <LINK REF="STD-Newsome-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Newsome 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stur-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Stur 1996</LINK>). In addition, we are aware of one unpublished study for which we have no data (<LINK REF="STD-France-1998" TYPE="STUDY">France 1998</LINK>). One further trial investigated zinc-monocysteine (<LINK REF="STD-Newsome-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Newsome 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Three trials reported data on our primary outcome of progression to late AMD (<LINK REF="STD-AREDS-2001" TYPE="STUDY">AREDS 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holz-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Holz 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stur-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Stur 1996</LINK>); only one of these trials reported data separately for neovascular AMD and geographic atrophy (<LINK REF="STD-AREDS-2001" TYPE="STUDY">AREDS 2001</LINK>). Two studies reported mean visual acuity (<LINK REF="STD-Newsome-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Newsome 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stur-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Stur 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>There were several different strategies for dealing with eyes. Some studies reported AMD for the person which means that the unit of analysis was the person and they were counted as having AMD if it was present in one or both eyes (<LINK REF="STD-AREDS-2001" TYPE="STUDY">AREDS 2001</LINK>). Some studies reported findings on right eyes and left eyes separately (<LINK REF="STD-Newsome-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Newsome 2008</LINK>), selected a trial eye (<LINK REF="STD-Stur-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Stur 1996</LINK>) or averaged the data for the two eyes in participants where both eyes were included (<LINK REF="STD-CARMA-2013" TYPE="STUDY">CARMA 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Newsome-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Newsome 1988</LINK>). In some studies there was not enough information to tell how eyes had been dealt with (<LINK REF="STD-France-1998" TYPE="STUDY">France 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holz-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Holz 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Data from <LINK REF="STD-AREDS-2001" TYPE="STUDY">AREDS 2001</LINK> were reported as adjusted odds ratios only. The odds ratios were calculated using repeated-measures logistic regression and were adjusted for baseline co-variates age, sex, race, AMD category and smoking status.</P>
<P>People taking zinc supplements may be less likely to progress to late AMD (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.98; 3790 participants; 3 studies; low-certainty evidence; <LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>), neovascular AMD (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.93; 2442 participants; 1 study; moderate-certainty evidence; <LINK REF="CMP-004.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.2</LINK>), geographic atrophy (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.10; 2442 participants; 1 study; moderate-certainty evidence; <LINK REF="CMP-004.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.3</LINK>), and visual loss (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.00; 3791 participants; 2 studies; moderate-certainty evidence; <LINK REF="CMP-004.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.4</LINK>).</P>
<P>Only one trial has investigated zinc-monocysteine (<LINK REF="STD-Newsome-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Newsome 2008</LINK>). At six months, people taking zinc-monocysteine read more letters (distance visual acuity). In people treated with zinc-monocysteine, the mean (SD) number of letters read correctly on an EDTRS charts with best correction was 39 (0.672) at baseline and 43 (0.784) at six months in their right eyes. In people taking placebo, the values were 40 (0.649) at baseline and 39 (0.921) in their right eyes. Differences between the groups were statistically significant. Similar findings were seen for the left eye.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Stur-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Stur 1996</LINK>, the primary outcome was incidence of choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) in all participants. During the treatment period, a CNV developed in the study eye in 14 participants (nine in the treatment group, five in the placebo group). People who experienced a CNV were not included in the analyses of visual acuity.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK> summarises information available on adverse effects.</P>
<P>Very low-certainty evidence was available on adverse effects from these Included studies. They were underpowered to look at adverse effects and these were inconsistently reported.</P>
<P>The main reported adverse effect leading to withdrawal from the studies was gastrointestinal symptoms. Of 286 people randomised into trials of zinc sulfate supplementation compared with placebo (excluding <LINK REF="STD-AREDS-2001" TYPE="STUDY">AREDS 2001</LINK>), 5/146 zinc-treated people withdrew due to gastrointestinal symptoms compared with 2/140 controls. No one developed copper-deficiency anaemia (high zinc intakes can inhibit copper absorption). In <LINK REF="STD-AREDS-2001" TYPE="STUDY">AREDS 2001</LINK> participants in the zinc arms reported more anaemia (13.2% versus 10.2%, P = 0.004), however, serum haematocrit levels were the same. Later follow-up of the cohort of people taking part in the AREDS study found that there was a significant increase in hospital admissions due to genitourinary diseases in people taking zinc supplements (11.1% versus 7.6%, P = 0.0003). In <LINK REF="STD-AREDS2-2013" TYPE="STUDY">AREDS2 2013</LINK> reported gastrointestinal disorders and hospitalizations for genitourinary diseases were similar comparing high-dose and low-dose zinc.</P>
<P>There were no data reported on quality of life and resource use and costs.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-05-17 13:48:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The trials contributing to this review fall into two categories. There are three large trials with reasonably long treatment duration and follow-up of four to six years (<LINK REF="STD-AREDS-2001" TYPE="STUDY">AREDS 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-AREDS2-2013" TYPE="STUDY">AREDS2 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VECAT-2002" TYPE="STUDY">VECAT 2002</LINK>). The other 16 trials are smaller (ranging from 20 to 400 participants) and have shorter duration of treatment and follow-up (six to 24 months).</P>
<P>The large trials provided reasonably clear answers to different questions. The <LINK REF="STD-AREDS-2001" TYPE="STUDY">AREDS 2001</LINK> trial provided evidence that long-term supplementation with vitamins C, E, beta-carotene, and zinc, in people with AMD, reduced the risk of progression of the disease and loss of visual acuity. The overall benefit was modest, with a risk reduction in the order of 20% to 25%. However, given that treatment options for AMD are limited, and vision loss is rarely recovered, this may be of interest to people with AMD. In people with very early signs of AMD, who are at low risk of progression, this would mean that there would be approximately 4 fewer cases of progression to late AMD for every 1000 people taking vitamins (1 fewer to 6 fewer cases). In people at high risk of progression (i.e. people with moderate AMD) this would correspond to approximately 8 fewer cases of progression for every 100 people taking vitamins (3 fewer to 13 fewer). </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-AREDS2-2013" TYPE="STUDY">AREDS2 2013</LINK> compared lutein or zeaxanthin with placebo. There was a modest or no risk reduction in AMD progression that was not statistically significant, but as all participants took the AREDS formula, there was no proper control group. Secondary analyses from the trial suggested that there may be some benefit in replacing beta-carotene with lutein, but these analyses were only exploratory (<LINK REF="REF-AREDS-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">AREDS 2014</LINK>). Other trials of lutein or zeaxanthin were small, of short duration, and did not report relevant outcomes. Limited data on mean visual acuity and quality of life did not suggest any important effects of these supplements on outcomes important to patients. </P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-VECAT-2002" TYPE="STUDY">VECAT 2002</LINK> study suggested that the general population should not take vitamin E with a view to preventing the incidence or progression of AMD (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 2017</LINK>). However, the study was underpowered to answer the question about whether people with signs of AMD, such as those participating in the <LINK REF="STD-AREDS-2001" TYPE="STUDY">AREDS 2001</LINK> study, should take vitamin E. Currently, <LINK REF="STD-VECAT-2002" TYPE="STUDY">VECAT 2002</LINK> is the only published trial on vitamin E supplementation and AMD.</P>
<P>The other trials of multivitamin preparations, Ocuguard (<LINK REF="STD-AMDSG-1996" TYPE="STUDY">AMDSG 1996</LINK>), Ocupower (<LINK REF="STD-Veterans-LAST-study-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Veterans LAST study 2004</LINK>), Visaline (<LINK REF="STD-Kaiser-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser 1995</LINK>), and lutein or antioxidant (<LINK REF="STD-Bartlett-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bartlett 2007</LINK>), were either too small to provide evidence either way, or the data were not available in a format suitable to include in this review (<LINK REF="STD-CARMIS-2011" TYPE="STUDY">CARMIS 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-LISA-2011" TYPE="STUDY">LISA 2011</LINK>). Pooling results, where possible, did not provide evidence of any benefit of supplementation. However, these trials were of relatively short duration.</P>
<P>A total of four published trials investigated zinc supplementation (<LINK REF="STD-AREDS-2001" TYPE="STUDY">AREDS 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holz-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Holz 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Newsome-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Newsome 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stur-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Stur 1996</LINK>), and one trial examined a novel zinc-monocysteine formulation (<LINK REF="STD-Newsome-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Newsome 2008</LINK>). The <LINK REF="STD-AREDS-2001" TYPE="STUDY">AREDS 2001</LINK> study indicated that the beneficial effect of zinc supplementation was of a similar order to that of vitamin supplementation. The other trials provided more conflicting evidence. <LINK REF="STD-Newsome-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Newsome 1988</LINK> found a reduction in the risk of visual acuity loss with supplementation over 12 to 24 months. However, <LINK REF="STD-Stur-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Stur 1996</LINK> found no effect of treatment. <LINK REF="STD-Stur-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Stur 1996</LINK>, which was planned to recruit 500 participants, was terminated early because the results of the first 40 participants at 24 months indicated no benefit of treatment. The other two trials of zinc supplementation are as yet unpublished, although limited results from <LINK REF="STD-Holz-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Holz 1993</LINK> were published in abstract form and were included here. <LINK REF="STD-Newsome-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Newsome 2008</LINK> found that zinc-monocysteine had beneficial effects on visual acuity and contrast sensitivity.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-03-28 14:35:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The main evidence that antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplementation was of benefit came from the <LINK REF="STD-AREDS-2001" TYPE="STUDY">AREDS 2001</LINK> trial. As <LINK REF="STD-AREDS-2001" TYPE="STUDY">AREDS 2001</LINK> was a large, well-conducted randomised study, potential biases would have been minimised. The only area where bias may have been introduced was if there were different systemic effects of the antioxidant and zinc supplementation (for example, yellowing of skin or difficulty swallowing tablets), which led the participants to guess which group they were in or alternatively, the retinal fundus photographs might have been different in some way, such that the graders' response was affected by treatment group. However, this is unlikely, and there was little evidence that this was a problem in the study.</P>
<P>It is worth comment that pooling data from trials other than <LINK REF="STD-AREDS-2001" TYPE="STUDY">AREDS 2001</LINK> revealed little evidence for effectiveness of antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplements on preventing visual loss or progression of the disease. However, the other studies encompassed many different formulations and in general, were rather small and of short duration, which may explain the lack of effect.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-AREDS-2001" TYPE="STUDY">AREDS 2001</LINK> was the only study to examine in detail the question of safety. They found little evidence of harm, but there was an increased risk of hospital admission due to genitourinary complications in people taking the zinc supplements. The safety of some of the components of the AREDS formulation have been questioned in other studies. Two large randomised controlled trials have indicated that smokers who take beta-carotene may be at increased risk of developing lung cancer (<LINK REF="REF-ATBC" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATBC</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Omenn-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Omenn 1996</LINK>). The Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) study found that among people with vascular disease or diabetes, vitamin E supplementation was associated with a higher risk of heart failure (<LINK REF="REF-Lonn-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lonn 2005</LINK>). A systematic search of the literature for systematic reviews addressing harms of vitamin supplements did not identify any further relevant evidence. <LINK REF="REF-Huang-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huang 2006</LINK> did not identify any consistent adverse effects of mineral and vitamin supplements, but only included nine RCTs in their review. A subsequent Cochrane Review that investigated antioxidant supplements for preventing all cause mortality, included 78 trials with 296,707 participants, and concluded "We found no evidence to support antioxidant supplements for primary or secondary prevention. Beta-carotene and vitamin E seem to increase mortality, and so may higher doses of vitamin A" (<LINK REF="REF-Bjelakovic-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bjelakovic 2012</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-11-21 18:26:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As the majority of the trials were placebo-controlled, we mostly assessed them as being at low risk of bias. In particular, the two trials that contributed most of the data to this review were judged at low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-AREDS-2001" TYPE="STUDY">AREDS 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-AREDS2-2013" TYPE="STUDY">AREDS2 2013</LINK>). There was some variable reporting of the smaller trials; the extent to which attrition bias may have played a role was not always clear. There was some evidence of selective outcome reporting with respect to data on visual acuity. We identified three trials that did not report non-significant data. Another problem with visual acuity was the variety of ways in which it could be reported &#8210; dichotomous with a variety of potential cut-points, as a continuous variable reporting change or final value. It was possible that investigators had done analyses of visual acuity in a variety of ways and reported the most significant finding. However, in these trials, we did not find evidence of improved visual acuity associated with treatment.</P>
<P>The main reasons for downgrading the evidence were imprecision and indirectness. In particular, as all participants in <LINK REF="STD-AREDS2-2013" TYPE="STUDY">AREDS2 2013</LINK> took multivitamin supplements, the results may not have represented a true reflection of the effect of lutein supplementation.</P>

<P>This review follows the guidance for the preparation of Cochrane reviews.

</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-05-17 13:40:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>There have been a number of reviews published on this topic in the last 3 years (<LINK REF="REF-Andreatta-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andreatta 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Angelo-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Angelo 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Broadhead-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Broadhead 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Buschini-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buschini 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Carneiro-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carneiro 2017</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chew-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chew 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Downie-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Downie 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grover-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grover 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hanus-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanus 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Liu-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Manikandan-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manikandan 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prasad-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prasad 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sacconi-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sacconi 2017</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schmidl-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmidl 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zampatti-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zampatti 2014</LINK>). In general, these reviews have been a narrative assessment of observational studies and RCT evidence, focusing mainly on the results of AREDS and AREDS2. On the basis of AREDS, these reviews generally conclude that supplementation may benefit people with AMD. This is the same conclusion as the current review. In general, more emphasis has been placed by these other studies on the secondary analyses of the AREDS2 study of lutein and zeaxanthin as a replacement for beta-carotene in the AREDS formula.</P>
<P>There has been one systematic review of lutein and zeaxanthin supplementation published (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2015</LINK>) which pooled data for 8 studies. All of these studies were identified by the current review but one has been excluded because lutein/zeaxanthin were combined with omega-3 fatty acids (<LINK REF="STD-LUTEGA-2013" TYPE="STUDY">LUTEGA 2013</LINK>). In the current review, we only included studies that were lutein/zeaxanthin alone i.e. not combined with other antioxidant vitamins (<LINK REF="STD-CARMA-2013" TYPE="STUDY">CARMA 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CARMIS-2011" TYPE="STUDY">CARMIS 2011</LINK>). The data for the remaining studies were similar, but not identical, comparing <LINK REF="REF-Liu-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2015</LINK> and the current review. The overall estimates of effect for visual acuity were similar with a pooled mean difference of -0.04 logMAR (95% CI -0.06 to -0.03) in <LINK REF="REF-Liu-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2015</LINK> and -0.00 logMAR (95% CI -0.05 to 0.05) in the current review. <LINK REF="REF-Liu-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2015</LINK> used the Jadad scale to assess quality of the included studies but this assessment was ignored in the conclusions. Similarly, no attempt was made to assess the overall certainty of the evidence. Although <LINK REF="REF-Liu-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2015</LINK> concluded that lutein/zeaxanthin improve visual performance, we would probably have concluded, with the same data, that there was low-certainty evidence that lutein/zeaxanthin make little important difference to visual acuity as a mean difference of 2 letters (0.04 logMAR) is probably not clinically significant. <LINK REF="REF-Liu-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2015</LINK> also included contrast sensitivity as an outcome and concluded that lutein/zeaxanthin showed "remarkable benefit". We did not consider contrast sensitivity.</P>
<P>The authors of <LINK REF="STD-AREDS2-2013" TYPE="STUDY">AREDS2 2013</LINK> concluded in the main trial report that "Addition of lutein + zeaxanthin [...] to the AREDS formulation in primary analyses did not further reduce risk of progression to advanced AMD." This is similar to the findings of this review, where we conclude that supplements containing lutein and zeaxanthin may have little or no effect on the progression of AMD. The authors of <LINK REF="STD-AREDS2-2013" TYPE="STUDY">AREDS2 2013</LINK> go onto suggest that "...because of potential increased incidence of lung cancer in former smokers, lutein + zeaxanthin could be an appropriate carotenoid substitute in the AREDS formulation." Subsequent exploratory analyses of trial data from <LINK REF="STD-AREDS2-2013" TYPE="STUDY">AREDS2 2013</LINK> suggested a benefit of lutein/zeaxanthin versus beta-carotene in this trial population, all of whom were taking supplements. For this reason, the authors of <LINK REF="STD-AREDS2-2013" TYPE="STUDY">AREDS2 2013</LINK> recommend replacing beta-carotene with lutein. See for example <A HREF="https://nei.nih.gov/areds2/PatientFAQ">https://nei.nih.gov/areds2/PatientFAQ</A>. We have not considered these secondary analyses of <LINK REF="STD-AREDS2-2013" TYPE="STUDY">AREDS2 2013</LINK> in this review. They were exploratory analyses and the subgroups considered were not pre-planned in this review. </P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-05-17 13:19:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>People with AMD may experience modest delay in progression of the disease with antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplementation. This finding was drawn from one large trial conducted in a relatively well-nourished American population. Until it is replicated by other large-scale trials in other populations, we will not know whether these findings can be applied more generally. Our review shows little effect, if any, of supplements containing lutein and zeaxanthin on the progression of AMD but the evidence was low-certainty. </P>
<P>Antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplements are readily available for purchase without prescription in many countries. The decision to take these supplements is at the discretion of the person with AMD. The following benefits and harms need to be considered. People with AMD may delay the progression of their condition if they take antioxidant vitamins and zinc at the levels described in this review. Given that there are few other interventions that offer much in the way of disease prevention or cure, this is an important consideration. However, harmful effects associated with long-term vitamin supplementation, particularly in smokers and people with vascular disease, cannot be ruled out. A healthy diet with a variety of fresh fruit and vegetables will have many benefits and is unlikely to be harmful. However, it may be difficult to consume, as part of a normal diet, the levels of antioxidants and zinc described in the trials included in this review.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-11-21 18:33:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Trials in other populations, preferably with a variety of nutritional status, are required. These trials should have a large enough sample size, and long enough duration, to demonstrate effects that are meaningful for people, and should also include outcomes relevant to people affected by AMD, including quality of life assessment. It is likely that AMD develops over many years. Three categories of people may be identified: healthy people at risk because of age or genetic factors; people with early stages of the disease; and people with intermediate or late-stage disease. If antioxidant supplementation is protective, there may be differences in the effect, depending on the stage of the disease.</P>
<P>Trial reporting should include enough information to assess the role of selective outcome reporting bias (ideally by providing online access to the protocol for the study), and clearer information about follow-up of participants in the study, in particular reasons for exclusion.</P>
<P>As antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplements have systemic effects, the literature on this topic would be much improved by a systematic review of the potential harms of such products, including broader sources of evidence than just randomised controlled trials.</P>

The participants are advised to take 1 tablet twice daily with a meal.The CARMA Study is strictly a double-masked clinical trial in that neither the CARMA participants nor the study staff, including the study investigator, are aware of the nature of study preparation allocated to the participants. To ensure masking, the study-preparation boxes are labelled with pre-assigned numbers at the site of manufacturing, and then shipped to both clinical centers for distribution.

<P>In some studies, gastrointestinal symptoms was reported as a reason for withdrawal. Of 286 people randomised into trials of zinc sulfate supplementation compared with placebo (not including AREDS), 5/146 zinc-treated people withdrew due to gastrointestinal symptoms compared with 2/140 controls. No-one developed copper-deficiency anaemia (high zinc intakes can inhibit copper absorption). In AREDS participants in the zinc arms reported more anaemia (13.2% versus 10.2%, P = 0.004), however, serum haematocrit levels were the same. In AREDS zinc was associated with higher risk of genitourinary problems in men, but no difference seen between high- and low-dose zinc groups in AREDS2</P>

<P>Over 100 comparisons of zinc versus no zinc and antioxidants versus no antioxidants. Participants in the antioxidant arms more frequently reported yellow skin (8.3% versus 6.0%, P = 0.008). No important effect on mortality associated with multivitamin use (hazard ratio for mortality 0.87, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.25).</P>
<P>Participants in the zinc arms reported more anaemia (13.2% versus 10.2%, P = 0.004), however, serum haematocrit levels were the same. They found that participants taking zinc had a lower mortality. Later follow-up of the cohort of people taking part in the AREDS study found that there was a significant increase in hospital admissions due to genitourinary diseases in people taking zinc supplements (11.1% versus 7.6%, P = 0.0003).</P>
