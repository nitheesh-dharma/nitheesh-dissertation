<P>There are insufficient data on use of betamimetic drugs given by mouth to reduce preterm birth in women at increased risk of preterm labour and carrying one baby.</P>
<P>Women sometimes go into labour early and babies are born prematurely (before 37 weeks). These babies are at increased risk of health problems and the earlier a baby is born the higher the risk. Babies born before 32 weeks have considerable problems, with those born before 28 weeks being at most risk. These babies can suffer from problems with breathing, bleeding, gut and intestines. They are also at increased risk of cerebral palsy or long-term handicap, and some babies do not survive even the early weeks. Babies need special care, sometimes intensive care, and this can be quite traumatic for parents. Preterm birth occurs in around 6% to 10% of births. Many interventions have been assessed to try to improve outcomes for these babies; this review looks at a group of drugs called betamimetics given by mouth in women at increased risk and carrying one baby. These drugs aim to reduce and inhibit labour contractions. However, they do have side effects which include nausea, vomiting, tremor, headaches and shortness of breath. The review of studies found only one trial involving 64 women. There is therefore insufficient evidence to support the use of these drugs to reduce preterm labour and birth.</P>

<P>One trial (64 singleton pregnancies) was included. The trial compared the oral betamimetic agent isoxuprine with placebo. No difference was seen for perinatal mortality rate (risk ratio (RR) 4.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50 to 45.00). There was no evidence of an effect of oral betamimetic agents in reduction of spontaneous onset of preterm labour (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.14 to 8.09) or preterm birth, less than 37 weeks' gestation. There was no significant association between the use of oral betamimetics and side effects sufficient to stop therapy (RR 2.51, 95% CI 0.59 to 10.76). No differences were found for infant outcomes; birthweight less than 2500 grams (RR 1.74, 95% CI 0.44 to 6.87) or neonatal death (RR 4.74, 95% CI 0.50 to 45.00). This trial had adequate methodological quality; however the sample size was inappropriate to determine any significance in neonatal outcome differences between the treatment groups.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2010-12-02 13:34:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Preterm birth occurs in up to 6% to 10% of all births and is the major complication of pregnancy associated with perinatal mortality and morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Lumley-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lumley 2003</LINK>). Nearly half of all preterm births are due to preterm labour. Once congenital anomalies are excluded, preterm birth is responsible for the majority of neonatal deaths and is the major cause of disability in childhood (<LINK REF="REF-Hack-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hack 1999</LINK>). Most mortality and morbidity occur with extreme prematurity prior to 32 weeks and especially before 28 weeks. Preterm infants often require intensive care. This is associated with emotional and economic costs to both the family and society (<LINK REF="REF-Petrou-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petrou 2001</LINK>). However, whilst the incidence of death and long-term handicap is relatively low in those born after 32 weeks, they make up over 80% of all preterm deliveries and, therefore, this group of infants has a significant impact upon the burden that preterm birth makes on public health (<LINK REF="REF-Kramer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kramer 2000</LINK>). Preterm birth is associated with respiratory distress syndrome (a respiratory disorder that is characterised by failure of the immature lungs to expand and contract properly during breathing), intracranial haemorrhage (bleeding within the brain), necrotising enterocolitis (a serious gastrointestinal disease in neonates characterised by necrosis of part of the intestine), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (a chronic lung condition that is caused by tissue damage to the lungs and usually occurs in immature infants who have received mechanical ventilation and supplemental oxygen) and cerebral palsy (a disability resulting from damage to the brain before, during, or shortly after birth and outwardly manifested by muscular incoordination and speech disturbances).</P>
<P>Despite intensive research over the past few decades, no decrease in the incidence of preterm labour has occurred, although there have been improved survival and other outcomes for preterm infants. Amongst the risk factors for preterm labour, previous preterm delivery is a strong predictor and the earlier the birth, the more likely it is to be repeated at the same gestation (<LINK REF="REF-Hoffman-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoffman 1984</LINK>). Overall survival for infants born between 20 and 25 weeks' gestation is in the region of 40% and of those who survive to 30 months morbidity is common, e.g. cerebral palsy in 19% (<LINK REF="REF-Costeloe-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Costeloe 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wood-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 2005</LINK>). It is therefore important to look at measures aimed at preventing recurrence of preterm birth in subsequent pregnancies in women who have experienced a preterm delivery in the past. However, interventions to prevent preterm labour in high-risk pregnancies have been disappointing. Bed rest is the oldest proposed method for the prevention of preterm birth. A meta-analysis found not enough evidence to support a policy of routine hospitalisation for bed rest in singleton pregnancies (<LINK REF="REF-Sosa-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sosa 2004</LINK>). Recent studies demonstrate the benefit of progesterone in reduction of preterm birth in a high-risk population for preterm birth (<LINK REF="REF-da-Fonseca-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">da Fonseca 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meis-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meis 2003</LINK>). Betamimetics (isoxsuprine, hexoprenaline, orciprenaline, ritodrine, terbutaline and salbutamol) have been used extensively by obstetricians in the past 20 years in an attempt to pharmacologically inhibit preterm uterine contractions and, thereby, reduce the incidence of preterm delivery, in both acute settings and in the form of prophylaxis (<LINK REF="REF-Barden-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barden 1980</LINK>). Beta-adrenergic agonists activate an enzyme which increases the levels of cyclic adenosine 3',5' monophosphate (cAMP). The increased cellular levels of cAMP decrease myosin light-chain kinase activity, both by phosphorylation of the myosin light-chain kinase itself, and by reducing intracellular calcium through increasing calcium uptake by sarcoplasmic reticulum (<LINK REF="REF-Gabor-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gabor 1982</LINK>). </P>
<P>Betamimetics can decrease contraction frequency or delay preterm birth by 24 to 48 hours when used in the setting of acute preterm labour (<LINK REF="REF-Anotayanonth-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anotayanonth 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gyetvai-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gyetvai 1999</LINK>). As an extrapolation from their effect in the acute setting, oral betamimetics have been used prophylactically in an attempt to prevent preterm labour in twin pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Yamasmit-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yamasmit 2005</LINK>). The ideal tocolytic agent is one which is effective in prolonging pregnancy but has no side effects for the woman or fetus. As a result of their effect on beta-adrenergic receptors, betamimetics can cause palpitations, tremor, nausea, vomiting, headaches, nervousness, anxiety, chest pain, shortness of breath and a range of biochemical disturbances such as hyperglycaemia and hypokalaemia. Moreover, pulmonary oedema may occur in about 3% of women, although this is more commonly seen when betamimetics are given intravenously (<LINK REF="REF-Sciscione-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sciscione 2003</LINK>), and has been associated with maternal death. Side effects may necessitate some women stopping the medication. Betamimetics cross the placenta and may cause fetal tachycardia, hypoglycaemia and hyperinsulinism following delivery. Moreover, they can similarly alter in utero fetal heart rate, which may affect fetal/neonatal outcome. It is known that antenatal cardiac events can influence a number of developmental outcomes for infants, particularly neurodevelopmental outcomes such as cerebral palsy and intracranial haemorrhage (<LINK REF="REF-Bracci-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bracci 2006</LINK>). </P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>The trial was conducted in the United Kingdom (UK) (<LINK REF="STD-Mathews-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Mathews 1967</LINK>). Mean age of participants was not described. Mean gestational age at trial entry was 30.6 weeks (range 28 to 32 weeks) (<LINK REF="STD-Mathews-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Mathews 1967</LINK>). It was unclear whether cases with medical or obstetric complications were excluded. Women were described as having 'a higher than average chance of going into premature labour' on the basis of a history of at least one previous spontaneous premature labour occurring between 24 and 36 weeks, with delivery of a baby weighing less than five pounds eight ounces. Further details of previous premature deliveries were not given.</P>

<P>The trial compared the oral betamimetic agent isoxuprine with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Mathews-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Mathews 1967</LINK>) (<I>see</I> <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). The trial stopped the medication at 36 weeks' gestation or, if labour started, medication was stopped when delivery seemed inevitable. Mean length of treatment was not reported and there was no reference to whether steroids were used for fetal lung maturity enhancement. Subgroup analysis of steroid administration was therefore not possible.</P>

<P>The study did not report the incidence of threatened preterm labour. Delivery before 36 weeks' gestation was used as a cutoff for premature delivery (<LINK REF="STD-Mathews-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Mathews 1967</LINK>).

<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>The trial was described as a double-blind study, but the method of randomisation and allocation concealment was not reported (<LINK REF="STD-Mathews-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Mathews 1967</LINK>). No description was given of sample size calculation, although the authors reported that the aim was to recruit 200 women (a combination of singleton and multiple pregnancies) to the trial. The trial was halted at an early stage due to the high incidence of disturbing side effects and the difficulty experienced by patients in taking 12 tablets of betamimetic/placebo in combination with folic acid and iron. Follow up was complete (<LINK REF="STD-Mathews-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Mathews 1967</LINK>).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-05-05 14:10:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness of prophylactic oral betamimetics for the prevention of preterm labour and birth for women with singleton pregnancies at high risk of preterm delivery. However, the results of the single randomised controlled trial that met the eligibility criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Mathews-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Mathews 1967</LINK>) should be interpreted with caution. We considered the trial included in this review to be of reasonable quality, although the allocation concealment was not clearly defined.</P>
<P>The single trial included in this review did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference for the primary outcome of perinatal mortality rate (risk ratio (RR) 4.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50 to 45.0). However, the sample size was small and hence had limited power to detect small, but important differences, especially in the primary outcomes of perinatal mortality and death at childhood follow up. Indeed, in most estimates of effect size, the 95% CIs are very wide. This limitation was acknowledged by the trial authors. In the 41 years since the this trial was conducted, considerable advances have occurred in neonatal medicine, with significant improvements in the survival of neonates who deliver prematurely. Indeed, this trial (<LINK REF="STD-Mathews-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Mathews 1967</LINK>) predates the first randomised controlled trial in humans of corticosteroids for the prevention of RDS which was conducted in 1972 (<LINK REF="REF-Liggins-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liggins 1972</LINK>). It is perhaps therefore not surprising that important clinical outcomes, such as the most common complications of prematurity and birth before 28 or 34 completed weeks, were not reported by the trial authors (<LINK REF="STD-Mathews-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Mathews 1967</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is difficult to evaluate the efficacy (and safety) of prophylactic oral betamimetics for the prevention of preterm labour and birth for women with singleton pregnancies at high risk of preterm delivery in the absence of adequately powered RCTs. There is a considerable body of data regarding maternal adverse events and the use of betamimetics in the setting of acute preterm labour. In this setting, betamimetics are significantly associated with: withdrawal from treatment due to adverse effects; chest pain; dyspnea; tachycardia; palpitation; tremor; headaches; hypokalemia; hyperglycemia and nausea or vomiting (<LINK REF="REF-Anotayanonth-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anotayanonth 2004</LINK>). More limited evidence regarding the use of prophylactic oral betamimetics is available from two Cochrane reviews, one of prophylactic oral betamimetics for reducing preterm birth in women with a twin pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Yamasmit-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yamasmit 2005</LINK>) and the other of oral betamimetics for maintenance therapy after threatened preterm labour (<LINK REF="REF-Dodd-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dodd 2006</LINK>). The review which looked at twin pregnancy included five trials (344 twin pregnancies), all comparing oral betamimetics to placebo. This review reported on maternal death (RR 2.84, 95% CI 0.12 to 68.57; one study, 144 patients), but did not comment upon side effects of treatment. The review which looked at maintenance therapy after threatened preterm labour (11 RCTs) found that, whilst oral betamimetics were not associated with a statistically significant increase in the incidence of side effects sufficient to stop therapy (RR 2.71, 95% CI 0.11 to 64.79), their use was associated with a statistically significant increase in the incidence of tachycardia (RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.37).</P>
<P>It is not possible to discuss health service resource implications of the effects of oral betamimetics on the prevention of preterm labour and birth for women with singleton pregnancies at high risk of preterm delivery, as the study (<LINK REF="STD-Mathews-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Mathews 1967</LINK>) did not include any data on maternal or neonatal hospital admissions.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-05-05 14:10:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is insufficient evidence either supporting or refuting the use of prophylactic oral betamimetics for preventing preterm birth in women at high risk of preterm delivery with a singleton pregnancy. The use of oral betamimetics for the prevention of preterm labour and birth in women with singleton pregnancies at high risk of preterm delivery is more or less an unevaluated intervention. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-05-05 14:10:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is still no effective intervention to prevent preterm birth in women with a singleton pregnancy at high risk of preterm delivery. There are no recent data suggesting that prophylactic oral betamimetics are currently being employed in women with a singleton pregnancy at high risk of preterm delivery. In the developed world women with a pregnancy considered at high risk of preterm delivery are often managed in specialised clinics with non-randomised cohort data suggesting improved perinatal outcomes with the provision of intensive antenatal education, continuity of carer and individualised care (<LINK REF="REF-Bienstock-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bienstock 2001</LINK>). Such specialised clinics may also see women with previous preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes, previous late miscarriage (16 weeks 0 days to 23 weeks 6 days of gestation) or prior cervical surgery. Prediction of risk may utilise ultrasound assessment of cervical length and the presence of fetal fibronectin in cervico-vaginal secretions. The package of care offered in such clinics may include promising prophylactic interventions for labour prevention including progesterone, clindamycin or cervical cerclage (<LINK REF="REF-Althuisius-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Althuisius 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-da-Fonseca-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">da Fonseca 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ugwumadu-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ugwumadu 2003</LINK>). Whilst the review authors do not feel that further large RCTs of prophylactic betamimetics are a research priority if future trials are proposed, they should be adequately powered to look at the effect of oral betamimetics on neonatal mortality and the rate of preterm birth. Outcome measurements should include not only the incidence of preterm birth, but also the incidence of precisely defined immaturity-related neonatal morbidities and longer-term childhood outcomes.</P>
