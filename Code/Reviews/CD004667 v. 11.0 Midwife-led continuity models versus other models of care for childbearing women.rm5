<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-04-22 11:12:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>What is the issue?</B>
</P>
<P>There are several ways to look after the health and well-being of women and babies during pregnancy, birth and afterwards &#8211; these ways are called &#8216;models of care&#8217;. Sometimes, an obstetrician or another doctor is the lead healthcare professional and at other times it is a midwife. Sometimes, the responsibility is shared between obstetricians and midwives. One of the models is called &#8216;the midwife-led continuity model&#8217;. This is where the midwife is the lead professional starting from the initial booking appointment, up to and including the early days of parenting. We wanted to find out if women and babies do better with this midwife-led continuity model, compared with other models.</P>
<P>
<B>Why is this important?</B>
</P>
<P>Midwife-led continuity models provide care from the same midwife or team of midwives during the pregnancy, birth and the early parenting period, and many women value this. These midwives also involve other care-providers if they are needed. Obstetrician-led or family doctor-led models are not usually able to provide the same midwife/wives throughout. We need to know if the midwife-led continuity model is safe, and if it brings benefits to mothers and babies.</P>
<P>
<B>What evidence did we find?</B>
</P>
<P>We identified 15 studies involving 17,674 mothers and babies (search date 25 January 2016). We included women at low risk of complications as well as women at increased risk, but not currently experiencing problems. All the trials involved professionally-qualified midwives and no trial included models of care that offered home birth. We used reliable methods to assess the quality of the evidence and looked at seven key outcomes: preterm birth (birth before 37 weeks of pregnancy); the risk of losing the baby in pregnancy or in the first month after birth; spontaneous vaginal birth (when labour was not induced and birth not assisted by forceps; caesarean birth; instrumental vaginal birth (births using forceps or ventouse); whether the perineum remained intact, and use of regional analgesia (such as epidural).</P>
<P>The main benefits were that women who received midwife-led continuity of care were less likely to have an epidural. In addition, fewer women had episiotomies or instrumental births. Women&#8217;s chances of a spontaneous vaginal birth were also increased and there was no difference in the number of caesarean births. Women were less likely to experience preterm birth, and they were also at a lower risk of losing their babies. In addition, women were more likely to be cared for in labour by midwives they already knew. The review identified no adverse effects compared with other models.</P>
<P>The trials contributed enough high quality evidence for each key outcome to give us reliable results for each one. We can be reasonably confident that future trials would find similar results for these outcomes.</P>
<P>
<B>What does this mean?</B>
</P>
<P>Most women should be offered &#8216;midwife-led continuity of care&#8217;. It provides benefits for women and babies and we have identified no adverse effects. However, we cannot assume the same applies to women with existing serious pregnancy or health complications, because these women were not included in the evidence assessed.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-04-22 11:18:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 15 trials involving 17,674 women. We assessed the quality of the trial evidence for all primary outcomes (i.e. regional analgesia (epidural/spinal), caesarean birth, instrumental vaginal birth (forceps/vacuum), spontaneous vaginal birth, intact perineum, preterm birth (less than 37 weeks) and all fetal loss before and after 24 weeks plus neonatal death using the GRADE methodology: all primary outcomes were graded as of high quality.</P>
<P>For the primary outcomes, women who had midwife-led continuity models of care were less likely to experience regional analgesia (average risk ratio (RR) 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 0.92; participants = 17,674; studies = 14; <I>high quality</I>), instrumental vaginal birth (average RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.97; participants = 17,501; studies = 13; <I>high quality</I>), preterm birth less than 37 weeks (average RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.91; participants = 13,238; studies = eight; <I>high quality</I>) and less all fetal loss before and after 24 weeks plus neonatal death (average RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.99; participants = 17,561; studies = 13; <I>high quality evidence</I>). Women who had midwife-led continuity models of care were more likely to experience spontaneous vaginal birth (average RR 1.05, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.07; participants = 16,687; studies = 12; <I>high quality</I>). There were no differences between groups for caesarean births or intact perineum.</P>
<P>For the secondary outcomes, women who had midwife-led continuity models of care were less likely to experience amniotomy (average RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.98; participants = 3253; studies = four), episiotomy (average RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.92; participants = 17,674; studies = 14) and fetal loss less than 24 weeks and neonatal death (average RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.98; participants = 15,645; studies = 11). Women who had midwife-led continuity models of care were more likely to experience no intrapartum analgesia/anaesthesia (average RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.37; participants = 10,499; studies = seven), have a longer mean length of labour (hours) (mean difference (MD) 0.50, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.74; participants = 3328; studies = three) and more likely to be attended at birth by a known midwife (average RR 7.04, 95% CI 4.48 to 11.08; participants = 6917; studies = seven). There were no differences between groups for fetal loss equal to/after 24 weeks and neonatal death, induction of labour, antenatal hospitalisation, antepartum haemorrhage, augmentation/artificial oxytocin during labour, opiate analgesia, perineal laceration requiring suturing, postpartum haemorrhage, breastfeeding initiation, low birthweight infant, five-minute Apgar score less than or equal to seven, neonatal convulsions, admission of infant to special care or neonatal intensive care unit(s) or in mean length of neonatal hospital stay (days).</P>
<P>Due to a lack of consistency in measuring women's satisfaction and assessing the cost of various maternity models, these outcomes were reported narratively. The majority of included studies reported a higher rate of maternal satisfaction in midwife-led continuity models of care. Similarly, there was a trend towards a cost-saving effect for midwife-led continuity care compared to other care models.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-08-19 16:37:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>In many parts of the world, midwives are the primary providers of care for childbearing women (<LINK REF="REF-ten-Hoope_x002d_Bender-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">ten Hoope-Bender 2014</LINK>). There are, however, considerable variations in the organisation of midwifery services and in the education and role of midwives (<LINK REF="REF-UNFPA-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNFPA 2014</LINK>). Furthermore, in some countries, e.g. in North America, medical doctors are the primary care providers for the vast majority of childbearing women, while in other countries, e.g. Australia, New Zealand, The Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Ireland, various combinations of midwife-led continuity, medical-led, and shared models of care are available. Childbearing women are often faced with different opinions as to which option might be best for them (<LINK REF="REF-De-Vries-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Vries 2001</LINK>). There is much debate about the clinical and cost effectiveness of the different models of maternity care (<LINK REF="REF-Ryan-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ryan 2013</LINK>) and hence continuing debate on the optimal model of care for routine ante-, intra- and postnatal care for healthy pregnant women (<LINK REF="REF-Sutcliffe-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sutcliffe 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walsh-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh 2012</LINK>). This review complements other work on models of maternity care and attributes thereof, specifically, the work of Hodnett (<LINK REF="REF-Hodnett-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodnett 2012</LINK>) and Olsen (<LINK REF="REF-Olsen-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olsen 2012</LINK>), in which the relationships between the various birth settings and pregnancy outcomes were evaluated systematically. This review also subsumes the Cochrane review, 'Continuity of caregivers during pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period' (<LINK REF="REF-Hodnett-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodnett 2000</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-03-09 11:48:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Whilst it is difficult to categorise maternity models of care exclusively due to the influence of generic policies and guidelines, it is assumed that the underpinning philosophy of a midwife-led model of care is normality and the natural ability of women to experience birth without routine intervention. The midwife-led continuity model of care is based on the premise that pregnancy and birth are normal life events. The midwife-led continuity model of care includes: continuity of care; monitoring the physical, psychological, spiritual and social well being of the woman and family throughout the childbearing cycle; providing the woman with individualised education, counselling and antenatal care; attendance during labour, birth and the immediate postpartum period by a known midwife; ongoing support during the postnatal period; minimising unnecessary technological interventions; and identifying, referring and co-ordinating care for women who require obstetric or other specialist attention. Differences between midwife-led continuity and other models of care often include variations in philosophy, relationship between the care provider and the pregnant woman, use of interventions during labour, care setting (home, home-from-home or acute setting) and in the goals and objectives of care (<LINK REF="REF-Rooks-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rooks 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Midwife-led continuity models of care</B>
</P>
<P>Midwife-led continuity of care has been defined as care where "the midwife is the lead professional in the planning, organisation and delivery of care given to a woman from initial booking to the postnatal period" (<LINK REF="REF-RCOG-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCOG 2001</LINK>). Some antenatal and/or intrapartum and/or postpartum care may be provided in consultation with medical staff as appropriate. Within these models, midwives are, however, in partnership with the woman, the lead professional with responsibility for assessment of her needs, planning her care, referral to other professionals as appropriate, and for ensuring provision of maternity services. Thus, midwife-led continuity models of care aim to provide care in either community or hospital settings, normally to healthy women with uncomplicated or 'low-risk' pregnancies. In some models, midwives provide continuity of midwifery care to all women from a defined geographical location, acting as lead professional for women whose pregnancy and birth is uncomplicated, and continuing to provide midwifery care to women who experience medical and obstetric complications in partnership with other professionals.</P>
<P>Some models of midwife-led continuity of care provide continuity of care to a defined group of women through a team of midwives sharing a caseload, often called 'team' midwifery. Thus, a woman will receive her care from a number of midwives in the team, the size of which can vary. Other models, often termed 'caseload midwifery', aim to offer greater relationship continuity, by ensuring that childbearing women receive their ante-, intra- and postnatal care from one midwife or her/his practice partner (<LINK REF="REF-McCourt--2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCourt 2006</LINK>). There is continuing debate about the risks, benefits, and costs of team and caseload models of midwife-led continuity of care (<LINK REF="REF-Ashcroft-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ashcroft 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Benjamin-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benjamin 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Green-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Waldenstrom-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waldenstrom 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Other models of care</B>
</P>
<P>Other models of care include the following (a) Obstetrician-provided care. This is common in North America, where obstetricians are the primary providers of antenatal care for most childbearing women. An obstetrician (not necessarily the one who provides antenatal care) is present for the birth, and nurses provide intrapartum and postnatal care.<BR/>(b) Family doctor-provided care, with referral to specialist obstetric care as needed. Obstetric nurses or midwives provide intrapartum and immediate postnatal care but not at a decision-making level, and a medical doctor is present for the birth.<BR/>(c) Shared models of care, where responsibility for the organisation and delivery of care, throughout initial booking to the postnatal period, is shared between different health professionals.</P>
<P>At various points during pregnancy, childbirth, and the postnatal period, responsibility for care can shift to a different provider or group of providers. Care is often shared by family doctors and midwives, by obstetricians and midwives, or by providers from all three groups. In some countries (e.g. Canada and The Netherlands), the midwifery scope of practice is limited to the care of women experiencing uncomplicated pregnancies, while in other countries (e.g. United Kingdom, France, Australia and New Zealand), midwives provide care to women who experience medical and obstetric complications in collaboration with medical colleagues. In addition, maternity care in some countries (e.g. Republic of Ireland, Iran and Lebanon), is predominantly provided by a midwife but is obstetrician-led, in that the midwife might provide the actual care, but the obstetrician assumes overall responsibility for the care provided to the woman throughout her ante-, intra- and postpartum periods.</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-08-19 16:38:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Continuity of care is a means of delivering care in a way which acknowledges that a woman&#8217;s health needs are not isolated events, and should be managed over time (<LINK REF="REF-Reid-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reid 2002</LINK>). This longitudinal aspect allows a relationship to develop between patients and their providers of care, and contributes to the patients' perception of having a provider who has knowledge of their medical history, and similarly an expectation that a known provider will care for them in the future (<LINK REF="REF-Haggerty-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haggerty 2003</LINK>). Continuity refers to a &#8216;coordinated and smooth progression of care from the patient&#8217;s point of view&#8217; (<LINK REF="REF-Freeman-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freeman 2007</LINK>) and therefore woman-centredness is an important aspect in the delivery of continuity of care.</P>
<P>The general literature on continuity notes that a lack of clarity in definition and measurement of different types of continuity has been one of the limitations in research in this field (<LINK REF="REF-Haggerty-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haggerty 2003</LINK>). Continuity has been defined by <LINK REF="REF-Freeman-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freeman 2007</LINK> as having three major types - management, informational and relationship. Management continuity involves the communication of both facts and judgements across team, institutional and professional boundaries, and between professionals and patients. Informational continuity concerns the timely availability of relevant information. Relationship continuity means a therapeutic relationship of the service user with one or more health professionals over time. Relationship/personal continuity over time has been found to have a greater effect on user experience and outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Saultz-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saultz 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saultz-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saultz 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saultz-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saultz 2005</LINK>). It has been argued that neither management nor informational continuity can compensate for lack of an ongoing relationship (<LINK REF="REF-Guthrie-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guthrie 2008</LINK>). Midwife-led continuity models of care have generally aimed to improve continuity of care over a period of time. Some models of midwife-led care offer continuity with a group of midwives, and others offer personal or relational continuity, and thus the models of care that are the foci of this review are defined as follows.</P>

<P>Models of care are classified as midwife-led continuity of care, and other or shared care on the basis of the lead professional in the antepartum and intrapartum periods. In midwife-led continuity models of care, the midwife is the woman's lead professional, but one or more consultations with medical staff are often part of routine practice. Other models of care include: a) where the physician/obstetrician is the lead professional, and midwives and/or nurses provide intrapartum care and in-hospital postpartum care under medical supervision; b) shared care, where the lead professional changes depending on whether the woman is pregnant, in labour or has given birth, and on whether the care is given in the hospital, birth centre (free standing or integrated) or in community setting(s); and c) where the majority of care is provided by physicians or obstetricians.</P>

A summary of the intervention effect and a measure of quality for each of the above outcomes was produced using the GRADE approach. The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome. The evidence can be downgraded from 'high quality' by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious) limitations, depending on assessments for risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates or potential publication bias. We have not downgraded evidence for heterogeneity with an I² &lt; 60%. We have not downgraded for risk of bias due to lack of blinding.</P>

<P>There was substantial statistical heterogeneity in many of the analyses. The I² value was greater than 50% for 10 outcomes (antenatal hospitalisation, amniotomy, augmentation, opiate analgesia, attendance at birth by known carer, intact perineum, perineum requiring suturing, duration of postnatal hospital stay, duration of neonatal stay, breastfeeding initiation, and greater than 30% for a further six (antepartum haemorrhage, induction of labour, episiotomy, five-minute Apgar score less than seven, preterm birth, admission to neonatal care). It is likely that heterogeneity could be due to the nature of the complexity of the intervention of a model of care, with variation in case mix and organisational setting.</P>

<P>It was not possible to analyse the following outcomes, either because data were not reported by any studies or they were reported in a way that did not allow extraction of the necessary data for meta-analysis, or losses and exclusions were more than 20% of the randomised participants. No maternal deaths were reported. Only one trial reported the following outcomes: mean number of antenatal visits, perceptions of control, breastfeeding on discharge and postpartum depression and so results were not included in a meta-analysis. No trials reported on longer-term outcomes: any breastfeeding at three months; prolonged perineal pain; pain during sexual intercourse; urinary incontinence; faecal incontinence; and prolonged backache.</P>

Ten trials randomised 11,183 women to compare team models of midwifery (defined as a group of midwives sharing responsibility for a caseload of women) with other models of care (<LINK REF="STD-Begley-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Begley 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Biro-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Biro 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Flint-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Flint 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harvey-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Harvey 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hicks-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hicks 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Homer-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Homer 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kenny-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kenny 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacVicar-1993" TYPE="STUDY">MacVicar 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rowley-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Rowley 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Waldenstrom-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Waldenstrom 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>On the whole, there was no evidence of a difference between the caseload and team subgroups for any of the outcomes included in the subgroup analysis, which included caesarean section, instrumental vaginal birth, spontaneous vaginal birth, intact perineum, preterm birth &lt; 37 weeks and all fetal loss before and after 24 weeks plus neonatal death.</P>

Six trials randomised over 6578 women to compare midwife-led continuity models of care with other models of care in women defined to be at mixed risk of complications by trial authors (<LINK REF="STD-Biro-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Biro 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Homer-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Homer 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kenny-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kenny 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-North-Stafford-2000" TYPE="STUDY">North Stafford 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rowley-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Rowley 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tracy-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Tracy 2013</LINK>;).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Maternal satisfaction</HEADING>
<P>Due to the lack of consistency in conceptualisation and measurement of women's experiences and satisfaction of care, a narrative synthesis of such data are presented. Ten studies reported maternal satisfaction with various components of the childbirth experiences (<LINK REF="STD-Biro-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Biro 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Flint-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Flint 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harvey-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Harvey 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hicks-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hicks 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kenny-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kenny 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacVicar-1993" TYPE="STUDY">MacVicar 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McLachlan-2012" TYPE="STUDY">McLachlan 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rowley-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Rowley 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Turnbull-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Turnbull 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Waldenstrom-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Waldenstrom 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Given the ambiguity surrounding the concept of satisfaction, it was not surprising to find inconsistency in the instruments, scales, timing of administration and outcomes used to 'measure' satisfaction across studies. Because of such heterogeneity and as might be expected, response rates of lower than 80% for most of these studies, meta-analysis for the outcome of satisfaction was considered inappropriate and was not conducted.</P>
<P>Satisfaction outcomes reported in the included studies included maternal satisfaction with information, advice, explanation, venue of delivery, preparation for labour and birth, as well as giving choice for pain relief and behaviour of the carer. One study assessed perceptions of control in labour (<LINK REF="STD-Flint-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Flint 1989</LINK>), using a three-point scale. For convenience and ease of understanding, tabulated results of the overall satisfaction or indicators which directly relate to staff attitude, or both, are presented in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. In brief, the majority of the included studies, showed a higher level of satisfaction in various aspects of care in the midwife-led continuity compared to the other models of care.</P>
<P>A second study (<LINK REF="STD-McLachlan-2012" TYPE="STUDY">McLachlan 2012</LINK>) assessed women's experience of childbirth in a postal survey. Women receiving caseload midwifery care were more likely to rate their experience of childbirth as very positive overall. These women reported a more positive experience of pain overall and more often reported feeling very proud of themselves. Women also felt more in control and more able to cope physically and emotionally; all of these outcome data are taken directly from the Machlachlan 2015 report and displayed in our <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> below.</P>

<P>We performed a sensitivity analysis excluding the cluster-randomised North Staffordshire trial from all outcomes in the primary comparison (comparison 1) for which it had contributed data (<LINK REF="STD-North-Stafford-2000" TYPE="STUDY">North Stafford 2000</LINK>). This did not alter the findings for any outcome, which remained consistent with overall findings with all trials included.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Economic analysis</HEADING>
<P>Findings from economic analyses will vary depending on the structure of health care in a given country and what factors are included in the modelling. Due to the lack of consistency in measurement of economic evaluations, a narrative synthesis of such data are presented. Seven studies presented economic analysis in which various measures and items were included in the final cost estimation (<LINK REF="STD-Begley-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Begley 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Flint-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flint 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Homer-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Homer 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kenny-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kenny 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rowley-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Rowley 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tracy-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Tracy 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Young-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Young 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Kenny 2015 reports an economic evaluation based on the <LINK REF="STD-Begley-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Begley 2011</LINK> trial. Because the trial found no differences in the effect of type of care on any primary clinical outcome, the economic analysis compares only the costs of care rather than their cost-effectiveness. Both midwifery-led care and obstetric-led care were shown to be equally safe and effective in the trial, but the costs of midwife-led care were lower, contributing to a cost saving of EUR 182 per pregnant woman receiving midwife-led care using an 'intention-to-treat' analysis.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Flint-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Flint 1989</LINK> examined the costs for a subgroup of women (n = 49) and estimated costs for antenatal admission and antenatal care, and found antenatal care was 20% to 25% cheaper for women in the midwife-led continuity of care group due to differences in staff costs. Women in the midwife-led continuity of care group had fewer epidurals (GBP 19,360 versus GBP 31,460).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Kenny-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kenny 1994</LINK> examined the costs of care in detail. The average cost/client in the antenatal period was AUD 158 midwife-led continuity of care and AUD 167 control. For high-risk women the average cost/client was AUD 390 midwife-led continuity of care and AUD 437 control, and for low-risk women AUD 119 midwife-led continuity of care and AUD 123 control. The average cost per woman for intrapartum care was AUD 219 midwife-led continuity of care and AUD 220 control and for postnatal care was AUD 745 midwife-led continuity of care and AUD 833 control. The total cost/woman was AUD 1122 for midwife-led continuity of care and AUD 1220 control.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Rowley-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Rowley 1995</LINK> used the Australian national cost weights for diagnostic-related groups (AN-DRGs) to estimate maternity care in each study group. The average cost per delivery was higher in the standard care group (AUD 3475) compared to the team-midwifery group (AUD 3324). This method was limited to the acute inpatient and did not include antenatal or postnatal care cost estimations. An assessment of midwife salaries from the first antenatal visit up to and including labour and delivery care resulted in a cost of AUD 653 for each team care woman and $688 for each routine care woman. The amount of sick leave taken by team care midwives was half that taken by standard care midwives.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Tracy-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Tracy 2013</LINK> calculated cost outcomes per woman on the basis of activity-based funding codes (Australian-refined Diagnosis-Related Group classification [DRG] codes). Expenditure data were obtained from the hospital financial systems, which provided detailed information about inpatient contacts for the mother and baby.The per-woman cost of care calculated included both direct and indirect costs for each full episode of maternity care, taking account of the length of hospital stay for each woman. Direct and indirect costs were calculated for midwifery and obstetric clinical time; use of operating theatres, laboratory tests, imaging, wards, allied health, pharmacy; capital depreciation; and clinical overheads. Costs for each full episode of maternity care we recalculated from the sum of the services provided to the woman for the duration of her stay. Neonatal costs were not reported. Caseload midwifery care for unassisted vaginal birth cost significantly less than standard maternity care. This difference contributed to a significant difference in the overall median cost of birth per woman of AUD 566.74 (95% CI 106.17 to 1027.30) P = 0·02). However, the cost data showed several high-cost outliers greater than $30,000, which were due to serious medical disorders, surgical complications, or accidental causes. The largest outlier, which cost more than $40,000, was due to a motor vehicle accident. The total cost of care per woman was AUD 566.74 (95% CI 106.17 to 1027.30); P = 0·02) less for caseload midwifery than for standard maternity care.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Young-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Young 1997</LINK> (cost analysis, <LINK REF="STD-Turnbull-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Turnbull 1996</LINK>) used the "individual patient-based costing" approach, in which an assumption was made about the number of caseloads per midwife. When the assumption was based on a median caseload of 29 women per midwife, the cost of midwife managed care was not significantly different from the shared-care group in the antenatal and intrapartum periods, but it was higher in the postpartum period. The authors also used an alternative assumption including a caseload of 39 women per midwife. A lower cost in the antenatal period for the midwife-managed care was shown in comparison with the shared-care group (mean: GPD 346 versus GPD 384, P = 0.05), but the postnatal care cost remained higher in the former group (GPD 444 versus GPD 397, respectively, P &lt; 0.01). The authors did not recalculate the cost of intrapartum care for the second assumption, and used the same estimation as for the 29 caseload per midwife (since they indicated that the main effects were in the unit costs of clinic and home visits). They reported no significant differences between the midwifery and shared-care group, in the cost of intrapartum care (GPD 280 versus GPD 276, P = 0.4).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Homer-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Homer 2001</LINK> calculated the costs of all aspects of care from the healthcare provider's perspective, including salaries and wages; goods and services; and repair, maintenance and renewal (RMR). The associated costs for all stages of antenatal, intrapartum and postnatal care were calculated and presented as the mean cost per woman per group. The results showed a cost-saving effect in the team midwifery group compared with the standard care arm of the study (mean cost per woman: AUD 2579 versus AUD 3483, respectively).</P>
<P>In summary, six studies presented cost data using different economic evaluation methods. All studies suggest a cost-saving effect in intrapartum care. One study suggests a higher cost, and one study no differences in cost of postnatal care when midwife-led continuity of care is compared with medical-led maternity care. There is a lack of consistency in estimating maternity care cost among the available studies; however, there seems to be a trend towards the cost-saving effect of midwife-led continuity of care in comparison with medical-led care. <B>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-04-05 12:46:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review summarises 15 trials involving 17,674 women that took place in four countries in a wide variety of settings and health systems. All trials involved midwife-led continuity models of care that included either team or caseload midwifery, and women classified as at low or mixed risk. All trials included licensed midwives, and none included lay or traditional midwives. The review includes trials that compared midwife-led continuity of care given both during the antepartum and the intrapartum period with other models of care, which included obstetricians or family physicians, or both, collaborating with nurses and midwives in a variety of organisational settings. No trial included models of care that offered out of hospital birth.</P>
<P>In the primary comparison, the results consistently show less use of some interventions for women who were randomised to receive midwife-led continuity of care compared to women randomised to receive other models of care without detriment to outcomes. Specifically, women were on average less likely to experience regional analgesia, episiotomy, and instrumental birth. Women were on average more likely to experience spontaneous vaginal birth, a longer mean length of labour, and to be attended at birth by a known midwife, however, there were no differences in caesarean birth rates.</P>
<P>Stillbirth is not reported specifically due to differing gestational definitions, but is included within the outcome &#8216;Fetal loss equal to/after 24 weeks and neonatal death&#8217;. Women who were randomised to receive midwife-led continuity of care compared to women randomised to receive other models of care were, on average, less likely to experience fetal loss less than 24 weeks and neonatal death and preterm birth before 37 weeks. The difference in the average treatment effect in all fetal loss before and after 24 weeks plus neonatal death across included trials between women allocated to midwife-led continuity models of care and women allocated to other models has an average risk ratio (RR) of 0.84, with 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71 to 0.99 (participants = 17561; studies = 13). Given that (i) the 95% CI just reaches 0.99 and (ii) the absence of measurable heterogeneity in this outcome analysis, the probability is that midwife-led continuity models of care are associated with a reduction in fetal loss and neonatal death by approximately 16%.</P>
<P>We conducted pre-specified subgroup analysis to investigate heterogeneity in the above outcomes of regional analgesia and preterm birth. The subgroup analyses of models of midwife-led continuity of care and risk status did not find any significant subgroup interaction tests, indicating that there is no observable subgroup effect. It is possible that the complexity of the intervention in a range of settings and populations may influence the heterogeneity found.</P>
<P>Overall, we did not find any increased likelihood for any adverse outcome for women or their infants associated with having been randomised to a midwife-led continuity model of care. These results were moderate in magnitude and generally consistent across all the trials.</P>
<P>It is possible that practice settings such as midwife-led units can be a confounding influence on outcomes of midwife-led continuity of care (<LINK REF="REF-Brocklehurst-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brocklehurst 2011</LINK>), although home birth was not offered in any of the trials. Four trials offered care in midwife-led units (<LINK REF="STD-Begley-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Begley 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacVicar-1993" TYPE="STUDY">MacVicar 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Turnbull-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Turnbull 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Waldenstrom-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Waldenstrom 2001</LINK>), which was available to women in both arms of one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Waldenstrom-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Waldenstrom 2001</LINK>), and only women in the midwife-led group in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Begley-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Begley 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacVicar-1993" TYPE="STUDY">MacVicar 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Turnbull-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Turnbull 1996</LINK>). The increased likelihood of spontaneous vaginal birth in women randomised to midwife-led continuity models of care may be a function of increased mobility due to less use of a range of analgesics, a much greater likelihood of attendance at birth by a known midwife, and the philosophy of care on offer. Midwife-led continuity of care is a complex intervention, and it is impossible to unpick the relative importance of philosophy and continuity of care. However, in 10 trials, care was provided on the labour ward, suggesting a separate effect of birth setting. To what extent the observed benefits can be attributed to the model of midwifery care, midwifery philosophy, or to the quality and degree of relationship between the care provider and women was outside the scope of this review and requires an in-depth exploration of the mechanisms through which midwife-led care might work.</P>
<P>The possible effects on fetal loss and the substantive 24% reduction in preterm birth are important. Aetiology of both these events are complex but potentially influenced by models of care. Medical interventions to prevent fetal loss prior to 24 weeks do exist, as this is mostly due to spontaneous miscarriage, (and are dependent on quick access to care potentially influenced by continuity), such as cerclage and progesterone. These interventions are targeted to 'at risk' women, and may explain why mixed-risk populations (with the improved access to care and appropriate referral) have the effect. Low-risk women may not be referred or when referred the interventions not used due to lack of evidence in low-risk women. There is insufficient detail in the trials to elucidate reasons for loss (e.g. intrauterine death or spontaneous miscarriage), and this would be important in future research.</P>
<P>Government and hospital policies affect how midwives are 'allowed' to practise, and/or the institutional structure within which midwives practise, and would thus affect practices and outcomes by limiting the potential of midwife-led continuity of care in some settings. This is in contrast to models of health care which offer relationship continuity over time, which have been found to prevent clients falling through 'gaps in care' (<LINK REF="REF-Cook-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 2000</LINK>). Women's experiences of care reported in the original studies include maternal satisfaction with information, advice, explanation, venue of delivery and preparation for labour and birth, as well as perceptions of choice for pain relief and evaluations of carers behaviour. In the majority of the included studies, satisfaction with various aspects of care appears to be higher in the midwife-led continuity of care compared to the other models of care.</P>

<P>Although there were limitations in the way that satisfaction-related outcomes were assessed and reported, the majority of the included studies showed a higher level of satisfaction with various aspects of care in the midwife-led continuity of care compared to the other models of care. Estimates of cost and resource use employed different economic evaluation methods. Results generally suggest a cost-saving effect in intrapartum care; one study suggests a higher cost of postnatal care when midwife-led continuity of care is compared with medical-led care. However, there is a lack of consistency in estimating maternity care cost among the available studies, and there seems to be a trend towards a cost-saving effect of midwife-led continuity of care in comparison with medical-led care.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-04-05 12:53:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We assessed the quality of trial evidence for the following outcomes using the GRADE methodology: preterm birth &lt; 37 weeks, all fetal loss before and after 24 weeks plus neonatal death, spontaneous vaginal birth (as defined by trialists), caesarean birth, instrumental vaginal birth, intact perineum and regional analgesia. All outcomes were graded as of high quality. Multiple trials of low risk of bias contributed to each outcome, and there were precise estimates with no heterogeneity greater than 60%. No trial included in this review had adequate blinding of participants, staff or outcomes assessors. We did not downgrade trial evidence for risk of bias due to lack of blinding. However, we understand that other authors might choose to do so. We would not expect blinding to affect the outcomes of preterm birth or fetal loss, but the argument could be made that blinding matters for mode of birth, intact perineum and use of analgesia.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-05-30 23:32:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched for further studies in the reference list of the studies identified, and did not apply any language or date restrictions. We made explicit judgements about whether studies were at high risk of bias using the GRADE approach. We carried out sensitivity analyses to explore the effect of trial quality assessed by concealment of allocation, high attrition rates, or both, with poor quality studies being excluded from the analyses in order to assess whether this made any difference to the overall result. No other potential sources of bias were identified in any of the included studies. There was no strong evidence of reporting bias, though this is difficult to detect with the number of studies in this review, and whether it exists and the extent to which it affects the results may be clarified when more studies have been conducted.</P>

<P>Studies of qualitative data can add understanding on why women experience fewer birth interventions within this model of care. One meta-synthesis (<LINK REF="REF-Walsh-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh 2012</LINK>), suggests that lower rates of interventions could be linked to the "greater agency experienced by women and midwives within midwife-led models", and that these effects are mediated, in part, by the smallness of scale in these settings. A review of reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Sutcliffe-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sutcliffe 2012</LINK>), compared midwife-led care during pregnancy and birth with physician-led care resulted in similar findings to this review.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-05-30 23:08:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Midwife-led continuity of care confers important benefits and shows no adverse outcomes. However, due to the exclusion of women with significant maternal disease and substance abuse from some trials of women at mixed risk, caution should be exercised in applying the findings of this review to women with substantial medical or obstetric complications. Policy makers and healthcare providers should be aware that such benefits are conferred when midwives provide intrapartum care in hospital settings and also where midwives provide continuity through pregnancy and childbirth. Not all areas of the world have health systems where midwives are able to provide midwife-led continuity models of care, and health system financing is a potential barrier to implementation. Policy makers who wish to achieve clinically important improvements in maternity care, particularly around normalising and humanising birth, and preventing preterm birth should consider midwife-led continuity models of care and consider how financing of midwife-led services can be reviewed to support this.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-03-09 10:41:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Questions remain about the best way to organise midwife-led continuity of care under varying conditions, and further comparisons of different models of midwife-led continuity of care would be helpful. Further research should explore whether the observed benefits can be attributed to the model of continuity of midwifery care, philosophy, or to the quality and degree of relationship between the care provider and women. Further research is needed on more recently developed midwife-led continuity models of care that include home birth and greater levels of relationship continuity in community settings to women classified at low and high risk of complications. One such model that should be evaluated is the community-based caseload model of midwife-led continuity of care. These models offer continuity of carer, with a named midwife working in partnership with associate midwives (usually two). They provide community-based outreach and locally accessible services, in association with other care providers as necessary, with the option of intrapartum care provided at home, in a midwife-led unit or in a hospital setting as appropriate. Others provide care to socially vulnerable women with promising results but further trials are required (<LINK REF="REF-Rayment_x002d_Jones-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rayment-Jones 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>Little is known about the interface between midwife-led continuity models of care and the multi-disciplinary network of support. Although continuity of care has been identified as a core component of a model of midwife-led care, there is wide variation in the definition and measurement of continuity of care, which will require greater sophistication in future studies. Future research should also assess acceptability to midwives of different models of midwife-led continuity of care that offer relational continuity.</P>
<P>Future trials in this area would benefit from drawing on a framework for trials of complex interventions, which explicitly requires theoretical modelling between processes and outcomes in the pre-trial stage, and a process evaluation of the trial (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 2008</LINK>). All trials should provide greater description of intervention and standard models of care being assessed (<LINK REF="REF-Hoffman-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoffman 2014</LINK>) and include process evaluations of how they are being implemented (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2014</LINK>), using reporting guidelines for complex interventions. Future research in this area would benefit from exploring the theoretical underpinnings of these complex interventions and their associations with processes and outcomes and implementation reviews are helpful.</P>
<P>Questions remain about the mechanisms regarding why fetal loss is reduced, and why there are fewer preterm births in midwife-led continuity models of care.</P>
<P>There remains relatively little information about the effects of midwife-led continuity models of care on mothers' and babies' health and well being in the longer postpartum period. Future research should pay particular attention to outcomes that have been under-researched, but are causes of significant morbidity, including postpartum depression, urinary and faecal incontinence, duration of caesarean incision pain, pain during intercourse, prolonged perineal pain and birth injury (to the baby). We will add these to the review outcomes when the review is updated as available, if not already specified in this review.</P>
<P>There were no trials in resource-constrained countries and additional trials may be required in such settings.</P>
<P>Little is known about whether women feel they are part of the decision-making process; sense of control; maternal self-confidence; post-traumatic stress disorder, coping after the birth. There is wide variation in the instruments used to measure women's views of and experiences of care. There is a need to develop meaningful, robust, valid and reliable methods to assess psychosocial outcomes and well being in pregnant and childbearing women. All trials should include an assessment of maternal and fetal well being. There is a lack of consistency in estimating maternity care cost, and further research using standard approaches of cost estimation is required which also includes cost to women and families. All trials should include economic analyses of the relative costs and benefits.</P>
<P>Given the heterogeneity in the choice of outcome measures routinely collected and reported in randomised evaluations of models of maternity care, a core (minimum) data set, such as that by <LINK REF="REF-Devane-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Devane 2007</LINK>, and a validated measure of maternal quality of life and well being would be useful not only within multi-centre trials and for comparisons between trials, but might also be a significant step in facilitating useful meta-analyses of similar studies. In addition, future trials should include measures of optimal outcomes for mothers and babies in addition to measures of morbidity.</P>

<B>Experimental:</B> women randomised to midwife-led care (MLU) received antenatal care from midwives and, if desired, from their GPs for some visits. Where complications arose, women were transferred to CLU based on agreed criteria. Intrapartum care was provided by midwives in a MLU with transfer to CLU if necessary. Postnatal care was by midwives in the MLU for up to 2 days, with transfer of women or neonates to CLU if necessary (and back, as appropriate). On discharge, MLU midwives visited at home, and/or provided telephone support, up to the seventh postpartum day.</P>

<P>Intervention: caseload midwifery care (receiving care through antenatal, intrapartum and postpartum, in hospital and in the community) from a named caseload midwife working in a small group of midwives known as a midwifery group practice (4 full-time MWs). Each midwife provides care to 40 women a year as named midwife. The named midwife was on call for labour and birth. The caseload midwives were backed up when necessary by other caseload colleagues and by hospital staff during women&#8217;s stay in the postnatal ward. Community postnatal care was provided for up to 6 weeks. An obstetrician was allocated to each midwifery practice for consultation and referral using national guidelines. Total number randomised to intervention: 871.</P>
<P>Comparison: standard care, which involved shared antenatal care from a GP and hospital midwives, labour and birth and postnatal hospital care from hospital midwives. It was unclear whether community postnatal care was provided in standard care. Total number randomised to standard care: 877.</P>

<P>Forti 2015, additional report of Tracy 2013 identified from 2016 update. This reports on a subset of publicly funded women randomised in the M@ngo trial (n = 420); women receiving caseload midwifery care saw fewer midwives and health professionals during their intrapartum care than did women in standard care. No additional data provided.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Denominator = total randomised minus loss to follow-up, but including fetal loss before 20 weeks. Intervention = 871 - 31 + 11 = 951; standard care = 877 - 50 + 14 = 841.</LI>
<LI>19 (2%) women crossed over from caseload to standard care and 65 (7%) crossed over from standard to caseload care.</LI>
<LI>70%of participants were first time mothers.</LI>
<LI>The 2 groups were statistically different in terms of their BMI, which was judged as clinically not significant by authors.</LI>
<LI>An interesting observation was an overall reduction in caesarean sections for both groups from the pre-trial from 29% (at site 1) to 22% in the study population. This decrease could be seen as a limitation of the trial and the result of the Hawthorn effect.</LI>
<LI>Participants' satisfaction data and long-term cost analysis will be reported elsewhere.</LI>
<LI>Cost calculation: the per-woman cost of care calculated includes both direct and indirect costs for each full episode of maternity care, taking account of the length of hospital stay for each woman. These were calculated for midwifery and obstetric clinical time; use of operating theatres, laboratory tests, imaging, wards, allied health, pharmacy; capital depreciation; and clinical overheads. Further comprehensive cost analyses, including neonatal costs, will be reported elsewhere, as will the results of a survey to assess the participants&#8217; experiences and satisfaction with the different models of care.</LI>
<LI>For the outcome of PPH, we have added together women who had between 500 and 1000 mL blood loss with those who had &gt; 1000 mL.</LI>

<P>The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC) is the longest established national organization for women&#8217;s reproductive care in North America, with membership made up of obstetricians, gynaecologists, nurses, midwives, family physicians and scientists. We have long supported a woman&#8217;s right to choose the care provider of her preference for obstetrical care, and we actively support and promote collaborative models of care.<BR/>
<BR/>We were therefore very interested to read the review of midwifery-led care that you published in August of this year. We were not surprised by the main findings cited in the abstract: less use of epidural or intra-partum analgesia, fewer instrumental deliveries and, in consequence, fewer episiotomies, longer length of labour. These differences would be expected with the different model of care; for some women an unmediated delivery is a goal. However, for others, access to analgesia is a key consideration; we cannot conclude from this difference that the midwifery-led model is better for all women.<BR/>
<BR/>We were interested by the findings of fewer preterm births, fewer deaths &lt;24weeks, findings which are unexplained, and for which it is unlikely that we could identify an explanation based on who was providing the care, given that there are few, if any, clinical interventions by any provider prior to 24 weeks which can affect these outcomes.<BR/>
<BR/>Beyond these matters, however, we are primarily contacting you because the abstract failed to list the important outcomes which do not differ with provider: perineal trauma, induction of labour, oxytocin augmentation of labour, caesarean section, antenatal hospitalisation, post-partum haemorrhage, length of hospital stay, initiation of breast feeding, neonatal Apgar score, admission to neonatal nursery, fetal loss or death &gt;24 weeks.<BR/>
<BR/>Our greatest concern is that, although the abstract failed to list or consider these fundamentally important clinical outcomes that were equivalent, the authors still asserted that &#8220;most women should be offered midwifery-led continuity models of care and women should be encouraged to ask for this option&#8230;&#8221;<BR/>
<BR/>We believe this conclusion received, and continues to receive, the bulk of media and lay attention. In fact, those who do not actually read the review but only the abstract will come away with an incorrect understanding that is not supported by the results, an outcome that appears to be self-serving and misleading.<BR/>
<BR/>We expect better from the Cochrane Collaboration. This was an opportunity to provide women with reassurance that they have healthful options for their pregnancy care, and that they can feel confident that, regardless of their choice, the outcomes will be similar with respect to a safe and healthy pregnancy and delivery. Instead, the way this issue has been positioned, and by the selective use of the data, the Cochrane appears to advocate for a particular model of care, a disservice to women and the many other health care professionals who care for them.</P>

<P>We are pleased to see the SOGC&#8217;s interest in our review and thank them for their comments.</P>
<P>We agree that findings of fewer preterm births and fewer deaths less than 24weeks are interesting. Midwife-led continuity of care is a complex intervention, and it is impossible to unpick the relative importance of philosophy and continuity of care. We note in our review that questions remain about the mechanisms underlying these findings.</P>
<P>Our abstract is reported in original format in an effort to present information on multiple outcomes in as clear a manner as possible. Further to your comments, in the updated review, we have reformatted the presentation of outcomes in the abstract such that all primary outcomes are presented initially followed by all secondary outcomes. This will, we believe provide the reader with the totality of information on which to inform their health care decisions. Similarly, we have revised the conclusion to summarise the findings of the review and key areas for further research.</P>
<P>We trust this addresses your concerns.</P>
<P>Regards</P>

<P>We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group&#8217;s Trials Register by contacting the Trials Search Co-ordinator (January 2008).</P>
<P>The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group&#8217;s Trials Register is maintained by the Trials Search Co-ordinator and contains trials identified from:</P>
<OL>
<LI>quarterly searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL);</LI>
<LI>weekly searches of MEDLINE;</LI>
<LI>handsearches of 30 journals and the proceedings of major conferences;</LI>
<LI>weekly current awareness alerts for a further 44 journals plus monthly BioMed Central email alerts.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Details of the search strategies for CENTRAL and MEDLINE, the list of handsearched journals and conference proceedings, and the list of journals reviewed via the current awareness service can be found in the &#8216;Specialized Register&#8217; section within the editorial information about the <A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clabout/articles/PREG/frame.html">Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group</A>.</P>
<P>Trials identified through the searching activities described above are each assigned to a review topic (or topics). The Trials Search Co-ordinator searches the register for each review using the topic list rather than keywords. </P>
<P>In addition, we searched the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group's Trials Register (January 2008), Current Contents (1994 to January 2008), CINAHL (1982 to August 2006), Web of Science, BIOSIS Previews, ISI Proceedings, (1990 to 2008), and the WHO Reproductive Health Library (WHO-RHL), No. 9. Through WHO-RHL we obtained unpublished studies from the System for Information on Grey Literature In Europe (SIGLE). We used the search strategy detailed below, modifying it for each database as appropriate by checking each thesaurus for relevant subject headings and replacing them with text-word search terms when a subject heading was not available.</P>
