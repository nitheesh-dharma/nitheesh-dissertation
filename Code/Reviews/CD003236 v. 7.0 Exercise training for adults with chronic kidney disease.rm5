<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-09-01 16:09:55 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Exercise regimens are based on the frequency, intensity and duration of exercise training as well as the type of activity and the individual's initial level of physical fitness. All these factors have to be taken into account when aiming to achieve the goal with the regular exercise training and or rehabilitation.</P>
<P>Forty-five studies, randomising 1863 participants were included in this review. Thirty two studies presented data that could be included in the meta-analyses.This review showed that regular exercise training significantly improved physical fitness, physical functioning (e.g. walking capacity), and health-related quality of life in adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Beneficial effects were also seen on other outcome measures, such as blood pressure, but where the level of evidence is somewhat lower due to too few research studies and or small study populations. Beneficial effects were present in both adults with CKD but not yet in need of dialysis treatment, patients with dialysis (haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis) and kidney transplant recipients.</P>
<P>This systematic review and meta-analysis presents evidence-based data to clinicians and patients on which type of exercise regimen (type of exercises, intensity, frequency and duration of exercise) that should be used to optimise the effect size. The results should be implemented by clinicians who should encourage and inform adults with CKD that there is scientific evidence for beneficial effects of regular exercise training, and who should use an adequate exercise intervention in order to achieve the patient&#8217;s and the clinician's goal with the regular exercise.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-08-30 21:32:17 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a worldwide public health problem. In the National Kidney Foundation Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines it is stressed that lifestyle issues such as physical activity should be seen as cornerstones of the therapy. The physical fitness in adults with CKD is so reduced that it impinges on ability and capacity to perform activities in everyday life and occupational tasks. An increasing number of studies have been published regarding health effects of various regular exercise programmes in adults with CKD and in renal transplant patients.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2011-09-01 16:03:13 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>We aimed to: 1) assess the effects of regular exercise in adults with CKD and kidney transplant patients; and 2) determine how the exercise programme should be designed (e.g. type, duration, intensity, frequency of exercise) to be able to affect physical fitness and functioning, level of physical activity, cardiovascular dimensions, nutrition, lipids, glucose metabolism, systemic inflammation, muscle morphology and morphometrics, dropout rates, compliance, adverse events and mortality.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2011-08-31 13:54:48 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's specialised register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, Biosis, Pedro, Amed, AgeLine, PsycINFO and KoreaMed. We also handsearched reference lists of review articles and included studies, conference proceeding's abstracts. There were no language restrictions.</P>
<P>Date of last search: May 2010.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2011-08-31 13:55:34 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>We included any randomised controlled trial (RCT) enrolling adults with CKD or kidney transplant recipients undergoing any type of physical exercise intervention undertaken for eight weeks or more. Studies using less than eight weeks exercise, those only recommending an increase in physical activity, and studies in which co-interventions are not applied or given to both groups were excluded.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2011-09-01 16:34:42 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Data extraction and assessment of study and data quality were performed independently by the two authors. Continuous outcome data are presented as standardised mean difference (SMD) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-09-01 16:08:47 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Forty-five studies, randomising 1863 participants were included in this review. Thirty two studies presented data that could be meta-analysed. Types of exercise training included cardiovascular training, mixed cardiovascular and resistance training, resistance-only training and yoga. Some studies used supervised exercise interventions and others used unsupervised interventions. Exercise intensity was classed as 'high' or 'low', duration of individual exercise sessions ranged from 20 minutes/session to 110 minutes/session, and study duration was from two to 18 months. Seventeen per cent of studies were classed as having an overall low risk of bias, 33% as moderate, and 49% as having a high risk of bias.</P>
<P>The results shows that regular exercise significantly improved: 1) physical fitness (aerobic capacity, 24 studies, 847 participants: SMD -0.56, 95% CI -0.70 to -0.42; walking capacity, 7 studies, 191 participants: SMD -0.36, 95% CI-0.65 to -0.06); 2) cardiovascular dimensions (resting diastolic blood pressure, 11 studies, 419 participants: MD 2.32 mm Hg, 95% CI 0.59 to 4.05; resting systolic blood pressure, 9 studies, 347 participants: MD 6.08 mm Hg, 95% CI 2.15 to 10.12; heart rate, 11 studies, 229 participants: MD 6 bpm, 95% CI 10 to 2); 3) some nutritional parameters (albumin, 3 studies, 111 participants: MD -2.28 g/L, 95% CI -4.25 to -0.32; pre-albumin, 3 studies, 111 participants: MD - 44.02 mg/L, 95% CI -71.52 to -16.53; energy intake, 4 studies, 97 participants: SMD -0.47, 95% CI -0.88 to -0.05); and 4) health-related quality of life. Results also showed how exercise should be designed in order to optimise the effect. Other outcomes had insufficient evidence.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-09-01 16:36:13 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>There is evidence for significant beneficial effects of regular exercise on physical fitness, walking capacity, cardiovascular dimensions (e.g. blood pressure and heart rate), health-related quality of life and some nutritional parameters in adults with CKD. Other outcomes had insufficient evidence due to the lack of data from RCTs. The design of the exercise intervention causes difference in effect size and should be considered when prescribing exercise with the aim of affecting a certain outcome. Future RCTs should focus more on the effects of resistance training interventions or mixed cardiovascular- and resistance training as these exercise types have not been studied as much as cardiovascular exercise.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-09-01 16:14:25 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a worldwide public health problem. Adverse outcomes of CKD include loss of kidney function and cardiovascular disease. The disease is defined as either: 1) kidney damage that is present for three months or more and with or without decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR); or 2) GFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m² that is present for three months or more with or without kidney damage (<LINK REF="REF-KDOQI-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">KDOQI 2002</LINK>). There are primary and secondary causes of CKD. Examples of primary CKD are glomerulonephritis, interstitial nephritis and polycystic kidney disease. Secondary causes can be diabetes mellitus, nephrosclerosis, and systemic diseases such as systemic lupus erythematous, rheumatic diseases and systemic vasculitis. There are five stages of CKD (<LINK REF="REF-KDOQI-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">KDOQI 2002</LINK>).</P>
<UL>
<LI>Stage 1: GFR &gt; 90 mL/min/1.73 m² (kidney damage with normal or increased kidney function)</LI>
<LI>Stage 2: GFR 60-89 mL/min/1.73 m² (kidney damage with mild reduction in kidney function)</LI>
<LI>Stage 3: GFR 30-59 mL/min/1.73 m² (moderate kidney function)</LI>
<LI>Stage 4: GFR 15-29 mL/min/1.73 m² (severely reduced kidney function)</LI>
<LI>Stage 5: GFR &lt; 15 mL/min/1.73 m² (kidney failure)</LI>
<LI>Stage 5D: on haemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD)</LI>
</UL>
<P>The complications to CKD may be problems in themselves, but they may also increase the risk for other adverse events, for instance increase the risk for cardiovascular disease (<LINK REF="REF-KDOQI-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">KDOQI 2002</LINK>). In the National Kidney Foundation Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines it is stressed that lifestyle issues such as physical activity habits should be seen as cornerstones of the therapy, especially when aiming at managing cardiovascular risk factors (<LINK REF="REF-KDOQI-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">KDOQI 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The physical fitness and physical functioning (the ability and capacity to perform activities of daily living) is severely reduced in adults with CKD (<LINK REF="REF-Bohannon-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bohannon 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clyne-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clyne 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heiwe-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heiwe 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heiwe-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heiwe 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heiwe-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Heiwe 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johansen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johansen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kempeneers-1990b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kempeneers 1990b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kettner-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kettner 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kouidi-1997b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kouidi 1997b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kouidi-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kouidi 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kutner-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kutner 1992</LINK>), declining from 70% of the expected norm at early stages of CKD, to 50% of the expected norm when starting dialysis therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Brodin-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brodin 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clyne-1991b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clyne 1991b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heiwe-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heiwe 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kettner-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kettner 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Painter-1986b" TYPE="STUDY">Painter 1986b</LINK>). Kidney transplant patients have a physical fitness of approximately 70% to 80% of the expected norm (<LINK REF="STD-Painter-1986b" TYPE="STUDY">Painter 1986b</LINK>). Thus, the physical fitness in adults with CKD is so reduced that it impinges on their ability and capacity to perform activities in everyday life and occupational tasks (<LINK REF="REF-Heiwe-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heiwe 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilmore-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilmore 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The main causes for the decline in physical exercise capacity in this group of patients are renal anaemia and skeletal muscle disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Clyne-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clyne 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Diesel-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diesel 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kouidi-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kouidi 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McMahon-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">McMahon 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thompson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 1996</LINK>). These factors cause fatigue and inactivity that, in turn, further reduces the physical exercise capacity. Today renal anaemia is successfully corrected by treatment with recombinant human erythropoietin (EPO), which improves, but does not normalise, maximal physical exercise capacity (<LINK REF="REF-Barany-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barany 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CESG-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">CESG 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clyne-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clyne 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Laupacis-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laupacis 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lim-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lim 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Painter-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Painter 2002b</LINK>). There is however no significant changes in muscle metabolism after correction of renal anaemia, which implies that oxygen delivery is not the only limiting factor for aerobic metabolism in adults with CKD (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 1996</LINK>). The muscle weakness is predominant in the proximal muscle groups and in particular in the lower extremities (<LINK REF="REF-Brautbar-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brautbar 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kettner-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kettner 1987</LINK>). When analysing muscle biopsies histopathological abnormalities are seen already in the pre-dialysis stages (<LINK REF="STD-Heiwe-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Heiwe 2005</LINK>). The causes of muscular weakness have, however, not been fully elucidated. Muscle atrophy, a neuropathic process, and myopathy are potential causes of the muscular weakness. It is suggested that myopathy is due to abnormal energy metabolism (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 1996</LINK>), secondary hyperparathyroidism (<LINK REF="REF-Ritz-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ritz 1980</LINK>), malnutrition (<LINK REF="REF-Guarnieri-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guarnieri 1983</LINK>), prolonged physical inactivity (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 1990</LINK>), and to uraemia itself (<LINK REF="REF-Sakkas-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sakkas 2003b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Insulin resistance as well as reduced insulin sensitivity is also present in adults with CKD (<LINK REF="REF-Eidemak-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eidemak 1995</LINK>). There is a positive correlation between maximal exercise capacity and insulin sensitivity of the tissues (<LINK REF="REF-Eidemak-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eidemak 1995</LINK>). Insulin resistance and metabolic acidosis, both common in CKD, causes an increased muscle proteolysis. Studies performed on uraemic rats have shown that regular exercise training reduces muscle protein catabolism, and that the reduction is combined with improved insulin sensitivity (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Davis-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>During the last 30 years there have been a significantly increasing number of published studies concerning effects of regular exercise training in adults with CKD. There is however a lack of evidence-based guidelines for exercise training in adults with CKD. Therefore there is a need for a review in this area to clarify: 1) the effects of regular physical exercise training in adults with CKD and kidney transplant patients; and 2) how the exercise training programme should be designed (e.g. type of exercises, duration, intensity, frequency) to be able to affect clinically important outcomes in this group of patients.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2011-09-01 16:15:39 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>To assess the effects of regular physical exercise training in adults with CKD and kidney transplant recipients on the following clinically important health outcomes: physical fitness and functioning; cardiovascular dimensions; nutrition; level of physical activity; depression; health-related quality of life; blood lipids; muscle morphology and morphometric systemic inflammation; glucose metabolism; dropout rates; adverse events; and mortality.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Design</HEADING>
<P>All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs, assessing the effects of regular physical exercise training in adults with CKD were included. Crossover studies were considered if the starting period of intervention was randomly allocated.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Duration</HEADING>
<P>Studies of eight weeks regular exercise or longer were included since the aim was to evaluate the effects of regular ongoing physical exercise training. An exercise training period of less than eight weeks would be too short to show alteration in nutritional status, inflammation, cardiac function, physical activity, fitness and functioning, and psychological well-being.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Exclusion criteria</HEADING>
<P>Studies where the intervention involved only the recommendation of increased physical activity were not included as it was not possible to quantify the exercise stimulus. Studies where there was a co-intervention in the experimental group was not applied to the control group. Studies with an exercise intervention less than two months were excluded as this period has been found too short for achieving changes in many of the outcome measures that this review focuses on (<LINK REF="REF-ACSM-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACSM 2006</LINK>) and also as this review is focused on effects of long-term regular exercise training interventions.</P>

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2011-09-01 16:19:24 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Exercise regimens needed to be planned, structured and repetitive.

Studies were classified as short-term (three months or less, but not less than two months regular exercise), medium-term (four to six months regular exercise), long term (six to 12 months or longer regular exercise) based on the presented exercise intervention period.</P>
<P>As the intention of the review was to measure the effect of regular exercise training, only studies where the only difference in interventions between groups was regular exercise training were included. The review includes studies involving the following types of interventions.</P>

<P>The reference lists of review articles and included studies were handsearched for other potentially eligible studies. Conference proceeding's abstracts from nephrology scientific meetings were obtained from CENTRAL and the Renal Group's specialised register. These contain the handsearched results of conference proceedings from general and speciality meetings. This is an ongoing activity across the Cochrane Collaboration and is both retrospective and prospective. Please refer to The Cochrane Renal Group's Module in The Cochrane Library for the most up-to-date list of conference proceedings (<LINK REF="REF-Renal-Group-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Renal Group 2011</LINK>). Conference proceeding's abstracts were also handsearched (American Society of Nephrology to May 2010, European Dialysis Transplant Association to May 2010, EDTNA-ERCA to May 2010, International Society of Nephrology to May 2010, World Congress of Nephrology 2001 to May 2010). Authors of included studies who were contacted due to need of clarification of methods or results were also asked if they knew of any other relevant studies. </P>

<STUDY_SELECTION MODIFIED="2011-09-01 16:21:37 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Two authors independently reviewed the titles, abstract sections and keywords of every record retrieved from the electronic search. If the information given in the title, abstract and or keywords suggested that the study might fit the inclusion criteria of the systematic review, the full article was retrieved for further assessment. From the full articles, the decision to eliminate a study was based on agreement by both authors. Studies that did not fulfil the selection criteria of the systematic review were eliminated. Once a study was excluded, a record of the article, including the reason for exclusion, was retained. Cohen's kappa statistic was to be used to measure inter-rater assessment of the studies. This was, however, not necessary as the authors were unanimous in their initial choices of abstracts for further investigation.</P>

<LI>General information: published/unpublished, title, authors, source, contact address, country, setting, language, year of publication, duplicate publication, source of funding.</LI>
<LI>Study characteristics: design, randomisation (and method if stated), allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessors.</LI>
<LI>Participants: if randomised, inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria, total number in intervention/control groups, sex, age, baseline characteristics, diagnostic criteria, similarity of groups at baseline. We also extracted data concerning the number of participants who refused or were excluded from entering the study as well as number of withdrawals/losses to end of intervention follow-up. Further, we sought information on the reasons for discontinuation of all participants allocated to the intervention.</LI>
<LI>Intervention and comparator, duration of study.</LI>
<LI>All outcomes.</LI>
<LI>Results: for continuous variables, we extracted the number of participants, and the baseline and post-intervention means with SD (or standard error of the mean (SEM) or 95% confidence interval (95% CI)) for the intervention and control groups. We transformed SEM or 95% CI into SD, if appropriate. For dichotomous variables, we extracted proportions.</LI>

<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2011-08-31 08:30:58 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Where possible, investigators of studies were contacted to obtain information or data required that could not be found in the published reports. Additional information was sought, when necessary, for all studies that appeared to meet the inclusion criteria. Studies with data only available in graph form were included in the review but excluded from the meta-analysis rather than estimate the mean and SD from the graph. When post-intervention measures of dispersion (SD, SEM or 95% CI) were not available (e.g. when post-intervention information was expressed as percentage change from baseline values) the result was excluded from the meta-analysis and noted as missing data. When an article contained missing data the primary investigator was contacted for clarification of results. If the investigators' present contact information was not found or the investigators were not able to provide the missing data, the result was excluded from the meta-analysis and noted as missing data. Fourteen authors were contacted for clarification and/or to request raw data. See <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>.</P>

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2011-09-01 16:26:37 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Heterogeneity between studies was analysed using the Cochran Q test of N-1 degrees of freedom (P of 0.10 used for statistical significance). The I² parameter was used to quantify any inconsistency (I² = [(Q - df)/Q] x 100%, where Q is the Chi² statistic and df is its degrees of freedom, (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). When there was no heterogeneity (I² &#8804; 50%, P &gt; 0.10) the results from the fixed-effect meta-analyses were presented. If there was evidence of heterogeneity between included studies, a visual inspection of the CIs was used as a help to get an idea of the amount of statistical heterogeneity and to decide whether it would be reasonable to combine the results of these studies.</P>

<P>Data were summarised statistically, when it was sufficiently uniform and of sufficient quality. For dichotomous outcomes results were expressed as a risk ratios (RR) with 95% CI. Where continuous scales of measurement were used to assess the effects of the exercise training intervention, mean difference (MD) was used between the post-intervention values of the intervention and control groups to analyse the size of the intervention effects, or standardised mean difference (SMD) if different scales had been used.</P>

<P>Where heterogeneity was found, the following was undertaken.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Data entry was checked.</LI>
<LI>Heterogeneity was explored by conducting subgroup analyses.</LI>
<LI>If the heterogeneity could not be explained and there was a small but significant heterogeneity (I² &lt; 50%, P&lt; 0.10), the random-effects model was used as this model is the most conservative option.</LI>
<LI>If the studies had collect continuous outcome data using different scales or different units, the effect measure was changed to SMD as extreme heterogeneity may be apparent when using the MD but not when the more appropriate SMD was used.</LI>
<LI>No meta-analysis was conducted if a considerable variation (I² &gt; 50%) in results still remained, and if there was inconsistency in the direction of effect.</LI>

<P>The different subgroups were type of physical exercise training, duration, frequency and intensity of physical exercise training. We also performed length of intervention subgroup analyses for outcome measures, when there were sufficient data (three months or less, four to six months, six to 12 months or longer). Other subgroup analyses planned (but with insufficient data to pursue) were: sex (male or female); exercise frequency (less than three times/week, more than three times/week); and post-intervention follow-up timing (less than six months, six to 12 months, more than 12 months).

<P>From the initial search of the databases all abstracts were screened to identify potentially relevant studies. During the initial screening reports were excluded on basis of the information presented in the abstracts, because they were not relevant to the question under study (i.e. it was clear that the study did not have an exercise intervention, that it was not a RCT). In many cases it was not possible to decide whether to include or exclude a study based on the information in the abstract or because there was no abstract presented in the database. In those cases, full papers were retrieved and screened. A total of 2576 reports were screened and 487 potential reports of studies were identified. We excluded 365 reports as they were not relevant to the question under study. From the reports selected for closer examination, 45 studies (61 reports) finally qualified for inclusion in the review.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-09-01 16:52:35 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Results from this study show that all regular exercise training (regardless of type of exercise, intensity, length of intervention, or supervision) improves aerobic capacity, but it also showed that when aiming to increase aerobic capacity as effectively as possible in adults with CKD the following exercise regimen is recommended: four to six months supervised, regular (three sessions/week) high intensity mixed cardiovascular and resistance training lasting 30 to 90 minutes. To maintain this peak effect the patient has to continue with the regular exercise training intervention. This finding is in concordance with the recommended quantity and quality of exercise training for developing cardiorespiratory fitness in healthy adults (<LINK REF="REF-ACSM-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACSM 1998</LINK>). Modes of activities that were shown to improve aerobic capacity in adults with CKD were activities that use large muscle groups and that can be maintained continuously, such as cycling, walking, and jogging.</P>
<P>Muscular strength progressively reduces in adults with CKD. Adults with CKD were shown to improve their muscular strength by using any regular high intensity exercise training. Positive effects could be observed after only three months of regular exercise training. Whether the beneficial effect can be achieved by using a low intensity exercise intervention remains unclear as only one of included studies had used a low intensity exercise intervention. All types of exercise training showed positive effects of exercise training on muscular strength. Resistance training had a significant beneficial effect on muscular strength. There was however too few included studies using cardiovascular exercise or mixed cardiovascular and resistance training, to be able to draw conclusions concerning the type of exercise required for an optimal enhancement of muscular strength. Only two studies used unsupervised exercise (<LINK REF="STD-Koh-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Koh 2010a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Painter-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Painter 2002a</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Painter-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Painter 2002a</LINK> used a resistance training program whereas <LINK REF="STD-Koh-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Koh 2010a</LINK> used a cardiovascular exercise training program. Pooled data showed significant beneficial effects on muscular strength. Severely reduced muscle endurance is a common problem among adults with CKD. Only two of the included studies had used muscular endurance as an outcome measure (<LINK REF="STD-Koufaki-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Koufaki 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Segura_x002d_Orti-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Segura-Orti 2009</LINK>). More research focusing on the if and how exercise training can affect the muscular endurance are needed before conclusions can be drawn in this area.</P>
<P>Changing one's lifestyle is an important factor for the prevention, treatment and control of hypertension. Previous research have shown that exercise training is a cornerstone therapy and that the most blood pressure lowering effect of exercise training is observed when using regular (three sessions/week) low intensity (40% to 60%) dynamic cardiovascular exercise training (&gt; 30 minutes/session) (<LINK REF="REF-ACSM-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACSM 2004</LINK>). Meta-analyses have shown no effects of exercise frequency, type, intensity and duration of training on the positive blood pressure response in adults with hypertension and without CKD (<LINK REF="REF-Kelley-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelley 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kelley-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelley 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kelley-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelley 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Whelton-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whelton 2002</LINK>). In concordance with previous research, the present study shows that regular exercise training had a significant effect on resting blood pressure in adults with CKD. To achieve this effect the analysis showed that it is not possible to use any exercise (regardless of type of exercise, intensity, length of intervention, supervision or not). Subgroup analysis based on intensity, length of intervention and type of exercise training did however show that when using four to six months of high intensity, mixed cardiovascular and resistance training programme there was a significant decrease in resting systolic and diastolic blood pressure in adults with CKD. This decrease was approximately 4 to 7 mm Hg following regular exercise training. This is of importance as even a small reduction (2 mm Hg) in an average population's systolic blood pressure can reduce coronary heart disease, stroke and all-cause mortality (<LINK REF="REF-ACSM-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACSM 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stamler-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stamler 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Whelton-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whelton 2002</LINK>). To be able to detect smaller decreases in blood pressure, large enough sample sizes have to be used.</P>
<P>Even modest reductions in body mass indices can improve an individual's health (<LINK REF="REF-Goldstein-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldstein 1992</LINK>). In combination with reduced energy intake, regular exercise training is used as a strategy to affect body mass indices in adults with overweight or obesity. The optimal exercise regimen for these individuals has been shown to be a progressive increase of physical exercise training from 150 to 200 to 300 minutes of exercise training/week. Adopting more than 280 minutes of exercise training/week (e.g. &gt;2000 kcal/week) has been shown to be important for maintaining weight loss in the long-term (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jakicic-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jakicic 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jakicic-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jakicic 2001</LINK>). However little is known about the difference in effects between different exercise regimens. Regular exercise training was not shown to significantly affect body mass indices in adults with CKD, except for one study with only 11 participants, and this result remained unchanged when we investigated type, intensity, intervention period and supervision of exercise. The result is however based on a relatively small sample size and further research is needed before drawing scientific conclusions concerning the effect that regular exercise training programmes can have on body mass indices. Also, it is well known that exercise training alone does not reduce weight and has to be combined with a reduced energy intake. In the present study body mass indices were used as an outcome measure, but the reader should be aware of that none of the included studies have used an intervention that was primarily designed for weight loss (e.g. there was no combined energy intake and exercise intervention).</P>
<P>Today, the main cause for CKD is diabetes mellitus. Mild to moderate intensity endurance and resistance exercise training (40% to 70% VO2 max ESKD) has been shown to have favourable effects on glucose control and insulin sensitivity in adults with type 2 diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Albright-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Albright 2000</LINK>). These favourable effects are however a reflection of the last individual exercise bout rather than exercise training per se, and to sustain the favourable effects it is therefore important that the exercise training is regular (5 sessions/week)(<LINK REF="REF-Albright-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Albright 2000</LINK>). In the present study there was not enough data to draw scientific conclusions about the effect of regular exercise training on glucose metabolism in adults with CKD. The single RCT that had investigated this did not see any significant effect of 12 months regular, supervised, high intensity cardiovascular exercise training on glucose metabolism (<LINK REF="STD-Goldberg-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Goldberg 1983</LINK>). The study sample was however only on 13 randomised participants and the exercise regimen used differed from that recommended for adults with type 2 diabetes in order to affect glucose metabolism (<LINK REF="STD-Goldberg-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Goldberg 1983</LINK>). They used high intensity exercise training, whereas the exercise regimen that has been shown to be effective in adults with type 2 diabetes consists of low to moderate intensity exercise training at least three times/week and with a minimum cumulative energy expenditure of 1000 kcal/week (<LINK REF="REF-Albright-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Albright 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Blair-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blair 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gordon-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gordon 1995</LINK>). Also, the type of exercise training used by <LINK REF="STD-Goldberg-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Goldberg 1983</LINK> was strictly cardiovascular, whereas today's exercise guidelines for adult with type 2 diabetes recommend that resistance training should be included as part of the exercise program (<LINK REF="REF-Albright-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Albright 2000</LINK>). Several studies (<LINK REF="REF-Fennicchia-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fennicchia 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fluckey-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fluckey 1994</LINK>), have found that resistance training results in improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in normal and glucose-intolerant adults. It has also been shown that a mixed cardiovascular and resistance training programme have significant beneficial effects on glucose metabolism in adults with type 2 diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Maiorana-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maiorana 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tokmatidis-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tokmatidis 2004</LINK>). It is possible that a mixed cardiovascular and resistance training program would have affected the glucose metabolism in <LINK REF="STD-Goldberg-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Goldberg 1983</LINK>. Further research is necessary to investigate whether regular exercise training has the capacity to affect glucose metabolism in adults with CKD, and if so to investigate the exercise regimen required for the optimal enhancement.</P>
<P>Depression can be present when having CKD. Results from the present study indicate that 3 to 10 months supervised high or low intensity, mixed cardiovascular and resistance training interventions should be used when aiming to decrease level of depression. More research data are needed in order to draw conclusions concerning the effect of regular exercise training on level of depression in adults with CKD, and also to be able to compare the effects depending on the type, intensity, duration, and supervision of the exercise intervention.</P>
<P>Results from the present study show that there is insufficient research data from RCTs concerning several outcome measures that might be affected by regular exercise training. Future research should focus on designing RCTs evaluating the effects of various exercise regimens on the following outcome measures in adults with CKD: muscular endurance, muscle morphology and morphometrics, physical functioning (e.g. stair climbing), cardiovascular dimensions (e.g. arrhythmias), nutrition, systemic inflammation, level of physical activity in daily living, depression, lipids, glucose metabolism, drop-out rates, compliance, adverse events and mortality. Future RCTs should also focus more on the effects of resistance training interventions and or mixed cardiovascular and resistance training as these exercise types has not been studied as much as cardiovascular exercise training. It would also be of interesting to study the effect of a regular exercise regimen versus a pharmacological treatment or as a complement to a pharmacological treatment, i.e. statin versus regular exercise regimen design to affect lipids, or the effect of a combination between statin and a regular exercise regimen designed to positively affect lipids.</P>
<P>This review has some potential limitations. First, in some studies the outcome measures were not blindly assessed and ITT analysis was not used in all studies. This could have inflated the apparent results (<LINK REF="REF-Hollis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hollis 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>). During the process of writing this review it also became evident that researchers and editors within this field need to improve the report of methodological and result information (i.e. method of randomisation, drop-out rate, compliance to the intervention and control) that is important for the reader when assessing the quality of the study. The reader should be aware that in this review a study that may have been classified as having lower quality than it actually had as data and/or information was missing from the reports. During the review process a large number of exercise studies were excluded as participants had not been randomised. Future exercise studies in adults with CKD should therefore strive for randomisation of participants, which would increase knowledge of effects of various exercise regimens. Another problem was outcome measurement. For example muscular fitness (strength and endurance) was measured in several different ways (i.e. one repetition maximum or peak torque). This complicates comparisons between studies and also the meta-analysis of studies results. Being able to achieve a consensus concerning which methods to be used when measuring muscular fitness and health-related quality of life in adults with CKD would make it easier to compare results from different studies with one another and increase the quality of meta-analysis and future research within this field.</P>
<P>Duration of exercise varied from three months (17 studies), four to six months (14 studies), and seven to 12 months (14 studies). Studies with longer duration of exercise intervention (12 to 24 months) are needed to be able to evaluate long-term benefits (e.g. morbidity and mortality) of regular exercise training in adults with CKD. When evaluating the effects of regular exercise training the reader and researcher also have to bear in mind that there is also important intrinsic limitation to regular exercise training, including the reluctance of individuals to regularly adhere to a prescribed exercise training intervention. Some individuals have a low compliance to exercise training, whereas others have a high compliance. Most exercisers do however have a relatively good compliance in the beginning but gradually decreases the compliance to regular exercise training in a long-term perspective. Clinical experience also shows that a high compliance to exercise training is usually achieved as long as the participant's exercise is supervised, but when the individual should continue to exercise on its own the compliance decreases. This was also seen in the studies in this review, where a follow-up period was used. Future studies should focus on long-term benefits of regular exercise training; on developing beneficial exercise and behavioural modification interventions with high compliance (also following the treatment); and include long-term follow-up of the treatment.</P>

<P>Clinicians should inform adults with CKD that there is scientific evidence showing that by exercising regularly for &gt; 30 minutes/session and three times/week they would improve their physical fitness, walking capacity, cardiovascular dimensions (e.g. blood pressure and heart rate), some nutritional parameters and health-related quality of life. Beneficial effects are present in both adults with CKD stages 1 to 5, patients with dialysis (haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis) and kidney transplant recipients. Clinicians should encourage adults with CKD to participate in regular exercise regimens. Exercise regimens should be based on the frequency, intensity and duration of exercise training as well as the type of activity and the individual's initial level of physical fitness. All these factors have to be taken into account when aiming to achieve the goal with the regular exercise training and or rehabilitation.</P>

<P>Outcomes that need more research are muscular endurance, muscle morphology and morphometrics, physical functioning (e.g. stair climbing), cardiovascular dimensions (e.g. arrhythmias), nutrition (e.g. muscle mass), systemic inflammation, level of physical activity in daily living, depression, lipids, glucose metabolism, drop-out rates, compliance, adverse events and mortality. Future RCTs should focus more on the effects of resistance training interventions and/or mixed cardiovascular and resistance training as these exercise types has not been studied as much as cardiovascular exercise training.</P>

<P>Supervised exercise group</P>
<UL>
<LI>Patients followed a 6-month supervised exercise training program.</LI>
<UL>
<LI>The training sessions were performed three times/week, 90 min each time, on the non-dialysis days. Patients were divided into subgroups, each consisting of three or four persons according to age, gender, and dialysis days. Each training session consisted of a 10-min warm-up (ergometer cycling or treadmill), a 50-min intermittent aerobic exercise program (including callisthenics, steps and flexibility exercises) and a 10-min cool down period. After 2 months of training, a 10-min stretching and low-weight resistance training program was added to the program. The intensity was prescribed on an individual basis, so that during the first 2 months the heart rate remained within 60-70% of the max heart rate achieved during the initial maximal exercise test. After the first 3 months the younger patients were playing basketball and football once a week, whereas the older patients were swimming.</LI>

<P>Home exercise group</P>

<LI>They were supplied with ergometer cycles and given instructions regarding the performance of simple exercises. The researchers kept close contact with these patients, to answer any questions they had and to become aware of their course. The patients had to cycle at least five times a week, 30 min each time, at a heart rate of 50-60% of the maximal heart rate each had performed during the baseline treadmill test. After that, the patients performed simple flexibility and muscular extension exercises. Progress checks were carried out at each patient's home every month to check physical adaptation and to modify the exercise program, if necessary.</LI>

<LI>Individual exercise training designed to match each patient's physical capacity.</LI>
<UL>
<LI>The training program consisted mainly of bicycle ergometer exercise in the patient's home, and running, swimming and walking. Exercise duration and intensity was gradually increased, the latter up to 60-75% of maximal exercise capacity. The intensity of exercise was related to the patient's VO2 max by monitoring heart rate during the exercise session and adjusting running/walking/swimming speed, or resistance on the bicycle ergometer, to elicit the heart rate equivalent to the desired per cent of VO2 max. The relationship between heart rate and O2 uptake was determined by measuring VO2 and heart rate during submaximal and maximal stages of the bicycle exercise tests performed each month. The goal was to raise the energy consumption by 2.000 kcal/week corresponding to approximately 30 min of bicycling or an equal amount of other activities daily.</LI>

Within 4-6 weeks, most patients progressed to bicycling 8-10 min at an intensity of 65% of VO2 max. By 12 weeks, most patients exercised at an intensity of 70-75% of VO2 max, alternating 23 laps of walking with 1 lap of jogging for 5-7 min. At 20 weeks, exercise sessions were increased to walk 1 lap, jog 1-2 laps for 5-7 min, and 10-15 min on the bicycle ergometer at an intensity of 70-80% of VO2 max.

There are also figures in which data is presented on an individual or a group basis. For carbohydrate metabolism the number of patients in the control group is not presented. We have tried to use the figures to calculate mean ± SD for the outcomes, but have decided that instead of including approximate outcome data (based on our calculations from the figures) into the meta-analysis, which would increase the risk of errors, the results from the study were not be used in the meta analysis.

<LI>3 months of aerobic exercise on a cycle ergometer.</LI>
<UL>
<LI>Patients with CAPD exercised 3 times/week under the supervision of an exercise physiologist. Patients with HD exercised during the first 2 h of dialysis also under the supervision of en exercise physiologist in a recumbent position. Patients who paused their exercise training for more than 2 weeks had to start from the exercise workload that they stopped at or the work load that they could sustain. Patients who had to pause their exercise training for more than 4 weeks had to start from the beginning. All patients had to complete 12 weeks of exercise training. Exercise intensity was 90% of VO2 peak. Each exercise session was divided into a warm-up, conditioning and cool down session. The exercise started gently with all patients having to perform 3 separate bouts on a bike, each of 6-8 min duration. After the first 2 weeks, exercise duration of cycling was gradually increased by adding 1 min extra to each conditioning bout also depending on the patients' response to the exercise training. The aim was that all patients were to be able to perform 2 separate bouts of continuous cycling of 20 min each on the cycle ergometer, or one of 30-35 min duration. The patients in this group were asked not to get involved in any other physical activities except the ones performed within the study.</LI>

<LI>The exercise intervention in this study has used a mix of resistance training with a low intensity and cardiovascular exercise training with an intensity of ~60%. Due to this mix of intensity, the studies exercise training programme has been classified as low intensity mixed cardiovascular- and resistance exercise training in this meta-analysis.</LI>
<LI>As the exercise intervention contains both exercise that has been performed pre-dialysis and exercise training that has been performed during dialysis, this study has not been included in the comparison between effects of exercise training performed on non-dialysis days, before dialysis or during dialysis, respectively.</LI>
