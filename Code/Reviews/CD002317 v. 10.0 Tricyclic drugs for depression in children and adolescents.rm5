<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-06-12 09:56:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>Depression affects about one in 20 young people, and can contribute to a variety of negative outcomes, such as poor academic functioning and difficulties in peer and family relationships. Depression also increases the risk for substance use, self harm and suicide. Beginning with imipramine, tricyclic drugs were developed from the late 1950s to alleviate the symptoms of depression. They were designed to enhance the availability of serotonin and noradrenaline to brain cells. Tricyclic drugs were first prescribed to children and adolescents for depression in the early 1960s, but were more commonly prescribed to children for the treatment of bedwetting. Since this Cochrane review was first published in 2000, tricyclic drugs have been replaced in most countries by newer-generation antidepressants.</P>
<P>This review contained 14 trials (with 590 participants) and tested the effectiveness of tricyclic drugs against placebo. Trial data were available for amitriptyline, desipramine, imipramine and nortriptyline. Based on nine trials (454 participants), there was no evidence that tricyclic drugs lead to higher rates of remission or response than placebo. Based on 13 of the trials (533 participants), there was evidence that people treated with a tricyclic drug had lower depression severity scores than those on placebo, however, the size of this difference was small. Consistent with their known mechanism of action, tricyclic drugs were more likely than placebo to cause vertigo, symptoms of lowered blood pressure, tremor and dry mouth. Subgroup analyses of six trials involving only adolescents (239 participants) and two trials involving only children (77 participants) found no evidence of differential rates of remission or response between the age groups. In contrast, there was lowering of depression scores in eight trials involving only adolescents (414 participants) and no lowering of depression scores in three trials involving only children (64 participants).</P>
<P>Most of the included studies were conducted in the era before standard methods for conducting treatment trials for depression in children and adolescents came about. There were considerable differences between the studies with regards to the clinical tools and methods used in assessment of improvement. Most trials were small. Only two trials produced a definitive result for depressive symptoms, and no trial produced a definitive result for response or remission. There was typically insufficient information to judge the quality of the trials accurately. With these limitations, it is difficult to answer questions about the effectiveness and safety of tricyclic drugs for treating depression in children and adolescents. Current evidence suggests that the situation is much the same for newer-generation antidepressants. Clinicians need to provide accurate information to children and adolescents, and their families, about the uncertainties regarding the benefits and risks of antidepressants as a treatment option for depression. Tricyclic drugs do not seem useful for treating children before puberty, and are, at most, of moderate benefit for adolescents.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-06-11 09:14:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a need to identify effective and safe treatments for depression in children and adolescents. While tricyclic drugs are effective in treating depression in adults, individual studies involving children and adolescents have been equivocal. Prescribing of tricyclic drugs for depression in children and adolescents is now uncommon, but an accurate estimate of their efficacy is helpful as a comparator for other drug treatments for depression in this age group. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2000 and updated in 2002, 2006 and 2010.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-06-11 10:11:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We conducted a search of the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR) (to 12 April 2013), which includes relevant randomised controlled trials from the following bibliographic databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (all years), EMBASE (1974-), MEDLINE (1950-) and PsycINFO (1967-). The bibliographies of previously published reviews and papers describing original research were cross-checked. We contacted authors of relevant abstracts in conference proceedings of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, and we handsearched the <I>Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry</I> (1978 to 1999).</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-06-11 18:15:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>One of two review authors selected the trials, assessed their quality, and extracted trial and outcome data. A second review author assessed quality and checked accuracy of extracted data. Most studies reported multiple outcome measures including depression scales and clinical global impression scales. For each study, we took the best available depression measure as the index measure of depression outcome. We established predetermined criteria to assist in the ranking of measures. Where study authors reported categorical outcomes, we calculated individual and pooled risk ratios for non-improvement in treated compared with control subjects. For continuous outcomes, we calculated pooled effect sizes as the number of standard deviations by which the change in depression scores for the treatment group exceeded those for the control group.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-06-13 08:28:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Fourteen trials (590 participants) were included. No overall difference was found for the primary outcome of response to treatment compared with placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.26; 9 trials, N = 454). There was a small reduction in depression symptoms (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.32, 95% CI -0.59 to -0.04; 13 trials, N = 533), but the evidence was of low quality. Subgroup analyses suggested a small reduction in depression symptoms among adolescents (SMD -0.45, 95% CI -0.83 to -0.007), and negligible change among children (SMD 0.15, 95% CI -0.34 to 0.64). Treatment with a tricyclic antidepressant caused more vertigo (RR 2.76, 95% CI 1.73 to 4.43; 5 trials, N = 324), orthostatic hypotension (RR 4.86, 95% CI 1.69 to 13.97; 5 trials, N = 324), tremor (RR 5.43, 95% CI 1.64 to 17.98; 4 trials, N = 308) and dry mouth (RR 3.35, 95% CI 1.98 to 5.64; 5 trials, N = 324) than did placebo, but no differences were found for other possible adverse effects. Wide CIs and the probability of selective reporting mean that there was very low-quality evidence for adverse events.</P>
<P>There was heterogeneity across the studies in the age of participants, treatment setting, tricyclic drug administered and outcome measures. Statistical heterogeneity was identified for reduction in depressive symptoms, but not for rates of remission or response. As such, the findings from analyses of pooled data should be interpreted with caution.</P>
<P>We judged none of these trials to be at low risk of bias, with limited information about many aspects of risk of bias, high dropout rates, and issues regarding measurement instruments and the clinical usefulness of outcomes, which were often variously defined across trials.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-06-12 10:27:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-06-11 09:38:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Depression is a common, yet under-recognised, problem in young people. Estimated prevalence ranges from 0.4% to 2.5% in primary school children, and from 0.4% to 8.3% in adolescents (<LINK REF="REF-Birmaher-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Birmaher 1996</LINK>). A study of registry data for a large number of American children over a 30-year period indicated that the rate of depression has consistently been around 2.8% for under 13 and 5.6% for 13- to 18-year olds (<LINK REF="REF-Costello-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Costello 2006</LINK>). Important consequences of depression in this age group include social dysfunction, academic underachievement and suicidal behaviour. Consequently, adequate detection and treatment of depressed adolescents is an important strategy for curbing the rising rate of youth suicide seen in many developed countries (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenberg-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenberg 1989</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-06-12 10:27:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Tricyclic drugs were the first-line pharmacological treatment for depression prior to the introduction of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in the 1990s. A variety of tricyclic drugs with different dose ranges and half lives were introduced to the market over the years. The two most commonly studied tricyclic drugs in children and adolescents are imipramine and amitriptyline. Both are typically prescribed in doses of 1 to 5 mg/kg/day. Half lives of medications in children are inversely related to the age. Average half lives in children and adolescents of imipramine and amitriptyline are 16 and 24 hours, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Werry-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Werry 1999</LINK>). Tricyclic drugs are metabolised in the liver by cytochrome P450 (CYP450) 2D6 and 1A2. Hence, CYP450 2D6 or 1A2 inhibitors, such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, cimetidine, haloperidol or phenothiazines, can increase plasma levels of tricyclic drugs. Methylphenidate, a drug used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), may also inhibit metabolism of tricyclic drugs. Other reported interactions include; increased risk of seizure in combination with tramadol, paralytic ileus or hyperthermia if used with anticholinergic medications, increased sympathomimetic effects if given with sympathomimetic drugs and precipitating a manic state if switched over from or added to another antidepressant. Tricyclic drugs can also inhibit the antihypertensive effect of clonidine (<LINK REF="REF-Stahl-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stahl 2006</LINK>).<BR/>

</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-06-12 09:59:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Depression, at least for some patients, is associated with a lower level of noradrenaline and serotonin at certain brain receptor sites. Tricyclic drugs have been shown to inhibit the cellular uptake and inactivation of serotonin and noradrenaline leading to an increased noradrenergic and serotonergic neurotransmission in the brain. This is believed to be the mechanism of action of tricyclic drugs in the treatment of depression (<LINK REF="REF-Feighner-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feighner 1999</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-06-11 18:18:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The current publication is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2000 and previously updated in 2008. The earlier version indicated that tricyclic drugs are not useful in treatment of depression in children. The meta-analysis needed to be updated given that there is an additional trial that has not been included in earlier the version. There has almost certainly been a shift away from the prescribing of tricyclic drugs to children and adolescents in favour of newer-generation antidepressants. An updated review of newer-generation antidepressants for depressive disorders in children and adolescents was published in 2012 (<LINK REF="REF-Hetrick-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hetrick 2012</LINK>). Knowledge of the efficacy of tricyclic drugs remains relevant, however, for providing a baseline against which these newer agents may be compared.</P>

<P>The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group (CCDAN) maintain two clinical trials registers at their editorial base in Bristol, UK: a references register and a studies-based register. The CCDANCTR-References Register contains over 31,500 reports of RCTs in depression, anxiety and neurosis. Approximately 65% of these references have been tagged to individual, coded trials. The coded trials are held in the CCDANCTR-Studies Register and records are linked between the two registers through the use of unique Study ID tags. Coding of trials is based on the EU-Psi coding manual, using a controlled vocabulary (please contact the CCDAN Trials Search Coordinator for further details). Reports of trials for inclusion in the Group's registers are collated from routine (weekly), generic searches of MEDLINE (1950-), EMBASE (1974-) and PsycINFO (1967-); quarterly searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and review-specific searches of additional databases. Reports of trials are also sourced from international trials registers via the World Health Organization's trials portal (the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (<A HREF="http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/">ICTRP</A>)); pharmaceutical companies; and handsearching of key journals, conference proceedings and other (non-Cochrane) systematic reviews and meta-analyses.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Setting</HEADING>
<P>One study was conducted in Canada, the remainder were conducted in the USA. Participants were outpatients in eight trials, inpatients of child or adolescent psychiatric units in five trials, and a mixture of inpatients and outpatients in one trial.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>Eight trials were directed to adolescents (aged 12 years and over), four trials were directed to children (aged 11 years and under) and two trials involved participants spanning childhood and adolescence. Gender was reported in 11 of 14 studies, yielding 297 female and 235 male participants. Exclusion criteria were inconsistent across studies. Most studies sought to exclude people with comorbid schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, pervasive developmental disorder, substance abuse and serious medical conditions, but studies variably excluded conditions such as obsessive compulsive disorder, conduct disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. It is likely, therefore, that patterns of comorbidity differed across studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>Six trials involved imipramine, four trials involved amitriptyline, two trials involved desipramine and two trials involved nortriptyline. The control treatment in all cases was inactive placebo. Methods of determining doses, where reported, ranged in sophistication from fixed milligram per kilogram doses to weekly plasma level monitoring. The number of doses of drug per day ranged from one to three.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Heterogeneous and generally multiple methods were used for measuring response to treatment or changes in depressive symptoms. No single measure was used sufficiently often across studies to warrant consideration as a 'gold standard' measure. Our strategy for managing the heterogeneity of outcome measures is described under <LINK TAG="CRIT_OUTCOMES" TYPE="SECTION">Types of outcome measures</LINK>. Clinical global assessment scale changes were reported by a sufficient number of studies to enable these data to be pooled.</P>
<P>Follow-up intervals ranged from 4 to 10 weeks. The shorter follow-up intervals are arguably insufficient to determine treatment responsiveness adequately.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-06-11 11:05:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The review has yielded equivocal results. On primary outcomes, low-quality evidence showed a small effect favouring tricyclic drug over placebo in the reduction of depressive symptoms while there was no difference in response/remission rates. On secondary outcomes, low-quality evidence showed no difference in global assessment scores; while consistent with the known pharmacological action of tricyclic drugs, certain side effects, such as orthostatic hypotension and dry mouth, were more common with active treatment than placebo. Subgroup analyses showed the effect of tricyclic drugs on reducing depressive symptoms in adolescents was in the range negligible to moderate, while for children the effect was in the range small favouring tricyclic drug to moderate favouring placebo. To place the effect of tricyclic drug treatment in perspective, 482/1000 participants might be expected to respond or remit with tricyclic treatment compared with 450/1000 treated with placebo, yielding a net increase of 32/1000.</P>
<P>For side effects, all but tiredness, perspiration and micturition problems occurred in the tricyclic group more frequently than the placebo group, but only the difference in rates of vertigo, orthostatic hypotension, tremor and dry mouth reached statistical significance. Based on these data, side effects are not likely to be the main barrier to the clinical usefulness of tricyclic antidepressants in juvenile depression. However, only a minority of studies reported side effects in a systematic fashion. We consider this an important omission. No serious adverse events were reported in the trials. That said, a spate of sudden deaths in children associated with apparently therapeutic doses of tricyclic drugs was reported through the 1990s (<LINK REF="REF-Varley-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Varley 1997</LINK>). In accidental or deliberate overdose, tricyclic drugs may cause seizures, coma and cardiac arrhythmias (<LINK REF="REF-Olgun-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olgun 2009</LINK>). Such problems are unlikely to occur, however, if the amount ingested of, for example, amitriptyline is less than 5 mg/kg (<LINK REF="REF-McFee-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">McFee 2001</LINK>). The equivocal benefits of tricyclic drugs for depression in children and adolescents is outweighed by the small but important risk of toxicity at therapeutic doses, and the greater risk of toxicity in overdose.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-06-11 18:36:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The results of this meta-analysis suggest that tricyclic drugs do not increase the likelihood that children and adolescents who are depressed will remit or respond. Tricyclic drugs may lead to a small reduction in depression symptoms in adolescents, but not children. The latter result makes intuitive sense, since it should be expected that samples of depressed adolescents would show a pattern of response to tricyclic drugs that moves towards the response seen in adult populations. The systematic review has included studies covering a variety of study populations in different sites treated with a range of tricyclic drugs in various doses. Nevertheless, it is by no means a comprehensive study of all possible participants, investigations and outcomes. Use of tricyclic drugs in children and adolescents has significantly diminished since the first version of this study was published, to be replaced by the prescription of SSRI drugs and other newer-generation antidepressants. A companion Cochrane review of 16 eligible RCTs of newer-generation antidepressants for depression in children and adolescents found an RR for response or remission of 1.18 (95% CI 1.08 to 1.28) (<LINK REF="REF-Hetrick-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hetrick 2012</LINK>). The magnitude of reduction in depression symptoms cannot be directly compared between the tricyclic and newer-generation antidepressant reviews, because different methods were used to analyse the data. While superiority of SSRI drugs as a class over placebo was statistically significant, the authors of the review correctly identified that the effect was small and of uncertain clinical significance. While SSRIs have been shown to increase the risk of suicide-related behaviours in the short term compared with placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Hetrick-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hetrick 2012</LINK>), there is a body of evidence demonstrating that unlike the situation with tricyclic drugs, fatal outcomes with SSRIs overdose are extremely rare (<LINK REF="REF-Barbey-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barbey 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hayes-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hayes 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klein_x002d_Schwartz-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein-Schwartz 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Phillips-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillips 1997</LINK>). SSRIs therefore, offer a safer alternative than tricyclic drugs and are possibly more effective in children and adolescents, although the benefits of treatment are modest.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-06-11 18:35:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Fourteen studies examining the efficacy of tricyclic drugs in the treatment of child and adolescent depression were amenable to analysis using a meta-analytic approach. Nine studies (454 participants) reported response or remission data. The sample size just has sufficient power at the 80% level to detect a significant RR for failure to recover or respond of 0.50 or less. Most of the included studies were conducted in the era before methodology of treatment trials for depression in children and adolescents was standardised. As such, there was considerable heterogeneity in the clinical tools and methods used in the assessment of improvement. It was unusual in this era for investigators to specify a primary outcome measure. We have attempted to overcome this by using a systematic approach to selecting the highest quality outcome measure. Variable and usually short period of follow-up (2 to 10 weeks) should also be considered a limitation. Nevertheless, the results of the studies were consistent. Only two of 14 studies show a positive treatment effect on any measure. The studies were also conducted in the era before standardised reporting of trial methodology (e.g. Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT)). Risk of bias was, therefore, difficult to determine across most domains because of inadequate reporting. That said, blinding of participants was reported most frequently, while concealment of allocation was reported least frequently.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-06-11 11:14:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Studies published in languages other than English may have been missed in the process of the literature search. We included only orally administered tricyclic drugs as this reflects the manner in which these drugs are typically delivered. However, this decision precluded the possibility of identifying that tricyclic drugs are more effective if administered by other routes. The original published version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Hazell-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hazell 1995</LINK>), which was based on a smaller number of trials, concluded that tricyclic drugs were unlikely to be beneficial for depression in children and adolescents. It is possible that we have allowed that conclusion to influence the interpretation of more recent trial data.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2013-06-11 18:37:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The results are consistent with findings of the earlier review by Hazell et al (<LINK REF="REF-Hazell-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hazell 1995</LINK>). However, unlike <LINK REF="REF-Hazell-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hazell 1995</LINK>, the present review has sufficient power at the 80% level to detect a significant OR for failure to improve of 0.50 or less. The 95% CI indicated that any improvement in depression rating scores in the treated group compared with the control group is likely to be less than 0.59 standard deviations, which is lower than the estimate of 0.86 reported by Hazell et al. (<LINK REF="REF-Hazell-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hazell 1995</LINK>). The pooled estimate effect size of 0.32 was statistically significant, but is well below the two standard deviation difference required to produce a 50% reduction in depression rating scores from baseline to follow-up (<LINK REF="REF-Byrne-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Byrne 1989</LINK>). Again, we conclude that the data indicate no clinically significant treatment effect.</P>
<P>A study by Sallee et al. involving intravenous administration of clomipramine to depressed adolescents aged between 14 and 18 years was excluded from the present analyses owing to its novel and experimental nature (<LINK REF="STD-Sallee-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sallee 1997</LINK>). However, the authors reported a statistically non-significant trend favouring treatment, with only one of eight actively treated adolescents failing to achieve 50% reduction in HAM-D scale scores after six days, compared with five of eight adolescents treated with saline (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 2.4, df = 1, P value = 0.12). This method of administration warrants further investigation in a larger sample, and may have special applicability to severely affected adolescents for whom rapid reduction in depressive symptoms is sought.</P>
<P>There are several plausible neuropharmacological explanations why tricyclic drugs are not efficacious for children or adolescent depression (<LINK REF="REF-Ryan-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ryan 1992</LINK>). In children, there is incomplete maturation of the neurotransmitter systems involved in the control of affect. The noradrenergic system does not fully develop until early adulthood, while the more rapid hepatic metabolism of tricyclic compounds in children shifts the ratio of noradrenergic to serotonergic activity in the direction of noradrenergic activity. In addition, adolescents have high ketosteroid levels, which also affect noradrenergic transmitter systems. In theory at least, selective serotonergic compounds may be expected to have greater efficacy than noradrenergic compounds in juveniles. This is supported by the preliminary evidence for efficacy of intravenously administered clomipramine (<LINK REF="STD-Sallee-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sallee 1997</LINK>), which is highly serotonergic compared with other tricyclic compounds, and the positive treatment effect reported in one of two published trials of the SSRI, fluoxetine (<LINK REF="REF-Emslie-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emslie 1997</LINK>). The hormonal milieu of adolescent brains may also influence neurotransmitter activity, but the mechanism is unknown. There is also a possibility that childhood-onset depressive illness is aetiologically distinct from adult-onset depressive illness, and that adults who are depressed with a childhood onset of their disorder may also be relatively non-responsive to tricyclic drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Jensen-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jensen 1992</LINK>). The likelihood of a substantial level of psychiatric comorbidity among depressed children and adolescents may also confound their response to treatment.</P>
<P>The data from the present review do suggest an increasing responsiveness to tricyclic drugs with increasing age. The role of the onset of puberty in mediating the response to tricyclic drugs warrants further investigation.<BR/>

<P>These data suggest that tricyclic drugs are not useful for treating depression in prepubertal children. There may be a place for the use of tricyclic drugs in adolescent depression, although the treatment effects are likely to be modest. While it is tempting to argue that tricyclic drugs should be considered second-line treatment for depression in adolescents after other pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy has failed, the one trial that used tricyclic drugs in this context demonstrated no evidence of treatment benefit (<LINK REF="STD-Birmaher-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Birmaher 1998</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-06-11 11:20:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We consider further replication studies using 'traditional' tricyclic drugs with mixed noradrenergic and serotonergic activity to be unwarranted. Pharmacological research with newer-generation antidepressants has yielded more favourable results, but the effects are modest and of uncertain clinical significance (<LINK REF="REF-Hetrick-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hetrick 2012</LINK>). Treatment research should examine other widely adopted strategies such as family therapy, supportive psychotherapy and specific psychotherapies. The benefits of hospitalisation over day hospitalisation or outpatient treatment should also be considered.</P>
