<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) leads to progressive destruction and weakening of the body's immune system. Patients with advanced HIV disease are vulnerable to various diseases, called opportunistic infections (OIs), which most people with normal immune systems are protected against. One of these OIs, a fungal disease called cryptococcosis, causes meningitis (an inflammation of the membrane surrounding the brain) and pneumonia and is lethal when untreated. This study looked at two medications, itraconazole and fluconazole, which could be taken by patients with advanced HIV disease, to prevent this fungal infection from ever occurring. This study found that both were effective drugs for preventing cryptococcal disease. However, these drugs were not found to be effective in decreasing the overall death rates from HIV. More studies of these medications are needed to further evaluate their cost-effectiveness and benefits in decreasing death rates in groups of patients with HIV.</P>

<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Cryptococcal disease is an opportunistic infection that causes significant morbidity and mortality in adults with HIV. Primary prophylaxis with antifungal interventions may decrease cryptococcal disease incidence and associated mortality.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the efficacy of antifungal interventions for the primary prevention of cryptococcal disease in adults with HIV.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), ClinicalTrials.gov, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE), Latin American and Caribbean Literature on the Health Sciences (LILACS), and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR). We reviewed abstracts from the following relevant conferences: International AIDS Conference, International AIDS Society Conference on HIV Pathogenesis and Treatment, and Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections. We searched reference lists for all primary and other pertinent articles identified. We attempted to contact experts in the field, particularly primary authors of included studies, to better ensure completeness of included studies. We also approached pharmaceutical companies for any available and relevant unpublished data. The time period searched was from 1980 to August 2004. We placed no language restrictions on the search.</P>
<P>Key words used include: meningitis, cryptococcal, cryptococcus, cryptococcosis, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, human immunodeficiency virus, prophylaxis, chemoprevention, antifungal agents, and the Cochrane screen for randomized controlled trials.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomized controlled trials using antifungal interventions for the primary prevention of cryptococcal disease in adults with HIV were selected.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers independently assessed trial eligibility and quality. Trial authors, experts, and pharmaceutical companies were contacted for additional and/or missing information. Data were abstracted by two reviewers. Data were pooled, where appropriate, to yield summary estimates.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Five studies (N=1316) were identified. All study patients had CD4 cell counts &lt;300 cells/µl, and the majority of patients had CD4 cell counts &lt;150 cells/µl. When all five studies are analyzed as a single group (N=1316), the incidence of cryptococcal disease was decreased in those taking primary prophylaxis (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.09, 0.46) compared to those taking placebo. However, there was no significant difference in overall mortality observed (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.71, 1.44). When the three studies using itraconazole as the intervention were analyzed together (N=798), the incidence of cryptococcal disease was decreased in those taking itraconazole for primary prophylaxis (RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.03, 0.51) compared to those taking placebo; however, there was no significant difference in overall mortality (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.70, 1.80). When the two studies using fluconazole as the intervention were analyzed together (N=518), the incidence of cryptococcal disease was decreased in those taking fluconazole for primary prophylaxis (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.07, 0.87) compared to those taking placebo; however, there was no significant difference in overall mortality (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.14, 2.62).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Antifungal primary prophylaxis with either itraconazole or fluconazole is effective in reducing the incidence of cryptococcal disease in adults with advanced HIV disease. However, neither of these interventions has a clear effect on overall mortality. Further research is needed to better understand these interventions and the populations in which they may be most effective.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Cryptococcal disease is an opportunistic infection causing significant morbidity and mortality in adults with HIV. The prevalence of HIV-associated cryptococcal disease varies widely both within and between countries from approximately 2%-5% in the developed world to as high as 38% in certain developing world populations (<LINK REF="REF-Hajjeh-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hajjeh 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tansuphasawadik-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tansuphasawadik 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chariyalertsak-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chariyalertsak 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-French-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">French 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dromer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dromer 2004</LINK>). In the developed world, the incidence of cryptococcal disease appears to have generally decreased during the era of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) and possibly with the general increased use of antifungal medications (<LINK REF="REF-Hajjeh-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hajjeh 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Louie-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Louie 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dromer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dromer 2004</LINK>). In the developing world, while incidence appears to be significantly higher, exact incidence and prevalence rates are not widely available secondary to limitations in surveillance capabilities (<LINK REF="REF-French-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">French 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<I>Cryptococcus neoformans</I>, an encapsulated yeast, is the causative organism in cryptococcosis. The disease spectrum includes pneumonia, cutaneous lesions, or, most commonly and morbidly, meningitis. Extrapulmonary cryptococcosis is considered an AIDS defining disease. Cryptococcal meningitis is the most common meningitis in adults with HIV and is usually fatal without antifungal treatment. Effective regimens for the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis are available. However, optimal regimens are costly, lengthy, and lifelong chronic suppressive therapy is typically recommended for patients successfully treated and not on ART (<LINK REF="REF-Aberg-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aberg 2002</LINK>). A Cochrane review of these treatment regimens is under development.</P>
<P>Currently, there are a considerable number of unanswered questions that could help in determining whether primary prophylaxis for the prevention of cryptococcal disease is a cost-effective intervention, particularly in the developing world. Examples include uncertainties concerning prophylaxis efficacy, the unclear incidence of cryptococcal disease in many parts of the world, the instability of costs for both prophylactic and treatment regimens, the ramifications, if any, of antifungal resistant organisms selected for by prophylactic antifungal use, and the unclear relationship between ART use and concomitant antifungal prophylaxis. Additionally, allocation of resources may be more effectively directed toward ART, which has profound effects on decreasing opportunistic disease incidence, rather than on prophylactic regimens. This review, however, will limit itself to primarily addressing the issue of the efficacy of antifungal interventions for primary cryptococcal disease prophylaxis.</P>

<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>See: Cochrane HIV/AIDS Group search strategy (http://www.igh.org/Cochrane).</P>
<P>The following databases were searched: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), ClinicalTrials.gov, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE), Latin American and Caribbean Literature on the Health Sciences (LILACS), and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR). Abstracts were reviewed from the following relevant conferences: International AIDS Conference, International AIDS Society Conference on HIV Pathogenesis and Treatment, and Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections. Reference lists for all primary and other pertinent articles identified were searched. Attempts were made to contact experts in the field, particularly primary authors of included studies, to better ensure completeness of included studies. Pharmaceutical companies were also approached for any available and relevant unpublished data. The time period searched was from 1980 to August 2004. No language restrictions were placed on the search.</P>
<P>Key words used include: meningitis, cryptococcal, cryptococcus, cryptococcosis, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, human immunodeficiency virus, prophylaxis, chemoprevention, antifungal agents, and the terms used in the Cochrane screen for randomized controlled trials.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>ELIGIBILITY<BR/>Using the above search strategy, two reviewers independently reviewed all identified titles. If the title was felt to be relevant by either reviewer, the corresponding abstract was then reviewed by both authors. If either reviewer felt the abstract was potentially relevant, the full text of the article was then reviewed.</P>
<P>DATA COLLECTION<BR/>Study characteristics were independently abstracted by two unblinded reviewers using a standarized abstraction form. Abstracted data included the following: study design, methodological quality, participant characteristics (age, gender, ethnicity, immunologic markers, antiretroviral history and/or concomitant use), trial setting, interventions, inclusion and exclusion criteria of patients, duration of follow-up, withdrawals and losses, adverse events (AEs), significant adverse events (SAEs), and clinical outcomes. Disagreements between the two reviewers were adjudicated by a third reviewer. All relevant data were entered into Cochrane's Review Manager (Version 4.2).</P>
<P>QUALITY ASSESSMENT<BR/>Different aspects of study methodology quality were assessed including whether the study was adequately randomised (appropriate generation of allocation sequence and adequacy of allocation concealment), were subjects and providers blinded, was intention-to-treat analysis used, and completeness of follow-up.<BR/> <BR/>Quality of concealment of treatment allocation was graded according to the standard Cochrane critieria (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2003</LINK>): adequate (A), unclear (B), inadequate (C), or that allocation was not used (D). Examples of adequate concealment schemes include allocation using centralised or pharmacy-controlled randomisation, pre-numbered or coded identical containers which are administered serially, and sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes. Inadequate approaches include alternation, the use of case record numbers, dates of birth or day of the week, and an open list of random numbers.</P>
<P>Trials were also graded using the Jadad scale, a clinical trial quality instrument scored from 0 to 6 with highers score correlating with better quality studies (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>). Trials were excluded from final analysis if their score on the Jadad scale was 2 or less, a previously validated cut-off point.</P>
<P>ANALYSIS<BR/>A meta-analysis was performed to generate summary point estimates and corresponding confidence intervals for the relevant outcomes. Heterogeneity of results were analyzed with Chi-square tests. If any comparisons demonstrated significant heterogeneity then a random effects model was considered the primary model for summary estimates and fixed effects model results were secondarily reported as appropriate. Risk ratios were a priori chosen to be the primary summary statistic givens their relative ease of clinical comprehension and mathematical consistency (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 2001</LINK>); summary risk differences are also secondarily reported. Funnel plots were constructed to examine for possible publication bias. Number needed to treat were calculated based on summary risk ratios based on random effects models using an event rate calculated from the controls of included trials. Analyses were performed with Cochrane's Review Manager (Version 4.2).</P>
<P>SUBGROUP ANALYSIS<BR/>Subgroup analyses were attempted for type of antifungal intervention (fluconazole versus itraconazole), different CD4 strata at the time prophylaxis was commenced, trial setting (developed versus developing world), and concomitant or history of antiretroviral use.</P>
<P>SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS<BR/>Sensitivity analysis were performed by systematically including and excluding all combinations of studies to ensure robustness of results.</P>

</METHODS>
<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>Five randomized controlled trials were found and included in this study. A number of non-randomized controlled trials were also found and excluded from analyses. Three of the included studies used itraconazole as the antifungal intervention, and two studies used fluconazole. Two of the included studies took place in the United States, two in Thailand, and one was multinational with most of its study patients enrolled in the developed world.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Powderly-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Powderly 1995</LINK> reported on 428 US patients in the multicenter ACTG 981 study, an open label, randomized controlled trial, which was conducted from September 1989 to June 1993. This study compared fluconazole (200mg daily) to clotrimazole troches (10mg five times daily). Clotrimazole troches were selected as the comparison group instead of placebo because study investigators desired an effective local therapy for oropharyngeal candidasis. Patients were eligible if they had CD4 counts &lt;200 cells/µl. The median CD4 count in the intervention group was 90 cells/µl (mean, 122 cells/µl); the median CD4 count in the control group was 114 cells/µl (mean, 141 cells/µl). All patients received zidovudine monotherapy as part of another related trial (ACTG 081). Patients were followed at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and then every month thereafter. Median follow-up was 1050 days. The primary study endpoint was any invasive fungal infection; a secondary endpoint was death. </P>

<LINK REF="STD-Smith-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2001</LINK> reported on 374 patients in a multicountry, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted from January 1994 to October 1997. The intervention was itraconazole (200mg daily). Patients were eligible if they had two average CD4 counts &lt;300 cells/µl within the past 4 months. The mean CD4 count was 200 cells/µl in both groups. Any history of antiretroviral use was reported in at least 79% of patients. Patients were followed every 2 months with a maximum of 102 weeks of follow-up.

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>See: Table of comparisons</P>
<P>Tests of heterogeneity, including analyses of subgroups, found significant heterogeneity for the meta-analyses of the relative risk of overall mortality of fluconazole-based interventions (p=0.04), the risk difference of cryptococcal incidence of all interventions (p=0.00003), the risk difference of cryptococcal incidence of itraconazole-based interventions (p=0.001), the risk difference of overall mortality for all interventions (p=0.04), and the risk difference of overall mortality of fluconazole-based interventions (p=0.02). Summary estimates from both random and fixed effects models are reported as follows. <BR/> <BR/>Random Effects Model<BR/>When all five studies are analyzed as a single group (N=1316), the incidence of cryptococcal disease was decreased in those taking primary prophylaxis (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.09, 0.46; RD -0.05, 95% CI -0.10, -0.01) compared to those taking placebo. However, there was no significant difference in overall mortality observed (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.71, 1.44; RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.07, 0.06).</P>

<P>Adverse Events<BR/>Adverse Events (AEs) were specifically reported by four of the studies. <LINK REF="STD-Chetchotisakd-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chetchotisakd 2004</LINK> did not mention specific AEs. <LINK REF="STD-Powderly-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Powderly 1995</LINK> gave AE rates rather than specific numbers of AEs. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were not explicitly reported separate from AEs by any of the studies though can be presumed based on descriptions of types of adverse events (e.g. Stevens-Johnson syndrome=SAE) for some of the studies. <LINK REF="STD-Chetchotisakd-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chetchotisakd 2004</LINK> specifically mentioned that there were no serious adverse events noted. Overall, the numbers of presumed SAEs were too small to perform any meaningful statistical analyses. Discontinuation of treatment (intervention or placebo) secondary to AEs was specifically reported by all but <LINK REF="STD-Chetchotisakd-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chetchotisakd 2004</LINK>. </P>
<P>Meta-analyses of AEs of itraconazole-based interventions showed significant statistical heterogeneity (RR, p=&lt;0.0001; RD, p=0.010), and a random effects model did not find any significant association between itraconazole use and AEs (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.71, 2.07; RD 0.06 95% CI -0.06, 0.18) compared to placebo. Meta-analyses of discontinuation of treament secondary to AEs in the itraconazole-based studies found a trend toward heterogeneity (RR, p=0.08; RD, p=0.14), and a random effects model also did not find any significant associations between itraconazole-based interventions and discontinuation compared to placebo (RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.59, 3.70; RD 0.02, 95% CI -0.03, 0.08). </P>
<P>Subgroup Analyses<BR/>Subgroup analyses by intervention are reported above. When trials were subgrouped by trial setting (<LINK REF="STD-Powderly-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Powderly 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-McKinsey-1999" TYPE="STUDY">McKinsey 1999</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2001</LINK>, primarily developed world setting, versus <LINK REF="STD-Chariyalertsak-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chariyalertsak 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Chetchotisakd-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chetchotisakd 2004</LINK>, primarily developing world setting), there were no significant findings concerning the outcome of mortality. However, when examining cryptococcal incidence, the developed world studies retained statistical significance (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.04, 0.41) while the developing world or Thai-based studies were not significant (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.05, 1.52). There were insufficient data to perform detailed subgroup analyses by CD4 count strata or any history of antiretroviral use. However, the two Thai studies had a low percentage of any ART use (&lt;8%) among its participants compared to the developed world studies (65%-100%) and this subgroup comparison of low ARV use studies versus high ARV use studies would be the same as the developing world versus developed world setting subgroup analyses.</P>
<P>Funnel plots were constructed to examine for biases, but were inconclusive due to the small number of included studies. Sensitivity analyses did not reveal any significant changes in the overall statistical significance of relative risk effect measures for cryptococcal incidence and mortality and associated measures of heterogeneity with exclusion of any of the trials, either individually or in combination.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Antifungal primary prophylaxis is effective in reducing the incidence of cryptococcal disease in adults with advanced HIV disease. Both itraconazole and fluconazole, antifungal drugs in the triazole class, reduce cryptococcal incidence; however, neither of these interventions has a clear effect on overall mortality. <BR/> <BR/>Statistical heterogeneity was found during some of the meta-analyses performed in this study. This heterogeneity was seen primarily with summary estimates involving risk difference which suggest, as determined a priori, that risk ratios are the preferred summary estimate for this meta-analysis due in part to their better mathematical consistency (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 2001</LINK>). Regardless, possible explanations for trial heterogeneity include the higher incidence of cryptococcal disease in the studies involving Thai patients compared to the studies based primarily in the United States, as well as the poorer immunologic status of the Thai patients at baseline. These patient characteristics would usually result in a greater measured reduction in cryptococcal incidence and mortality from an effective prophylactic intervention compared to patients with lower disease incidence and better immunologic status. This effect is seen most noticeably in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Chetchotisakd-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chetchotisakd 2004</LINK> which was the only study to note a statistically significant reduction in mortality from an antifungal intervention. Notably, all of the studies found lower CD4 counts to be a risk factor for incident cryptococcal disease, and the greatest benefit of prophylaxis was typically seen in patients with CD4 counts &lt;100 cells/µl. It has also been suggested that the lack of antifungal treatment for cryptococcal meningitis in resource-poor settings, such as Thailand, may increase the attributable mortality to this condition, a further source for trial heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-John-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">John 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The use of fluconazole versus itraconazole is another significant source of trial heterogeneity. For fluconazole specifically, the differing dose and frequency used in the two fluconazole trials introduces a further element of differences between trials. It is not clear from current data which antifungal is superior for the primary prophylaxis of cryptococcal infection or what the optimal dose and frequency of interventions should be. Patient population characteristics may be an important consideration in choosing between these interventions as itraconazole is effective against other region specific endemic fungal infections such as histoplasmosis and pencillinosis while fluconazole is not. Resource concerns may affect choice in fluconazole regimen dose and frequency of administration as well as the choice between either fluconazole or itraconazole as costs differ from region to region (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2004</LINK>). Additionally, the current limited data demonstrates that AEs, SAEs, and discontinuation from these events were not statistically different between itraconazole and fluconazole, or even different between either drug and placebo. The trend, however, appears to be toward both drugs being associated with more AEs and discontinuation due to AEs and SAEs. Further studies with detailed AEs, SAEs, discontinuation rates, and reasons for discontinuation are needed to better understand this issue. Finally, further complicating the choice of either of these interventions may be potential drug-drug interactions, particularly as the number of patients taking concomitant ART increases.</P>
<P>Trials also differed in terms of antiretroviral use and experience in their patient populations which may have effected the efficacy of antifungal interventions. As <LINK REF="STD-McKinsey-1999" TYPE="STUDY">McKinsey 1999</LINK> noted, even two drug antiretroviral therapy was associated with decreased likelihood of failing itraconazole prophylaxis. The lower rates of any ARV use in the Thai studies may have then contributed to increasing the relative efficacy of antifungal prophylaxis. Differences in trial design may also explain some of the heterogeneity between the trials; specifically, the study by <LINK REF="STD-Powderly-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Powderly 1995</LINK> was the only unblinded study of the five, and different lengths of follow-up time in each trial may have introduced heterogeneity. Finally, varying rates of adherence were noted to study drugs, in particular the study by <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2001</LINK>. This study had a very high rate of discontinuation, around eighty percent, when compared to the other itraconazole-based intervention studies, which may have been clinically significant as the author noted that many of the cases of incident disease occurred after patients stopped the prophylactic drug.</P>
<P>Heterogeneity was also found in the analyses of AEs for itraconazole-based interventions and summary estimates should be interpreted cautiously. These findings may reflect differing study criteria for AEs, the different levels of AEs monitoring used in each study, and subject and setting heterogeneity. Differing lengths of follow-up between the studies may have also affected the results as most studies reported AEs as a percent of trial participants rather than as a rate, making direct comparisons unreliable. For instance, the study which had the most apparent follow-up visits, <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2001</LINK>, also reported the highest percentage of adverse events. </P>
<P>In subgroup analyses the lack of significance when evaluating cryptococcal incidence in the Thai studies is likely due to the small study sizes being insufficienctly powered to detect a statistically significant difference, but the trend was clearly toward reduced cryptococcocal disease incidence with antifungal prophylaxis. Finally, the numbers needed to treat results should be interpreted cautiously as the event rate was calculated from the control group of included studies and may not be fully generalizable to different populations (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 2001</LINK>). </P>
<P>The goal of primary prophylaxis of opportunistic infections is to provide an intervention, typically pharmacologic, to patients who do not yet have the disease in an attempt to prevent the acquisition of the particular illness. Multiple issues must be addressed when considering whether primary prophylaxis should be recommended. These issues include prophylaxis efficacy, cost of prophylaxis treatment, cost of treating acute and chronic disease, disease incidence, morbidity and mortality both with and without treatment, possible risk of increasing numbers of resistant organisms to the prophylactic drug class, access, and patient quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Scharfstein-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scharfstein 1997</LINK>). Certain primary prophylaxis regimens are already well established in the care of adults with HIV, such as the use of cotrimaxazole for the prevention of <I>Pneumocystis jiroveci </I>(formerly <I>carinii</I>) pneumonia (PCP) and toxoplasmosis (<LINK REF="REF-Grimwade-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grimwade 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Benson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benson 2004</LINK>). </P>
<P>A fundamental issue is the role of primary prophylaxis in the setting of ART. Though the efficacy of ART as primary prophylaxis for cryptococcal disease has never been directly examined in a randomized controlled trial, existing evidence clearly demonstrate that ART is the most efficacious prophylactic therapy for all opportunistic infections, including cryptococcal disease (<LINK REF="REF-Palella-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palella 1998</LINK>). However, despite the remarkable benefits of ART, primary prophylaxis for diseases such as cytomegalovirus, PCP, and toxoplasmosis, have been shown to offer additional survival benefits when used in conjunction with ART in the developed world (<LINK REF="REF-McNaghten-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">McNaghten 1999</LINK>). Patients starting ART are still at risk for opportunistic infections, particularly those patients who begin treatment with severely depressed CD4 counts, and prophylaxis regimens may prevent many of these infections (<LINK REF="REF-Michelet-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michelet 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chene-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chene 1998</LINK>). Cryptococcal primary prophylaxis, added to other established primary prophylaxis regimens and given concomitantly with ART, could be the most cost-effective initial strategy in the treatment of patients with advanced HIV by allowing patients the best chance for clinically significant immune reconstitution to occur. Timing of discontinuation of cryptococcal primary prophylaxis in the immune reconstituted patient has not been studied, but reports on the safe discontinuation of secondary cryptococcal disease prophylaxis and discontinuation of primary prophylaxis for other opportunistic infections may help guide clinical decisions and research regarding this issue (<LINK REF="REF-Benson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benson 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Intervention cost is clearly a critical component in assessing the cost-effectiveness of a prophylactic agent. There have been a small number of studies of the cost-effectiveness of primary fluconazole prophylaxis (<LINK REF="REF-Scharfstein-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scharfstein 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yazdanpanah-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yazdanpanah 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tuli-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tuli 2003</LINK>); however, there are no published cost-effective analyses of primary itraconazole prophylaxis. The two cost-effectiveness analyses of fluconazole in a developed world setting reported fluconazole to be not cost-effective, while the study perfomed in a developing world setting where fluconazole is less costly found fluconazole to be cost savings. The price of fluconazole and itraconazole varies significantly from country to country (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2004</LINK>). With the recent expiration of fluconazole's US patent and the relatively inexpensive availability of generic fluconazole in countries such as Thailand and the increasing availability of ART in the developing world, previous cost-effective analyses of fluconazole may need reassessment and initial studies on the cost-effectiveness of itraconazole should be encouraged both in the developed and developing world. </P>
<P>The incidence of disease and its morbidity and mortality with and without treatment needs to be taken into consideration as well in decisions to institute primary antifungal prophylaxis. As disease incidence rises, a primary intervention becomes more cost-effective. Studies of the cost-effectiveness of fluconazole demonstrate cost savings in areas of high cryptococcal prevalence such as Thailand and lack of cost savings in the developed world where the prevalence is typically low (<LINK REF="REF-Scharfstein-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scharfstein 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yazdanpanah-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yazdanpanah 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tuli-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tuli 2003</LINK>). Current developed world guidelines reflect these findings and do not recommend the routine use of fluconazole or itraconazole for primary prophylaxis (<LINK REF="REF-Kaplan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaplan 2002</LINK>). While the incidence of cryptococcal disease in the developed world has been fairly well studied, there have been only a few, mostly small cohort studies of incidence in the developing world (<LINK REF="REF-Tansuphasawadik-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tansuphasawadik 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chariyalertsak-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chariyalertsak 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-French-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">French 2002</LINK>). Though incidence appears to be significantly higher in the developing world, better data is needed for more accurate cost-effectiveness estimates. </P>
<P>A concern raised about routine antifungal prophylaxis is the potential for selecting antifungal resistant organisms with increased antifungal use. Antifungal resistance was not directly studied in any of these trials, but there have been a small number of published reports of triazole-resistant fungi, presumably arising in settings of increased triazole use (<LINK REF="REF-Berg-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berg 1998</LINK>). However, the clinical significance of this entity is not clearly elucidated, and there is limited data on the effect routine cryptococcal prophylaxis would have on increasing resistance. This important issue invites further study.</P>
<P>Finally, efficacy of the intervention, as addressed in this review, must be taken into account. This study clearly demonstrates efficacy from two antifungal agents. However, many research questions remain unanswered. It is not clear if there is a superior antifungal intervention; current data shows both fluconazole and itraconazole to be equally effective. There is also insufficient data on the optimum dose and frequency of administration of either intervention, though the findings from one study using relatively infrequent dosing of fluconazole (once a week) is the most convenient prophylactic regimen reviewed here (<LINK REF="STD-Chetchotisakd-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chetchotisakd 2004</LINK>). The optimal timing of prophylaxis initiation, whether based on clinical and/or CD4 cell count criteria, is also not clearly known though most of the benefits from prophylaxis appear to be in patients with CD4 counts &lt;100 cells/µl. Finally, only one of the reviewed studies reported a mortality benefit (<LINK REF="STD-Chetchotisakd-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chetchotisakd 2004</LINK>), which was seen when comparing mortality rates per 10,000 person-days. This study occurred in an area of relatively high cryptococcal prevalence among very immunosuppressed patients (all CD4 counts &lt;100 cells/µl), and, as has been noted previously, the reason no mortality benefit was seen in studies performed in the developed world is likely due to the relatively low incidence of cryptococcal disease in these settings (<LINK REF="REF-John-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">John 2004</LINK>). Further studies investigating mortality benefits of primary prophylaxis regimens in areas of high disease prevalence are ongoing (<LINK REF="STD-Lalloo-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lalloo 2004</LINK>) and needed.</P>
<P>In summary, the issues surrounding primary prophylaxis of cryptococcal disease in patients with advanced HIV are complex and not fully elucidated. This study demonstrated antifungal efficacy in preventing incident cryptococcal diease but no effect on overall mortality. Further research, with particular emphasis on the developing world where the major burden of this disease lies, should be anticipated and encouraged on this important topic.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Both itraconazole and fluconazole are effective interventions for the primary prophylaxis of cryptococcal disease in persons with advanced HIV. However, these interventions do not clearly affect overall mortality.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further studies should continue to address issues of cost-effectiveness of both fluconazole and itraconazole as primary prophylaxis for cryptococcal disease. More studies are needed on cryptococcal incidence in diverse settings, particulary in the developing world. The role of primary cryptococcal prophylaxis use in conjunction with antiretroviral therapy needs further investigation. Further study of the potential mortality benefits of cryptococcal disease prophylaxis in areas of high cryptococcosis incidence are ongoing and needed.</P>
