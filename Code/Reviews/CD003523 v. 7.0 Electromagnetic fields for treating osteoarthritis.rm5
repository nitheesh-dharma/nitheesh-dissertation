<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We conducted a review of the effect of electromagnetic fields on osteoarthritis. We found nine studies with 636 people.</P>
<P>
<B>Background: what is osteoarthritis and what are electromagnetic fields?</B>
</P>
<P>Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis that can affect the hands, hips, shoulders and knees. In osteoarthritis, the cartilage that protects the ends of the bones breaks down and causes pain and swelling.</P>
<P>An electromagnetic field is the invisible force that attracts things to magnets. This invisible attraction can be created using an electrical current that may affect the cartilage around the joints. In osteoarthritis, electromagnetic fields are a kind of therapy using electrical currents applied to the skin around the joints. Small machines or mats can be used to deliver electromagnetic fields to the whole body or to certain joints. A doctor or physiotherapist can perform the therapy and some machines can be used at home.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>After searching for all relevant studies up to October 2013, we found nine studies that reviewed the effect of electromagnetic field treatment compared to a sham or fake treatment in 636 adults with osteoarthritis for a duration of 4 to 26 weeks.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Pain (on a 0 to 100 scale; higher scores mean worse or more severe pain) </B>
</P>
<P>- Electromagnetic fields probably relieve pain in osteoarthritis.</P>
<P>- People who received electromagnetic field treatment experienced pain relief of 15 points more compared with people who received fake treatment (15% improvement).</P>
<P>- People who received electromagnetic field treatment rated their pain to be 26 points lower on a scale of 0 to 100.</P>
<P>- People who received fake treatment rated their pain to be 11 points lower on a scale of 0 to 100.</P>
<P>
<B>Physical function</B>
</P>
<P>- Electromagnetic fields may improve physical function but this may have happened by chance.</P>
<P>
<B>Overall health and well-being</B>
</P>
<P>- Electromagnetic fields probably make no difference to overall health and well-being.</P>
<P>
<B>Side effects</B>
</P>
<P>- Electromagnetic fields probably make no difference to whether people have side effects or stop taking the treatment because of side effects, but this may have happened by chance.</P>
<P>We do not have precise information about side effects and complications. This is particularly true for rare but serious side effects. Possible side effects could include skin rash and aggravated pain.</P>
<P>
<B>X-ray changes</B>
</P>
<P>There was no information available on whether electromagnetic fields show any improvement to a joint with osteoarthritis on an X-ray.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>- Electromagnetic fields probably improve pain and make no difference to overall health and well-being and side effects. This may change with further research.</P>
<P>- Electromagnetic fields may improve physical function. This is very likely to change with further research.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-11-28 10:19:39 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2002. Osteoarthritis is a disease that affects the synovial joints, causing degeneration and destruction of hyaline cartilage and subchondral bone. Electromagnetic field therapy is currently used by physiotherapists and may promote growth and repair of bone and cartilage. It is based on principles of physics which include Wolff's law, the piezoelectric effect and the concept of streaming potentials.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2013-11-11 15:58:56 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess the benefits and harms of electromagnetic fields for the treatment of osteoarthritis as compared to placebo or sham.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-11-28 10:20:03 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2013, Issue 9), PreMEDLINE for trials published before 1966, MEDLINE from 1966 to October 2013, CINAHL and PEDro up to and including October 2013. Electronic searches were complemented by handsearches.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-11-28 10:20:18 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised controlled trials of electromagnetic fields in osteoarthritis, with four or more weeks treatment duration. We included papers in any language.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-11-28 10:21:18 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion in the review and resolved differences by consensus with a third review author. We extracted data using pre-developed data extraction forms. The same review authors assessed the risk of bias of the trials independently using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We extracted outcomes for osteoarthritis from the publications according to Outcome Measures in Rheumatology Clinical Trials (OMERACT) guidelines. We expressed results for continuous outcome measures as mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI). We pooled dichotomous outcome measures using risk ratio (RR) and calculated the number needed to treat (NNT).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-11-28 10:24:05 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nine studies with a total of 636 participants with osteoarthritis were included, six of which were added in this update of the review. Selective outcome reporting was unclear in all nine included studies due to inadequate reporting of study design and conduct, and there was high risk of bias for incomplete outcome data in three studies. The overall risk of bias across the nine studies was low for the other domains.</P>
<P>Participants who were randomised to electromagnetic field treatment rated their pain relief 15.10 points more on a scale of 0 to 100 (MD 15.10, 95% CI 9.08 to 21.13; absolute improvement 15%) after 4 to 26 weeks' treatment compared with placebo. Electromagnetic field treatment had no statistically significant effect on physical function (MD 4.55, 95% CI -2.23 to 11.32; absolute improvement 4.55%) based on the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities osteoarthritis index (WOMAC) scale from 0 to 100 after 12 to 26 weeks' treatment. We also found no statistically significant difference in quality of life on a scale from 0 to 100 (SMD 0.09, 95% CI -0.36 to 0.54; absolute improvement 0.09%) after four to six weeks' treatment, based on the SF-36. No data were available for analysis of radiographic changes. Safety was evaluated in four trials including up to 288 participants: there was no difference in the experience of any adverse event after 4 to 12 weeks of treatment compared with placebo (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.92). There was no difference in participants who withdrew because of adverse events (measured in one trial) after four weeks of treatment (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.06 to 13.92). No participants experienced any serious adverse events.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-11-28 10:24:47 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Current evidence suggests that electromagnetic field treatment may provide moderate benefit for osteoarthritis sufferers in terms of pain relief. Further studies are required to confirm whether this treatment confers clinically important benefits in terms of physical function and quality of life. Our conclusions are unchanged from the previous review conducted in 2002.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-11-28 11:49:58 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Elizabeth Tanjong Ghogomu">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-11-28 11:41:36 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Osteoarthritis is a progressive rheumatic disease which occurs most commonly in older populations. It is becoming increasingly common due to the ageing population in many societies. The degeneration and eventual loss of articular cartilage causes changes in periarticular bone, synovial tissue and other periarticular soft tissue structures such as ligaments and muscles. This causes the pain, swelling, tenderness and stiffness that characterise osteoarthritis, especially in the weight-bearing joints of the lower extremities.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-11-28 11:47:39 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Current osteoarthritis treatment options include pharmacological and non-pharmacological procedures to decrease progression and treat the pain associated with this condition. They include:</P>
<OL>
<LI>oral pharmacological medications: analgesics such as acetaminophen, aspirin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); symptomatic slow-acting drugs for osteoarthritis (SYSADOA) such as glucosamine sulphate (<LINK REF="REF-Towheed-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Towheed 2005</LINK>), diacerein (<LINK REF="REF-Fidelix-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fidelix 2006</LINK>) and the non-saponifiable oils of avocado and soya; and the newer disease-modifying osteoarthritis drugs (DMOAD);</LI>
<LI>topical therapies (applied as gels or creams), including NSAIDs and capsaicin;</LI>
<LI>intra-articular therapies, including corticosteroid and hyaluronic acid injections (<LINK REF="REF-Bellamy-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bellamy 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bellamy-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bellamy 2006b</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>non-pharmacological therapies, including aquatic exercise therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Bartels-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bartels 2007</LINK>), balneotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Verhagen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verhagen 2007</LINK>), physical therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Rutjes-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutjes 2010</LINK>), occupational therapy, strengthening exercises (<LINK REF="REF-Fransen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fransen 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fransen-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fransen 2009</LINK>), wedged insoles and braces and orthoses (<LINK REF="REF-Brouwer-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brouwer 2005</LINK>); and</LI>
<LI>surgical treatment: joint replacement (<LINK REF="REF-Singh-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 2013a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Singh-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 2013b</LINK>) and arthroscopic debridement (<LINK REF="REF-Laupattarakasem-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laupattarakasem 2008</LINK>) of the affected joint.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Management of osteoarthritis of the knee aims to relieve pain, maintain or improve mobility, and minimise disability. However, these goals are seldom achieved through drug therapy alone, as many treatments are ineffective or lead to serious adverse effects, including the potentially lethal complications encountered with selective NSAIDS (<LINK REF="REF-Blower-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blower 1996</LINK>). Different modalities in physiotherapy have been shown to help improve clinical symptoms and function in knee osteoarthritis, generally with fewer adverse effects than medical treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Brosseau-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brosseau 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rutjes-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutjes 2010</LINK>). Electromagnetic fields are among these non-invasive therapies, already considered a proven adjunct therapy for delayed union fractures (<LINK REF="REF-Bassett-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bassett 1974</LINK>). Interest in electromagnetic field stimulation began after observing that physical stress on bone causes the appearance of tiny electric currents called piezoelectric potentials that are thought to act as the transduction signals to promote bone formation. In vitro studies showed that chondrocyte proliferation and matrix synthesis are significantly enhanced by pulsed electromagnetic field stimulation (<LINK REF="REF-De-Mattei-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Mattei 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-De-Mattei-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Mattei 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-De-Mattei-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Mattei 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fioravanti-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fioravanti 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pezzetti-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pezzetti 1999</LINK>). A number of multicentric randomised and double-blind clinical trials have been carried out with promising results (<LINK REF="REF-Fini-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fini 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Electromagnetic fields can be delivered to biological systems by the direct placement of an electrode or non-invasively by two means:</P>
<UL>
<LI>capacitive coupling, in which opposing electrodes are placed within a conducting medium, that is, in contact with the skin surface overlying a target tissue (e.g. bone, joint, wound);</LI>
<LI>inductive coupling, in which a time-varying pulsed electromagnetic field induces an electrical current in the target tissue. This technique does not require direct contact with the skin or biological system.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Although the former relies on direct application of an electrical field rather than creating induced current through magnetic impulses, they act by the same mechanism. Thus both pulsed electromagnetic fields and pulsed electrical stimulation are considered electromagnetic field interventions in this update.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-11-28 11:48:56 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three basic principles of physics are proposed to explain how electromagnetic fields may promote the growth and repair of bone and cartilage: Wolff's Law, the piezoelectric effect and the concept of streaming potentials (<LINK REF="REF-Shupak-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shupak 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Electromagnetic field stimulation first garnered interest as treatment for osteoarthritis following the discovery of evidence that stimulation of chondrocytes increased the synthesis of the major component of the cartilage matrix, known as proteoglycans (<LINK REF="REF-Aaron-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aaron 1993</LINK>). Experimental studies suggest that electromagnetic fields may interact with ligands on the chondrocyte cell surface membrane, potentially leading to changes in internal calcium concentrations which trigger proteoglycan synthesis (<LINK REF="REF-Graziana-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graziana 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lee-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Electromagnetic field treatments might also help to preserve extracellular matrix integrity in the early stages of osteoarthritis by down-regulating proteoglycan production and degradation (<LINK REF="REF-Ciombor-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ciombor 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Liu-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 1997</LINK>) and by increasing chondrocyte DNA replication and cell proliferation (<LINK REF="REF-Pezzetti-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pezzetti 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rodan-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodan 1978</LINK>).</P>
<P>Through these improvements in bone and cartilage maintenance and repair, pulsed electromagnetic field stimulation could influence the osteoarthritic disease process by decreasing inflammation and providing temporary relief from pain (<LINK REF="REF-Darendeliler-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Darendeliler 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lee-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Trock-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trock 2000</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-11-28 11:49:58 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Electromagnetic field therapy is already being widely used for the management of joint pain associated with osteoarthritis and has a promising theoretical basis for clinical application. Clinical trials evaluating its therapeutic effectiveness have been conducted recently, but with inconsistent results. A 2002 Cochrane review suggested that pulsed electromagnetic field therapy led to improvements in all measurements for knee osteoarthritis, but concluded that further studies were required to confirm whether the statistically significant results shown in these trials conferred important benefits to patients (<LINK REF="REF-Hulme-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hulme 2002</LINK>). The optimal frequency, duration and intensity of electromagnetic fields for osteoarthritis were also yet to be determined. This update of the 2002 review will include new clinical studies which have since been published.</P>

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2013-11-28 11:57:53 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors (SL, BY) extracted data using a standard, pre-developed form that we pilot-tested. We extracted details of trial design, patient characteristics, treatment duration and the mechanics of the electromagnetic field device used, and established baseline and end of study outcomes. We resolved differences in data extraction by referring back to the original article and by establishing consensus. A third review author (CH or JH) was consulted to help resolve differences. Where the method of randomisation or allocation concealment was not clearly described, or where data were missing, we contacted the authors of the study to clarify the issues.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2013-11-28 11:59:59 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The review authors assessed the risk of bias in the included studies using The Cochrane Collaboration 'Risk of bias' tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We considered six domains: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessors, selective outcome reporting and incomplete outcome reporting. We expressed the judgements simply as 'low risk', 'high risk' or 'unclear risk' of bias.</P>
<P>We assessed two components of randomisation: generation of allocation sequence and concealment of allocation. We considered the generation of sequence adequate if it resulted in an unpredictable allocation schedule; mechanisms considered adequate included random number tables, computer-generated random numbers, minimisation, coin tossing, shuffling cards and drawing lots. We considered trials using an unpredictable allocation sequence to be randomised. We considered trials using potentially predictable allocation mechanisms, such as alternation or the allocation of patients according to date of birth, to be quasi-randomised.</P>
<P>We considered concealment of allocation adequate if both the patients and the investigators responsible for patient selection were unable to predict allocation to treatment or placebo groups. Adequate concealment included central randomisation and sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes.</P>
<P>Since the primary measure of effectiveness was patient-reported pain relief, we considered blinding of patients adequate if experimental and control preparations were explicitly described as indistinguishable or if a double-dummy technique was used.</P>
<P>We considered analyses adequate if all randomised patients were included in the analysis according to the intention-to-treat principle. We further assessed the reporting of major outcomes.</P>

<P>For continuous data, we presented results as a mean difference (MD). However, where different scales were used to measure the same concept or outcome, we used standardised mean difference (SMD).

If considerable between-group statistical heterogeneity was detected (i.e. an I<SUP>2</SUP> value of more than 75%), we explored the causes of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).

<P>We presented key findings in a 'Summary of findings' table. These included the magnitude of effect of the interventions examined, the sum of available data on the main outcomes and the quality of the evidence.</P>
<P>For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the absolute risk difference using the risk difference (RD) statistic in RevMan (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2012</LINK>) (RR - 1 calculated the weighted relative per cent change). We calculated the number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) or to harm (NNTH) from the control group event rate (unless the population event rate was known) and the risk ratio using the Visual Rx NNT calculator (<LINK REF="REF-Cates-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>For continuous outcomes, we calculated the absolute benefit as the improvement in the treatment group (follow-up mean minus baseline mean) less the improvement in the control group (follow-up mean minus baseline mean). We calculated the relative difference in the change from baseline as the absolute benefit divided by the baseline mean of the control group. We calculated NNTB or NNTH using the Wells calculator software available at the CMSG editorial office. We determined the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for each outcome for input into the calculator.</P>
<P>We used GRADE to describe the quality of the overall body of evidence (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>), defined as the extent of confidence in the estimates of treatment benefits and harms.

<P>Six trials used pulsed electromagnetic fields (<LINK REF="STD-Nelson-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nicolakis-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Nicolakis 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pipitone-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pipitone 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thamsborg-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Thamsborg 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trock-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Trock 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trock-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Trock 1994</LINK>) while three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Fary-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Fary 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Garland-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Garland 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zizic-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Zizic 1995</LINK>) used pulsed electrical stimulation.</P>
<P>One study used a pulsed electromagnetic field signal consisting of a 7 ms burst of 6.8 MHz sinusoidal waves repeating at one burst/s and delivering a peak induced electrical field of 34 ± 8 V/m in the knee from a portable battery-operated device (Palermo, Ivivi Health Sciences, LLC, San Francisco, CA). Patients were treated for 15 minutes twice daily for 42 days (<LINK REF="STD-Nelson-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 2013</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
<P>Another study reviewed a pulsed electromagnetic field device (Medicur) that generates pulses of magnetic energy via a soft iron core treated with 62 trace elements. Pulses are selected at base frequencies of 3 Hz, 7.8 Hz and 20 Hz and have a rise time of 1 &#956;s, a low magnetic output (&lt; 0.5 gauss) and a range of activity of up to 30 cm around the unit. The Medicur device runs on batteries, requires no wires or electrodes, and only needs to be held close to the area to be treated. Patients were treated for 30 minutes per session three times a day for six weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Pipitone-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pipitone 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>In one study a pulsed electromagnetic field was administered to the whole body using a mat which produced a field from 1 Hz to 3000 Hz with a mean intensity of 40 &#956;T (wave ranger professional, program 12, Mediscan GmbH, Bad Haller Straße34, 4500 Kremsmünster, Austria). The frequency of the pulsed electromagnetic field ranged from 1 Hz to 3000 Hz. Patients lay on the mat for 30 minutes per session twice a day for six weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Nicolakis-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Nicolakis 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>A fourth study measured the effect of a pulse generator that yields G50V in 50 Hz pulses, changing voltage at 3 ms intervals. This results in a maximal electrical gradient of 1 to 100 mV/cm as sensed by charged particles in the tissue, depending on the distance from the coils. As a result of this current, the coils become slightly warmer than the surroundings after 30 minutes (28 to 35 °C). Treatment was given for two hours daily, five days per week for six weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Thamsborg-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Thamsborg 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two other trials used a non-contact device that delivered three signals in a stepwise fashion, ranging from 5 Hz to 12 Hz frequency at 10 G to 25 G of magnetic energy (<LINK REF="STD-Trock-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Trock 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trock-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Trock 1994</LINK>). These studies exposed the affected knee to nine hours of stimulation over a one-month period.</P>
<P>In one study a commercially available TENS stimulator (Metron Digi-10s) was modified by a biomedical engineer to deliver pulsed electrical stimulation current parameters as follows: pulsed, asymmetrically biphasic, exponentially decreasing waveform with a frequency of 100 Hz and pulse width of 4 ms. Current was delivered via 120 mm x 80 mm multiple-use conductive silicone electrodes inserted into larger calico pockets. The participants were asked to wear the device seven hours daily, preferably overnight, for 26 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Fary-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Fary 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two other pulsed electrical stimulation studies used a pulsed electrical device to deliver a 100 Hz low-amplitude signal to the knee joint via skin surface electrodes. The patients were exposed for 6 to 14 hours a day for three months and 6 to 10 hours a day for four weeks, respectively (<LINK REF="STD-Garland-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Garland 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zizic-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Zizic 1995</LINK>).</P>

<P>In the nine controlled trials included in the analysis, a total of 636 participants were randomised: 327 participants to electromagnetic field treatment and 309 to a placebo device.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-12-06 12:50:55 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Osteoarthritis is the most common of the rheumatic diseases. With an estimated 40,000 new cases of osteoarthritis diagnosed each year, it is the third leading cause of life-years lost due to disability and is associated with high morbidity and healthcare utilisation (<LINK REF="REF-March-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">March 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Towheed-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Towheed 2004</LINK>). The range of treatments for osteoarthritis is continually increasing as conventional therapies, such as pharmaceutical management, physiotherapy and joint replacement surgery, are coupled with emerging and established complementary therapies.</P>
<P>Osteoarthritis results from a failure of chondrocytes within the joint to synthesise a good-quality matrix and to maintain a balance between synthesis and degradation of the extracellular matrix. The change in the quality of the matrix is mainly the result of dedifferentiation of chondrocytes, whereas the imbalance between synthesis and degradation of the extracellular matrix is caused by increased synthesis of proteinases and decreased anabolic effects of growth factors, mainly from chondrocytes but also from synovial tissue and subchondral bone. The biochemical reasoning behind the electrical stimulation of cartilage has been clearly demonstrated in vitro; its value in the treatment of delayed union fracture has been proven over two decades of use and it has been established as a standard of care (<LINK REF="REF-Aaron-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aaron 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Baker-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baker 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bassett-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bassett 1974</LINK>). The question remains as to whether it provides a financially accessible, clinically significant alternative to current therapies for osteoarthritis. The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness of electrical stimulation treatment. However, its major limitation is the small number of contributing studies that could be included; this also prevented the planned subgroup analysis of variations in treatment.</P>
<P>All of the studies' participants had osteoarthritis of one or both knees, or cervical osteoarthritis, diagnosed by clinical symptoms and radiographic evidence, and the osteoarthritis was painful despite medical treatment.</P>
<P>The protocols for pulsed electrical stimulation or pulsed electromagnetic field device setting and application varied widely between studies, as did the outcome measures. Some pulsed electrical stimulation devices delivered a low-frequency (100 Hz), low-amplitude, voltage sourced (mean = 6.2 peak volts), monophasic, spiked signal to the knee via skin surface electrodes (<LINK REF="STD-Fary-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Fary 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Garland-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Garland 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zizic-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Zizic 1995</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 2013</LINK> a pulsed electromagnetic field signal consisting of a 7 ms burst of 6.8 MHz sinusoidal waves repeating at one burst/s delivered a peak induced electrical field of 34 ± 8 V/m to the knee from a portable battery-operated device. Other devices used in the included trials generated a pulsating electromagnetic field with a mean intensity of 40 &#956;T (the frequency of the pulsed magnetic field ranged: 1 Hz to 3000 Hz) (<LINK REF="STD-Nicolakis-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Nicolakis 2002</LINK>); or generated pulses of magnetic energy via a soft iron core with base frequencies (3 Hz, 7.8 Hz and 20 Hz) (<LINK REF="STD-Pipitone-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pipitone 2001</LINK>), G50V in 50 Hz pulses changing voltage in 3 ms intervals (<LINK REF="STD-Thamsborg-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Thamsborg 2005</LINK>) and extremely low-frequency pulsed waves at 5 Hz, 10 to 15 gauss for 10 minutes, 10 Hz 15 to 25 gauss for 10 minutes and 12 Hz 15 to 25 gauss for 10 minutes (<LINK REF="STD-Trock-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Trock 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trock-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Trock 1994</LINK>). Characteristics of the devices, such as electromagnetic field modes, and application characteristics, such as duration, could not be evaluated in this systematic review due to the small number of trials.</P>
<P>Pain relief was measured using visual analogue scales (VAS). We pooled this outcome from six trials and found a significant difference between the electromagnetic field and placebo-treated groups (<LINK REF="STD-Fary-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Fary 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Garland-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Garland 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trock-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Trock 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trock-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Trock 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zizic-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Zizic 1995</LINK>). All were randomised controlled trials with appropriate blinding and they had appropriate, well-described placebo treatments (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). There was moderate heterogeneity in the results. The intervention and its duration also differed between the studies.</P>
<P>The improvement in physical function<B> </B>in patients with knee osteoarthritis treated with pulsed electromagnetic fields was not statistically significant (<LINK REF="STD-Fary-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Fary 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Garland-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Garland 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pipitone-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pipitone 2001</LINK>). There was high heterogeneity in the results. This might be due to the different measurement tools used in the included studies. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Fary-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Fary 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Garland-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Garland 2007</LINK>) used WOMAC physical function (on a 100 mm VAS) to measure the efficacy variable, while one study (<LINK REF="STD-Pipitone-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pipitone 2001</LINK>) used the WOMAC disability score on a 20 cm VAS of the EuroQol. The intervention duration also differed among these studies.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Quality of life was not statistically significantly different between the treatment and placebo groups (<LINK REF="STD-Fary-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Fary 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pipitone-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pipitone 2001</LINK>). This might be explained by the small sample sizes of the included studies measuring these outcomes, the wide variation in electromagnetic field devices and application protocols, or the inadequate intervention periods.</P>
<P>There were no life-threatening events reported among participants exposed to electromagnetic fields.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-11-28 13:10:34 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A comprehensive search of the literature revealed a number of studies of electromagnetic field interventions for osteoarthritis. Although the studies presented differences between placebo and active treatment for osteoarthritis for some outcomes, these effects did not meet the generally accepted criteria for clinical importance. There are currently insufficient data to draw conclusions about the efficacy of electromagnetic field interventions in the management of osteoarthritis, thus highlighting the need for larger independent studies that focus on the OMERACT core outcomes with complete documentation of results.</P>
<P>In summary, electromagnetic field treatment has a moderate benefit for patients' pain relief. There is inconclusive evidence that electromagnetic field treatment improves physical function, quality of life or radiographic joint structure. No serious adverse effects of electromagnetic field treatment were reported in the included trials. This might be because of the relative safety of electromagnetic fields compared to physiotherapy, which could be an advantage. This meta-analysis did not reveal clinically important results overall and the analysis was limited by the paucity of literature on electromagnetic fields for osteoarthritis. However, the statistically significant benefits seen here do support the undertaking of further large-scale studies to allow definite conclusions to be drawn.</P>

<P>The quality of the evidence of all included trials was moderate or low. Six trials described generation of allocation sequence or concealment of allocation, or reported whether primary outcomes were specified a priori.

They reported that pulsed electromagnetic field treatment improved clinical scores and function in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee and that it should be considered as an adjuvant therapy in the management of these patients. However, there is still equipoise regarding the evidence in the literature for an effect on pain.</P>
