<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Preterm infants are often much smaller than term infants by the time that they are discharged home from hospital. This review sought evidence that feeding these infants with nutrient-enriched formula milk rather than breast milk would increase growth rates and benefit development. No trials of this intervention were found. Whether undertaking such trials would be acceptable to mothers of preterm infants is not known. </P>

<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Preterm infants are often growth-restricted at hospital discharge. Feeding infants after hospital discharge with nutrient-enriched formula milk instead of human breast milk might facilitate "catch-up" growth and improve development.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used. This included searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2007), MEDLINE (1966 - May 2007), EMBASE (1980 - May 2007), CINAHL (1982 - May 2007), conference proceedings, and previous reviews.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There are no data from randomised controlled trials to determine whether feeding preterm infants following hospital discharge with nutrient-enriched formula milk versus human breast milk affects growth and development. Mothers who wish to breast feed, and their health care advisors, would require very clear evidence that feeding with a nutrient-enriched formula milk had major advantages for their infants before electing not to feed (or to reduce feeding) with maternal breast milk. If evidence from trials that compared feeding preterm infants following hospital discharge with nutrient-enriched versus standard formula milk demonstrated an effect on growth or development, then this might strengthen the case for undertaking trials of nutrient-enriched formula milk versus human breast milk. </P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-08-22 13:36:07 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Most preterm infants accumulate significant energy, protein, mineral, and other nutrient deficits by the time of discharge from hospital (<LINK REF="REF-Embleton-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Embleton 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lucas-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucas 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clark-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 2003</LINK>). Although demand-fed preterm infants consume greater volumes of milk than term infants following hospital discharge, growth deficits persist throughout infancy and beyond (<LINK REF="REF-Lucas-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucas 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morley-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morley 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ford-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ford 2000</LINK>). Poor postnatal growth in preterm infants, especially of the head, is associated with an increased risk of neurodevelopmental impairment in later childhood, as well as with poorer cognitive and educational outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Hack-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hack 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cooke-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooke 2003</LINK>). Preterm infants who have accumulated deficits in calcium and phosphate by the time of hospital discharge are at increased risk of poor bone mineralisation, metabolic bone disease, and slower skeletal growth compared to infants born at term (<LINK REF="REF-Rigo-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rigo 2000</LINK>). There has also been concern that nutritional deficiency and growth restriction, both in utero and in early infancy, may have consequences for long-term cardiovascular health (<LINK REF="REF-Barker-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barker 2002</LINK>). </P>
<P>There is an opportunity for continued nutritional intervention during the post-hospital discharge period of early infancy (<LINK REF="REF-Cooke-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooke 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Griffin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griffin 2002</LINK>). Nutritional supplementation during this period may be of particular importance for infants with on-going additional metabolic requirements, for example due, to chronic lung disease. Several strategies for increasing nutrient delivery for preterm infants following hospital discharge are available. The effect of multicomponent, nutrient fortification of human breast milk for preterm infants following discharge is addressed in another Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-McGuire-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGuire 2007a</LINK>). The purpose of this review is to determine whether there is any evidence that feeding preterm or low birth weight infants after hospital discharge with a nutrient-enriched formula milk versus human breast milk improves growth and development. </P>
<P>A variety of nutrient-enriched formulae, mainly modified cow milk, are available (<LINK REF="REF-Fewtrell-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fewtrell 1999</LINK>). These vary in energy, protein and mineral content and can be categorised broadly as:<BR/>1. Preterm formula; energy (about 80 kcal/100 ml) and protein (about 2.0 - 2.4 grams/100ml) -enriched, and variably enriched with minerals, vitamins, and trace elements to support intra-uterine nutrient accretion rates. These milks are often used for nutrition of preterm infants prior to hospital discharge.<BR/>2. Post-discharge formula; specifically designed for formula-fed preterm infants following discharge from hospital. These are less nutrient dense compared with preterm formulae, but are energy- (about 72- 74 kcal/100 ml) and protein- (about 1.8 grams/ 100ml) enriched, and variably enriched with minerals, vitamins, and trace elements compared to human breast milk.</P>
<P>Feeding with nutrient-enriched formula milk might be expected to increase nutrient delivery compared to feeding with human breast milk (<LINK REF="REF-Gross-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gross 1980</LINK>). However, there are putative non-nutrient benefits of feeding with human milk for mothers and preterm infants. For example, the delivery of immunoglobulins, growth factors, and other immunological mediators to the immature gut mucosa may help with postnatal adaptation, improve feed tolerance, and prevent infection (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2001</LINK>). Feeding with nutrient-enriched formula may also be associated with other adverse effects such as reduced gastric motility and emptying (<LINK REF="REF-Hancock-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hancock 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Siegel-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siegel 1984</LINK>). Nutrient-enriched formula milk may, therefore, be more poorly tolerated by reducing nutrient delivery and, potentially, removing any benefits for growth and development. </P>

<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>The standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used. This consisted of searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2007), MEDLINE (1966 - May 2007), and EMBASE (1980 - May 2007), and CINAHL (1982 - May 2007). The electronic search used the following text words and MeSH terms: [Infant, Newborn OR Infant, Premature OR Infant, Low Birth Weight OR infan* OR neonat*] AND "Infant-Nutrition"/ all subheadings OR Milk, Human OR milk OR breast OR fortif* OR supplement*]. The search outputs were limited with the relevant search filters for clinical trials. No language restriction was applied. References in previous reviews and studies were examined. Abstracts presented at the Society for Pediatric Research, European Society for Pediatric Research, the North American Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition, and the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition between 1990 and 2006/7 were searched. Trials reported only as abstracts were eligible if sufficient information was available from the report, or from contact with the authors, to fulfil the inclusion criteria. The UK National Research Register (http://www.nrr.nhs.uk), and Current Controlled Trials (http://www.controlled-trials.com) websites were searched for completed or ongoing trials. </P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>1. The title and abstract of all studies identified by the above search strategy were screened and the full articles for all potentially relevant trials obtained. The full text of any potentially eligible reports was re-assessed and those studies that did not meet all of the inclusion criteria were excluded. Any disagreements were discussed until consensus was achieved.</P>
<P>2. We planned to use the criteria and standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group were used to assess the methodological quality of the trials in terms of allocation concealment, blinding of parents, carers, and assessors to the intervention, and completeness of assessment in all randomised individuals. </P>
<P>3. We planned to use a data collection form was used to extract relevant information. If data from the trial reports were insufficient, the trialists were contacted for further information.</P>
<P>4. We planned to present outcomes for categorical data were presented as relative risk, risk difference, and number needed to treat. For continuous data, the weighted mean difference (with respective 95% confidence intervals) was presented.</P>
<P>5. We planned to estimate the treatment effects of individual trials and heterogeneity between trial results was examined by inspecting the forest plots and quantifying the impact of heterogeneity in meta-analyses using a measure of the degree of inconsistency in the studies' results (I- squared statistic). If statistical heterogeneity was detected, the possible causes (for example, differences in study quality, participants, intervention regimens, or outcome assessments) were explored using post-hoc sub-group analyses. A fixed effects model was planned for meta-analyses. </P>

<DISCUSSION>
<P>No randomised controlled trials of nutrient-enriched formula milk versus human breast milk for feeding preterm infants following hospital discharge were identified. This is likely to be due to reluctance of researchers to assess an intervention that results in young infants stopping (or at least reducing) breast-feeding, especially when this is contrary to the mother's initial choice to establish breast-feeding. If nutrient input during the period of early infancy following hospital discharge is important in determining long-term growth and developmental outcomes, it may be that the benefits of higher nutrient input outweigh the disadvantages of formula feeding. However, systematic review of trials of nutrient-enriched formula versus standard term formula (which contains about the same level of energy, protein and other nutrients as human breast milk) did not find any clinically important effects on growth or development (<LINK REF="REF-McGuire-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGuire 2007b</LINK>). A possible explanation for this apparent paradox is that ad libitum fed infants adjust their intake to the energy content of the formula and consume lower volumes of nutrient-enriched formula than standard term formula. Therefore, it is plausible that feeding infants ad libitum with nutrient-enriched formula rather than human breast milk would not result in higher levels of nutrient intake. </P>
<P>It may be appropriate to focus research efforts on the subgroup of preterm infants who are not able to feed ad libitum following hospital discharge and who have extra metabolic demands, for example, because of growth-restriction or chronic lung disease. It would be important to determine the acceptability to mothers and health care advisors of undertaking trials of feeding with nutrient-enriched formula, perhaps as a supplement to human breast milk, in this population. Multicomponent fortification of human breast milk may be a preferable strategy for increasing nutrient input for mothers who have established breast-feeding (<LINK REF="REF-McGuire-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGuire 2007a</LINK>). </P>
<P>Finally, considerable uncertainty exists with regard to the effect of growth status during fetal life and early infancy on long term health. A recent systematic appraisal of observational studies did not find evidence to support a strong association between fetal growth and cardiovascular heath in later life (<LINK REF="REF-Huxley-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huxley 2002</LINK>). Similarly, although rapid "catch-up" growth has been proposed as a potential contributor to a "metabolic syndrome" that results in long term adverse cardiovascular outcomes, current evidence suggests that any contribution of diet in early infancy to long-term outcomes of preterm infants is likely to be very small (discussed by <LINK REF="REF-Greer-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greer 2007</LINK>). </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There are no data from randomised controlled trials to determine whether feeding preterm infants following hospital discharge with nutrient-enriched formula milk versus human breast milk affects growth and development. Mothers who wish to breast feed, and their health care advisors, would require very clear evidence that feeding with a nutrient-enriched formula milk had major advantages for their infants before electing not to feed (or to reduce feeding) with maternal breast milk. </P>
