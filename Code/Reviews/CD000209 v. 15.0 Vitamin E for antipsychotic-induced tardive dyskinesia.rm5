These symptoms are usually treated with antipsychotic drugs. However, these drugs can have debilitating side effects. Tardive dyskinesia is an involuntary movement that causes the face, mouth, tongue and jaw to convulse, spasm and grimace. It is caused by long-term or high-dose use of antipsychotic drugs, is difficult to treat and can be incurable.

There was no clear difference between vitamin E and placebo for the outcome of TD: not improved to a clinically important extent (6 RCTs, N = 264, RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.01, low-quality evidence). However, people allocated to placebo may show more deterioration of their symptoms compared with those given vitamin E (5 RCTs, N = 85, RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.76, low-quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in the incidence of any adverse effects (9 RCTs, N = 205, RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.35 to 4.15, <I>v</I>ery low-quality evidence), extrapyramidal adverse effects (1 RCT, N = 104, MD 1.10, 95% CI -1.02 to 3.22, very low-quality evidence), or acceptability of treatment (measured by participants leaving the study early) (medium term, 8 RCTs, N = 232, RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.80, very low-quality evidence).

These drugs can effectively control symptoms such as abnormal perceptions (hallucinations), disordered thinking and fixed false beliefs (delusions). In addition, maintenance therapy with antipsychotics is associated with a reduced risk of relapse (<LINK REF="REF-Schooler-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schooler 1993</LINK>). However, antipsychotic medication has been also associated with a wide range of adverse effects, including movement disorders. The appearance of these movement disorders can contribute to poor compliance with antipsychotic treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 1993</LINK>).</P><P>Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is one such movement disorder and is characterised by abnormal, repetitive and involuntary movements. TD is a chronic condition of insidious onset, the severity of which spontaneously fluctuates (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1992</LINK>). Studies on the natural history of TD have reported widely variable remission rates (1% to 62%) depending on patient age, psychiatric diagnosis, course of the psychiatric disorder, and duration of therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Bergen-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bergen 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fernandez-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fernandez 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glazer-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazer 1990</LINK>). It occurs in more than 20% of those using antipsychotic medication continually for longer than three months. Every year 4% to 5% of adults and 25% to 30% of elderly persons who continually use these drugs begin to show signs of TD (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Correll-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Correll 2004</LINK>). This disorder can result in considerable social and physical disability (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 1993</LINK>).</P><P>The prevalence of TD is often thought to be decreasing based on the use of atypical antipsychotics in place of typical antipsychotics (<LINK REF="REF-Cloud-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cloud 2014</LINK>). A systematic review found that the incidence of TD associated with atypical drugs (2% to 4%) was significantly lower than that for typicals (5% to 8%) (<LINK REF="REF-Correll-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Correll 2008</LINK>). Despite this, the widespread use of atypical drugs in clinical settings may still result in an overall increase in the number of cases of TD (<LINK REF="REF-Glazer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazer 2000</LINK>).</P><P>Although the most frequent cause of TD is the use of antipsychotic medication, it is striking that dose reduction can lead to a temporary exacerbation in symptoms. Conversely, increasing the dose is often associated with a temporary remission. Antipsychotic drugs block certain chemical receptor sites in the brain - one of these is specific for dopamine (<LINK REF="REF-Casey-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casey 1994</LINK>). One hypothesis explaining the cause of antipsychotic-induced TD is that chronic blockade of dopamine receptors in specific cells of the brain (neurones from the nigrostriatum) causes an overgrowth of these receptors (<LINK REF="REF-Casey-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casey 1994</LINK>). However, there is some suggestion that the chronic use of antipsychotics may also cause an abnormal production of highly active atoms and chemical groups (cytotoxic free radicals), which may damage specific cells in the brain. This, in turn, could be responsible for the appearance of TD (<LINK REF="REF-Cadet-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cadet 1989</LINK>).</P><P>This work updates one in a series of reviews relevant to the management of antipsychotic-induced tardive dyskinesia (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P></CONDITION><INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-12-21 10:31:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Vitamin E (tocopherol) is a lipid-soluble antioxidant, illustrated in <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>, that acts as a free radical scavenger and has been proposed as a treatment for antipsychotic-induced TD (<LINK REF="REF-Rotrosen-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rotrosen 1996</LINK>).</P></INTERVENTION><THEORY MODIFIED="2017-10-11 14:23:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Vitamin E may assist in minimising damage caused by cytotoxic free radical overproduction, and may prevent or decrease the severity of TD, particularly for people who have had the onset of the problem in the preceding five years (<LINK REF="REF-Feltner-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feltner 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jeste-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jeste 1993</LINK>).</P></THEORY><IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-01-04 19:52:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Several atypical antipsychotic drugs have been produced in the last decades that claim to cause less or no TD (<LINK REF="REF-Lieberman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lieberman 1996</LINK>). These claims may or may not be true, and certainly evidence does point to the fact that thoughtful use of older generation drugs is not associated with any more problems of TD than with newer treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Chouinard-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chouinard 2008</LINK>). However, in a global context, it is likely that the less expensive and more familiar drugs - such as chlorpromazine or haloperidol - will continue to be the mainstay of treatment of people with schizophrenia (<A HREF="http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/essentialmedicines/Updated_sixteenth_adult_list_en.pdf">WHO Essential List 2010</A>). Use of drugs such as these is associated with emergence of TD and, therefore, this condition will remain a problem for years to come.</P><P>Cessation or reduction of the dose of antipsychotic medication is the ideal management for TD. In clinical practice this is not always possible, not least because in many individuals such a reduction would lead to relapse. This review focuses on whether the addition of vitamin E to those already receiving antipsychotic medication is likely to help TD.</P></IMPORTANCE></BACKGROUND><OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-10-11 14:23:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The primary objective was to determine the clinical effects of vitamin E in people with schizophrenia or other chronic mental illness who had developed antipsychotic-induced TD.</P><P>The secondary objectives were:<BR/>1. to examine whether the effect of vitamin E was maintained as duration of follow-up increased;<BR/>2. to test the hypothesis that the use of vitamin E is most effective for those with early onset TD (less than five years) (see <LINK TAG="SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS" TYPE="SECTION">Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</LINK>).</P></OBJECTIVES><METHODS MODIFIED="2017-11-16 12:43:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-11-16 12:43:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><CRIT_STUDIES MODIFIED="2011-01-04 19:53:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>All relevant randomised controlled trials.

We extracted data presented only in graphs and figures whenever possible, but included only if both review authors independently had the same result. We attempted to contact authors through an open-ended request in order to obtain missing information or for clarification whenever necessary.

We realise that this is not often reported clearly, we noted in <LINK TAG="STUDY_DESCRIPTION" TYPE="SECTION">Description of studies</LINK> if this was the case or not.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">2.3 Endpoint versus change data</HEADING><P>There are advantages of both endpoint and change data. Change data can remove a component of between-person variability from the analysis. On the other hand, calculation of change needs two assessments (baseline and endpoint), which can be difficult in unstable and difficult to measure conditions such as schizophrenia. We decided primarily to use endpoint data, and only use change data if the former were not available. We combined endpoint and change data in the analysis as we preferred to use mean differences (MD) rather than standardised mean differences (SMD) throughout (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">2.4 Skewed data</HEADING><P>Continuous data on clinical and social outcomes are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data, we applied the following standards to relevant data before inclusion.<BR/></P><P>Please note, we entered skewed data from studies of at least 200 participants in the analysis, because skewed data pose less of a problem in large studies. We also entered all relevant change data as when continuous data are presented on a scale that includes a possibility of negative values (such as change data), it is difficult to tell whether data are skewed or not.</P><P>For endpoint data from studies &lt; 200 participants:</P><P>(a) when a scale starts from the &#64257;nite number zero, we subtracted the lowest possible value from the mean, and divided this by the standard deviation (SD). If this value was lower than 1, it strongly suggests a skew and we excluded these data. If this ratio was higher than one but below 2, there is suggestion of skew. We entered these data and tested whether its inclusion or exclusion changed the results substantially. Finally, if the ratio was larger than 2 we included these data, because skew is less likely (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P><P>(b) if a scale starts from a positive value (such as the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), (<LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>)), which can have values from 30 to 210), we modified the calculation described above to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skew is present if 2 SD &gt; (S-S min), where S is the mean score and 'S min' is the minimum score.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">2.5 Common measure</HEADING><P>Where relevant, to facilitate comparison between trials, we converted variables that can be reported in different metrics, such as days in hospital (mean days per year, per week or per month) to a common metric (e.g. mean days per month).</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">2.6 Conversion of continuous to binary</HEADING><P>Where possible, we converted continuous outcome measures to dichotomous data. This can be done by identifying cut-off points on rating scales and dividing participants accordingly into 'clinically improved' or 'not clinically improved'. It is generally assumed that if there is a 50% reduction in a scale-derived score such as the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS, <LINK REF="REF-Overall-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1962</LINK>) or the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS, <LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>), this can be considered as a clinically significant response (<LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005</LINK>). If data based on these thresholds were not available, we used the primary cut-off presented by the original authors.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">2.7 Direction of graphs</HEADING><P>Where possible, we entered data in such a way that the area to the left of the line of no effect indicated a favourable outcome for Vitamin E. Where keeping to this made it impossible to avoid outcome titles with clumsy double-negatives (e.g. 'Not un-improved'), we presented data where the left of the line indicates an unfavourable outcome and noted this in the relevant graphs.</P></SUBSECTION></SUBSECTION></DATA_EXTRACTION><QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2017-11-01 14:37:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Review authors NM and HB independently assessed risk of bias within the included studies by using criteria described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>to assess trial quality (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011a</LINK>).

Cluster trials</HEADING><P>Studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Firstly, authors often fail to account for intra-class correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) whereby P values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This causes type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>).</P><P>If any of the included trials had randomised participants by clusters, and where clustering was not accounted for in primary studies, we would have presented such data in a table, with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review we will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) for their clustered data and to adjust for this by using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Where clustering has been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we will present these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjust for the clustering effect.</P><P>We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a 'design effect'. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the ICC [Design effect = 1+(m-1)*ICC] (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC is not reported it will be assumed to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>).</P><P>If cluster studies have been appropriately analysed taking into account ICCs and relevant data documented in the report, synthesis with other studies would be possible using the generic inverse variance technique.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Cross-over trials</HEADING><P>A major concern of cross-over trials is the carry-over effect. It occurs if an effect (e.g. pharmacological, physiological or psychological) of the treatment in the first phase is carried over to the second phase. As a consequence, on entry to the second phase the participants can differ systematically from their initial state despite a wash-out phase. For the same reason cross-over trials are not appropriate if the condition of interest is unstable (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). As both effects are very likely in severe mental illness, we only used data of the first phase of cross-over studies.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Studies with multiple treatment groups</HEADING><P>Had a study involved more than two treatment arms, if relevant, we would have presented the additional treatment arms in comparisons. If data were binary we simply would have added and combined within the two-by-two table. If data were continuous we would have combined data following the formula in section 7.7.3.8  (Combining groups) of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (</I><LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>)<I>.</I> We would not use data where the additional treatment arms were not relevant.</P></SUBSECTION></UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS><MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2017-10-11 14:23:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Overall loss of credibility</HEADING><P>At some degree of loss of follow-up, data must lose credibility (<LINK REF="REF-Xia-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xia 2009</LINK>). We chose that, for any particular outcome, should more than 50% of data be unaccounted for, we would not reproduce these data or use them within analyses. If, however, more than 50% of those in one arm of a study were lost, but the total loss was less than 50%, we would address this within the 'Summary of Findings' table by down-rating quality. We also planned to downgrade quality within the 'Summary of Findings' table should loss be 25% to 50% in total.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Binary</HEADING><P>In the case where attrition for a binary outcome is between 0% and 50% and where these data were not clearly described, we presented data on a 'once-randomised-always-analyse' basis (an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis). We assumed all those leaving the study early had no improvement in TD symptoms. We undertook a sensitivity analysis to test how prone the primary outcomes were to change by comparing data only from people who completed the study to that point to the ITT analysis using the above assumptions.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Continuous</HEADING><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">3.1 Attrition</HEADING><P>We reported and used data where attrition for a continuous outcome was between 0% and 50%, and data only from people who completed the study to that point were reported.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">3.2 Standard deviations</HEADING><P>If standard deviations were not reported, we first tried to obtain the missing values from the authors. If not available, where there were missing measures of variance for continuous data, but an exact standard error (SE) and confidence intervals available for group means, and either P value or t value available for differences in mean, we calculated them according to the rules described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2011</LINK>): When only the SE is reported, standard deviations (SDs) are calculated by the formula SD = SE * square root (n). Chapters 7.7.3 and 16.1.3 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2011</LINK>) present detailed formulae for estimating SDs from P values, t or F values, confidence intervals, ranges or other statistics. If these formulae did not apply, we calculated the SDs according to a validated imputation method which is based on the SDs of the other included studies (<LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2006</LINK>). Although some of these imputation strategies can introduce error, the alternative would be to exclude a given study&#8217;s outcome and thus to lose information. We nevertheless examined the validity of the imputations in a sensitivity analysis excluding imputed values.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">3.3 Assumptions about participants who left the trials early or were lost to follow-up</HEADING><P>Various methods are available to account for participants who left trials early or were lost to follow-up. Some trials just present the results of study completers, others use the method of last observation carried forward (LOCF), while more recently, methods such as multiple imputation or mixed effects models for repeated measurements (MMRM) have become more of a standard. While the latter methods seem to be somewhat better than LOCF (<LINK REF="REF-Leon-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leon 2006</LINK>), we feel that the high percentage of participants leaving the studies early and differences in the reasons for leaving the studies early between groups is often the core problem in randomised schizophrenia trials. We therefore did not exclude studies based on the statistical approach used. However, we preferred to use the more sophisticated approaches. (e.g. MMRM or multiple-imputation) and only presented completer analyses if some kind of ITT data were not available at all. Moreover, we addressed this issue in the item "incomplete outcome data" of the 'Risk of bias' tool.</P></SUBSECTION></SUBSECTION></MISSING_DATA><HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2017-10-11 14:23:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">1.

The random-effects method incorporates an assumption that the different studies are estimating different, yet related, intervention effects. This often seems to be true to us and the random-effects model takes into account differences between studies even if there is no statistically significant heterogeneity. There is, however, a disadvantage to the random-effects model. It puts added weight onto small studies, which often are the most biased ones. Depending on the direction of effect, these studies can either inflate or deflate the effect size.

The search</HEADING><P>This area of research does not seem to be active. this 2017 update has identified additional data, but most trials predate the year 2000, only one was carried out after that time (published 2004). This could be because of reasons such as less concern with tardive dyskinesia (TD), or less emergence of the problem in research-active communities because of more thoughtful use of antipsychotic drugs or loss of faith in vitamin E as a potential treatment.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Few data</HEADING><P>Only a little under 500 people have been involved in placebo-controlled trials of vitamin E for TD. It is possible that real, and important, effects have not been highlighted because of the necessarily wide confidence intervals of the findings. Many outcomes were not measured at all (see <LINK TAG="APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS" TYPE="SECTION">Overall completeness and applicability of evidence</LINK>), including one of our pre-stated outcome measures. We may have been overambitious in hoping for some of these outcomes in TD trials but simple reporting of satisfaction with care or quality of life still does not seem too demanding and does remain of interest.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">3. Comparison 1. Vitamin E versus placebo</HEADING><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">3.1 TD symptoms</HEADING><P>Results of this review do not suggest that vitamin E improves symptoms of TD. However, the quality of the evidence for improvement of TD symptoms is low; further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. The recent addition of <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2004</LINK> did not impact on the binary outcomes for improvement in TD symptoms, but changed the continuous scale results in favour of vitamin E. The finding that people allocated to placebo may show more deterioration of their symptoms compared with those allocated to vitamin E is interesting (low-quality evidence, 5 trials, 85 people, RR 0.23 95% CI 0.07 to 0.76) and generates some hope that the experimental treatment may have a preventative role. This is worthy of further investigation.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">3.2 Adverse effects</HEADING><P>There is no evidence that vitamin E has any significant adverse effects.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">3.3 Mental state</HEADING><P>Three trials reported on mental state. All used the BPRS scale, but this involved only asking 165 people regarding this important outcome. There was no suggestion that vitamin E had any different effect on mental state than placebo.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">3.4 Leaving the study early</HEADING><P>It is always unclear what leaving the study early means. It could be to do with the participant not accepting treatment for a series of reasons, or of participants finding the trial intolerable. It also could be a function of a trial design in which willing participants are still asked to leave because of some degree of protocol violation. In any event, between 20% and 30% of people left the study early, but this was not different for those allocated to either group.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">3.5 Social confidence, social inclusion, social networks, or personalised quality of life</HEADING><P>This group of outcomes was selected as being of importance to patients for the 2017 review update following a service user consultation. No studies were identified that reported on any of these outcomes.</P></SUBSECTION></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">4. Comparison 2. Vitamin E versus any other intervention</HEADING><P>We found no included study that compared the efficacy of vitamin E compared to another active intervention. There is currently one ongoing study (<LINK REF="STD-ISRCTN14688109-2015" TYPE="STUDY">ISRCTN14688109 2015</LINK>) comparing vitamin E to cannabidiol that is due to be published in 2018.</P></SUBSECTION></SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS><APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-10-11 14:23:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Completeness</HEADING><P>No outcomes in this review involved large numbers of people. Some are general measures and more subtle findings are not recorded. For example, we identified few data on the outcome of &#8216;any adverse effect&#8217; but none on the binary outcomes &#8216;use of any anti-parkinsonism drugs&#8217; or &#8216;no clinically significant extrapyramidal adverse effects - any time period&#8217;- the latter being one of our pre-stated primary outcomes. There were no data on the patient-designated important outcomes quality of life and satisfaction with care for either recipients of care or caregivers, nor were there data on hospital and service utilisation outcomes, economic outcomes, behaviour or cognitive response.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Applicability</HEADING><P>All trials were hospital-based but were nevertheless on people who would be recognisable in everyday care. The intervention in question - vitamin E - is readily accessible and most outcomes understandable in terms of clinical practice. Should vitamin E have had important effects the findings may well have been applicable.</P></SUBSECTION></APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS><QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-10-11 14:23:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The largest trial in this area randomised only 158 people (<LINK REF="STD-Adler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Adler 1999</LINK>). A trial of this size is unable to detect subtle, yet important differences due to vitamin E with any confidence. In order to detect a 20% difference between groups, probably about 150 people are need in each arm of the study (alpha 0.05, beta 0.8). Overall, the quality of reporting of these trials was poor (see <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). Allocation concealment was not described, generation of the sequence was not explicit, studies were not clearly blinded, we are unsure if data are incomplete or selectively reported or if other biases were operating. The small trial size, along with the poor reporting of trials, would be associated with an exaggeration of effect of the experimental treatment (<LINK REF="REF-J_x0171_ni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">J&#369;ni 2001</LINK>) if an effect had been detected. This is only evident for the outcome of &#8216;deterioration&#8217; where there is indeed an effect favouring the vitamin E group. This interesting finding may be real &#8211; but could equally be a function of biases or of chance.</P></QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE><POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-10-11 14:23:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Missing studies</HEADING><P>Every effort is made to identify relevant trials. However, these studies are all small and it is likely that we have failed to identify other studies of limited power. It is likely that such studies would also not be in favour of the vitamin E group. If they had been so, it is more likely that they would have been published in accessible literature. We do not, however, think it likely that we have failed to identify large relevant studies. </P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Introducing bias</HEADING><P>This review group has now updated this review several times. We have tried to be balanced in our appraisal of the evidence but could have inadvertently introduced bias. We welcome comments or criticisms. New methods and innovations now make it possible to report data where, in the past, we could not report data at all or had to report data in a different way. We think the <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> to be a valuable innovation &#8211; but problematic to those not &#8216;blind&#8217; to the outcome data. It is possible to &#8216;cherry pick&#8217; significant findings for presentation in this table. We have tried to decrease the chance of doing this by asking a new review author (NM) to select outcomes relevant for this table before becoming familiar with the data. </P></SUBSECTION></POTENTIAL_BIASES><AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-10-11 14:23:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The only other relevant quantitative review we know of is the previous version of this Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Soares_x002d_Weiser-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soares-Weiser 2011</LINK>).

For people with TD</HEADING><P>There is some suggestion that vitamin E supplementation may alter the course of tardive dyskinesia (TD) for those with schizophrenia and these findings are in keeping with other types of studies (<LINK REF="REF-Hawkins-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawkins 1989</LINK>). These data are very weak and should be interpreted with considerable caution. If offered vitamin E supplementation to offset symptoms of TD a person taking antipsychotic medication would be justified in asking for evidence, and encouraging generation of new better evidence by volunteering to help with a well-designed evaluative study.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">2. For clinicians</HEADING><P>TD is such a disfiguring condition. This review generates a theory that vitamin E could be a preventative measure for TD. The data in this review do not justify routine use of vitamin E. It would be reasonable, however, to ask people with schizophrenia to complicate their treatment plan if the use of vitamin E was to generate data better than seen in this review. There is a real place for clinician-driven research, with prescription within the context of a randomised trial and routine data collection on outcomes of relevance to people with TD and their clinicians.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">3. Policy makers or managers</HEADING><P>This is one of the largest in the series of Cochrane reviews on TD. No evidence is convincing that addition of another drug helps with the symptoms of TD. There are, however, many unanswered questions in this area. This unattractive adverse effect is caused, to a greater or lesser extent, by antipsychotic drugs. Clinicians and researchers should feel responsible enough to continue to try to help it. Those compiling guidance could encourage supportive activity and more research into this neglected area.</P></SUBSECTION></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-10-11 14:23:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">1. General</HEADING><P>The power of this review would have been greatly enhanced by better reporting of data. For example, only one study made explicit how randomisation was undertaken (<LINK REF="STD-Adler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Adler 1999</LINK>). We realise that much of the work for these trials predates <A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org/">CONSORT</A>, which was first published in 1996 (<LINK REF="REF-Begg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begg 1996</LINK>), and that it is only too easy to judge studies of the past by standards of today. Future studies, however, should report to a much higher standard. </P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Specific</HEADING><P>Well-designed randomised controlled trials, involving a large number of participants over protracted periods of time, are needed if we are to see if vitamin E could have a role in prevention and treatment of TD. Such studies are of importance to people with the problem (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>) and have long been ignored.</P><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">2.1 Use of cross-over design</HEADING><P>Trialists find it difficult to identify people with both TD and schizophrenia to participate in trials (<LINK REF="STD-Schmidt-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Schmidt 1991</LINK>). Randomised cross-over design is used in the hope of improving the power of the study to find outcomes of interest. This design initially asks participants to be randomised to one of the experimental interventions, and then, at a pre-specified time, to be crossed over to the treatment that they did not at first receive. Conditions with a more stable time course than TD are better suited for cross-over studies (<LINK REF="REF-Fleiss-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleiss 1984</LINK>). Further difficulties are the carry-over effect. At the very least, vitamin E is dissolved in fat and probably high levels from the doses given in trials may well persist in the body for long periods after discontinuation. Unless cross-over studies include a mid-study washout period (where the person is free of treatment before starting the next arm of the study), any effect of vitamin E may continue into the second half placebo arm of the trial &#8211; the 'carry-over effect'. Also, carry-over may involve the re-growth or retreat of neuroreceptors. This slow re-balancing, if started, could continue long after all traces of intervention drugs are gone, so physiological half life of the experimental treatment may not be the only variable to consider when thinking though the issues of carry-over. Tardive dyskinesia is also an unstable condition and people with TD may not remain compliant with medication. All these factors make the arguments for not using cross-over methodology strong, despite the initial attraction (<LINK REF="REF-Armitage-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armitage 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fleiss-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleiss 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pocock-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pocock 1983</LINK>).</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">2.2 Sample size calculation</HEADING><P>Only one of the studies included in this review mentioned how they calculated the sample size (<LINK REF="STD-Adler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Adler 1999</LINK>). However, the results suggest that larger sample size should be used to provide more precise estimates of effect.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">2.3 Length of study</HEADING><P>Three studies included in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Adler-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Adler 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Adler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Adler 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sajjad-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sajjad 1998</LINK>) used the intervention for more than five months. TD, however, is a chronic condition of insidious onset, the severity of which fluctuates spontaneously (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1992</LINK>). Even if vitamin E has a swift effect, which is unlikely, it is the long-term outcomes that must be considered of most clinical value.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">2.4 Outcomes</HEADING><P>Scale-derived data do have their place. Trials most commonly used the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) scale. This is a very widely used tool to measure the severity of symptoms of those who have TD. The use of this scale to measure change as a result of treatment is, however, problematic (<LINK REF="REF-Bergen-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bergen 1984</LINK>). It is therefore important that a scale is validated for measuring changes secondary to treatment in those with TD. In addition, many of the outcomes we initially desired when we started this review have not been investigated. Finally, a service user consultation also informed the addition of outcomes of special importance to patients. We have reconsidered all these outcomes in case they were too ambitious and tried to tailor them to a real-world pragmatic trial design (see <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>).</P></SUBSECTION></SUBSECTION></IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH></CONCLUSIONS></BODY><ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS MODIFIED="2017-10-11 14:23:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The authors acknowledge Clive Adams, Jair Mari and Rochelle Seifas for their constant help and support, Jon Deeks for statistical assistance, and Ben Gray for writing the Plain language summary.

Reports of articles that had cited these studies were inspected in order to identify further trials.<BR/><BR/>2. Reference searching <BR/>The references of all identified studies were also inspected for more studies.<BR/><BR/>3. Personal contact <BR/>The first author of each included study was contacted for information regarding unpublished trials.<BR/><BR/>Data collection and analysis<BR/>[For definitions of terms used in this, and other sections, please refer to the Glossary.]<BR/><BR/>1. Selection of reports and studies <BR/>KSW and JM inspected every report identified by the search, independently, to see if the study was likely to be relevant. Where resolving disagreement by discussion was not possible, the full article was obtained. The reviewers then inspected these articles, independently, to assess their relevance to this review. Again, where disagreements could not be resolved by discussion the article was added to those awaiting assessment and the authors of the study were contacted for clarification for ambiguous or missing descriptions of the methodology.<BR/><BR/>2. Assessment of methodological quality <BR/>The reviewers also evaluated the quality of all included trials independently of one another. A rating was given for each trial based on the three quality categories as described in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook (Clarke 2000). Only trials that stated to be randomised (category A or B of the Handbook) were included in this review.<BR/><BR/>3. Data extraction <BR/>Data were independently extracted by KSW and JM. When disputes arose resolution was attempted by discussion. When this was not possible and further information was necessary to resolve the dilemma, data were not entered and this outcome of the trial was added to the list of those awaiting assessment. Outcomes are assessed using continuous (for example changes on a behaviour scale), categorical (for example, one of three categories on a behaviour scale, such a 'little change', 'moderate change' or 'much change') or dichotomous measures (for example, either 'no important changes' or 'important changes' in a persons behaviour). Currently RevMan does not support categorical data so they were presented only in the text of the review.<BR/><BR/>4. Data synthesis <BR/>4.1 Intention to treat analysis <BR/>Data were excluded from studies where more than 50% of participants in any group were lost to follow-up. For all events, in studies with less than 50% attrition rate, people leaving early were considered to have had the negative outcome, except for the event of death.<BR/><BR/>4.2 Binary data <BR/>For binary outcomes a standard estimation of the relative risk (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated. The weighted number needed to treat or harm statistic (NNT, NNH), and its 95% confidence interval (CI), was also calculated (http://www.mango3d.cwc.net/vsx.htm). If heterogeneity was found (see section 5) a random effects model was used.<BR/><BR/>4.3 Continuous data <BR/>4.3.1 Skewed data: continuous data on clinical and social outcomes are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data, the following standards are applied to all data before inclusion: (i) standard deviations and means were reported in the paper or were obtainable from the authors; (ii) when a scale started from the finite number zero, the standard deviation, when multiplied by two, was less than the mean (as otherwise the mean was unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution, (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>); (iii) if a scale started from a positive value (such as PANSS which can have values from 30 to 210) the calculation described above in (ii) was modified to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skewness is present if 2SD&gt;(S-Smin), where S is the mean score and Smin is the minimum score. Endpoint scores on scales often have a finite start and end point and these rules can be applied to them. When continuous data are presented on a scale which includes a possibility of negative values (such as change on a scale), there is no way of telling whether data is non-normally distributed (skewed) or not. It is thus preferable to use scale end point data, which typically cannot have negative values. If end point data were not available, the reviewers used change data, but they were not subject to a meta-analysis, and were reported in the 'Additional data' tables, as were non-normally distributed end point data.<BR/><BR/>4.3.2 Summary statistic: for continuous outcomes a weighted mean difference (WMD) between groups was estimated. Again, if heterogeneity was found (see section 5) a random effects model was used.<BR/><BR/>4.3.3 Valid scales: continuous data from rating scales were included only if the measuring instrument had been described in a peer-reviewed journal (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>) and the instrument was either a self report or completed by an independent rater or relative (not the therapist).<BR/><BR/>4.3.4 Endpoint versus change data <BR/>Where possible endpoint data were presented and if both endpoint and change data were available for the same outcomes then only the former were reported in this review.<BR/><BR/>5. Test for heterogeneity <BR/>A Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test was used, as well as visual inspection of graphs, to investigate the possibility of heterogeneity. A significance level less than 0.10 was interpreted as evidence of heterogeneity. If heterogeneity was found the data were re-analysed using a random effects model to see if this made a substantial difference. If it did, the studies responsible for heterogeneity were not added to the main body of homogeneous trials, but summated and presented separately and reasons for heterogeneity investigated.<BR/><BR/>6. Addressing publication bias <BR/>Data from all included studies were entered into a funnel graph (trial effect against trial size) in an attempt to investigate the likelihood of overt publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>).<BR/><BR/>7. Sensitivity analyses <BR/>The effect of including studies with high attrition rates was analysed in a sensitivity analysis.<BR/><BR/>8. General <BR/>Where possible, reviewers entered data in such a way that the area to the left of the line of no effect indicated a favourable outcome for vitamin E.</P></APPENDIX_BODY></APPENDIX><APPENDIX ID="APP-04" MODIFIED="2017-11-01 14:37:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" NO="4"><TITLE MODIFIED="2016-01-18 14:07:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">Previous methods and searches</TITLE><APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2017-11-01 14:37:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Methods</HEADING></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Criteria for considering studies for this review</HEADING></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Types of studies</HEADING><P>All relevant randomised controlled trials.

In addition, to ensure reliability, KSW inspected a random sample of these abstracts, comprising 10% of the total.

We acquired the full articles of relevant reports for reassessment and carefully inspected for a final decision on inclusion (see <LINK TAG="SELECTION_CRITERIA" TYPE="SECTION">Criteria for considering studies for this review</LINK>). Once we obtained the full articles, in turn NM and KSW inspected all full reports and independently decided whether they met inclusion criteria. NM and KSW were not blinded to the names of the authors, institutions or journal of publication. Where difficulties or disputes arose, we asked author JM for help and if it was impossible to decide, added these studies to those awaiting assessment and contacted the authors of the papers for clarification.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction and management</HEADING><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Extraction</HEADING><P>Reviewer NM extracted data from all included studies. In addition, to ensure reliability, KSW independently extracted data from a random sample of these studies, comprising 10% of the total. Again, we discussed any disagreement, documented decisions and, if necessary, contacted authors of studies for clarification. With remaining problems JM helped clarify issues and we documented those final decisions. We extracted data presented only in graphs and figures whenever possible, but included these only if two reviewers independently had the same result. We attempted to contact authors through an open-ended request in order to obtain missing information or for clarification whenever necessary. Where possible, we extracted data relevant to each component centre of multi-centre studies separately.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">2.

Change data can remove a component of between-person variability from the analysis. On the other hand calculation of change needs two assessments (baseline and endpoint); normally both sets of data would be available to trialists but if change scores are presented, the SD of the change is often not provided. We decided to primarily use endpoint data and only use change data if the former were not available. We combined endpoint and change data in the analysis as we used mean differences rather than standardised mean differences throughout (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2011</LINK>, Chapter 9.4.5.2).</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">2.4 Skewed data</HEADING><P>Continuous data on clinical and social outcomes are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data, we aimed to apply the following standards to all data before inclusion: a) standard deviations and means are reported in the paper or obtainable from the authors; b) when a scale starts from the finite number zero, the standard deviation, when multiplied by two, is less than the mean (as otherwise the mean is unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>); c) if a scale started from a positive value (such as PANSS which can have values from 30 to 210) the calculation described above was modified to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skew is present if 2SD&gt;(S-S min), where S is the mean score and S min is the minimum score. Endpoint scores on scales often have a finite start and end point and these rules can be applied. When continuous data are presented on a scale that includes a possibility of negative values (such as change data), it is difficult to tell whether data are skewed or not. We have entered skewed data from studies of less than 200 participants in additional tables rather than into an analysis. Skewed data of means pose less of a problem if the sample size is large; if this condition was met, then we entered skewed data into syntheses.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">2.5 Conversion to common measures</HEADING><P>To facilitate comparison between trials, we intended to convert variables that can be reported in different metrics, such as days in hospital (mean days per year, per week or per month) to a common metric (e.g. mean days per month).</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">2.6 Conversion of continuous to binary outcome measures</HEADING><P>Where possible, efforts were made to convert outcome measures to dichotomous data. This could be done by identifying cut-off points on rating scales and dividing participants accordingly into 'clinically improved' or 'not clinically improved'. It was generally assumed that if there had been a 50% reduction in a scale-derived score such as the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS, <LINK REF="REF-Overall-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1962</LINK>) or the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS, <LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>), this could be considered as a clinically significant response (<LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005b</LINK>).

We used the criteria summarised in Table 8.5.c of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2011</LINK>) to make judgements, and recorded these assessments in the standard 'risk of bias' tables in RevMan 5 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>). For the domains of blinding or masking and for incomplete outcome reporting, we assessed the risk of bias separately for subjectively reported and for objectively ascertained outcomes. We presented these evaluations in the 'risk of bias' summary figure (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>), and risk of bias summary graph (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>) and discussed them further in the results section under <LINK TAG="STUDY_QUALITY" TYPE="SECTION">Risk of bias in included studies</LINK>. We incorporated these judgements in assessing limitations in study design for critical and important outcomes in the <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK></P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Measures of treatment effect</HEADING><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Binary data</HEADING><P>For binary outcomes we calculated a standard estimation of the risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). It has been shown that RR is more intuitive (<LINK REF="REF-Boissel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boissel 1999</LINK>) than odds ratios and that odds ratios tend to be interpreted as RR by clinicians (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2000</LINK>). For statistically significant results we had planned to calculate the number needed to treat to provide benefit/to induce harm statistic (NNTB/H), and its 95% confidence interval (CI) using Visual Rx (http://www.nntonline.net/) taking account of the event rate in the control group. This, however, was superseded by the <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> and the estimates therein.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Continuous data</HEADING><P>For continuous outcomes we estimated mean difference (MD) between groups. We preferred not to calculate effect size measures (standardised mean difference (SMD)). However, had different scales with similar characteristics been used to measure the same outcome for comparisons, we would have calculated the SMD and transformed the weighted, pooled effect back to the units of one (or more) of the specific and familiar instruments.</P></SUBSECTION></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Unit of analysis issues</HEADING><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Cluster trials</HEADING><P>Studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Firstly, authors often fail to account for intra-class correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) whereby P values are spuriously low, CIs unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This causes type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>).</P><P>If any of the included trials had randomised participants by clusters, and if the results were adjusted for clustering, we combined the adjusted measures of effects of these cluster-randomised trials with parallel group RCTs using the generic inverse variance technique. If results had not adjusted for clustering, we would have attempted to adjust the results by multiplying the standard errors of the estimates by the square root of the design effect (where the design effect is calculated as D<SUB>Eff </SUB>= 1 + (M - 1) ICC, where M is the average cluster size and ICC is the intra-cluster coefficient) (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC was not reported nor available from the authors, we assumed it to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>).</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Cross-over trials</HEADING><P>A major concern of cross-over trials is the carry-over effect. It occurs if an effect (e.g. pharmacological, physiological or psychological) of the treatment in the first phase is carried over to the second phase. As a consequence on entry to the second phase the participants can differ systematically from their initial state despite a wash-out phase. For the same reason cross-over trials are not appropriate if the condition of interest is unstable (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). As both effects are very likely in severe mental illness, we only use data of the first phase of cross-over studies.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Studies with multiple treatment groups</HEADING><P>Where a study involved more than two treatment arms, if relevant, we have presented the additional treatment arms in comparisons. If data were binary we have simply added these added and combined within the two-by-two table. If data were continuous we combined data following the formula in section <A HREF="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=s11gCx4LS_EC&amp;pg=PT199&amp;lpg=PT199&amp;dq=7.7.3.8+combining+groups&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FePxt5qxZI&amp;sig=8u2Dow36cB41x1tXqtfubVlBFVk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2IKXTOsylryMB-WIwekF&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=7.7.3.8%20combining%20groups&amp;f=false">7.7.3.8</A> (Combining groups) of the Cochrane <I>Handbook</I>. Where the additional treatment arms were not relevant, we have not reproduced these data.</P></SUBSECTION></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Dealing with missing data</HEADING><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Overall loss of credibility</HEADING><P>At some degree of loss of follow-up, data must lose credibility (<LINK REF="REF-Xia-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xia 2007</LINK>). For any particular outcome should more than 20% of data be unaccounted for, we did not reproduce these data or use them within analyses. If, however, more than 20% of those in one arm of a study were lost, but the total loss was less than 20%, we marked such data with (*) to indicate that such a result may well be prone to bias.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Binary outcomes</HEADING><P>We extracted data to allow an intention-to-treat analysis in which all randomised participants were analysed in the groups to which they were originally assigned. If there was a discrepancy in the number randomised and the numbers analysed in each treatment group, we calculated the percentage loss to follow-up in each group and reported this information. We sought supplementary information from trial authors such as intention to treat and per-protocol analyses data-set, or a participant flow diagram in a sufficiently detailed manner as to facilitate data retrieval. If unexplained dropouts exceeded 20% in either group, we would have assigned the same proportion of those with the worst outcome to those lost to follow-up for dichotomous outcomes (except for mortality and adverse effects) as for those who completed the study, and assessed the impact of this in sensitivity analyses with the results of completers.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Continuous outcomes</HEADING><P>For continuous outcomes, if provided and where possible, we calculated missing standard deviations from other available data such as standard errors, P, T or F values as detailed in <LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2011</LINK>. If this was not possible, we calculated the SDs according to a validated imputation method that is based on the SDs of the other included studies (<LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2006</LINK>). We examined the validity of the imputations in a sensitivity analysis excluding imputed values.</P><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">3.1 Last observation carried forward</HEADING><P>We preferred not to make any assumptions about loss to follow-up for continuous data and analysed results for those who completed the trial, since the use of methods such as the last observation carried forward (LOCF) introduce uncertainty about the reliability of the result (<LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2007</LINK>). If LOCF data had been used in included trials, we reproduced these data and indicated that they were the result of LOCF assumptions.</P></SUBSECTION></SUBSECTION></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of heterogeneity</HEADING><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Clinical heterogeneity</HEADING><P>We considered all included studies initially, without seeing comparison data, to judge clinical heterogeneity. We simply inspected all studies for clearly outlying situations or people which we had not predicted would arise. When such situations or participant groups arose, we have discussed these fully.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Methodological heterogeneity</HEADING><P>We considered all included studies initially, without seeing comparison data, to judge methodological heterogeneity. We simply inspected all studies for clearly outlying methods which we had not predicted would arise. When such methodological outliers arose we have discussed these fully.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Statistical heterogeneity</HEADING><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">3.1 Visual inspection</HEADING><P>We visually inspected the forest plots to evaluate the possibility of heterogeneity of intervention effects across trials as evidenced by outlying trials with non-overlapping confidence intervals. We also noted differences in the direction of effect estimates across trials.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">3.2 Employing the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic</HEADING><P>We attempted to assess if significant heterogeneity was present using the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test for homogeneity at a 10% level of significance. We used the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic to quantify inconsistency (the percentage of the variability in effect estimates that is due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error) (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). The importance of the observed value of I<SUP>2 </SUP>depends on i. magnitude and direction of effects and ii. strength of evidence for heterogeneity (e.g. P value from Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test, or a CI for I<SUP>2</SUP>). In general we interpreted I<SUP>2 </SUP>estimates greater than or equal to 50% accompanied by a statistically significant Chi<SUP>2</SUP> statistic, as evidence of substantial levels of heterogeneity, although we acknowledge that values of I<SUP>2</SUP> ranging from 30% to 60% may also indicate substantial heterogeneity (Section 9.5.2 - <LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2011</LINK>). When we found substantial levels of heterogeneity in the primary outcome, we explored reasons for heterogeneity (<LINK TAG="SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS" TYPE="SECTION">Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</LINK>). If severe heterogeneity was present (I<SUP>2 </SUP>&gt; = 75%) and could not be explained by differences across the trials in terms of clinical or methodological features or by subgroup analyses (see below), we would not have combined the trials in a meta-analysis, but presented the results in a forest plot.</P></SUBSECTION></SUBSECTION></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of reporting biases</HEADING><P>Reporting biases arise when the dissemination of research findings is influenced by the nature and direction of results (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>). These are described in Section 10 of the Cochrane <I>Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2011</LINK>). We are aware that funnel plots may be useful in investigating reporting biases but are of limited power to detect small-study effects. We did not use funnel plots for outcomes where there were 10 or fewer studies, or where all studies were of similar sizes. In other cases, where funnel plots were possible, we sought statistical advice in their interpretation.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Data synthesis</HEADING><P>We understand that there is no closed argument for preference for use of fixed-effect or random-effects models. The random-effects method incorporates an assumption that the different studies are estimating different, yet related, intervention effects. This often seems to be true to us and the random-effects model takes into account differences between studies even if there is no statistically significant heterogeneity. There is, however, a disadvantage to the random-effects model. It puts added weight onto small studies which often are the most biased ones. Depending on the direction of effect, these studies can either inflate or deflate the effect size. Therefore, we chose the fixed-effect model for all analyses. If the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic indicated substantial heterogeneity (values 50% or greater), we presented the results using fixed-effect and random-effects meta-analysis and assessed the impact of both models on the direction and precision of the effect estimate.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</HEADING><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Subgroup analyses</HEADING><P>We anticipated one sub-group analysis to test the hypothesis that the use of vitamin E is most effective for those with early onset TD (less than five years). We had hoped to present data for this subgroup for the primary outcomes.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Investigation of heterogeneity</HEADING><P>In the presence of substantial heterogeneity, we had hoped to undertake one pre-stated subgroup analysis for the primary outcomes in this review to test the hypothesis that vitamin E is more effective for those with an onset of TD within five years.</P><P>We also explored the possibility that unanticipated clinical or methodological differences contributed to significant statistical heterogeneity by removing trials with these characteristics from the meta-analysis, to assess if this reduced the I<SUP>2 </SUP>estimate to below 50%. If substantial heterogeneity was reduced, we reported this but presented the forest plot with the data from these trials as well. We stated hypothesis regarding these in the discussion and hoped to evaluate them more fully in future versions of the review.</P><P>When unanticipated clinical or methodological heterogeneity were obvious, we simply stated hypotheses regarding these for future reviews or versions of this review. We did not anticipate undertaking analyses relating to these.</P></SUBSECTION></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analysis</HEADING><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Implication of randomisation</HEADING><P>We aimed to include trials in a sensitivity analysis if they were described in some way as to imply randomisation. For the primary outcomes we included these studies and if there was no substantive difference when the implied randomised studies were added to those with better description of randomisation, then we employed all data from these studies.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Assumptions for lost binary data</HEADING><P>Where assumptions had to be made regarding people lost to follow-up (see <LINK TAG="MISSING_DATA" TYPE="SECTION">Dealing with missing data</LINK>), we compared the findings of the primary outcomes when we used our assumption compared with completer data only. If there was a substantial difference, we have reported results and discussed them, but continue to employ our assumption.</P><P>Where assumptions had to be made regarding missing SDs data (see <LINK TAG="MISSING_DATA" TYPE="SECTION">Dealing with missing data</LINK>), we compared the findings on primary outcomes when we used our assumption compared with complete data only. We undertook a sensitivity analysis testing how prone results were to change when 'complete' data only were compared to the imputed data using the above assumption. If there was a substantial difference, we have reported results and discussed them, but continue to employ our assumption.</P></SUBSECTION></SUBSECTION></APPENDIX_BODY></APPENDIX></APPENDICES><EXTENSIONS><EXTENSION ID="FLOW_5" NAME="FIGURE" REVMAN_VERSION="5.1.0" TYPE="FLOWCHART"><ALIAS ALIAS_ID="5"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;13 studies included in quantitative synthesis (meta-analysis)&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="120"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;13 studies (22 references) included in qualitative synthesis&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="120"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;35 full-text articles assessed for eligibility&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="120"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;712 records screened&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="120"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;712 records after duplicates removed&lt;/p&gt;"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;704 records identified through database searching up to 2017&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="120"/><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;No additional records identified through other sources&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="120"/><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;8 records found in database searching 2017&lt;/p&gt;"/></FLOWCHARTBOX><OUT TEXT="&lt;p&gt;677 records excluded&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="120"/></FLOWCHARTBOX><OUT TEXT="&lt;p&gt;8 studies (11 full-text articles) excluded, with reasons&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 ongoing study&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 study awaiting classification&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="120"/></FLOWCHARTBOX></FLOWCHARTBOX></FLOWCHARTBOX></ALIAS></EXTENSION></EXTENSIONS></COCHRANE_REVIEW>
