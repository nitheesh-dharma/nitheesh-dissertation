<P>Malaria is a parasitic disease, spread by mosquitoes. It affects millions of people worldwide, and causes significant illness and mortality. Uncomplicated malaria presents with symptoms such as fever, headache, muscle pain, and vomiting. The parasite has become resistant to a number of previously effective drugs, and so combinations of drugs are used to try increase cure and to prevent further resistance. Artemether-lumefantrine is one such drug combination. This review of trials showed that the six-dose regimen of artemether-lumefantrine was associated with high cure rates and was more effective that most other drug combinations used for uncomplicated malaria. Further research is needed to properly assess adverse outcomes.</P>

<P>The World Health Organization recommends artemether-lumefantrine for treating uncomplicated malaria. We sought evidence of superiority of the six-dose regimen over existing treatment regimens as well as its effectiveness in clinical situations.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate the six-dose regimen of artemether-lumefantrine for treating uncomplicated falciparum malaria.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register (April 2005), CENTRAL (<I>The Cochrane Library 2005, </I>Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to April 2005), EMBASE (1974 to April 2005), LILACS (1982 to April 2005), conference proceedings, and reference lists of articles. We also contacted experts in malaria research and the pharmaceutical company that manufactures artemether-lumefantrine.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomized controlled trials comparing six doses of artemether-lumefantrine administered orally with standard treatment regimens (single drug or combination), or supervised with unsupervised treatment, for uncomplicated falciparum malaria.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-08-11 16:59:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two authors independently applied inclusion criteria to potentially relevant trials, assessed the risk of bias in the trials, and extracted data, including adverse events. Total failure by day 28 (day 42 for sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and day 63 for mefloquine) was the primary outcome.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Nine trials (4547 participants) tested the six-dose regimen. Total failure at day 28 for artemether-lumefantrine was lower when compared with amodiaquine (270 participants, 1 trial), amodiaquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (507 participants, 1 trial), but not with chloroquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (201 participants, 2 trials). In comparisons with artemisinin derivative combinations, artemether-lumefantrine performed better than amodiaquine plus artesunate (668 participants, 2 trials), worse than mefloquine plus artesunate (270 participants, 4 trials), and no differently to dihydroartemisinin-napthoquine-trimethoprim (89 participants, 1 trial).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The six-dose regimen of artemether-lumefantrine appears more effective than antimalarial regimens not containing artemisinin derivatives.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-08-11 16:36:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Malaria</HEADING>
<P>Malaria is a major health problem with at least 300 to 500 million people diagnosed with the illness every year (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2000a</LINK>). The main cause is <I>Plasmodium falciparum</I>, one of the four species of malaria parasites found in humans. Uncomplicated malaria occurs in the majority of those affected, and is the form of the illness which presents with such symptoms as fever, headache, muscle pain (myalgia), vomiting, mild diarrhoea, anaemia, and enlarged spleen (splenomegaly). In addition, children commonly present with rapid breathing (tachypnoea), cough, and convulsions.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Antimalarial drug resistance</HEADING>
<P>Resistance to antimalarial drugs emerged in South-East Asia and South America (<LINK REF="REF-White-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 1999a</LINK>), and then spread to Africa and western Oceania. Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine has replaced chloroquine as the first-line treatment in some African countries (such as Malawi and Kenya), but resistance to this is now also emerging (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2000a</LINK>). Resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine is relatively common in South-East Asia (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2001b</LINK>), where resistance and declining sensitivity to mefloquine have also been reported (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2000a</LINK>). Mefloquine is contraindicated in areas of intensive malaria transmission, such as sub-Saharan Africa, because its long half life may expose parasites to subcurative doses, which could result in the development of resistant strains (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2000a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Artemisinin drugs, including artemether and artesunate, are now used as first-line treatment in some countries in South-East Asia, but they are recommended only as combination treatment (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2000a</LINK>). Such combination therapy affords rapid clinical response and higher cure rates when compared with other antimalarial combinations (<LINK REF="REF-White-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 1999a</LINK>). It is also thought combination therapy may slow the parasite developing resistance to the drug (<LINK REF="REF-White-1999b" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 1999b</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Artemether-lumefantrine combination</HEADING>
<P>The fixed-dose combination of artemether-lumefantrine, called co-artemether, contains 20 mg of artemether and 120 mg of lumefantrine (previously called benflumetol). It was initially developed by scientists at the Academy of Military Medical Sciences in China before the pharmaceutical company Novartis (Switzerland) became a partner and was licensed to market it as Coartem® or Riamet®. This oral preparation has been designed for use against chloroquine-resistant falciparum malaria. Artemether has a rapid onset of action and is rapidly eliminated from the plasma (half life of two to three hours; <LINK REF="REF-Lef_x00e8_vre-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lefèvre 1999</LINK>). Lumefantrine is cleared more slowly and has a longer elimination half life (approximately 4.5 days; <LINK REF="REF-Ezzet-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ezzet 1998</LINK>). The rationale behind this combination is that artemether initially provides rapid symptomatic relief by reducing the number of parasites present before lumefantrine eliminates any residual parasites. This is thought to minimize development of resistance because the malaria parasites are never exposed to artemether alone (due to its rapid elimination). Although they may be exposed to lumefantrine alone, the probability of resistance developing simultaneously to both drugs used in combination is thought to be low (<LINK REF="REF-Bloland-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bloland 2000</LINK>). Artemether-lumefantrine also reduces gametocyte carriage and thus should have an impact on malaria transmission (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Vugt-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Vugt 1998a</LINK>).</P>
<P>There has been some concern about the possible risk of neurotoxicity with artemisinin derivatives that arose from animal studies using high doses of lipid-soluble preparations given intramuscularly (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1999</LINK>). No serious adverse or persistent neurotoxic adverse events have been documented (<LINK REF="REF-Novartis-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Novartis 2005</LINK>). There has been concern that the lumefantrine component could have adverse cardiac effects due to its similar structure to halofantrine (<LINK REF="REF-Bindschedler-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bindschedler 2000</LINK>). Artemether-lumefantrine causes minimal QTc prolongation which was not associated with adverse clinical cardiac events (<LINK REF="REF-Novartis-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Novartis 2005</LINK>). These potential adverse effects have to be considered when assessing the drug combination.</P>
<P>Artemether-lumefantrine has been added to the WHO Model list of Essential Medicines and is being promoted in Africa as first-line treatment for malaria by the World Health Organization. The World Health Organization has commended the company for providing the drug at discounted prices for developing countries in malaria endemic areas ( <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2001a</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Rationale for review</HEADING>
<P>Since the first Cochrane Review on artemether-lumefantrine was published (<LINK REF="REF-Omari-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Omari 2002</LINK>), the six-dose regimen has become the standard, as researchers acknowledged the review findings that the four-dose regimen was associated with treatment failures (<LINK REF="REF-Nosten-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nosten 2003</LINK>). Trials are generally using the six-dose regimen, with the evidence for the four-dose regimen maintained in a separate Cochrane Review (<LINK REF="REF-Omari-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Omari 2006</LINK>). This review aims to summarize the existing evidence of the six-dose regimen of artemether-lumefantrine and how it compares with other antimalarial drugs for treating uncomplicated falciparum malaria, including mefloquine, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, and chloroquine.</P>
<P>For our endpoint, we use total failure by day 28 as the primary outcome measure, or day 42 for sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and day 63 for mefloquine because of their long half lives. In areas where malaria transmission is intense, recurrence of parasites by day 28 could also be due to reinfection, so we also examine the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) which is thought to distinguish between a new infection and recurrence of malaria (recrudescence) due to drug resistance.</P>

We assessed the inclusion of all randomized participants in the main effectiveness analysis to be adequate if more than 90% were included in the analysis, inadequate if 90% or less, or unclear.</P>
</QUALITY_ASSESSMENT>
<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2008-10-05 11:39:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We compared the drug with non-artemisinin derivative regimens, other artemisinin regimens, and then other comparisons that examined delivery. Adverse events from all trials were reported together. We analysed data using <LINK REF="REF-Review-Manager-5" TYPE="REFERENCE">Review Manager 5</LINK>. We compared outcome measures for dichotomous data using risk ratio (RR), which is the risk of achieving an outcome in the artemether-lumefantrine group relative to that in the control group. We used total failure (clinical or parasitological failure by day 28) as our main outcome, and we also conducted analysis excluding reinfection where PCR data were available. As the value of the risk ratio is constrained to lie between 0 and 1/CGER (control group event rate), large values of the risk ratio are impossible when events are common, so failure is preferred to treatment success. We would consider the DerSimonian Laird random-effects model if there was significant heterogeneity.</P>
<P>We intend to explore the following potential sources of heterogeneity using subgroup analyses or meta-regression: participant age (under five years versus five years or more); trial setting (high malaria transmission versus low transmission); and the presence of drug resistance to comparator drug, as new trials become available. Additional trials may allow sensitivity analyses according to blinding, allocation concealment, and whether the trials used an intention-to-treat analysis at a future date.</P>
<P>In determining the effectiveness of antimalarial treatment, we intended to extract the results of analyses conducted according to the intention-to-treat principle. This approach is considered to be more pragmatic as it attempts to estimate the effectiveness of the treatment in routine practice rather than in the context of a clinical trial. To allow the intention-to-treat principle to be applied, all participants should be followed for the duration of the trial irrespective of whether or not the treatment course was completed or other protocol deviations. Any reason for dropping out of the trial or being excluded from the trial should be documented (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>For total failure with trials that had conducted PCR analysis, we classified the infections into: recrudescent infection (matching genotypes on day 0 and day of recurrence); new infection (different genotypes on day 0 and day of recurrence); and missing values. We intended to conduct a sensitivity analysis around PCR examining the effect of missing data, but there were too few trials for us to do this.</P>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Concealment of allocation</HEADING>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Blinding</HEADING>
<P>One trial was single blind in which all staff apart from those in recruiting clinic and field assistants were not aware of the treatment group. The remaining eight trials were described as open.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Inclusion of randomized participants in the analysis</HEADING>
<P>None of the nine trials had complete data for all participants randomized into the trial for the duration of follow up. This was partly because researchers stopped follow up after a participant withdrew. Therefore an intention-to-treat analysis was not possible for the trial investigators or for this review because data necessary for an intention-to-treat analysis were not collected. All trials gave results of analyses based on evaluable participants, that is, participants still on treatment at each time point. Three of the trials, however, also claimed to have reported cure rates as an 'intention-to-treat' analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Lefevre-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lefevre 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mayxay-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mayxay 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sutherland-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sutherland 2005</LINK>) These are not the results of an intention-to-treat analysis, and differed from their evaluable participants analysis by assuming that all participants withdrawn from treatment or lost to follow up still had parasitaemia at all remaining time points. At the end of follow up, the number of participants evaluable for the primary outcome was greater than 90% in six trials and 85% to 90% in three trials .</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-10-06 08:41:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Trial methods</HEADING>
<P>The risk of bias in several of the included trials was below average given current standards. Seven of the nine trials did not describe the method used to generate the allocation sequence and three did not describe how allocation was concealed. In seven trials, 90% or more of the participants were included in the final analysis for the reported primary outcome. The 'intention-to-treat' analysis for the primary outcome reported in five trials was actually a limited form of sensitivity analysis because they made the assumption that all participants lost to follow up were treatment failures. As results were not based on an intention-to-treat analysis, they are subject to attrition bias and the clinical effectiveness may be biased.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">PCR analysis</HEADING>
<P>Data for failure by day 14 and day 28 were corrected for new infections with missing samples or failed tests classified as treatment failures. This had a minimal effect for mefloquine plus artesunate and the result remained statistically insignificant in favour of mefloquine artesunate. Although PCR results were reported in seven trials, results from different groups were combined making it difficult to draw any valid conclusions and PCR data were not reported on all treatment failures.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Non-artemisinin therapies</HEADING>
<P>The results of a Cochrane Review of the four-dose regimen showed that it was often less effective than other standard treatment regimens (<LINK REF="REF-Omari-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Omari 2006</LINK>). The review included a trial comparing four-dose and six-dose regimens, and the six-dose regimen had fewer treatment failures, and this was statistically significant.</P>
<P>The six-dose regimen of artemether-lumefantrine performed better than amodiaquine and amodiaquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. Total failure was lower with artemether-lumefantrine compared with chloroquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine in two trials, but this was not statistically significant. Background resistance to chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine in both trial areas could have affected the performance of the non-artemisinin combination. One of the trials, <LINK REF="STD-Sutherland-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sutherland 2005</LINK>, did not report outcomes on day 42, which would have been more informative due to the long half life of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine.</P>
<P>Parasite and fever clearance times were shorter for artemether-lumefantrine when compared with chloroquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, which suggests that clinical symptoms may resolve faster.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Artemisinin combination therapies</HEADING>
<P>In comparisons with other artemisinin-combination therapies, fewer participants failed treatment with artemether-lumefantrine compared with amodiaquine plus artesunate. However, the combination of mefloquine and artesunate was more effective at reducing parasitological failure on days 28 and 42. None of the trials reported outcomes on day 63 despite the long half life of mefloquine. There was no difference in parasitological failures between artemether-lumefantrine and dihydroartemisinin-napthoquine-trimethoprim, but the trial may have been too small (130 participants) to detect any statistically significant difference.</P>
<P>There was no difference in the parasite, fever, and gametocyte clearance times in comparisons with mefloquine plus artesunate and dihydroartemisinin-napthoquine-trimethoprim. This is not surprising due to the artemisinin component in both therapies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Supervised versus unsupervised treatment</HEADING>
<P>Artemether-lumefantrine given without supervision (which is normal clinical practice) showed no difference in the failure rate compared with supervised delivery.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Clearance times</HEADING>
<P>Trials reported clearance times as medians, percentiles, and means. It would have been more informative reporting these as time-to-event analyses, as data on participants who did not reach the event would have been included in the analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Adverse events</HEADING>
<P>In some trials where adverse events were reported, no distinction was made between the treatment groups thereby making comparisons impossible. Although some trials reported adverse cardiac events, the evidence was insufficient to address concerns about the possible risk of cardiotoxicity. We, therefore, cannot justifiably comment on adverse events reported apart from reporting the details.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The six-dose regimen of artemether-lumefantrine is associated with fewer failures and may be a suitable alternative to amodiaquine, amodiaquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, and amodiaquine plus artesunate. Available data suggest that mefloquine plus artesunate is as effective and possibly superior to artemether-lumefantrine. </P>
<P>The comparative effectiveness of artemether-lumefantrine was evaluated in a health service setting and the cure rates with unsupervised administration are acceptable.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Trials should be of high quality, with careful attention to concealment of allocation. All participants should be followed up for the duration of the trial regardless of withdrawal from treatment or other protocol violations as this would permit an intention-to-treat analysis. Reasons for all treatment withdrawals should be documented. </P>
<P>Where possible, PCR analysis data should be reported on all treatment failures; if this is not possible, explanations should be given. Results from different groups should be reported separately.</P>
