<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-07-14 11:13:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Question</B>
</P>
<P>We wanted to compare the safety and efficacy of clot-dissolving (thrombolytic) drugs versus placebo or no treatment in the early stages of ischaemic stroke to see if clot-dissolving drugs improve outcome after stroke.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Most strokes are due to blockage of an artery in the brain by a blood clot. Prompt treatment with clot-dissolving (thrombolytic) drugs can restore blood flow before major brain damage has occurred and could mean that people are more likely to make a good recovery from their stroke. Thrombolytic drugs can also, however, cause serious bleeding in the brain, which can be fatal. Thrombolytic therapy has now been evaluated in many randomised trials in acute ischaemic stroke. The thrombolytic drug alteplase has been licensed for use within three hours of stroke in the USA and Canada, and within 4.5 hours in most European countries. The numbers of people receiving this treatment successively are increasing.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We identified 27 trials with a total of 10,187 participants in searches conducted up to November 2013. Most data come from trials testing one drug (recombinant tissue Plasminogen Activator, rt-PA) given into a vein up to six hours after acute ischaemic stroke, but several other drugs were also tested and at different times to treatment after stroke and given into an artery in the brain rather than into a vein in the arm. All trials compared a clot-dissolving drug with a placebo (control) group. Most trials included participants with moderate to severe stroke. All trials took place in hospitals that were used to treating people with stroke. Differences between trials mean that not all trials contribute information to all outcomes, but we have used all available data. Most trials included participants after a computed tomography (CT) brain scan had excluded a brain haemorrhage as the cause of symptoms (a few trials used magnetic resonance brain scanning instead).</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>There is general agreement between the earlier trials and the one recent trial added in this update (IST-3) for all main outcomes, and between the 12 trials that tested rt-PA and the 15 trials that tested other clot-dissolving drugs. The main difference between IST-3 and earlier trials was that IST-3 had many participants above 80 years. Clot-dissolving treatment can reduce the risk of long-term dependency on others for daily activities, in spite of there being an increased risk of bleeding in the brain which also increased the risk of early death. Once the early bleeding risk had passed, at three or six months after stroke, people given clot-dissolving drugs were more likely to have recovered from their stroke and to be independent, especially if they had been treated within the first three hours after stroke. Older people benefited as much as younger people. Giving aspirin at the same time as clot-busting drugs increased the risk of bleeding and should be avoided. Further analyses of individual patient data factors such as findings on brain scanning before treatment, and of different ways of giving the treatment, may give more information than the summary data that we used here. Meantime, people who think that they are experiencing a stroke should get to hospital quickly, be assessed by a stroke doctor, have a brain scan and receive clot-dissolving treatment as fast as possible. They should not hesitate by thinking that they will be 'too old' for treatment. The treatment is very effective if started within three hours of stroke and definitely improves outcome if given up to 4.5 hours after stroke, but later than that the effects are less clear and are still being tested in trials. More information is needed from trials in people with mild stroke to see if the benefit of clot-dissolving drugs outweighs the risk of haemorrhage.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence comes mostly from well-conducted randomised trials run by stroke experts. Some trials (8/27) were run by companies that make the clot-dissolving drugs, but most trials (19/27, including most participants) were funded by Government or charity sources independently of drug companies. These results apply to a wide range of people with a wide range of severities of stroke and other medical conditions.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-07-14 11:10:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Most strokes are due to blockage of an artery in the brain by a blood clot. Prompt treatment with thrombolytic drugs can restore blood flow before major brain damage has occurred and improve recovery after stroke in some people. Thrombolytic drugs, however, can also cause serious bleeding in the brain, which can be fatal. One drug, recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA), is licensed for use in selected patients within 4.5 hours of stroke in Europe and within three hours in the USA. There is an upper age limit of 80 years in some countries, and a limitation to mainly non-severe stroke in others. Forty per cent more data are available since this review was last updated in 2009.</P>

<P>We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched November 2013), MEDLINE (1966 to November 2013) and EMBASE (1980 to November 2013). We also handsearched conference proceedings and journals, searched reference lists and contacted pharmaceutical companies and trialists.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-04-06 21:17:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Two review authors applied the inclusion criteria, extracted data and assessed trial quality. We verified the extracted data with investigators of all major trials, obtaining additional unpublished data if available.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-07-24 21:37:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 27 trials, involving 10,187 participants, testing urokinase, streptokinase, rt-PA, recombinant pro-urokinase or desmoteplase. Four trials used intra-arterial administration, while the rest used the intravenous route. Most data come from trials that started treatment up to six hours after stroke. About 44% of the trials (about 70% of the participants) were testing intravenous rt-PA. In earlier studies very few of the participants (0.5%) were aged over 80 years; in this update, 16% of participants are over 80 years of age due to the inclusion of IST-3 (53% of participants in this trial were aged over 80 years). Trials published more recently utilised computerised randomisation, so there are less likely to be baseline imbalances than in previous versions of the review. More than 50% of trials fulfilled criteria for high-grade concealment; there were few losses to follow-up for the main outcomes.</P>
<P>Thrombolytic therapy, mostly administered up to six hours after ischaemic stroke, significantly reduced the proportion of participants who were dead or dependent (modified Rankin 3 to 6) at three to six months after stroke (odds ratio (OR) 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 0.93). Thrombolytic therapy increased the risk of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (OR 3.75, 95% CI 3.11 to 4.51), early death (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.44 to 1.98; 13 trials, 7458 participants) and death by three to six months after stroke (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.30). Early death after thrombolysis was mostly attributable to intracranial haemorrhage. Treatment within three hours of stroke was more effective in reducing death or dependency (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.79) without any increase in death (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.21; 11 trials, 2187 participants). There was heterogeneity between the trials. Contemporaneous antithrombotic drugs increased the risk of death. Trials testing rt-PA showed a significant reduction in death or dependency with treatment up to six hours (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.93, P = 0.0006; 8 trials, 6729 participants) with significant heterogeneity; treatment within three hours was more beneficial (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.80, P &lt; 0.0001; 6 trials, 1779 participants) without heterogeneity. Participants aged over 80 years benefited equally to those aged under 80 years, particularly if treated within three hours of stroke.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-07-14 11:12:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Thrombolytic therapy given up to six hours after stroke reduces the proportion of dead or dependent people. Those treated within the first three hours derive substantially more benefit than with later treatment. This overall benefit was apparent despite an increase in symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage, deaths at seven to 10 days, and deaths at final follow-up (except for trials testing rt-PA, which had no effect on death at final follow-up). Further trials are needed to identify the latest time window, whether people with mild stroke benefit from thrombolysis, to find ways of reducing symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage and deaths, and to identify the environment in which thrombolysis may best be given in routine practice.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-04-04 21:50:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Acute ischaemic stroke is a major cause of death and disability worldwide. Most strokes are due to blockage of an artery in the brain by a blood clot (ischaemic stroke) e.g. from the heart or neck arteries. </P>

<P>Thrombolytic drugs derive from naturally-occurring enzymes that dissolve thrombus as part of the natural clotting cascade.

<P>Clot-dissolving (thrombolytic) drugs may reduce brain damage from a stroke by restoring the blood flow if given rapidly enough after stroke, but may also cause serious bleeding in the brain.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-07-14 11:13:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>An overview of the literature on thrombolysis in acute ischaemic stroke in 1992 (<LINK REF="REF-Wardlaw-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wardlaw 1992</LINK>) identified six randomised trials of various thrombolytic drugs including a total of just 700 participants. A Cochrane review published in 1995 (<LINK REF="REF-Wardlaw-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wardlaw 1995</LINK>) updated the original 1992 review. It was updated again in 1999 (3478 participants in total) (<LINK REF="REF-Wardlaw-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wardlaw 1999</LINK>), in 2003 (5727 participants) (<LINK REF="REF-Wardlaw-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wardlaw 2003b</LINK>), in 2009 (7152 participants) (<LINK REF="REF-Wardlaw-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wardlaw 2009</LINK>) but even so, many essential questions remained unanswered: How big is the overall benefit? What is the latest time window in which the treatment is still beneficial? Which grades of stroke severity and which types of stroke, as judged clinically and on brain imaging, are more likely to respond favourably to treatment? Should people aged over 80 years receive thrombolysis? Which types of patients are most likely to be harmed by treatment, and which to benefit from it (e.g. with or without other major medical conditions like cardiac arrhythmias, diabetes, hypertension, or other disorders and concomitant medication) (<LINK REF="REF-Wardlaw-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wardlaw 2002</LINK>)? To answer these questions reliably, and in particular to be able to tailor treatment to the individual, more data are needed from new randomised controlled trials (RCTs).</P>
<P>Meanwhile, the thrombolytic drug alteplase (rt-PA) was licensed for use within three hours of stroke in the USA and Canada, and up to 4.5 hours in most European countries, and an increasing number of people now receive the treatment. Guidelines recommended that thrombolysis should be delivered by a clinical team with suitable training and experience and in a setting with appropriate facilities (<LINK REF="REF-ESO-Stroke-Guidelines-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESO Stroke Guidelines 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-Stroke-Guideline-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE Stroke Guideline 2008</LINK>). A general review of the use of thrombolytic therapy in clinical practice and the clinical service required to deliver it was provided in a book on the management of stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Warlow-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warlow 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>This updated review includes all trials completed and made public since 2009, as well as additional data published since 2009 from trials included in earlier versions of the review. The total number of participants is now 10,187, more than a 10-fold increase since the review was initiated in 1990 and an increase of more than 40% since 2009. Although many of the data now come from trials testing intravenous rt-PA within the first six hours after stroke onset, the more recent trials are exploring alternative methods for selecting participants and extending time windows, e.g. through use of advanced brain imaging. The upper age limit of 80 years, stroke severity and new imaging data are also analysed. This systematic review includes these data and provides a convenient and up-to-date summary of the evidence.</P>

We excluded trials that were not truly randomised, such as dose-range-finding studies, and trials that included thrombolytic treatment in the control group. We included trials in which the exact method of randomisation was unknown, even after correspondence with the authors, if the available information suggested that the randomisation was not likely to be biased.

<P>The primary outcome measures were death or dependency, as defined by modified Rankin score of 3 to 6, and death at the end of follow-up. We considered all other outcomes as secondary.</P>
<P>We assessed the following.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Deaths from all causes within the first seven to 10 days after treatment.</LI>
<LI>Symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (SICH): either symptomatic (that is, temporally associated with a deterioration in the person's neurological state), or fatal (that is, leading directly to death), and occurring within the first seven to 10 days. Note that symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage includes haemorrhagic transformation of the infarct, haemorrhage elsewhere in the brain remote from the infarct, and haemorrhage into the spaces surrounding the brain. Definitions of SICH vary between trials and therefore we have used the SICH data as defined by each trial's primary definition rather than attempting to standardise the definition.</LI>
<LI>Fatal intracranial haemorrhage.</LI>
<LI>Deaths within the first seven to 10 days not due to intracranial haemorrhage.</LI>
<LI>Symptomatic infarct swelling (oedema).</LI>
<LI>Deaths occurring between the end of the first seven to 10 days and three to six months.</LI>
<LI>Deaths from all causes during the whole trial follow-up period.</LI>
<LI>Poor functional outcome at the end of follow-up. This was the primary outcome measure for the review and was defined as death or dependency, measured by the modified Rankin or Barthel scales, at the end of the trial follow-up period. Poor functional outcome (the converse of good functional outcome) is the most clinically relevant and important measure of outcome, since the aim of treatment should be not merely to avoid death but also to decrease dependency among the survivors; that is, to increase the proportion of independent survivors and conversely to reduce the risk of survival with serious disability. Dependency in the present analysis was defined as a score of between 3 and 5 inclusive on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Some would prefer a definition of 'good outcome' (independence) including Rankin 0 and 1 only; therefore, wherever possible we sought data on the number of participants in each individual Rankin category so as to compare poor functional outcome defined as mRS 2 to 6 with the definition of 3 to 6. Where data were not available for mRS 3 to 6, we used mRS 2 to 6 instead, rather than excluding the trial from analysis.</LI>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2014-07-14 11:14:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our definition of SICH included people who died or deteriorated clinically as a result of intracranial haemorrhage. This could be either secondary bleeding into the infarct or new bleeding at an anatomically separate site elsewhere in the brain or its surrounding spaces after randomisation, confirmed by CT or MR scanning or post-mortem examination. We have defined 'early after the stroke' as within the first seven to 10 days, as the trials each tended to use a slightly different time point, but all had collected information on intracranial haemorrhage certainly within the first 10 days. Many symptomatic haemorrhages actually occurred within the first few days of the stroke. It is difficult to estimate the exact number of SICHs because some people died without a CT scan or post-mortem examination. Thus the true number with SICH may be higher than that suggested by these data. On the other hand, heightened awareness of an association between haemorrhagic transformation and thrombolysis may mean that the investigators too readily attributed any neurological deterioration following treatment to intracranial haemorrhage, even if the amount of blood was small. A review of published CT findings suggests that, at least for some trials, SICH included people with very large swollen and oedematous infarcts with trivial amounts of haemorrhage within them (<LINK REF="STD-ECASS-1995" TYPE="STUDY">ECASS 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NINDS-1995" TYPE="STUDY">NINDS 1995</LINK>). Therefore, it is also possible that the risk of intracranial haemorrhage has been overestimated (<LINK REF="REF-Von-Kummer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Von Kummer 2002</LINK>). The ECASS trial (<LINK REF="STD-ECASS-1995" TYPE="STUDY">ECASS 1995</LINK>) did not report the number with SICH, but whether the radiological appearance of the haemorrhage suggested haemorrhagic transformation of an infarct or parenchymatous haematoma (and its size). Most parenchymatous haemorrhages were associated with symptoms, so we used the number of participants with parenchymatous haematoma as the number with symptomatic haemorrhages.</P>

<P>We examined the effect of stroke severity, age under or over 80 years, time from stroke to treatment and the effect of having a large infarct on plain CT (ASPECT score 7 or less) on outcome after thrombolysis. We assessed the effect of time by several approaches: we examined the effect of time in all trials regardless of what time windows they contributed to, then in only those trials that contributed to all time windows, and then by latest time to randomisation. These approaches were used to maximise use of available data and minimise bias by excluding some trials from some analyses (e.g. the <LINK REF="STD-NINDS-1995" TYPE="STUDY">NINDS 1995</LINK> trial only recruited participants up to three hours and therefore would not contribute to an analysis comparing treatment administered within three hours with that administered between three and six hours, where inclusion was restricted to trials which included participants in both time windows). We used the proportion who died in the control group to estimate the severity of stroke. We assessed:</P>
<UL>
<LI>effect of time to treatment; the number of participants who had symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage, died or were dependent at the end of follow-up according to whether they had been treated within three hours of the stroke or later than three hours (in trials which randomised participants beyond three hours after the stroke);</LI>

This review includes all possible available information about all trials in an effort to provide as complete a record as possible of the available data on thrombolysis for acute ischaemic stroke. The NINDS trial (<LINK REF="STD-NINDS-1995" TYPE="STUDY">NINDS 1995</LINK>) was conducted in two consecutive parts, A and B, but published in one paper, so is included as one trial in this review. Although the USA Food and Drug Administration review of the primary analysis of the NINDS trial referred to an 'on-treatment' analysis, the analysis was actually 'intention-to-treat' as no participants who had been entered into the trial were excluded from that analysis (<LINK REF="STD-NINDS-1995" TYPE="STUDY">NINDS 1995</LINK>). Reasons for these comments and further analyses are provided in the Clinical Reviews submitted by Genentech to the USA Food and Drug administration in support of the license application for alteplase (<A HREF="http://www.fda.gov/cder/biologics/products/altegen061896.htm">www.fda.gov/cder/biologics/products/altegen061896.htm</A>; see Clinical Review 2, pages 18 to 20).</P>
<P>The trials performed in the 1980s (<LINK REF="STD-Abe-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Abe 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Atarashi-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Atarashi 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ohtomo-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Ohtomo 1985</LINK>) were methodologically different to the trials performed from the 1990s onwards. The 1980s trials used very low doses of thrombolytic drug, given daily intravenously for several days, and started up to five or 14 days after the stroke. The trials from the 1990s onwards used a single large dose of thrombolytic drug (in the region of 80 mg to 100 mg rt-PA or equivalent), given intravenously or intra-arterially, in most trials, within three, six, nine or 24 hours of the stroke. The 1980s trials did not collect data on functional outcome and therefore only the 1990s-onwards trials contribute to the analysis of death or dependency. All trials, however, contributed to analyses of intracranial haemorrhage and death by the end of follow-up (although very few deaths or intracranial haemorrhages occurred in the trials in the 1980s). However, it is possible to see in the figures what effect the exclusion of these early trials would have on the overall results.</P>
<P>The MAST-I trial (<LINK REF="STD-MAST_x002d_I-1995" TYPE="STUDY">MAST-I 1995</LINK>), which tested intravenous streptokinase and oral aspirin given within six hours of stroke onset in a two-by-two factorial design, is the only trial to have tested for an interaction between thrombolytic and antithrombotic drugs in a randomised trial; the comparison of streptokinase plus aspirin versus aspirin from <LINK REF="STD-MAST_x002d_I-1995" TYPE="STUDY">MAST-I 1995</LINK> is included in this review (separated from the <LINK REF="STD-MAST_x002d_I-1995" TYPE="STUDY">MAST-I 1995</LINK> data in the absence of aspirin) because it represents the only available randomised evidence on this important interaction. As there was a significant adverse interaction between streptokinase and aspirin, which we felt was important to highlight, the data for the participants receiving streptokinase in the presence or absence of aspirin are presented separately (that is, streptokinase versus control separate from streptokinase with aspirin versus aspirin). It would not be methodologically appropriate to exclude <LINK REF="STD-MAST_x002d_I-1995" TYPE="STUDY">MAST-I 1995</LINK> participants allocated aspirin because in most other trials, some antithrombotic agents were used, and while it is possible to identify the proportion of participants in the trial that received antithrombotic treatment, it is not possible to identify and then exclude the individual participants.</P>

This also occurred in another study (<LINK REF="STD-IST3-2012" TYPE="STUDY">IST3 2012</LINK>) where the primary six-month outcome originally reported is used, even if the 18-month follow-up, of a predefined vast majority of participating countries, has been subsequently reported.</P>
<P>Please note that because of the difficulty of blinding the biological effect of thrombolytic therapy, it is important to ensure that outcome assessment is blinded and objective. Follow-up should therefore be performed by individuals unaware of the trial treatment allocation either because they have not been involved in the administration of the trial treatment, or in the care of the participant during at least the first few days.

</UL>
<P>Some trials used more than one scale to measure outcome; for example, six studies (<LINK REF="STD-ATLANTIS-A-2000" TYPE="STUDY">ATLANTIS A 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ATLANTIS-B-1999" TYPE="STUDY">ATLANTIS B 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DEDAS-2006" TYPE="STUDY">DEDAS 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DIAS-2005" TYPE="STUDY">DIAS 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DIAS-2-2008" TYPE="STUDY">DIAS 2 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NINDS-1995" TYPE="STUDY">NINDS 1995</LINK>) favoured a 'Global Outcome Statistic' which involved collecting Barthel, Rankin, Glasgow Outcome Score and NIHSS scores individually and then combining the four scores. Three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Abe-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Abe 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Atarashi-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Atarashi 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ohtomo-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Ohtomo 1985</LINK>) used the 'Global Improvement Rating', which measures change in neurological status and safety outcome as a composite surrogate for functional outcome.</P>
<P>There are differences in the primary outcome measure used between trials, in that some used a 'poor functional outcome' and some used a 'good outcome'. The following trials sought 'dependency' (that is, whether the participant was dependent or not in activities of daily living) as a measure of poor functional outcome: two studies (<LINK REF="STD-MAST_x002d_E-1996" TYPE="STUDY">MAST-E 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MAST_x002d_I-1995" TYPE="STUDY">MAST-I 1995</LINK>) defined dependency as Rankin 3 or worse, and two studies (<LINK REF="STD-ASK-1996" TYPE="STUDY">ASK 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morris-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Morris 1995</LINK>) defined dependency as a Barthel score of 60 or worse. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-IST3-2012" TYPE="STUDY">IST3 2012</LINK>) 'alive and independent' (OHS 0 to 2; mRS 0 to 2) was the primary measure of outcome. The 'alive and favourable outcome' (mRS 0 to 1) and ordinal analysis were included in prespecified secondary outcome analyses.</P>
<P>Thirteen trials sought 'good functional outcome' (that is, whether the participant had made a complete or virtually complete recovery) defining 'good outcome' as mRS 0 or 1 (<LINK REF="STD-ATLANTIS-A-2000" TYPE="STUDY">ATLANTIS A 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ATLANTIS-B-1999" TYPE="STUDY">ATLANTIS B 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DEDAS-2006" TYPE="STUDY">DEDAS 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DIAS-2005" TYPE="STUDY">DIAS 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DIAS-2-2008" TYPE="STUDY">DIAS 2 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ECASS-1995" TYPE="STUDY">ECASS 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ECASS-II-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECASS II 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ECASS-3-2008" TYPE="STUDY">ECASS 3 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-EPITHET-2008" TYPE="STUDY">EPITHET 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MELT-2007" TYPE="STUDY">MELT 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NINDS-1995" TYPE="STUDY">NINDS 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>For most trials, it has been possible to obtain data on participants in each individual Rankin (or Barthel) group, or data dichotomised on Rankin 0 to 2 versus 3 to 6, or 0 to 1 versus 2 to 6, so that dependency in this review refers to Rankin, (mRS or OHS) 3 to 5 (6 being dead) unless otherwise stated. There are only two trials for which the number of participants in individual Rankin groups is not so far available (and therefore the data shown are for Rankin 2 or worse) (<LINK REF="STD-ATLANTIS-A-2000" TYPE="STUDY">ATLANTIS A 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PROACT-1998" TYPE="STUDY">PROACT 1998</LINK>).</P>

In one study (<LINK REF="STD-NINDS-1995" TYPE="STUDY">NINDS 1995</LINK>), the randomisation system, set up in an effort to reduce delays to treatment, led to 'out of order' trial treatment allocations in between 13 and 31 participants, which affected every subsequent participant until the error was detected, and led to participants appearing to cross between treatment allocations (more moved from rt-PA to placebo than the other way round). Also in the interests of reducing delays to trial treatment administration, there were some participants who ultimately were not entered into the study after the pharmacy had prepared the trial pack (and therefore some discarded trial packs).

<P>Five trials were single-blind without a placebo (<LINK REF="STD-AUST-2005" TYPE="STUDY">AUST 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MAST_x002d_I-1995" TYPE="STUDY">MAST-I 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MELT-2007" TYPE="STUDY">MELT 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PROACT-2-1999" TYPE="STUDY">PROACT 2 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2003</LINK>). In one trial (<LINK REF="STD-IST3-2012" TYPE="STUDY">IST3 2012</LINK>) the first 276 participants were treated in the double-blinded phase of the trial and all 2759 remaining participants were included into the open phase of the trial. All participants in the study, irrespective of study phase, were blindly assessed by postal mail or telephone by a blinded and trained observer. In <LINK REF="STD-PROACT-2-1999" TYPE="STUDY">PROACT 2 1999</LINK>, the control group underwent catheter placement but received no infusion. All the rest were double-blind placebo-controlled trials. However, it should also be noted that thrombolysis, due to its effects on the coagulation system at high doses, can be difficult to blind completely due to the obvious signs of bleeding (prolonged bleeding at venepuncture sites, easy bruising, gingival or conjunctival haemorrhages, etc). Thus, provision of an identical-appearing placebo (in the syringe) may not fully blind investigators to treatment allocation. Furthermore, as thrombolytic agents are proteins, they froth when shaken in solution with water or saline, rather like egg white mixed with water and shaken. Normal saline is therefore not an identical-looking placebo for a thrombolytic agent. Thus, in addition to the possibilities for failure of treatment allocation concealment inherent in the randomisation methods used as outlined above, it is possible that treatment allocation could be guessed accurately by the physicians caring for the participant in the acute phase because of these biological effects. Accordingly, methods for ensuring complete blinding of treatment allocation at late follow-up are crucial. Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-MAST_x002d_I-1995" TYPE="STUDY">MAST-I 1995</LINK>) used central telephone follow-up by a blinded trained observer. Although seven other trials specified that follow-up was to be by a physician not involved in the acute care of the participant, it is uncertain how completely this was achieved in practice. Other trials either did not specify who should do the follow-up, or did not make it mandatory that follow-up was by an independent physician, so in either case follow-up may have been carried out by the acute phase physician who could have been influenced by their knowledge of events in the acute phase.</P>

A strict intention-to-treat analysis was used in 18 studies (<LINK REF="STD-ASK-1996" TYPE="STUDY">ASK 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ATLANTIS-A-2000" TYPE="STUDY">ATLANTIS A 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ATLANTIS-B-1999" TYPE="STUDY">ATLANTIS B 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-AUST-2005" TYPE="STUDY">AUST 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DEDAS-2006" TYPE="STUDY">DEDAS 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DIAS-2005" TYPE="STUDY">DIAS 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DIAS-2-2008" TYPE="STUDY">DIAS 2 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ECASS-1995" TYPE="STUDY">ECASS 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ECASS-II-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECASS II 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ECASS-3-2008" TYPE="STUDY">ECASS 3 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-EPITHET-2008" TYPE="STUDY">EPITHET 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-IST3-2012" TYPE="STUDY">IST3 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MAST_x002d_E-1996" TYPE="STUDY">MAST-E 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MAST_x002d_I-1995" TYPE="STUDY">MAST-I 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MELT-2007" TYPE="STUDY">MELT 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PROACT-1998" TYPE="STUDY">PROACT 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PROACT-2-1999" TYPE="STUDY">PROACT 2 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2003</LINK>), but not in any of the earlier trials. The administrative problems with randomisation in one study (<LINK REF="STD-NINDS-1995" TYPE="STUDY">NINDS 1995</LINK>) led the FDA reviewer to describe the primary analysis as an 'on-treatment analysis'. However, the primary analysis was undertaken without excluding any participants entered into the trial and was, therefore, an intention-to-treat analysis (<A HREF="http://www.fda.gov/cber/products/altegen061896.htm">www.fda.gov/cber/products/altegen061896.htm</A>; <I>see</I> Clinical Review 2, page 20). For the earlier trials, with additional information from the principal investigators if necessary, we have attempted to find a final outcome for all randomised participants, rather than simply relying on the published data from which some randomised participants may have been excluded. Note that one trial (<LINK REF="STD-ECASS-1995" TYPE="STUDY">ECASS 1995</LINK>) was published as intention-to-treat and as a 'target population' after about 20% of the randomised participants had been excluded, but only the intention-to-treat data have been included here.</P>

The overall OR for all trials appears at the bottom of each plot. Note that one study (<LINK REF="STD-MAST_x002d_I-1995" TYPE="STUDY">MAST-I 1995</LINK>) appears twice in the analyses because the data in participants allocated aspirin have been entered separately from the participants allocated no aspirin. Also note that some outcomes have fewer trials contributing data than other outcomes. This is because not all trials collected data on all outcomes examined in this review, or if they did collect data on the particular outcome, it may not be available. If data were available for a particular outcome, then the trial appears listed in the relevant analysis. The 2012 systematic review and meta-analysis of rt-PA (<LINK REF="REF-Wardlaw-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wardlaw 2012</LINK>) conducted a comparison of the 11 earlier rt-PA studies (<LINK REF="STD-ATLANTIS-A-2000" TYPE="STUDY">ATLANTIS A 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ATLANTIS-B-1999" TYPE="STUDY">ATLANTIS B 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ECASS-1995" TYPE="STUDY">ECASS 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ECASS-3-2008" TYPE="STUDY">ECASS 3 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ECASS-II-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECASS II 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-EPITHET-2008" TYPE="STUDY">EPITHET 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haley-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Haley 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-JTSG-1993" TYPE="STUDY">JTSG 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mori-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Mori 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NINDS-1995" TYPE="STUDY">NINDS 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2003</LINK>) and <LINK REF="STD-IST3-2012" TYPE="STUDY">IST3 2012</LINK> on its own, and analysed the effect of adding IST-3 to the 11 earlier trials.

There was a significant excess of early deaths with thrombolysis: 11.5% of those allocated to thrombolytic therapy died compared with 7.4% of those allocated to control (OR 1.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.44 to 1.98, P &lt; 0.00001). In absolute terms, if confirmed, this is an increase of 40 (95% CI 30 to 55) early deaths per 1000 participants treated with thrombolysis.

<P>Data on early deaths were available for eight trials using intravenous rt-PA. The numerical (tabular) data on early deaths for the NINDS trial (<LINK REF="STD-NINDS-1995" TYPE="STUDY">NINDS 1995</LINK>) have not been published, but the NINDS trial did publish a survival curve which suggested that fewer deaths occurred in the rt-PA-treated participants from 24 hours after treatment onwards. The tabular data available from the other rt-PA trials showed a significant excess of early deaths: the OR was 1.44 (95% CI 1.18 to 1.76, P = 0.0003; 5535 participants) with no significant heterogeneity; the absolute effect was 25 more (95% CI 11 to 40 more) deaths per 1000 participants treated. In the three trials using streptokinase, there was also a significant excess of early deaths (OR 1.90, 95% CI 1.37 to 2.63; 963 participants).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Fatal intracranial haemorrhage within seven to 10 days</HEADING>
<P>Data were available from 17 trials on fatal intracranial haemorrhage (9066 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>).

This outcome may underestimate the frequency of intracranial haemorrhage since some of the participants who died without a post-mortem examination or CT scan may have died of intracranial haemorrhage. There was a significant, approximate six-fold increase in the rate of fatal intracranial haemorrhage with thrombolysis (4.19% of participants allocated to thrombolysis compared with 0.65% of those allocated to control, OR 4.53, 95% CI 3.47 to 5.91, P &lt; 0.00001).

<P>The combination of streptokinase with aspirin in one study (<LINK REF="STD-MAST_x002d_I-1995" TYPE="STUDY">MAST-I 1995</LINK>) significantly increased fatal intracranial haemorrhage (OR 4.56, 95% CI 1.62 to 12.84; 309 participants), and more participants died of cerebral causes without a CT scan or autopsy who may therefore also have had intracranial haemorrhage than in the group who received aspirin alone.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Deaths within the first seven to 10 days from causes other than fatal intracranial haemorrhage</HEADING>
<P>We calculated the effect of thrombolysis on death from causes other than fatal intracranial haemorrhage for the 10 trials that provided data on both early death and fatal intracranial haemorrhage (7226 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). Note that, unfortunately, this excludes several large trials (<LINK REF="STD-ATLANTIS-A-2000" TYPE="STUDY">ATLANTIS A 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ATLANTIS-B-1999" TYPE="STUDY">ATLANTIS B 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DEDAS-2006" TYPE="STUDY">DEDAS 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DIAS-2005" TYPE="STUDY">DIAS 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NINDS-1995" TYPE="STUDY">NINDS 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PROACT-1998" TYPE="STUDY">PROACT 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PROACT-2-1999" TYPE="STUDY">PROACT 2 1999</LINK>), which did not provide data on early death. There were 264/3752 (7.0%) non-intracranial haemorrhage deaths in the thrombolysis-treated participants and 234/3474 (6.7%) in the control participants (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.30, P = 0.39) with significant between-trial heterogeneity (I² = 53%, P = 0.02). In comparison with <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK> this suggests that most of the excess in early deaths of 42 per 1000 treated with thrombolysis is attributable to intracranial haemorrhage.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Symptomatic (including fatal) intracranial haemorrhage within seven to 10 days</HEADING>
<P>All trials provided data on intracranial haemorrhage and most provided them in a form that made it clear how many participants had suffered a neurological deterioration associated with the appearance of new haemorrhage in the brain on a CT or MR brain scan or at post-mortem examination (10,186 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). There was a highly significant four-fold increase in symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage with thrombolysis in 7.5% of those allocated to thrombolysis versus 1.7% of those allocated to control (OR 3.75, 95% CI 3.11 to 4.51, P &lt; 0.00001) with no statistically significant between-trial heterogeneity (P = 0.36). This represents an extra 60 (95% CI 50 to 65) symptomatic intracranial haemorrhages per 1000 participants treated.</P>
<P>In 12 trials using rt-PA, there were 60 (95% CI 50 to 70) extra symptomatic intracranial haemorrhages per 1000 participants treated (OR 3.72, 95% CI 2.98 to 4.64, P &lt; 0.00001; 7011 participants) with no heterogeneity between trials (I² = 28%, P = 0.17).</P>
<P>Excluding the trials that used lower doses of thrombolysis and had lower rates of fatal and symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage had little effect on the overall result as they contributed relatively few of the data to this analysis.</P>

<P>Six trials all testing rt-PA provided data on symptomatic including fatal infarct swelling (<LINK REF="STD-ATLANTIS-B-1999" TYPE="STUDY">ATLANTIS B 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ECASS-1995" TYPE="STUDY">ECASS 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ECASS-II-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECASS II 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ECASS-3-2008" TYPE="STUDY">ECASS 3 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-IST3-2012" TYPE="STUDY">IST3 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NINDS-1995" TYPE="STUDY">NINDS 1995</LINK>) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>; 5961 participants). There was no overall reduction in symptomatic infarct swelling with thrombolysis: 10.2% of those allocated thrombolysis had symptomatic infarct swelling compared with 10.4% of those allocated control (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.19, P = 0.75) with significant heterogeneity (I² = 71%, P = 0.004). Due to the heterogeneity we undertook an analysis according to a random-effects model. This gave very similar results (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.51, P = 0.88), and identical heterogeneity compared with the fixed-effect model.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Deaths from all causes during follow-up</HEADING>
<P>Data were available for all 27 trials (10,187 participants) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>). There was a modest but significant increase in deaths within scheduled follow-up, from 18.0% in controls to 19.4% in the participants allocated to thrombolysis (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.30 , P &lt; 0.002). In absolute terms, this represented an extra 15 (95% CI six fewer to 30 more) deaths at the end of follow-up per 1000 participants treated with thrombolysis. There was heterogeneity between the trials (I² = 48%, P = 0.003) reflected in the fact that some trials (for example, <LINK REF="STD-ECASS-II-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECASS II 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-IST3-2012" TYPE="STUDY">IST3 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MAST_x002d_I-1995" TYPE="STUDY">MAST-I 1995</LINK> (of participants allocated to the thrombolytic agent alone) and <LINK REF="STD-NINDS-1995" TYPE="STUDY">NINDS 1995</LINK>) showed a non-significant reduction and others (for example, <LINK REF="STD-ASK-1996" TYPE="STUDY">ASK 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-ATLANTIS-A-2000" TYPE="STUDY">ATLANTIS A 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-MAST_x002d_I-1995" TYPE="STUDY">MAST-I 1995</LINK> (of participants allocated to the thrombolytic agent plus aspirin)) showed a significant increase in case fatality with thrombolysis.</P>
<P>In the 12 trials using intravenous rt-PA, there was no net effect on deaths (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.20; 7012 participants) equivalent overall to seven more (two fewer to 25 more) deaths per 1000 participants treated. The heterogeneity of treatment effect among the trials of rt-PA was not quite statistically significant (I² = 38%, P = 0.09).</P>
<P>In view of the statistically significant heterogeneity for all trials (I² = 48%), we performed an analysis of the data using a random-effects model. This also shows a statistically significant excess of deaths with thrombolysis of similar magnitude to the fixed-effect analysis (all trials: OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.52 P = 0.02).The results for just trials of rt-PA (OR 1.12, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.38, P = 0.31) were also of similar magnitude as the fixed-effect model and still without any statistical significance.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Deaths occurring between seven and 10 days and the end of follow-up</HEADING>
<P>We examined the number of deaths occurring between the first seven to 10 days and the end of follow-up in the 13 trials that provided data for both early and late deaths (<LINK REF="STD-ASK-1996" TYPE="STUDY">ASK 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DIAS-2-2008" TYPE="STUDY">DIAS 2 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ECASS-1995" TYPE="STUDY">ECASS 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ECASS-II-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECASS II 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ECASS-3-2008" TYPE="STUDY">ECASS 3 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-EPITHET-2008" TYPE="STUDY">EPITHET 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haley-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Haley 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-IST3-2012" TYPE="STUDY">IST3 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MAST_x002d_E-1996" TYPE="STUDY">MAST-E 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MAST_x002d_I-1995" TYPE="STUDY">MAST-I 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mori-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Mori 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2003</LINK>). There were 425/3890 (10.9%) deaths in this period in the thrombolysis-treated participants compared with 460/3568 (12.9%) in the control participants, a difference of 2 per 1000, OR 0.88 (95% CI 0.76, 1.02, P = 0.09; 7458 participants). There was significant heterogeneity (I² = 57%, P = 0.007) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>). In eight trials testing rt-PA, the corresponding OR was 0.84 (95% CI 0.71 to 0.99; 5535 participants) also indicating fewer deaths between seven and 10 days and the end of follow-up. This analysis suggests that most of the deaths that occur following thrombolysis, including rt-PA, occur in the first seven to 10 days, and that thereafter the number of deaths occurring in thrombolysis-treated participants is very similar to that occurring in the control participants, or fewer than in the control group in trials testing rt-PA. <LINK REF="STD-IST3-2012" TYPE="STUDY">IST3 2012</LINK> provided data on death at six months, which suggested that the longer duration of follow-up (six instead of three months) allowed for the deaths in the control group occurring after the first seven to 10 days (300/1520, 19.7%, versus 245/1515, 16.2% in rt-PA treated participants) to overtake the excess of deaths due to fatal intracranial haemorrhage after rt-PA occurring in the first seven to 10 days, leading to a net-neutral overall effect on death at long-term follow-up with rt-PA.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Death or dependency at the end of follow-up</HEADING>
<P>Analysable data from 22 trials (including all recently completed and large trials) on functional outcome were available for 9318 participants (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>). Two further trials also assessed functional outcome but the data from one (<LINK REF="STD-Haley-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Haley 1993</LINK>) were incomplete (3/27 participants were alive but lost to follow-up), and in the other (<LINK REF="STD-JTSG-1993" TYPE="STUDY">JTSG 1993</LINK>) the Barthel Scores were not available.</P>
<P>There was a significant reduction in death or dependency with thrombolysis: 54.8% compared with 58.9% of those allocated to control (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.93, P = 0.0002). This is equivalent to 41 (95% CI 20 to 60) fewer dead or dependent participants per 1000 treated. There was significant heterogeneity of treatment effect between the trials (I² = 39%, P = 0.03).</P>
<P>For the 10 trials using intravenous rt-PA (6886 participants), the OR was 0.84 (95% CI 0.77 to 0.93, P = 0.0006), equivalent to 40 (95% CI 20 to 65) fewer participants being dead or dependent per 1000 treated. There was significant heterogeneity of treatment effect among the trials using rt-PA (I² = 63%, P = 0.004).</P>
<P>In view of the statistically significant between-trial heterogeneity, we performed an analysis of the data on death or dependency using a random-effects model. This gives an OR of 0.83 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.95, P = 0.006) for all trials, and of 0.80 (95% CI 0.66 to 0.97, P = 0.03) for just trials of rt-PA. (Note of caution: random-effects analyses place undue weight on smaller studies and possibly should be avoided with combined outcomes.

<LI>mRS 2 to 6 for any thrombolytic drug versus control OR 0.76 (95% CI 0.70 to 0.84, P = 0.00001; 8824 participants) with significant between-trial heterogeneity (I² = 45%, P = 0.02); for just rt-PA trials, the OR was 0.79 (95% CI 0.71 to 0.88, P = 0.00001; 6887 participants), but also with significant heterogeneity (I² = 64%, P = 0.003) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>mRS 3 to 6 for any thrombolytic drug versus control OR 0.85 (95% CI 0.78 to 0.93, P = 0.15 with non-significant between-trial heterogeneity (I² = 25%; 8824 participants); for 10 just rt-PA trials, the OR was 0.85 (95% CI 0.77 to 0.94, P = 0.001; 6887 participants), and also with borderline significant heterogeneity (I² = 47%, P = 0.05) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>Although the confidence intervals for poor outcome defined by mRS 3 to 6 and 2 to 6 overlap for analyses of all thrombolytic drugs and of just rt-PA, these data suggest that choosing mRS 2 to 6 as the primary outcome may provide a more positive trial result. Heterogeneity is present for poor outcome defined as mRS 2 to 6 as for poor outcome defined as mRS 3 to 6. This suggests that none of these dichotomous outcomes is specifically robust and that a more cautious estimate of overall thrombolysis and of rt-PA effect, such as the ordinal shift analysis, is wise. Note that some individual trials 'wobble' from being positive to not positive in going between the mRS definitions (some go one way and some the other) but overall the trend is to more positive results with mRS 2 to 6. For example, <LINK REF="STD-ECASS-II-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECASS II 1998</LINK> was neutral on its primary outcome of mRS 2 to 6, but positive on the alternative outcome of mRS 3 to 6; <LINK REF="STD-ECASS-3-2008" TYPE="STUDY">ECASS 3 2008</LINK> was positive on its primary outcome of mRS 2 to 6, but neutral on mRS 3 to 6; <LINK REF="STD-NINDS-1995" TYPE="STUDY">NINDS 1995</LINK> became less positive on mRS 3 to 6; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2003</LINK> moves from very positive on mRS 2 to 6 to neutral on mRS 3 to 6, the latter trial illustrating the particular instability of small and highly positive studies, and <LINK REF="STD-IST3-2012" TYPE="STUDY">IST3 2012</LINK> went from neutral on mRS 3 to 6 to positive on mRS 2 to 6 as well as on ordinal shift analysis.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dependency at the end of follow-up</HEADING>
<P>We examined the effect of thrombolysis on dependency defined as mRS 3 to 5 in the 22 trials with analysable data (9318 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>). There were 1649/4891 (33.7%) dependent participants amongst those treated with thrombolysis and 1761/4427 (39.8%) in the control group, an absolute reduction in dependent participants of 60 per 1000 participants treated with thrombolysis, OR 0.75 (95% CI 0.69 to 0.82, P &lt; 0.00001), with borderline significant between-trial heterogeneity (I² = 47%, P = 0.007) or between the groups treated with different thrombolytic drugs (I² = 55%, P = 0.04). This would suggest that amongst those who avoid early death (when most of the excess of deaths attributable to thrombolysis appear to occur), there is a highly significant and worthwhile reduction in the risk of being dependent with any thrombolytic treatment. Amongst those treated with rt-PA, the reduction in dependency was similar, with an OR of 0.80 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.89, P &lt; 0.0001; 6886 participants, 10 trials) but with between-trial heterogeneity (I² = 53%, P = 0.02).</P>

For mRS 0 to 1, 1211/3483 participants allocated rt-PA versus 998/3404 allocated control were alive with a favourable outcome (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.43, P &lt; 0.00001; 10 trials, 6887 participants) but with significant heterogeneity (I² = 57%, P = 0.01).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Possible sources of between-trial heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>To attempt to identify possible causes for the heterogeneity of the data on death (amongst all trials), functional outcome and symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (SICH) in rt-PA trials, we have ordered the trials by:</P>
<UL>
<LI>thrombolytic drug used (in all main outcome analyses);</LI>
<LI>concomitant antithrombotic drug usage;</LI>
<LI>time to treatment;</LI>
<LI>severity of stroke among participants randomised based on the case fatality in the control group (dichotomised on 0% to 19%, and 20% or more)</LI>
<LI>use of CT scanning versus MR diffusion- and perfusion-weighted imaging (DWI/PWI) mismatch or CT perfusion prior to inclusion; and</LI>
<LI>CT scan ASPECTS score, which is a measure of the extent of acute ischaemic tissue changes.</LI>
</UL>
<P>We have also examined the effect of time to treatment and effect of imaging modality (CT versus MR DWI/PWI mismatch or CT perfusion) on:</P>
<UL>
<LI>death or dependency;</LI>
<LI>alive and independent;</LI>
<LI>death by the end of follow-up; and</LI>
<LI>SICH.</LI>
</UL>
<P>There are obviously many other possible causes of heterogeneity, but it has not been possible to examine these systematically at the present time. These include, for example, the availability of data, the design of the trials, other aspects of the participant population apart from stroke severity, and the play of chance amongst what are still mainly relatively small trials.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Thrombolytic drug used</HEADING>
<P>The indirect comparisons of the effects of each individual drug on death at the end of follow-up (<LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>), death or dependency (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>), or SICH (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>) - like all indirect comparisons - are confounded by a number of factors, and hence not reliable. These trials differ in many respects apart from just the thrombolytic drug used, or its dose (for example the dose of streptokinase used in <LINK REF="STD-ASK-1996" TYPE="STUDY">ASK 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MAST_x002d_E-1996" TYPE="STUDY">MAST-E 1996</LINK>; and <LINK REF="STD-MAST_x002d_I-1995" TYPE="STUDY">MAST-I 1995</LINK> was similar to that used in myocardial infarction; a lower dose would perhaps be more relevant to a typical older stroke population). Although trends were observed, there were no statistically significant differences in symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage or death or dependency between trials using urokinase, streptokinase, rt-PA or desmoteplase. There was significant between-trial heterogeneity for death at the end of follow-up (<LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>). Examination of this analysis shows that the MAST-I streptokinase-plus-aspirin arm is a particular outlier with a large excess of deaths in the participants allocated streptokinase-plus-aspirin; the heterogeneity became non-significant after removal of MAST-I aspirin-plus-streptokinase-allocated participants (I² dropped to 28%, P = 0.09). For all outcomes, including death at the end of follow-up, there was considerable overlap between the 95% confidence intervals, clearly indicating that there are other differences between these trials in addition to the drug being tested. For example, the desmoteplase trials included participants as late as nine hours, whereas most other trials only included participants up to six hours. Any apparent differences between drugs may therefore be due to factors other than the drug in question.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Concomitant antithrombotic drug use</HEADING>
<P>It is not possible to comment on the effect of aspirin use prior to the stroke; although some trials recorded prior aspirin use, we could not extract data from the publications in a comparable manner and none of the earlier trials balanced randomisation on prior aspirin use. In <LINK REF="STD-IST3-2012" TYPE="STUDY">IST3 2012</LINK> treatment with antiplatelet drugs in the previous 48 hours was consistently collected and included among the pre-randomisation variables. The interaction between thrombolytic drugs and antithrombotic drugs given simultaneously (or the latter very soon after the former) was only tested by random allocation in one study (<LINK REF="STD-MAST_x002d_I-1995" TYPE="STUDY">MAST-I 1995</LINK>), which therefore provides the only truly valid evidence on this potential interaction. In this study there was a clinically important adverse interaction between aspirin and streptokinase when given simultaneously, resulting in a substantial increase in case fatality (early and late), which was not offset by a reduction in the number of dead or dependent participants by the end of follow-up (28% of those allocated to streptokinase alone versus 43% of those allocated to streptokinase plus aspirin were dead by the end of follow-up (P &lt; 0.001), and 62% and 63% were dead or dependent respectively (versus 68% in the control group)). The actual cause of the increase in early and total deaths with streptokinase and aspirin appears largely to be due to cerebrovascular events. Aspirin with streptokinase significantly increased the number of deaths in hospital from all causes (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.3 to 3.8), from neurological causes (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1 to 3.7), and intracranial haemorrhage on CT scan or at autopsy (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.0 to 5.0) when compared with the group who received streptokinase alone. There was no difference in deaths from neurological causes without intracranial haemorrhage, but note also that more participants in the streptokinase plus aspirin group died of neurological causes without a CT scan or autopsy, so could also have had an intracranial haemorrhage, that is, the increase in intracranial haemorrhage with aspirin and streptokinase may be even greater (<LINK REF="REF-Ciccone-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ciccone 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Information is also available on antithrombotic drug use (although not randomly allocated) in 20 other trials (<LINK REF="STD-ASK-1996" TYPE="STUDY">ASK 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ATLANTIS-A-2000" TYPE="STUDY">ATLANTIS A 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ATLANTIS-B-1999" TYPE="STUDY">ATLANTIS B 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-AUST-2005" TYPE="STUDY">AUST 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DEDAS-2006" TYPE="STUDY">DEDAS 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DIAS-2005" TYPE="STUDY">DIAS 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DIAS-2-2008" TYPE="STUDY">DIAS 2 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ECASS-1995" TYPE="STUDY">ECASS 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ECASS-II-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECASS II 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ECASS-3-2008" TYPE="STUDY">ECASS 3 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-EPITHET-2008" TYPE="STUDY">EPITHET 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haley-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Haley 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-IST3-2012" TYPE="STUDY">IST3 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MAST_x002d_E-1996" TYPE="STUDY">MAST-E 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MELT-2007" TYPE="STUDY">MELT 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mori-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Mori 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NINDS-1995" TYPE="STUDY">NINDS 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PROACT-1998" TYPE="STUDY">PROACT 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PROACT-2-1999" TYPE="STUDY">PROACT 2 1999</LINK>), and some further data in three other trials (<LINK REF="STD-Abe-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Abe 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Atarashi-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Atarashi 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ohtomo-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Ohtomo 1985</LINK>) (9674 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-001.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.14</LINK>). The odds of death by the end of follow-up were increased in line with the frequency, the amount, and proximity to the administration of thrombolysis of the concomitant antithrombotic drug use (OR 1.31 when all participants received antithrombotic drugs within 24 hours of thrombolysis; 1.27 when some participants received antithrombotic drugs within 24 hours; 1.13 when no participants received antithrombotic drugs within 24 hours but some thereafter; and 0.89 for no antithrombotic drugs within the first 10 to 14 days; I² = 50%, P = 0.002). Although these data are based on non-randomised comparisons, they do support the evidence of a clinically significant adverse interaction between thrombolysis and antithrombotic drugs given concurrently found in the <LINK REF="STD-MAST_x002d_I-1995" TYPE="STUDY">MAST-I 1995</LINK> study and may go some way towards explaining the heterogeneity between the trials for case fatality</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Severity of stroke among randomised participants</HEADING>
<P>There was no obvious statistically significant difference in the effect of thrombolysis on case fatality between trials with a case fatality rate less than 19% in the control group (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.58; 17 trials, 4973 participants) and those with a case fatality rate greater than 20% in the control group (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.19; 10 trials, 4905 participants; pooled I² = 28%, P = 0.09) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.15" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.15</LINK>). However, this crude comparison may mask an important relationship between stroke severity and hazard with thrombolysis. Post-hoc statistical correction methods are unlikely to be adequate, so combined individual patient data from published rt-PA trials may be incorrect. Also, unfortunately, analysis based on an outcome in the control group is prone to bias due to regression to the mean (<LINK REF="REF-Sharp-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharp 1996</LINK>). Nonetheless, the post-hoc analyses of both the NINDS (<LINK REF="REF-Ingall-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ingall 2003</LINK>) and MAST-I trials (<LINK REF="REF-Wardlaw-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wardlaw 1999a</LINK>) suggested that the risk reduction for death or dependency varied with stroke severity, being largest for participants with moderate stroke (NIHSS score around 10 to 15) and least in severe stroke (NINDS score around 18 to 30). However, these findings were based on small numbers in post-hoc analysis and need to be verified prospectively in larger randomised trials. A first attempt has now been made in the <LINK REF="STD-IST3-2012" TYPE="STUDY">IST3 2012</LINK> trial. In IST-3 severity was well balanced between the study arms through minimisation and more than 30% of all participants had a NINDS score of 15 or more, Furthermore, case fatality was 20% or more in the control group. The participants with more severe stroke had at least the same benefit of thrombolytic treatment as those with less severe stroke.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Effect of time to treatment (randomisation): death or dependency at the end of follow-up</HEADING>
<P>There was a significant reduction in the number of dead or dependent participants allocated thrombolysis who were randomised within three hours (57.4% of those allocated to thrombolysis were dead or dependent compared with 67% of those allocated to control, OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.79, P = 0.00001; 10 trials, 2160 participants) with no statistically significant heterogeneity (P = 0.91) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.16" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.16</LINK>). In absolute terms, this is equivalent to 95 (95% CI 55 to 136) fewer dead or dependent participants per 1000 treated with thrombolysis (all drugs combined). In trials testing rt-PA, 59.3% of those allocated rt-PA were dead or dependent compared with 68.3% % of those allocated to control, OR 0.65 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.80, P &lt; 0.0001; 6 trials, 1779 participants) with no significant heterogeneity, equivalent to 90 per 1000 fewer (95% CI 46 to 135) dead or dependent participants with rt-PA. Thus, heterogeneity present in the analysis of all trials, all time windows and drugs, is removed for participants randomised within three hours of stroke. This reinforces the previous finding of no heterogeneity for rt-PA and is presumably due to the fact that the vast majority of the participants (82.4%) in this analysis were treated with rt-PA, an effect of the inclusion of the <LINK REF="STD-IST3-2012" TYPE="STUDY">IST3 2012</LINK> trial.</P>
<P>To compare these data on the effects of treatment given within three hours with the effects when given after three hours, we examined only those trials that reported data for both time windows (<LINK REF="STD-ASK-1996" TYPE="STUDY">ASK 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ATLANTIS-A-2000" TYPE="STUDY">ATLANTIS A 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ATLANTIS-B-1999" TYPE="STUDY">ATLANTIS B 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ECASS-1995" TYPE="STUDY">ECASS 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ECASS-II-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECASS II 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-IST3-2012" TYPE="STUDY">IST3 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MAST_x002d_E-1996" TYPE="STUDY">MAST-E 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MAST_x002d_I-1995" TYPE="STUDY">MAST-I 1995</LINK>) to avoid confounding by other differences between trials (<LINK REF="CMP-001.17" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.17</LINK>; 9 trials, 6941 participants). Although there appeared to be more reduction in death or dependency in participants treated within three hours, the difference was not significant: three hours, OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.85; between three and six hours OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.10, (I² = 28%, P = 0.13).</P>
<P>In trials using rt-PA alone, amongst trials randomising in both less than three-hour and three- to six-hour time windows, the effect of treatment was not significantly different when given within three hours (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.87; 5 trials, 1155 participants), or more than three hours after stroke (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.09; 5 trials, 1449 participants), (I² = 45%, P = 0.06) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.18" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.18</LINK>). Comparing all rt-PA trials whether they randomised only under three hours or only between three and six hours or from zero to six hours made little difference (<LINK REF="CMP-001.19" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.19</LINK>): within three hours OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.80; 6 trials, 1779 participants; between three and six hours OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.04; 7 trials, 4950 participants. This should not be interpreted to mean that time to treatment is unimportant, but rather that other factor(s) like stroke severity may have confounded the association between time and outcome, and cannot be corrected for in this tabular analysis.</P>
<P>We also compared the outcome death or dependency at the end of follow-up across all trials stratified by their latest time allowed to randomisation (<LINK REF="CMP-001.20" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.20</LINK>). This provided data at up to three hours, up to 4.5 hours, up to six hours, up to nine hours and up to 24 hours.

<P>Data on participants treated within three hours of stroke are available for 11 trials (<LINK REF="CMP-001.23" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.23</LINK>). The <LINK REF="STD-NINDS-1995" TYPE="STUDY">NINDS 1995</LINK> trial contributes 29% of the data on all drugs (624/2187 participants). There was no excess of deaths during follow-up with thrombolysis: 25.5 % of participants allocated to thrombolysis versus 25.8% of those allocated to control (OR 0.99 95% CI 0.82 to 1.21) but with statistically significant heterogeneity (I² = 65%, P = 0.0008). The main outlier was the <LINK REF="STD-MAST_x002d_I-1995" TYPE="STUDY">MAST-I 1995</LINK> streptokinase-plus-aspirin-allocated participants who showed a significant excess of deaths even with treatment within three hours. In trials using rt-PA, the equivalent figures were OR 0.91 (95% CI 0.73 to 1.13, P = 0.39; 7 trials, 1806 participants), with no statistically significant heterogeneity (P = 0.22 ) and 14 fewer per 1000 deaths (95% CI 26 fewer to 55 fewer).</P>
<P>To compare treatment within three hours with treatment between three and six hours, we performed a similar analysis to those above for death and dependency (<LINK REF="CMP-001.24" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.24</LINK>). Here there was a significant difference in treatment effect between those treated within three hours (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.35; 9 trials, 1536 participants) and between three and six hours (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.48; 9 trials, 5400 participants) after the stroke (I² = 63%, P = 0.0002) for all trials providing data in both time windows. For just trials testing intravenous rt-PA (<LINK REF="CMP-001.25" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.25</LINK>), there was a marginally significant excess of deaths for participants treated between three and six hours (OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.38; 5 trials, 4044 participants), compared with those treated within three hours (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.26; 5 trials, 1155 participants. I² = 46%, P = 0.05). Including all rt-PA data (i.e. all trials, all time windows) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.26" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.26</LINK>) made little difference: within three hours: OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.13; 7 trials, 1806 participants; between three and six hours OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.35 (P = 0.07); 7 trials, 4966 participants.</P>
<P>We also compared the outcome death at the end of follow-up across all trials stratified by latest time to randomisation (<LINK REF="CMP-001.27" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.27</LINK>).

Within three hours, there was an excess of SICH with rt-PA (OR 4.25, 95% CI 2.53 to 7.16; 1155 participants). This did not differ to the increase in SICH in participants randomised between three and six hours (OR 3.62 , 95% CI 2.76 to 4.76; 4013 participants; I² = 0%). When data from all rt-PA trials were included (that is, those randomising only within three or only between three and six hours) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.29" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.29</LINK>), there was little difference: within three hours OR 4.55 (95% CI 2.92 to 7.09; 6 trials, 1779 participants); between three and six hours OR 3.73 (95% CI 2.86 to 4.86; 7 trials, 4935 participants; I² = 0%).</P>
<P>We also compared the outcome SICH across all trials stratified by latest time to randomisation (<LINK REF="CMP-001.30" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.30</LINK>). There was surprisingly little difference in ORs for each time point: zero to three hours, OR 5.85 (95% CI 1.54 to 22.26; 2 trials, 651 participants); zero to 4.5 hours, OR 6.56 (95% CI 2.51 to 17.18; 2 trials, 1161 participants); zero to six hours, OR 4.20 (95% CI 3.21 to 5.50; 15 trials, 6951 participants); zero to nine hours, OR 6.82 (95% CI 0.88 to 52.78; 3 trials, 325 participants); zero to 24 hours, no SICH in <LINK REF="STD-AUST-2005" TYPE="STUDY">AUST 2005</LINK>; I² = 23, P = 0.17.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Effect of age under or over 80 years on death or dependency and alive and independent</HEADING>
<P>We analysed the effect of age in just the rt-PA trials. Three trials included participants aged over 80 years (<LINK REF="STD-EPITHET-2008" TYPE="STUDY">EPITHET 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-IST3-2012" TYPE="STUDY">IST3 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NINDS-1995" TYPE="STUDY">NINDS 1995</LINK>), most coming from <LINK REF="STD-IST3-2012" TYPE="STUDY">IST3 2012</LINK>. With treatment up to six hours, the effect of rtPA on reducing the proportion of participants who were dead or dependent aged over 80 years (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.99, P = 0.04; 3 trials, 1696 participants) was the same as in participants aged up to and including 80 years (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.95, P = 0.004; 10 trials, 5175 participants) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.31" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.31</LINK>). For participants treated within three hours (<LINK REF="CMP-001.32" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.32</LINK>), those aged over 80 (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.78, P = 0.0007; 2 trials, 726 participants) did as well as those aged up to or including 80 years (0.66, 95% CI 0.52, 0.85, P = 0.001; 6 trials, 1039 participants) with no heterogeneity. There was similarly little difference between the proportions of those aged under or over 80 years who were alive and independent after rt-PA whether treated up to six hours (<LINK REF="CMP-001.33" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.33</LINK>; 10 trials, 6885 participants), within three hours (<LINK REF="CMP-001.34" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.34</LINK>; 6 trials, 1779 participants) or between three and six hours (<LINK REF="CMP-001.35" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.35</LINK>; 7 trials, 4971 participants).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Selection using CT scanning or Magnetic Resonance diffusion and perfusion (DWI/PWI) mismatch</HEADING>
<P>We restricted this analysis to just trials testing intravenous thrombolysis. Eleven trials contributed data on selection using CT scanning (<LINK REF="STD-ATLANTIS-A-2000" TYPE="STUDY">ATLANTIS A 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ATLANTIS-B-1999" TYPE="STUDY">ATLANTIS B 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ECASS-1995" TYPE="STUDY">ECASS 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ECASS-II-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECASS II 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ECASS-3-2008" TYPE="STUDY">ECASS 3 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-IST3-2012" TYPE="STUDY">IST3 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MAST_x002d_E-1996" TYPE="STUDY">MAST-E 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MAST_x002d_I-1995" TYPE="STUDY">MAST-I 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NINDS-1995" TYPE="STUDY">NINDS 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2003</LINK>) and four trials contributed data on selection using DWI/PWI mismatch (<LINK REF="STD-DEDAS-2006" TYPE="STUDY">DEDAS 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DIAS-2005" TYPE="STUDY">DIAS 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DIAS-2-2008" TYPE="STUDY">DIAS 2 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-EPITHET-2008" TYPE="STUDY">EPITHET 2008</LINK>). We included the EPITHET trial in the DWI/PWI section, although participants were not actually selected for inclusion on the basis of the MR findings, but rather on the basis of plain CT. However EPITHET obtained MR DWI/PWI data prior to randomisation and provided data on mismatch findings in relation to thrombolysis effect. Amongst 8334 participants selected on the basis of plain CT, 19% allocated thrombolysis and 19.3% allocated control were dead at the end of follow-up (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.25; 15 trials); amongst 426 participants selected on the basis of DWI/PWI mismatch, 14% allocated thrombolysis and 8.2% allocated control were dead at the end of follow-up (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.02 to 4.15; 4 trials) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.36" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.36</LINK>). Amongst 7843 participants selected on the basis of plain CT, 60.5% allocated thrombolysis and 66.3% allocated control were dead or dependent at the end of follow-up (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.89; 11 trials); amongst 425 participants selected on the basis of DWI/PWI mismatch, 58.6% allocated thrombolysis and 61.2% allocated control were dead or dependent at the end of follow-up (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.35; 4 trials) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.37" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.37</LINK>). Amongst 8358 participants selected on the basis of plain CT, 8.1% allocated thrombolysis and 1.9% allocated control developed SICH (OR 4.38, 95% CI 3.38 to 5.69; 16 trials); amongst 426 participants selected on the basis of DWI/PWI mismatch, 6.4% allocated thrombolysis and 0% allocated control developed SICH (OR 7.51, 95% CI 1.40 to 40.35; 4 trials) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.38" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.38</LINK>). These differences between selection by CT and by DWI/PWI mismatch were not statistically different.</P>
<P>Four studies (<LINK REF="STD-ECASS-II-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECASS II 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-IST3-2012" TYPE="STUDY">IST3 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NINDS-1995" TYPE="STUDY">NINDS 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PROACT-2-1999" TYPE="STUDY">PROACT 2 1999</LINK>) assessed ischaemic tissue extent on plain CT according to the ASPECT score, 8 to 10 versus 0 to 7, and the probability of being alive and independent (mRS 0 to 1) by end of follow-up after thrombolysis (<LINK REF="CMP-001.39" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.39</LINK>). In all, 4567 participants provided data for this analysis. Among the 3317 participants with an ASPECT score indicating no or only a small area of ischaemic change (ASPECT 8 to 10), 38.9% of those allocated control versus 43.4% of those allocated thrombolysis had a favourable outcome (mRS 0 to 1) at the end of follow-up, (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.39, P = 0.006; 4 trials, I² = 79%, P = 0.002). For the 1250 participants with an ASPECT score indicative of more extensive ischaemia (ASPECT 0 to 7) 19.3% of participants allocated control versus 22.5% of participants allocated thrombolysis were alive and independent (OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.58, P = 0.19; 4 trials), with no heterogeneity (I² = 1%, P = 0.39). However, there was heterogeneity between the effect of rt-PA in the participants with no or mild and extensive ischaemic change on CT (I² = 60, P = 0.01). In this relatively small sample tested for the effect on outcome by grade of CT-visible infarction, there were several types of drugs and different administration (pro-urokinase intra-arterially and rt-PA intravenously) which may account for the between-group heterogeneity.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Trials testing intra-arterial thrombolysis</HEADING>
<P>Amongst participants allocated to thrombolysis, 56.6% were dead or dependent at the end of follow-up compared with 70.3% of those allocated to control, OR 0.49 (95% CI 0.31 to 0.79; 4 trials, 350 participants) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.40" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.40</LINK>). This can be compared crudely with analysis of death or dependency for the combined intravenous thrombolysis trials which gave an OR of 0.79 (95% CI 0.71 to 0.89). These are not direct comparisons, and there are many other differences between the trials apart from the route of administration; this analysis should therefore be regarded with extreme caution. A separate Cochrane review presents the evidence, at present very limited, on direct randomised comparisons of intravenous with intra-arterial thrombolysis (<LINK REF="REF-Wardlaw-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wardlaw 2013</LINK>).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2014-07-28 12:52:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-07-28 12:52:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>There is strong evidence from 27 trials in 10,187 participants on the immediate hazards and the apparent net benefit of thrombolytic therapy given up to within three hours of acute ischaemic stroke, with overall benefit suggested up to six hours, for people aged over or under 80 years, and with different stroke severities. Overall, thrombolytic therapy was associated with a significant excess of deaths within the first seven to 10 days, symptomatic and fatal intracranial haemorrhages and (for all drugs) deaths by the end of follow-up. Most of the excess of deaths with thrombolysis occurred early and was explained by fatal intracranial haemorrhage. However, dependency was reduced in survivors so overall there was a significant net benefit. For every 1000 people treated with thrombolysis, 41 avoided death or dependency. Treatment within three hours resulted in 95/1000 fewer dead or dependent people. Trials using intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) contributed the most data to this review, and rt-PA appeared more favourable. Nevertheless, it was associated with an excess of early deaths, virtually all attributable to fatal intracranial haemorrhage (ICH), and a significant excess of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (SICH), but a neutral effect on deaths by the end of follow-up, and significantly more people avoiding dependent survival. If the factors associated with early fatal ICH can be identified (<LINK REF="REF-Whiteley-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whiteley 2012</LINK>), then it may become easier to identify those who are at greatest risk of harm and clarify the risk-to-benefit ratio for thrombolysis. There was no clear increase in hazard (ICH or death) with increasing time up to six hours after stroke, although there was some evidence of decreasing benefit (reduction in death and dependency). Therefore, increasing time to treatment may reduce benefit more than it increases the hazard of thrombolysis.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-IST3-2012" TYPE="STUDY">IST3 2012</LINK> has provided substantial new data since the last update, and includes a wide range of participants that has helped to answer questions about how to select patients (to maximise benefit and minimise hazard), by using the variables age, time from onset, stroke severity, stroke subtype, role of imaging findings and co-morbidities. However, questions remain about whether hazard can be minimised by novel thrombolytic drugs, different doses and routes or speed of administration (<LINK REF="REF-Wardlaw-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wardlaw 2013</LINK>) or strategies to improve access of rt-PA to the occluding thrombus (e.g. ultrasound or glyceryl trinitrate (GTN)): some trials addressing these questions are ongoing or are in the planning stages.</P>
<P>There is now good data on the effect of thrombolytic therapy in the elderly, in whom stroke is most common. Prior to <LINK REF="STD-IST3-2012" TYPE="STUDY">IST3 2012</LINK>, only <LINK REF="STD-EPITHET-2008" TYPE="STUDY">EPITHET 2008</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-MAST_x002d_E-1996" TYPE="STUDY">MAST-E 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-MAST_x002d_I-1995" TYPE="STUDY">MAST-I 1995</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-NINDS-1995" TYPE="STUDY">NINDS 1995</LINK> did not have an upper age limit but they included few participants (69 in NINDS and 25 in EPITHET) older than 80 years. People over 80 constitute a significant and increasing proportion of patients with stroke. The European license has an upper age limit of 80 years and has further strict selection criteria compared with the USA, where the license is based mainly on the <LINK REF="STD-NINDS-1995" TYPE="STUDY">NINDS 1995</LINK> trial and does not have an upper age limit. Among other limitations in Europe, an upper limit of stroke severity has also been introduced, as has a contraindication in people with the combined occurrence of diabetes and previous stroke. Hopefully these new data showing similar benefits of rt-PA in older as in younger people, particularly if treated within three hours of stroke, will lead to a relaxation of the licence.</P>
<P>Despite the large increase in available data with the inclusion of <LINK REF="STD-IST3-2012" TYPE="STUDY">IST3 2012</LINK> (and near doubling of data for rt-PA) there is still significant between-trial heterogeneity for death or dependency at the end of follow-up both for trials testing rt-PA, and for all thrombolysis trials together. For rt-PA, there is heterogeneity for death or dependency whether defined as modified Rankin Score (mRS) 3 to 6 or 2 to 6. This indicates that more data are needed to provide more robust results. The need for more data from new trials is also supported by the fact that the data are relatively unstable. For example, changing the definition of death or dependency from mRS 3 to 6 to 2 to 6 increases the heterogeneity for all thrombolysis trials (and is still present for just rt-PA trials) (<LINK REF="REF-Wardlaw-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wardlaw 2000</LINK>). In this latter analysis, although the overall conclusion of the trials combined was not materially altered, some individual trials 'wobbled' between being statistically significantly positive to statistically non-significant on moving from Rankin score 2 to 6 to 3 to 6, and vice versa (<LINK REF="STD-ECASS-II-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ECASS II 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ECASS-3-2008" TYPE="STUDY">ECASS 3 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PROACT-2-1999" TYPE="STUDY">PROACT 2 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wardlaw-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wardlaw 2000</LINK>), with the most recent victim of this play of chance being <LINK REF="STD-IST3-2012" TYPE="STUDY">IST3 2012</LINK>. The fact that a neutral trial can become positive, or vice versa, or heterogeneity can be apparently removed by such a small alteration in the endpoint analysed simply emphasises the instability of the data and also advocates for alternative more robust ways of analysing data. The heterogeneity could have arisen from many sources, including differences in the design of the trials, in the type of participants included, in the availability of data to contribute to the present analysis (not all trials contributed data to all outcome analyses), and in the fact that these can only be considered as small trials for a condition as heterogeneous as ischaemic stroke. Individual data will be able to examine whether factors such as sex, blood glucose, etc. influence the effect of thrombolysis (<LINK REF="REF-Kent-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kent 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kent-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kent 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kent-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kent 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mann-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mann 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sandercock-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandercock 2006</LINK>). Comparisons of different thrombolysis drugs, doses and routes of administration are addressed in a separate Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Wardlaw-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wardlaw 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was a suggestion that the presence of a visible recent infarct on the CT scan prior to randomisation may be related to increased hazard (risk of ICH and death) but this was based on a post-hoc analysis of the CT scans in <LINK REF="STD-ECASS-1995" TYPE="STUDY">ECASS 1995</LINK>, in which the baseline CT scans were not read blind to follow-up CT scans. Some trials had CT-visible infarction exclusion criteria and some, including <LINK REF="STD-NINDS-1995" TYPE="STUDY">NINDS 1995</LINK>, did not. The reported rate of CT-visible infarction varied between trials, either reflecting differences in participant selection, observer sensitivity, or definition of visible infarction signs. We have now been able to include data on CT-visible infarct extent categorised using the ASPECTS score from secondary analyses of CT scans in several trials. We did not find any evidence of an interaction between visible infarct extent and rt-PA on death or dependency. Other possible risk factors identifiable on the CT scan that might interact with rt-PA (such as evidence of small vessel disease), are being addressed in <LINK REF="STD-IST3-2012" TYPE="STUDY">IST3 2012</LINK>. Whether or not other, more advanced imaging modalities, such as CT perfusion or magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion with perfusion, would improve patient selection or allow an extension of time window to treatment is the subject of ongoing trials (<LINK REF="STD-EXTEND" TYPE="STUDY">EXTEND</LINK>). At present, the modest data available in an indirect comparison do not suggest that selection on the basis of MR diffusion- or perfusion-weighted imaging (DWI/PWI) leads to better effect of thrombolysis than for those selected on the basis of plain CT (<LINK REF="CMP-001.36" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.36</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.37" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.37</LINK>).</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-07-28 12:51:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The trials included in this review are small in comparison with the thrombolytic therapy in myocardial infarction trials. Nonetheless, this version of the review, with the addition of <LINK REF="STD-IST3-2012" TYPE="STUDY">IST3 2012</LINK>, includes a wider range of participants, with many more aged over 80 years, than previous versions. This is an effect of the principal methodology of <LINK REF="STD-IST3-2012" TYPE="STUDY">IST3 2012</LINK> with the application of the uncertainty principle, which states that when there is a clear indication for treatment the person should be treated, and when there clearly is a contraindicated the person should not be treated; only where the tested treatment is promising but unproven could the participant be randomised. This approach provides the chance to test wider treatment criteria. There are substantially more data with the inclusion of 3035 participants from <LINK REF="STD-IST3-2012" TYPE="STUDY">IST3 2012</LINK>. However, not all trials contributed to all analyses, some analyses only include five or so trials and there were imbalances in stroke severity and age between treatment groups in some earlier trials. There remains significant heterogeneity for some outcomes and lack of a complete picture of the sources of heterogeneity, meaning that there is scope for more trials. This is particularly the case for mild strokes. Although there is a lack of information on concomitant aspirin usage, it seems fairly clear from <LINK REF="STD-MAST_x002d_I-1995" TYPE="STUDY">MAST-I 1995</LINK> and the non-random comparisons in <LINK REF="CMP-001.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.14</LINK> that aspirin (or other antithrombotic drugs) given at the same time as thrombolysis is hazardous. The adverse effect of aspirin together with rt-PA was confirmed in one recent trial that stopped prematurely due to excess bleeding with aspirin and rt-PA combined (<LINK REF="REF-Zinkstok-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zinkstok 2008</LINK>). We have not been able to identify clear reasons why some people do poorly with thrombolysis. For example, the absence of any apparent time dependence of SICH with thrombolysis suggests that some other non-time-dependent factors may increase haemorrhage risk - i.e., not the presence of acute ischaemic change or other time-dependent factors. In contrast, the benefit of thrombolysis declines with time, fewer patients being alive and independent the later the treatment. The independent data meta-analysis of all rt-PA trials may be better able to identify factors influencing hazard.</P>
<P>The time window beyond which there is unlikely to be any benefit (or too much hazard) with thrombolytic therapy is unclear. The modifiers of the adverse effects of thrombolytic mode of action remain undetermined. There is a clear time dependency, with fewer participants treated within three hours of stroke being dead or dependent, than participants treated between three and six hours, but the latest time window remains undetermined. Other trials that tested other thrombolytic regimens beyond six hours suggest that the benefit may extend to nine hours or even longer in selected people. Although these trials were themselves not positive, when combined the overall result suggests that thrombolysis reduces death or dependency even at these later times. Thus, the time window for benefit probably extends to, and even beyond, six hours in selected people. However, this should not encourage complacency about the need for speedy treatment in ischaemic stroke. It simply underlines the need for more data so as to be able to provide individually-tailored treatment accounting for age, sex, stroke severity, prior aspirin use, brain scan appearances, etc., to name but a few factors in addition to time, which are likely to affect thrombolysis effect.</P>
<P>There is little information on which thrombolytic drug might have most benefit and least hazard, and there is little information on which dosage of drug has least hazard and most benefit (<LINK REF="REF-Wardlaw-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wardlaw 2013</LINK>). Direct randomised comparisons would be required (<LINK REF="REF-Dundar-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dundar 2003</LINK>). The Chinese UK trial (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2000</LINK>) had two doses of urokinase, but was underpowered to detect any difference between them. Similarly, the <LINK REF="STD-DEDAS-2006" TYPE="STUDY">DEDAS 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-DIAS-2005" TYPE="STUDY">DIAS 2005</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-DIAS-2-2008" TYPE="STUDY">DIAS 2 2008</LINK> trials were together underpowered to detect a difference between doses of desmoteplase. Note that further details on direct randomised comparisons of drug or dose are included in a separate Cochrane Review (<LINK REF="REF-Wardlaw-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wardlaw 2013</LINK>), for which there are few additional data since its original publication.</P>
<P>There is limited information about the effect of thrombolysis on survival in a longer time frame, as most of the trials (all of the recent rt-PA trials) performed the follow-up at three months. <LINK REF="STD-NINDS-1995" TYPE="STUDY">NINDS 1995</LINK> published data on functional outcome at six months and one year which indicate that the effect of rt-PA was sustained beyond three months. <LINK REF="STD-IST3-2012" TYPE="STUDY">IST3 2012</LINK> published data on functional outcome and death at 18 months which also indicate long-term benefits, but there are few other data on whether the benefit of thrombolysis is sustained (or even increases) at one year. This information is important for understanding the impact of thrombolytic treatment on health economics.</P>
<P>It is difficult to assess the cost effectiveness of thrombolytic treatment. A review for the UK National Health Service Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme on the cost effectiveness of thrombolytic treatment for acute ischaemic stroke needs to be updated (<LINK REF="REF-Sandercock-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandercock 2002</LINK>). One trial has a prospective substudy ongoing for the measured and modelled evaluation of cost effectiveness (<LINK REF="STD-IST3-2012" TYPE="STUDY">IST3 2012</LINK>).</P>

<P>The overall quality of evidence, particularly for the drug with the majority of data, rt-PA, is good. The concerns about quality in earlier trials are largely overcome.

<P>This review is the result of an ongoing process involving the collaborative effort of many researchers worldwide and the principal investigators of many of the thrombolysis trials. At present, this review represents all of the evidence from the randomised controlled studies on the effects of thrombolytic therapy on acute ischaemic stroke. Comparisons of trials using different thrombolytic drugs should be treated with caution as these comparisons are indirect; available data on direct comparisons are presented in the companion review (<LINK REF="REF-Wardlaw-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wardlaw 2013</LINK>). We have tried to include all available tabular data and have checked the accuracy of it rigorously. We have tried not to miss any relevant completed trials.

<P>A more detailed individual patient data meta-analysis of the streptokinase trials, using data from <LINK REF="STD-MAST_x002d_E-1996" TYPE="STUDY">MAST-E 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-MAST_x002d_I-1995" TYPE="STUDY">MAST-I 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-ASK-1996" TYPE="STUDY">ASK 1996</LINK>, has been completed (<LINK REF="REF-TAS_x002d_PP-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">TAS-PP 1999</LINK>); urokinase trials (<LINK REF="REF-Jin-Urokinase-metaanalysis-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jin Urokinase metaanalysis 2000</LINK>) have been completed, and three rounds of a meta-analysis of individual data from the rt-PA trials have been published (<LINK REF="REF-rt_x002d_PA-pooled-analysis-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">rt-PA pooled analysis 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-rt_x002d_PA-pooled-analysis-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">rt-PA pooled analysis 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-TTAS" TYPE="REFERENCE">TTAS</LINK>) with a third completed and accepted for publication (in press). The analyses based on tabular data in the present review are consistent with these individual patient data analyses.</P>
<P>The SICH, death and functional outcome rates in the large registry of people treated open-label with rt-PA (<LINK REF="REF-SITS_x002d_MOST" TYPE="REFERENCE">SITS-MOST</LINK>) are also similar to those found in the randomised trials.

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-07-28 12:57:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-07-28 12:57:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<OL>
<LI>Taken overall, in people given thrombolysis in the acute phase of ischaemic stroke, there appears to be a net benefit of a significant reduction in the proportion who are dead or dependent at the end of follow-up across all drugs and time windows.</LI>
<LI>Faster treatment is more beneficial. People treated within three hours of stroke are less likely to be dead or dependent than those treated after three hours, although some may still derive benefit if treated up to six hours.</LI>
<LI>There is, overall, proof of an excess risk of symptomatic and fatal intracranial haemorrhage and early death from all causes with thrombolytic therapy. Evidence on risk factors, however, is incomplete.</LI>
<LI>More data are available for recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) than for other drugs; with rt-PA, there was no net effect on death from all causes at long-term follow-up.</LI>
<LI>People aged over 80 derive as much benefit from rt-PA as do those aged under 80 years, especially if treated within three hours of stroke.</LI>
<LI>Despite the overall net benefit, the available data do not provide sufficient evidence to determine the duration of the therapeutic time window, the clinical or radiological features which identify those most likely to benefit (or be harmed) including whether or not people with mild stroke benefit or not, or the optimum agent (or dose or route of administration).</LI>
<LI>The data indicate that antithrombotic treatment should be avoided until at least 24 hours after thrombolytic treatment.</LI>
<LI>In the light of these considerations, current evidence supports configuration of stroke services so as to be able to treat as many people as possible as fast as possible with the licensed drug rt-PA, including those aged over 80. There is no evidence to withhold rt-PA on the basis of age, early CT ischaemic changes, or severity of stroke if it can be administered within 4.5 hours and preferably within three hours. While the data suggest that some people may benefit even up to six hours, change in clinical practice should await results of further trials to determine the latest time window for benefit.</LI>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-07-14 11:17:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>These data leave some uncertainties, which suggest that further large-scale randomised trials testing aspects of delivery of thrombolytic therapy in people with acute ischaemic stroke are needed:</P>
<OL>
<LI>To identify means of minimising the hazard without reducing the benefit, e.g. lower dose, avoiding people with specific characteristics (yet to be determined) or combinations of characteristics (e.g. elderly, severe stroke and some imaging feature), slower administration of the rt-PA bolus, different drug with lower haemorrhage risk, etc;</LI>
<LI>To provide data on the latest time window for treatment in which people and by what means of selection;</LI>
<LI>To provide data on benefits or harms of thrombolysis in mild stroke;</LI>
<LI>To provide randomised data on quality of life and cost effectiveness.</LI>
</OL>
<P>In future trials it would be helpful if data could be collected in such a way as to be compatible with the simple and fundamental effect parameters used in this review (e.g. early and late death, fatal intracranial haemorrhage, functional outcome). This would help to address the problem in the present review of between-trial heterogeneity (which may be exacerbated by missing data), and facilitate future meta-analyses.</P>

<P>The Division of Clinical Neurosciences at the University of Edinburgh had a collaborative project with Boehringer Ingelheim (UK) to establish a research magnetic resonance scanner, through the UK Research Councils Joint Research Equipment Initiative in 1997. For this, the Division received a grant from Boehringer Ingelheim, manufacturers of rt-PA in Europe, towards the purchase of the scanner. Further details of competing interests are listed on the Division's web site (<A HREF="http://www.dcn.ed.ac.uk">www.dcn.ed.ac.uk</A>).</P>
<P>The Division of Clinical Neurosciences at the University of Edinburgh are co-ordinating the Third International Stroke Trial (<LINK REF="STD-IST3-2012" TYPE="STUDY">IST3 2012</LINK>) of intravenous tissue Plasminogen Activator within six hours of acute ischaemic stroke. Prof Joanna Wardlaw is the Imaging Principal Investigator of this trial, Dr Veronica Murray is the Swedish National Co-ordinator and Dr Eivind Berge is the Norwegian National Co-ordinator for IST-3. The start-up phase was funded by the UK Stroke Association and PPP Foundation, with a limited supply of drug and placebo for the first part of the start-up phase from Boehringer Ingelheim; the main trial is funded by the UK Medical Research Council.</P>
<P>Prof Joanna Wardlaw received payment from Boehringer Ingelheim for reading scans for ECASS 3 on a cost-per-scan basis up to 2008. She was/is on the Steering Committees of <LINK REF="STD-MAST_x002d_I-1995" TYPE="STUDY">MAST-I 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-IST3-2012" TYPE="STUDY">IST3 2012</LINK>, and contributed to the design of <LINK REF="STD-ECASS-3-2008" TYPE="STUDY">ECASS 3 2008</LINK> (first Steering Committee meeting and design of scan reading). Boehringer Ingelheim applied for an extension to the licence for rt-PA from three to 4.5 hours on the basis of the <LINK REF="STD-ECASS-3-2008" TYPE="STUDY">ECASS 3 2008</LINK> result and supporting data, such as individual patient data analyses and the Cochrane review.</P>

<P>Category: Methodological qualities of included studies</P>
<P>This review (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> Issue 1,1997) states that ".. in the NINDS (1995), Mori et al 1992, and Haley et al 1993 no antithrombotic drugs were allowed within 24 hours .". However, Haley et al published that "Intravenous heparin was prohibited until at least 30 minutes after the infusion was complete .." thereby suggesting that heparin may have been given much earlier than 24 hours.</P>

<P>Wardlaw et al have tried to contact Haley et al but without success. Hence, they have changed the text to ".. in Haley et al (1993) a few patients received antithrombotic drugs within 24 hours ..". </P>

<P>Comment: We commented on this Cochrane review and the overall evidence reported for alteplase use at 3-4.5 hours after stroke (BMJ. 2015 Mar 17;350:h1075) and provide specific feedback for improving this Cochrane review.<BR/>
<BR/>In the Risk of bias in included studies section, it would be helpful:<BR/>1.) to include a risk of bias summary table<BR/>
<BR/>2.) in the paragraph on incomplete outcome data, to describe the completeness of the available data explicitly rather than stating all available data are included. Describe the risk of bias from incomplete data, including a trial-specific understanding of how prevalent or nonprevalent this risk is<BR/>
<BR/>3.) in the paragraph on selective reporting, to define what you mean by "strict intention-to-treat analysis". Does this mean that outcomes were assumed and assigned for all randomized patients, regardless of follow-up data availability? And if missing data was imputed, how was it done, and was it done in a similar way in each trial? Also, presenting sensitivity analyses and including an available case analysis would be useful. Regardless of how you describe your methodology for approaching intention-to-treat analysis, comment on whether the data is available or the intention-to-treat analyses were available from the trials to determine if absence of intention-to-treat analyses represents a risk of bias in the data at a trial-specific level.<BR/>
<BR/>4.) to add a discussion on baseline differences: What relevant factors, if any, were imbalanced between groups in each trial? This is an important risk of bias criterion not addressed in the review.<BR/>
<BR/>In the Results section and subsequent discussions and conclusions:<BR/>1.) While there are many analyses that can be grouped by time in many ways (0-3 hours, 0-4.5 hours, 0-6 hours, 3-6 hours, 3-4.5 hours, 4.5-6 hours), providing data for many overlapping combinations is confusing, so timeframes that do not represent clinically useful and methodologically sound groups should be dropped from the results reporting.<BR/>
<BR/>2.) Overall timeframes such as 0-4.5 hours and 0-6 hours are not useful for clinical decision making or overall data interpretation because:<BR/>
<BR/>a. Clinical practice patterns and guidelines have &#8220;chunked&#8221; practice into 0-3 hours, 3-4.5 hours, and 4.5-6 hours for practical implementation.<BR/>
<BR/>b. The data in the existing Cochrane review have such different results in subgroup analyses for 0-3 hours and for 3-6 hours that lumping these two together for an overall analysis does not provide a summary statistic that is representative of a clinically representative grouping of patients. The 'average' of these two groupings does not represent the 'whole'.<BR/>
<BR/>c. If data for 3-4.5 hours and 4.5-6 hours could be separated this may be more clear than analyses for 3-6 hours.<BR/>
<BR/>3.) Addressing the impact of risk of bias assessments could be important for results interpretation and discussion.<BR/>
<BR/>The changes above could be applied relatively quickly and are important considering the Cochrane review could be expected to be the most valid, thorough and current systematic review for this subject.<BR/>
<BR/>Meanwhile, if Cochrane reviewers could obtain the full data, address population subgroupings considered most clinically relevant (age &lt; 80 years vs. age &gt; 80 years, timeframes 0-3 hours vs. 3-4.5 hours), and provide an updated individual patient data meta-analysis, it would immensely help policy-makers view this in full detail. A protocol for such an analysis being shared a priori with an opportunity for clinicians, researchers, and content domain experts to comment on which subgroupings are most clinically relevant and which approaches to the data interpretation and analysis are most likely to be informative or potentially introducing a risk of bias would allow for a meta-analysis with wider acceptance and greater confidence in its results.<BR/>

<P>We thank Brian Alper and colleagues for their interest in our review, and for their comments. Our responses (in bold) are listed below point by point. Many of the points raised cannot be answered by the tabular data of the review (for example the effects in different time splits). However, these were answered by the Stroke Thrombolysis Trialists' Collaboration (STTC) publication in the Lancet in 2014, which is referenced in the review.</P>
<P>Comment: We commented on this Cochrane review and the overall evidence reported for alteplase use at 3-4.5 hours after stroke (BMJ 2015 Mar 17;350:h1075) and provide specific feedback for improving this Cochrane review.</P>
<P>
<B>Response: Thank you for your interest in the review and for taking the time to submit this critique.</B>
</P>
<P>In the Risk of bias in included studies section, it would be helpful:</P>
<P>1) to include a risk of bias summary table.</P>
<P>
<B>Response: Thank you. We have provided 'Risk of bias' tables for the trials included since the last update, and plan to extend to all trials in the next revision. However, we clearly state the major issues related to bias in the text and state in the Methods in 'Assessment of risk of bias':</B>
</P>
<P>
<I>"We assessed risk of bias as specified in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, Version 5.1.0 (March 2011), Chapter 8 (Higgins 2011). We assessed whether the method of randomisation would allow allocation concealment, the adequacy of efforts to blind treatment administration and outcome assessment. For each included trial we collected information about:</I>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<I>the method of randomisation (including information on allocation concealment);</I>
</LI>
<LI>
<I>blinding of treatment administration;</I>
</LI>
<LI>
<I>blinding of outcome assessment; and</I>
</LI>
<LI>
<I>whether an intention-to-treat analysis was done, or could possibly be done.</I>
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<I>We provide detailed 'Risk of bias' tables for the trial included since the last update."</I>
</P>
<P>2) to describe, in the paragraph on incomplete outcome data, the completeness of the available data explicitly rather than stating all available data are included. Describe the risk of bias from incomplete data, including a trial-specific understanding of how prevalent or nonprevalent this risk is.</P>
<P>
<B>Response: We do report the following about incomplete outcome data:</B>
</P>
<P>
<I>"Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias)</I>
</P>
<P>
<I>All available data are included. Data on six participants were missing from the ATLANTIS B 1999 trial publication and details have not been forthcoming from the investigators, and we have not yet received data on 46 participants from the Chinese UK Trial (Chen 2000) (these participants were randomised after the trial's six-hour time limit and have not yet been supplied). More information is available for some trials than for others, either because the trial collaborators have published very actively on various aspects of their trial, or because in some cases further information is available from other sources (for example, reports on NINDS 1995 appear on the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website as part of the licence application process). The more frequent reporting or greater completeness of the data for some trials is merely a reflection that more information is available for those trials, and not intended to over- or under-emphasise the actual results or quality of any particular trial (or trials) compared with others for which there is less detailed information available.</I>
</P>
<P>
<I>There was more detail about each trial in the text in earlier versions and in drafts of the present version. However, space constraints imposed by the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), the large volume of important information that now has to be included, and the historical nature of some of the trials (which, note, are also relatively small), meant that these details have not been retained in the text. Note we state clearly in Methods, 'Dealing with missing data':</I>
</P>
<P>
<I>"We contacted trial investigators to obtain all unpublished missing data where possible. Where data were still missing or had not been collected in the original trial, then that trial did not contribute to the relevant outcome. We clarified missing or unclear data with the principal investigator. The outcomes in two studies were very clearly described in the original texts and verification with the principal investigators was not necessary (Haley 1993; Morris 1995)."</I>
</P>
<P>
<B>Also see Methods 'Assessment of reporting biases':</B>
</P>
<P>
<I>"We have endeavoured to include data from all trials on all prespecified outcomes, obtained from secondary publications or the trial investigators if unpublished. We assessed the likelihood of missing trials using a funnel plot."</I>
</P>
<P>
<B>The risk of bias from incomplete data is dependent on whether or not the trials used blinded outcome assessment. We will therefore also refer to Results, from the five sections on five different important sources of bias:</B>
</P>
<P>
<I>"Blinding (performance bias and detection bias)</I>
</P>
<P>
<I>Five trials were single-blind without a placebo (AUST 2005; MAST-I 1995; MELT 2007; PROACT 2 1999; Wang 2003). In one trial (IST3 2012) the first 276 participants were treated in the double-blinded phase of the trial and all 2759 remaining participants were included into the open phase of the trial. All participants in the study, irrespective of study phase, were blindly assessed by postal mail or telephone by a blinded and trained observer. In PROACT 2 1999, the control group underwent catheter placement but received no infusion. All the rest were double-blind placebo-controlled trials. However, it should also be noted that thrombolysis, due to its effects on the coagulation system at high doses, can be difficult to blind completely due to the obvious signs of bleeding (prolonged bleeding at venepuncture sites, easy bruising, gingival or conjunctival haemorrhages, etc). Thus, provision of an identical-appearing placebo (in the syringe) may not fully blind investigators to treatment allocation. Furthermore, as thrombolytic agents are proteins, they froth when shaken in solution with water or saline, rather like egg white mixed with water and shaken. Normal saline is therefore not an identical-looking placebo for a thrombolytic agent. Thus, in addition to the possibilities for failure of treatment allocation concealment inherent in the randomisation methods used as outlined above, it is possible that treatment allocation could be guessed accurately by the physicians caring for the participant in the acute phase because of these biological effects. Accordingly, methods for ensuring complete blinding of treatment allocation at late follow-up are crucial. Only one study (MAST-I 1995) used central telephone follow-up by a blinded trained observer. Although seven other trials specified that follow-up was to be by a physician not involved in the acute care of the participant, it is uncertain how completely this was achieved in practice. Other trials either did not specify who should do the follow-up, or did not make it mandatory that follow-up was by an independent physician, so in either case follow-up may have been carried out by the acute phase physician who could have been influenced by their knowledge of events in the acute phase."</I>
</P>
<P>
<B>Also, the risk of bias from incomplete data is dependent on other sources of bias. We have, therefore, copied from the three other sections on different important sources of bias in the Results section, here for avoidance of doubt:</B>
</P>
<P>
<I>"Allocation (selection bias)</I>
</P>
<P>
<I>Among the included studies 14 (52%) fulfilled criteria for high grade concealment. The concealment has successively improved over time with the development and utilisation of new randomisation methods, such as the use of a centralised computerised method with interactive interface for randomisation over the telephone or Internet.</I>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<I>Twelve trials used central telephone or Internet randomisation (ASK 1996; AUST 2005; DEDAS 2006; DIAS 2005; DIAS 2 2008; ECASS 3 2008; IST3 2012; MAST-E 1996; MAST-I 1995; MELT 2007; PROACT 1998; PROACT 2 1999). In five studies (AUST 2005; IST3 2012, MAST-I 1995; MELT 2007; PROACT 2 1999), the allocated treatment was then given unblinded without a placebo. In one of the studies (IST3 2012) with the exception of 276 participants treated in the double-blinded phase of the trial, the remaining participants (2759) were treated unblinded without placebo. In four other studies (ASK 1996; ECASS 3 2008; MAST-E 1996; PROACT 1998) sealed prepacks of thrombolytic drug or identical-appearing placebo were given according to the randomisation instructions.</I>
</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>
<I>In three trials randomisation was at the participating hospital by selection of a sealed, sequentially-numbered, prepack (of active drug or identical appearing placebo) followed within two hours by a telephone call to the Central Trial Co-ordinating Office to notify them of the participant and the number of the drug pack (ATLANTIS A 2000; ATLANTIS B 1999; NINDS 1995). In one study (NINDS 1995), the randomisation system, set up in an effort to reduce delays to treatment, led to 'out of order' trial treatment allocations in between 13 and 31 participants, which affected every subsequent participant until the error was detected, and led to participants appearing to cross between treatment allocations (more moved from rt-PA to placebo than the other way round). Also in the interests of reducing delays to trial treatment administration, there were some participants who ultimately were not entered into the study after the pharmacy had prepared the trial pack (and therefore some discarded trial packs). Details of the randomisation are given at www.fda.gov/cber/products/altegen061896.htm; see Clinical Review 2, page 11-12 and 18-19.</I>
</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>
<I>In three trials, randomisation was by selection of a sequentially numbered, sealed drug prepack at the participating centre provided by the sponsor from a randomisation schedule drawn up centrally (ECASS 1995; ECASS II 1998; EPITHET 2008).</I>
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<I>Of the remaining trials:</I>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<I>five trials used sealed drug prepacks of active drug or identical-appearing placebo (Abe 1981; Atarashi 1985; JTSG 1993; Mori 1992; Ohtomo 1985);</I>
</LI>
<LI>
<I>one used sealed envelopes (Haley 1993);</I>
</LI>
<LI>
<I>one used sealed drug prepacks of active drug or normal saline (as placebo) (Chen 2000);</I>
</LI>
<LI>
<I>the method was not stated in two (Morris 1995; Wang 2003).</I>
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<I>Please note that, therefore, only two of the rt-PA trials (ECASS 3 2008: IST3 2012) recorded the participant details centrally over the telephone or Internet prior to starting trial treatment. In one of these trials (IST3 2012) a minimisation algorithm was used to balance the study arms for key prognostic variables like stroke severity before randomisation. Several later studies have made use of modern randomisation techniques and entering key prognostic variables into the IT system before randomisation, which allows balancing of the study arms - as has been introduced in one trial (IST3 2012).</I>
</P>
<P>
<I>Selective reporting (reporting bias)</I>
</P>
<P>
<I>We have avoided, as far as possible, any reporting bias by obtaining original data from the trial investigators where these have not been published. Only the intention-to-treat results are included here. In any trials where there have been exclusions, these were made prior to the breaking of the randomisation code. A strict intention-to-treat analysis was used in 18 studies (ASK 1996; ATLANTIS A 2000; ATLANTIS B 1999; AUST 2005; DEDAS 2006; DIAS 2005; DIAS 2 2008; ECASS 1995; ECASS II 1998; ECASS 3 2008; EPITHET 2008; IST3 2012; MAST-E 1996; MAST-I 1995; MELT 2007; PROACT 1998; PROACT 2 1999; Wang 2003), but not in any of the earlier trials. The administrative problems with randomisation in one study (NINDS 1995) led the FDA reviewer to describe the primary analysis as an 'on-treatment analysis'. However, the primary analysis was undertaken without excluding any participants entered into the trial and was, therefore, an intention-to-treat analysis (www.fda.gov/cber/products/altegen061896.htm; see Clinical Review 2, page 20). For the earlier trials, with additional information from the principal investigators if necessary, we have attempted to find a final outcome for all randomised participants, rather than simply relying on the published data from which some randomised participants may have been excluded. Note that one trial (ECASS 1995) was published as intention-to-treat and as a 'target population' after about 20% of the randomised participants had been excluded, but only the intention-to-treat data have been included here.</I>
</P>
<P>
<I>Other potential sources of bias</I>
</P>
<P>
<I>Randomisation in two trials, ASK 1996 (in the over-three-hour group) and MAST-E 1996, was stopped on the advice of their respective data monitoring committees after only about half of the originally intended number of participants had been randomised. One study (MAST-I 1995) was suspended by its steering committee (in view of the stopping of MAST-E 1996 and ASK 1996) to examine its interim results after randomising about one third of its originally intended number. Another study (MELT 2007) was discontinued on the advice of its data monitoring committee when rt-PA was licensed in Japan in 2005. Another study (AUST 2005) was discontinued on the basis of very slow recruitment after 24 participants of a planned sample of 200 had been included. Four studies (ECASS 1995; ECASS II 1998; NINDS 1995; PROACT 2 1999) all reached their planned targets. One study (PROACT 1998) was stopped after completing two of its planned three dosage arms by the pharmaceutical provider. Another study (ATLANTIS A 2000) was stopped on publication of the NINDS 1995 trial, and continued in modified form as ATLANTIS B 1999, which in turn stopped in 1998 following a 'futility analysis' prompted by results from the ECASS II 1998 study. Examination of funnel plots for the main outcomes showed these to be symmetrical and therefore provided little evidence of publication bias."</I>
</P>
<P>3) to define, in the paragraph on selective reporting, what you mean by "strict intention-to-treat analysis". Does this mean that outcomes were assumed and assigned for all randomised patients, regardless of follow-up data availability? And if missing data was imputed, how was it done, and was it done in a similar way in each trial? Also, presenting sensitivity analyses and including an available case analysis would be useful. Regardless of how you describe your methodology for approaching intention-to-treat analysis, comment on whether the data is available or the intention-to-treat analyses were available from the trials to determine if absence of intention-to-treat analyses represents a risk of bias in the data at a trial-specific level.</P>
<P>
<B>Response: 'Intention to treat' means analysed by treatment group to which the subject was assigned at randomisation, rather than by the treatment that they actually got. This is a standard term. All analyses were done as intention-to-treat analyses, and there were no assumptions, imputations or other fiddling with the data. The data are as published in the individual trials in almost all cases and can be extracted should you wish to repeat these analyses yourselves. In a few trials, additional unpublished data were sought and included but these were mostly for secondary outcomes. Also see above.</B>
</P>
<P>4) to add a discussion on baseline differences: What relevant factors, if any, were imbalanced between groups in each trial? This is an important risk of bias criterion not addressed in the review.</P>
<P>
<B>Response: A detailed discussion on baseline imbalance was included in previous versions of this review over the last 15 years but has mostly been removed from the current version due mainly to space constraints and because there has been an extensive debate and reanalysis (e.g. of the NINDS trial) all of which is referenced, plus the STTC individual patient data meta-analysis (Lancet 2014, see references), all of which overcome concerns regarding baseline imbalance. Also see sections on bias from Results copied above.</B>
</P>
<P>In the Results section and subsequent discussions and conclusions:</P>
<P>1) While there are many analyses that can be grouped by time in many ways (0-3 hours, 0-4.5 hours, 0-6 hours, 3-6 hours, 3-4.5 hours, 4.5-6 hours), providing data for many overlapping combinations is confusing, so timeframes that do not represent clinically useful and methodologically sound groups should be dropped from the results reporting.</P>
<P>
<B>Response: With respect, a) many would disagree on what constitutes a clinically meaningful time window, and b) tabular data on 3-4.5 or 4.5-6 hours have not been published from most trials. Only ECASS-3 examined 3-4.5 hours and IST-3 provided 3-4.5 hour data in a prespecified subgroup analysis. There is substantial interest in 0-3 hours and 3-6 hours and these times are available. Therefore we provide these times and refer the reader to the STTC analysis (Lancet 2014). The several time subgroups are clearly labelled and their presence explained in the text. The separate analyses are retained for trials that randomised in both 0-3 and 3-6 hour time windows to deal with the difference in stroke severity seen in early vs later presenting patients, which was not otherwise possible with tabular data.</B>
</P>
<P>2) Overall timeframes such as 0-4.5 hours and 0-6 hours are not useful for clinical decision making or overall data interpretation because:</P>
<P>a. Clinical practice patterns and guidelines have &#8220;chunked&#8221; practice into 0-3 hours, 3-4.5 hours, and 4.5-6 hours for practical implementation.</P>
<P>b. The data in the existing Cochrane review have such different results in subgroup analyses for 0-3 hours and for 3-6 hours that lumping these two together for an overall analysis does not provide a summary statistic that is representative of a clinically representative grouping of patients. The &#8220;average&#8221; of these two groupings does not represent the &#8220;whole&#8221;.</P>
<P>c. If data for 3-4.5 hours and 4.5-6 hours could be separated this may be more clear than analyses for 3-6 hours.</P>
<P>
<B>Response: See above. As only 2 trials provide 3-4.5 hr data, there is little point in creating separate tables, because the sample would be too small. The STTC analysis addresses this issue adequately, clearly showing that the latest time window for alteplase (rt-PA) is around 5 hrs or just after. Please note a methodological point however: the lack of patients randomised beyond six hours means that it is not possible to determine the very latest time window at present &#8211; for now we can only be confident of some benefit out to 5 hours &#8211; a larger sample, as is seen where all thrombolytic drugs (10,000 patients) are considered, suggests a definite benefit out to six hours. Confirmation of this point will be possible with the results of more later time window trials. Note that the recent positive (small) thrombectomy trials had time windows out to 8 hours.</B>
</P>
<P>3) Addressing the impact of risk of bias assessments could be important for results interpretation and discussion.</P>
<P>
<B>Response: We have above copied from the five sections on different important sources of bias, from Results. For avoidance of doubt, please see also the three sections on these points in the Discussion:</B>
</P>
<P>
<I>"Overall completeness and applicability of evidence</I>
</P>
<P>
<I>The trials included in this review are small in comparison with the thrombolytic therapy in myocardial infarction trials. Nonetheless, this version of the review, with the addition of IST3 2012, includes a wider range of participants, with many more aged over 80 years, than previous versions. This is an effect of the principal methodology of IST3 2012 with the application of the uncertainty principle, which states that when there is a clear indication for treatment the person should be treated, and when there clearly is a contraindicated the person should not be treated; only where the tested treatment is promising but unproven could the participant be randomised. This approach provides the chance to test wider treatment criteria. There are substantially more data with the inclusion of 3035 participants from IST3 2012. However, not all trials contributed to all analyses, some analyses only include five or so trials and there were imbalances in stroke severity and age between treatment groups in some earlier trials. There remains significant heterogeneity for some outcomes and lack of a complete picture of the sources of heterogeneity, meaning that there is scope for more trials. This is particularly the case for mild strokes. Although there is a lack of information on concomitant aspirin usage, it seems fairly clear from MAST-I 1995 and the non-random comparisons in Analysis 1.14 that aspirin (or other antithrombotic drugs) given at the same time as thrombolysis is hazardous. The adverse effect of aspirin together with rt-PA was confirmed in one recent trial that stopped prematurely due to excess bleeding with aspirin and rt-PA combined (Zinkstok 2008). We have not been able to identify clear reasons why some people do poorly with thrombolysis. For example, the absence of any apparent time dependence of SICH with thrombolysis suggests that some other non-time-dependent factors may increase haemorrhage risk - i.e., not the presence of acute ischaemic change or other time-dependent factors. In contrast, the benefit of thrombolysis declines with time, fewer patients being alive and independent the later the treatment. The independent data meta-analysis of all rt-PA trials may be better able to identify factors influencing hazard.</I>
</P>
<P>
<I>The time window beyond which there is unlikely to be any benefit (or too much hazard) with thrombolytic therapy is unclear. The modifiers of the adverse effects of thrombolytic mode of action remain undetermined. There is a clear time dependency, with fewer participants treated within three hours of stroke being dead or dependent, than participants treated between three and six hours, but the latest time window remains undetermined. Other trials that tested other thrombolytic regimens beyond six hours suggest that the benefit may extend to nine hours or even longer in selected people. Although these trials were themselves not positive, when combined the overall result suggests that thrombolysis reduces death or dependency even at these later times. Thus, the time window for benefit probably extends to, and even beyond, six hours in selected people. However, this should not encourage complacency about the need for speedy treatment in ischaemic stroke. It simply underlines the need for more data so as to be able to provide individually-tailored treatment accounting for age, sex, stroke severity, prior aspirin use, brain scan appearances, etc., to name but a few factors in addition to time, which are likely to affect thrombolysis effect.</I>
</P>
<P>
<I>There is little information on which thrombolytic drug might have most benefit and least hazard, and there is little information on which dosage of drug has least hazard and most benefit (Wardlaw 2013). Direct randomised comparisons would be required (Dundar 2003). The Chinese UK trial (Chen 2000) had two doses of urokinase, but was underpowered to detect any difference between them. Similarly, the DEDAS 2006, DIAS 2005, and DIAS 2 2008 trials were together underpowered to detect a difference between doses of desmoteplase. Note that further details on direct randomised comparisons of drug or dose are included in a separate Cochrane Review (Wardlaw 2013), for which there are few additional data since its original publication.</I>
</P>
<P>
<I>There is limited information about the effect of thrombolysis on survival in a longer time frame, as most of the trials (all of the recent rt-PA trials) performed the follow-up at three months. NINDS 1995 published data on functional outcome at six months and one year which indicate that the effect of rt-PA was sustained beyond three months. IST3 2012 published data on functional outcome and death at 18 months which also indicate long-term benefits, but there are few other data on whether the benefit of thrombolysis is sustained (or even increases) at one year. This information is important for understanding the impact of thrombolytic treatment on health economics.</I>
</P>
<P>
<I>It is difficult to assess the cost effectiveness of thrombolytic treatment. A review for the UK National Health Service Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme on the cost effectiveness of thrombolytic treatment for acute ischaemic stroke needs to be updated (Sandercock 2002). One trial has a prospective substudy ongoing for the measured and modelled evaluation of cost effectiveness (IST3 2012).</I>
</P>
<P>
<I>Quality of the evidence</I>
</P>
<P>
<I>The overall quality of evidence, particularly for the drug with the majority of data, rt-PA, is good. The concerns about quality in earlier trials are largely overcome. The recent trials had good allocation concealment, central telephone randomisation, central blinded follow-up, and very few losses to follow-up.</I>
</P>
<P>
<I>Potential biases in the review process</I>
</P>
<P>
<I>This review is the result of an ongoing process involving the collaborative effort of many researchers worldwide and the principal investigators of many of the thrombolysis trials. At present, this review represents all of the evidence from the randomised controlled studies on the effects of thrombolytic therapy on acute ischaemic stroke. Comparisons of trials using different thrombolytic drugs should be treated with caution as these comparisons are indirect; available data on direct comparisons are presented in the companion review (Wardlaw 2013). We have tried to include all available tabular data and have checked the accuracy of it rigorously. We have tried not to miss any relevant completed trials. We can only apologise if we have overlooked some available data on an outcome in an included trial or have overlooked a trial completely."</I>
</P>
<P>The changes above could be applied relatively quickly and are important considering the Cochrane review could be expected to be the most valid, thorough and current systematic review for this subject.</P>
<P>
<B>Response: Thank you but please take note of the above points, particularly that of space constraints. A large amount of text had to be culled from the present version at a late stage. Perhaps the CDSR could consider increasing their space &#8211; an electronic publishing medium should not impose text space constraints. The information you refer to is not &#8216;missing&#8217; from the review &#8211; information on bias is given in the text and the published trial reports do not contain tabular data on the specific time window you request. Earlier versions provide detailed descriptions and discussion of baseline imbalance. However these issues concern only two trials (NINDS and ECASS III) of only about 1400 patients (of 7000 patients treated with alteplase or 10,000 patients treated with any thrombolytic drug). Disputes over this have already been settled, and the STTC individual patient data meta-analysis has already overcome concerns over this.</B>
</P>
<P>Meanwhile, if the Cochrane reviewers could obtain the full data, address population subgroupings considered most clinically relevant (age &lt; 80 years vs. age &gt; 80 years, timeframes 0-3 hours vs. 3-4.5 hours), and provide an updated individual patient data meta-analysis, it would immensely help policy-makers view this in full detail. A protocol for such an analysis being shared a priori with an opportunity for clinicians, researchers, and content domain experts to comment on which subgroupings are most clinically relevant and which approaches to the data interpretation and analysis are most likely to be informative or potentially introducing a risk of bias would allow for a meta-analysis with wider acceptance and greater confidence in its results.</P>
<P>
<B>Response: The STTC has already done exactly what you suggest and published both the protocol and the results in 2014. For the Cochrane review, all available data are in the data tables, and the primary and secondary trials publications are all listed in the review so that interested readers can go and replicate this 25 years' worth of analysis should they wish.</B>

<P>We previously provided feedback (dated March 21, 2015) and your many responses to numerous concerns did not address a highly specific concern regarding the baseline difference in history of prior stroke in ECASS III, and how adjusting for this may negate any evidence of efficacy for alteplase 3 to 4.5 hours after stroke onset. </P>
<P>The ECASS III trial (Hacke et al. New England Journal of Medicine 2008 25;359(13):1317-29) is the only trial supporting efficacy of alteplase 3 to 4.5 hours after stroke. A potentially serious risk of bias in ECASS III was the baseline difference in history of prior stroke, a finding that was present in 7.7% of alteplase patients and 14.1% of placebo patients.</P>
<P>Detailed discussions on baseline imbalances that were included in previous versions of this review (2000, 2003, or 2009) do not adequately cover the baseline difference in history of prior stroke in ECASS III and its specific influence on conclusions regarding efficacy 3 to 4.5 hours after stroke, either in ECASS III alone or in analysis of all available data for this timeframe.</P>
<P>This baseline difference was erroneously reported in ECASS III as non-significant in the original trial report in 2008 and not corrected until 2011, so none of this should be considered "settled" or referred to historically. In the 2008 ECASS III report, the adjusted analyses to show the primary outcome was robust when adjusting for baseline differences did not adjust for the history of prior stroke.<BR/>The P value for this baseline difference in history of stroke, a potentially confounding variable, was corrected online in 2011 (from 0.03 to 0.003) without a correction notice, and this is only known based on a letter published in another journal in 2012 (Shy. Journal of Emergency Medicine 2014;46(3):385-6. Epub 2012 November 8). This letter also reported a reanalysis of ECASS III based on available summary data and limited to the 89% of patients without a prior stroke, which found no significant effect on the primary outcome.</P>
<P>Thus, this specific key baseline difference appears to be the primary contributor to the "statistically significant benefit" reported in ECASS III and conclusions of efficacy derived from this data or any other data should require substantial transparency and scrutiny to be accepted.</P>
<P>The ECASS III trial data is reported to be available at clinicalstudydatarequest.com and a reanalysis using the original data could be conducted independently. Until such reanalysis is done, it is most prudent to acknowledge this specific risk of bias, recognize its potential effect on the overall body of evidence specific to use of alteplase 3 to 4.5 hours after stroke, and not make conclusions about alteplase use 3 to 4.5 hours after stroke that extrapolate from data outside this timeframe or analyses that have not accounted for such risk of bias.</P>

<FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2016-01-05 10:47:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We thank Dr Alpers and colleagues for their continuing interest in the review of thrombolysis in acute ischaemic stroke. We are sorry that our responses did not address one highly specific concern.</P>
<P>To summarise, in ECASS 3, there was a difference in history of stroke (7.7% in the patients allocated to alteplase and 14.1% in the patients allocated to placebo). You are concerned that this difference in baseline characteristic is enough to account for the apparent benefit of rt-PA on mRS 0 to 1 at 90 days that was seen in ECASS 3, which only randomised patients between 3 to 4.5 hours after stroke. You cite a letter by Shy published in the Journal of Emergency Medicine 2014 in support of this concern. Shy refers to an adjusted analysis done by Bluhmki et al [1] restricted to the 89% of patients without a prior stroke in ECASS 3, which produced an odds ratio for the effect of rt-PA on mRS 0 to 1 of 1.19, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.59. You interpret this to mean that there is no benefit of rt-PA within the 3 to 4.5 hour time window.</P>
<P>We believe that the loss of significance when analysis is restricted to 89% of the data is more likely due to the diminished sample. Bluhmki et al [1] also performed a fully adjusted analysis including prior stroke, and also reported several additional outcomes and subgroup analyses beyond those provided in the original NEJM primary report [2]. In the fully adjusted model of the effect of rt-PA on mRS 0 to 1 at 90 days, Bluhmki et al [1] adjusted for NIHSS, age, weight, onset to treatment time, diastolic and systolic blood pressure, dose in mg/kg body weight, smoking, previous stroke, previous diabetes, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, previous use of antithrombotic drugs, and sex, giving an OR for mRS 0 to 1 at 90 days after stroke of 1.43 (95% CI 1.02, 2.00, P value = 0.040), which was no different to the OR in the model that included about half of those variables but not prior stroke (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.02-1.98, P value = 0.037) and the analysis that was completely unadjusted (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.02-1.76, P value = 0.038): see Figure 3 in 1. This would suggest that the effect of prior stroke is unlikely to be sufficient to negate the positive result of ECASS 3 on mRS 0 to 1.</P>
<P>We note two further points.</P>
<OL>
<LI>None of the trials were especially large. As we explain in the review, a consequence is that several trials go from positive to neutral, or neutral to positive, simply by switching between mRS 0 to 1 and mRS 0 to 2, or between mRS 3 to 6 and mRS 2 to 6 as the outcome. Figures 1.9, 1.10, 1.12, 1.13, etc, explore this effect in the Review and it is described in the <LINK TAG="RESULTS" TYPE="SECTION">Results</LINK> and discussed in detail in the <LINK TAG="DISCUSSION" TYPE="SECTION">Discussion</LINK>. This illustrates that the data should be viewed in totality rather than focusing too closely on individual trials, which of course is the purpose of Cochrane reviews.</LI>
<LI>You are concerned that the imbalance in ECASS 3 is important because ECASS 3 was the only trial that randomised in the 3 to 4.5 hour time window. However, several other trials also randomised in that time window although not exclusively. Unfortunately, as explained in a previous response, not enough of those trials published tabular data on the 3 to 4.5 hour window to make a tabular meta-analysis feasible, therefore we were not able to provide the 3 to 4.5 hour time window separately. However, as stated in the Review, there is now an individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis which includes ECASS 3. This IPD, performed by independent statisticians, has published a very detailed analysis of the effect of rt-PA by time, with adjustments, and clearly showed that there is benefit for rt-PA between 3 and 4.5 hours after stroke [3], indeed up to between 4.5 and 5 hours after stroke, when considering all the data.</LI>
</OL>
<P>The Cochrane Review has several sections on risk of bias focusing on the main messages that apply to multiple trials. For example, about half the trials had various baseline imbalances, which were inevitable as they did not use central randomisation with minimisation, and some were of similar size or worse than the prior stroke imbalance in ECASS 3 (like those in NINDS). We believe that these major messages are more relevant than to focus on only one trial. Indeed, Cochrane editorial policy means that the limited space precludes providing very detailed descriptions of all variables in all trials.</P>
