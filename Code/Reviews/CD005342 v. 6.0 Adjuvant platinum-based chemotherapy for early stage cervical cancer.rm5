<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-11-03 13:13:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>
<B>Background </B>
<BR/>Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women. Most women with early stage cervical cancer (stages I to IIA) are cured with surgery or, radiotherapy, or both. Radiotherapy uses high energy x-rays to damage tumour cells. Chemotherapy (anti-cancer) drugs use different ways to stop tumour cells dividing so they stop growing or they die.</P>
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
<BR/>We undertook this review because it was unclear whether chemotherapy with a drug called cisplatin offered additional benefits or risks to women with early stage cancer with risk factors for recurrence, when given after surgery, after radiotherapy, or both. (Risks for recurrence include tumour spread to the lymph nodes, spread into the lymph and blood vessels, tumour depth of more than 10 mm, microscopic invasion of the connective tissues next to the womb, non-squamous type of cancer, and when it is unlikely that surgery has removed all the tumour cells).<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>Main Findings</B>
<BR/>In this review, we analysed data from four small trials of unclear quality. It was not possible to separate data of bulky early stage disease (stage IB2 and IIA lesions greater than 4 cm) from the overall results. We found limited evidence to suggest that the addition of cisplatin chemotherapy to radiotherapy prolongs survival (time to death) and delays progression of the cancer when given after surgery to women with cervical cancer stage IA2 to IIA with risk factors for recurrence. The combined therapy was associated with more severe side effects than radiotherapy alone.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the Evidence</B>
<BR/>This evidence is limited by the small numbers and moderate quality methodological quality of included studies.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>What are the conclusions</B>?<BR/>We conclude that it seems appropriate to offer these women chemotherapy plus radiotherapy after surgery, however, more evidence regarding the relative benefits and risks is needed; this will hopefully be provided by the results of three ongoing trials.</P>

<P>This is the second updated version of the original Cochrane review published in the Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 3.<BR/>
<BR/>Most women with early cervical cancer (stages I to IIA) are cured with surgery or radiotherapy, or both. We performed this review originally because it was unclear whether cisplatin-based chemotherapy after surgery, radiotherapy or both, in women with early stage disease with risk factors for recurrence, was associated with additional survival benefits or risks.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-11-03 12:19:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy after radical hysterectomy, radiotherapy, or both in the treatment of early stage cervical cancer.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-11-03 12:19:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>For the original 2009 review, we searched the Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 1), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, BIOLOGICAL ABSTRACTS and CancerLit, the National Research Register and Clinical Trials register, with no language restriction. We handsearched abstracts of scientific meetings and other relevant publications. We extended the database searches to November 2011 for the first update and to September 2016 for the second update.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-04-26 10:50:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy (after radical surgery, radiotherapy or both) with no adjuvant chemotherapy, in women with early stage cervical cancer (stage IA2-IIA) with at least one risk factor for recurrence.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-05-14 11:12:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Daniela D Rosa">
<P>Two review authors extracted data independently. Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model, with death and disease progression as outcomes.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-11-07 17:03:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>For this second updated version we identified only one small trial reporting grade 4 toxicity results, without disease-free or overall survival data with a median follow-up of 16 months.</P>
<P>From the first updated version, we identified three trials that were ongoing, and remain so in 2016.</P>
<P>Four trials including 401 women with evaluable results with early cervical cancer were included in the meta-analyses. The median follow-up period in these trials ranged from 29 to 42 months. All women had undergone surgery first. Three trials compared chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone; and one trial compared chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone. It was not possible to perform subgroup analyses by stage or tumour size.</P>
<P>Compared with adjuvant radiotherapy, chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy significantly reduced the risk of death (two trials, 297 women; hazard ratio (HR) = 0.56, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.36 to 0.87) and disease progression (two trials, 297 women; HR = 0.47, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.74), with no heterogeneity between trials (I² = 0% for both meta-analyses). Acute grade 4 toxicity occurred significantly more frequently in the chemotherapy plus radiotherapy group than in the radiotherapy group (three trials, 321 women; risk ratio (RR) 6.26, 95% CI 2.50 to 15.67). We considered the evidence for all three outcomes to be of a moderate quality, using the GRADE approach due to small numbers and limited follow-up in the included studies. In addition, it was not possible to separate data for bulky early stage disease.</P>
<P>In the one small trial that compared adjuvant chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy with adjuvant radiotherapy alone there was no difference in disease recurrence between the groups (one trial, 71 women; HR = 1.34; 95% CI 0.24 to 7.66) and overall survival was not reported. We considered this evidence to be of a low quality.</P>
<P>No trials compared adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy with no adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery for early cervical cancer with risk factors for recurrence.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-11-03 13:13:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>The addition of platinum-based chemotherapy to adjuvant radiotherapy (chemoradiation) may improve survival in women with early stage cervical cancer (IA2-IIA) and risk factors for recurrence. Adjuvant chemoradiation is associated with an increased risk of severe acute toxicity, although it is not clear whether this toxicity is significant in the long term due to a lack of long-term data. This evidence is limited by the small numbers and low to moderate methodological quality of the included studies. We await the results of three ongoing trials, which are likely to have an important impact on our confidence in this evidence.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-11-03 13:14:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>This is the second update of the original review that was published in the <I>Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,</I> 2009, Issue 3.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-11-03 13:14:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Despite significant advances in the screening and treatment of cervical dysplasia, cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women (<LINK REF="REF-GLOBOCAN-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">GLOBOCAN 2012</LINK>). Worldwide, there are more than 500,000 new cases of cervical cancer each year, accounting for around 8% of all cancers diagnosed in women. A woman's risk of developing cervical cancer by the age of 75 ranges from 0.9% in more developed countries to 1.6% in less developed countries; the risk of dying from cervical cancer is 0.3% and 0.9% in more- and less developed countries, respectively. Worldwide, over 260,000 women die from cervical cancer every year; over 230,000 of these deaths being in less developed countries. In Europe, about 60% of women with cervical cancer survive five years after diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-EUROCARE-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">EUROCARE 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging of cervical cancer, determined at the time of primary diagnosis, is summarised in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> (<LINK REF="REF-Benedet-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benedet 2003</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-11-03 13:14:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Most women with early lesions (stages I to IIA) are cured with surgery or radiotherapy alone. However, patients who present with metastatic disease or locally advanced lesions are at a significant risk of recurrence and account for most cervical cancer deaths (<LINK REF="REF-Im-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Im 2002</LINK>). These deaths occur despite current surgical and radiotherapy protocols, often as a direct result of local or in-field treatment failure (<LINK REF="REF-Im-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Im 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The treatment of women with stage IA1 or micro-invasive cervical cancer usually consists of local excision (a loop or cone biopsy), or a simple hysterectomy. Women with stage IA2 to IIA lesions require either radical hysterectomy with bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection or radiotherapy, combining whole pelvic teletherapy with brachytherapy. There is a trend to increased use of primary radiotherapy with increased stage of disease (<LINK REF="REF-Benedet-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benedet 2003</LINK>). These treatments (radical surgery and radiotherapy) are considered equally effective with respect to local control and survival if lesions are small and nodal metastasis are absent (<LINK REF="REF-Holtz-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holtz 2002</LINK>); however, for bulky early lesions (IB2 and IIA), chemoradiation (as primary treatment or after surgery) is considered to be more effective in improving survival and reducing recurrence than radiotherapy alone (<LINK REF="REF-CCCMAC-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">CCCMAC 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Disease control for early lesions with risk factors such as lymph node metastasis, lymphovascular space invasion, depth invasion more than 10 mm, parametrial invasion (<LINK REF="REF-Ho-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ho 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lai-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lai 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Park-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Park 1997</LINK>), non-squamous histology (<LINK REF="STD-Ikeda-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Ikeda 1994</LINK>) and positive surgical margins (<LINK REF="STD-Rushdan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rushdan 2004</LINK>) is difficult. Retrospective studies analysing the outcome of high-risk women after adjuvant radiotherapy found that radiotherapy decreased the incidence of local recurrence with little or no effect on overall survival (OS) (<LINK REF="REF-Kinney-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kinney 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Monk-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Monk 1994</LINK>). These findings are supported by a Cochrane review (<LINK REF="STD-Rogers-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Rogers 2012</LINK>). Furthermore, many women with these risk factors are at increased risk for subclinical dissemination of the disease, which will not be affected by radiotherapy directed to the pelvis. To eradicate micrometastases, <LINK REF="STD-Wertheim-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Wertheim 1985</LINK> added chemotherapy to radiotherapy, with an apparent improvement in survival rates when compared to historical controls. Cisplatin-based regimens, evaluated on the basis of shrinkage of the tumour, are the most effective chemotherapy regimens (<LINK REF="STD-Morton-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Morton 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Park-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Park 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>The complete response rate to primary treatment of early stage disease ranges from 70% to 90%, with an overall five-year survival for stage I disease in excess of 90% (<LINK REF="REF-Benedet-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benedet 2003</LINK>). Adjuvant therapies may improve survival but are associated with several adverse effects and toxicities. Early morbidity from radiotherapy is most frequently seen in the rectosigmoid (around 60%) with proctitis, tenesmus, diarrhoea, fistula, stenosis and ulceration. In one third of patients, toxicity within the urinary bladder such as cystitis, fistula, ulceration and contracted bladder may occur. Local dermal toxicity (oedema, erythema, pigmentation, fibrosis and ulceration) is reported in 20% of patients and gynaecological toxicity (vaginitis, dryness, narrowing, shortening, dyspareunia, necrosis or ulceration of the cervix, uterus infection, pyometra, hematometra, perforation of the uterus and necrosis of the uterus) in 10%. Furthermore, there is a 5% chance of developing late pelvic complications following intra-cavitary and external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), the most frequent being cystitis and proctitis (<LINK REF="REF-Maduro-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maduro 2003</LINK>). Reviews of chemoradiation in the treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer have shown greater acute haematological and gastro-intestinal toxicity in the combination arm (<LINK REF="REF-CCCMAC-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">CCCMAC 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Green-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 2005</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-11-03 13:14:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>There is no consensus about the place of chemotherapy in the adjuvant treatment of early stage (stages I to IIA) cervical cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Curtin-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curtin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kato-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kato 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lin-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lin-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mossa-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mossa 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nitz-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nitz 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thomas-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 1996</LINK>). Adding therapies also adds potential adverse effects and toxicities. We aimed to help clarify the risks and benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy for early cervical cancer by performing this systematic review. Adjuvant radiotherapy for early cervical cancer is the subject of a separate Cochrane review (<LINK REF="STD-Rogers-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Rogers 2012</LINK>), as is chemoradiation for locally advanced cervical cancer (<LINK REF="REF-CCCMAC-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">CCCMAC 2010</LINK>).</P>

<P>For the first version of this review, we conducted the following searches to identify all published and unpublished RCTs, without language restrictions: Specialised Register (SR) of the Cochrane Gynaecological, Neuro-oncology and Orphan Cancers (CGNOC), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library, 2009, Issue 1, MEDLINE (January 1990 to 2009), Embase (January 1990 to 2009), LILACS (January 1990 to 2009), BIOLOGICAL ABSTRACTS (January 1990 to 2009) and Cancerlit (January 1990 to 2009). See <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK> for the MEDLINE and Embase search strategies used. The search strategies were developed and executed by the author team for the original review.</P>
<P>The first updated version of the review searches of the SR, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and LILACS (<LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>) were performed in November 2011 by the CGNOC Information Specialist, who also searched the MetaRegister (<A HREF="http://www.controlled-trials.com/mrct/">http://www.controlled-trials.com/mrct/</A>) for ongoing trials.</P>

<P>For the orginal version of the review, two review authors (DDR, LRM) undertook study selection and extracted data independently to assess whether the studies met the specified inclusion criteria. Any discrepancies were resolved by a third and a fourth review author (ATS, MCB). The review authors were blind to names of authors, institutions and journals. For this second updated version, two review authors selected the studies (FSF, DDR) as described in the inclusion criteria.<BR/>

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2016-11-04 10:16:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For the included studies in the original version of the review, five review authors (DDR, LRM, MCB, MIE, ATS) independently abstracted the following data to specifically designed, data collection forms: characteristics of patients and interventions, study quality, endpoints and deviations from protocol (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>). Differences between review authors were resolved by discussion or by appeal to a third review author if necessary. When necessary, we sought additional information from the principal investigator of the trial concerned. For this second updated version of the review, two review authors (FSF, DDR) extracted data from the one new included study.</P>
<P>For time-to-event (survival) data, we extracted the log of the hazard ratio (HR) [log(HR)] and its standard error from trial reports. If these were not reported, we digitised the published Kaplan-Meier survival curves using Adobe Photoshop (<LINK REF="REF-Adobe-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adobe 2007</LINK>) and noted the minimum and maximum duration of follow-up, in order to estimate the log(HR) and its standard error using the methods of <LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>. We performed these calculations in Stata 9 (<LINK REF="REF-StataCorp-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">StataCorp 2005</LINK>), using a specially written program, which yielded the reported log(HR) and variance when used on the data presented in Table V of <LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>. If possible, we also extracted the log-rank or Cox P value, and number of observed events by treatment arm, in order to make alternative estimates of the log(HR) and its standard error (<LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>For one trial for which unpublished individual patient data were available (<LINK REF="STD-Protocol-CE3005" TYPE="STUDY">Protocol CE3005</LINK>), we used Cox regression to estimate log(HR) and its standard error for overall and recurrence-free survival, both unadjusted and adjusted for age (<LINK REF="REF-McCullagh-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCullagh 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>For dichotomous outcomes (adverse events), we extracted the number of patients in each treatment arm who experienced the outcome of interest and the number of patients assessed at endpoint, in order to estimate a risk ratio (RR).</P>

<P>1) <LINK REF="STD-Peters-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Peters 2000</LINK>: 268 women with clinical stage IA2, IB or IIA carcinoma of the cervix treated by surgery were randomised to receive either adjuvant pelvic radiotherapy or pelvic radiotherapy plus four cycles of chemotherapy with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil. After randomisation, 25 (9%) women were deemed ineligible and so 243 women were assessed: 116 in the radiotherapy-only arm and 127 in the radiotherapy and chemotherapy arm. In the radiotherapy-only arm, three women refused radiotherapy and one was not treated because of physician discretion; in the radiotherapy plus chemotherapy arm, one woman was not treated due to a surgical complication, five women refused chemotherapy and four women refused both chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Accrual took place between 1991 and 1996 in the US. Women were followed up for a median of 42 months.</P>
<P>2) <LINK REF="STD-Tattersall-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Tattersall 1992</LINK>: 71 women with clinical stage IB or IIA treated by radical hysterectomy were randomised to receive either pelvic radiotherapy (n = 37) or three cycles of chemotherapy with cisplatin, vinblastine and bleomycin followed by pelvic radiotherapy (n = 34). One woman randomised to receive radiotherapy alone refused all treatment and two women randomised to receive chemotherapy plus radiotherapy refused chemotherapy. Accrual of women took place between May 1985 and November 1990 in Australia. Women were followed up for a median of 30 months.</P>
<P>3) <LINK REF="STD-Protocol-CE3005" TYPE="STUDY">Protocol CE3005</LINK>: Women with clinical stage IB or IIA were randomised to receive either adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy (n = 27) or adjuvant radiotherapy only (n = 30).Three women were not followed up after randomisation: one in the radiotherapy plus chemotherapy arm and two in the radiotherapy-only arm. Hence 26 and 28 women were evaluated in the radiotherapy plus chemotherapy and radiotherapy-only arms, respectively. Accrual of women took place between September 1988 and October 1995 in the UK. Patients were followed up for a median of 29.5 months.</P>

There were 27 episodes of grade 4 toxicity in 21 patients in the combination arm, most of which were haematological, and four episodes of grade 4 toxicity in four patients in the radiotherapy-only arm. There was one late death in a patient treated with radiotherapy alone that may have been treatment-related. The numbers of women in each arm who experienced grade 3 toxicities were not reported.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2016-11-03 13:48:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-11-03 13:47:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>We found four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of the following comparisons: adjuvant chemotherapy plus radiotherapy versus adjuvant radiotherapy (three trials enrolling 364 women of whom 321 (88%) were assessed) and adjuvant chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy versus adjuvant radiotherapy (one trial assessing 71 women). All included trials used chemotherapy regimens consisting of cisplatin alone or in combination with other agents and all included women who had undergone surgery. No trials compared adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery with no adjuvant chemotherapy.</P>
<P>Heterogeneous evidence from two small trials showed that the addition of chemotherapy to the radiotherapy regimen reduced the risk of death by between 13% and 64% and reduced the risk of disease progression by between 26% and 70% (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). This corresponds to an absolute benefit in overall survival (OS) of 12% and in progression-free survival (PFS) of 16%.</P>
<P>Overall, the risk of severe adverse events was significantly higher among women who received radiotherapy and chemotherapy than among those who received radiotherapy alone.</P>
<P>The trial comparing adjuvant chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone (<LINK REF="STD-Tattersall-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Tattersall 1992</LINK>) found little difference in outcomes between the two treatment groups (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>); it should be noted that in this trial chemotherapy was given sequentially and not in combination with radiotherapy.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-11-03 13:47:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>One important observation is that the studies analysed in this systematic review included women with bulkier disease (stage IB2 and IIA). Nowadays, it is widely accepted that these women should not be treated primarily with surgery as concurrent chemoradiation improves OS and PFS of women with locally advanced cervical cancer (<LINK REF="REF-CCCMAC-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">CCCMAC 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Green-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 2005</LINK>). It is possible that the exclusion of women with bulky early lesions from the trials could alter these results.</P>
<P>Chemotherapy toxicity may delay radiotherapy, which may be harmful, since local disease control has been shown to fall by up to 1% per day if treatment is prolonged beyond seven weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Perez-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perez 1995</LINK>). We were unable to analyse late toxicity as this was not reported by the included trials. While acute side effects are generally of short duration and resolve with medical management (<LINK REF="STD-Morris-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Morris 1999</LINK>), the late complications of radiotherapy can lead to damage which can be difficult to reverse, and may permanently impair quality of life (QoL). As data on late morbidity are sparse, there is insufficient evidence to say whether it increases with combined therapy (<LINK REF="REF-CCCMAC-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">CCCMAC 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Green-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>We were unable to obtain data about QoL. Increasing interest in the systematic assessment of QoL in cancer patients using standardised, self-administered instruments has emerged over the past two decades, and has become an important focus in the evaluation of the benefit of newer therapies (<LINK REF="REF-Ganz-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ganz 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sloan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sloan 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>We found no trials comparing platinum-based chemotherapy with no platinum-based chemotherapy after surgery, or after primary radiotherapy, for early cervical cancer. Such trials would not be ethical in high-risk patients as, even although adjuvant radiotherapy has not been shown to improve survival in these women (<LINK REF="STD-Rogers-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Rogers 2012</LINK>), chemoradiation has been shown to improve survival compared with radiotherapy in locally advanced disease (<LINK REF="REF-CCCMAC-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">CCCMAC 2010</LINK>). Ongoing studies in this field, comparing chemoradiation with primary radiotherapy for early cervical cancer without high-risk factors (<LINK REF="STD-Hong-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Hong 2013</LINK>), and comparing chemoradiation with radiotherapy after surgery in women with intermediate- and high-risk factors (<LINK REF="STD-GOG-0263" TYPE="STUDY">GOG 0263</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NCT-00806117" TYPE="STUDY">NCT 00806117</LINK>), should further elucidate the role of platinum-based chemotherapy in this disease.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-11-03 13:48:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>It is unclear whether the PFS reported by <LINK REF="STD-Peters-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Peters 2000</LINK> is the same as the disease-free survival (DFS) reported by <LINK REF="STD-Curtin-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Curtin 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Tattersall-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Tattersall 1992</LINK> and disease recurrence reported by <LINK REF="STD-Protocol-CE3005" TYPE="STUDY">Protocol CE3005</LINK> (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1995</LINK>). It should be noted that neither trial comparing radiotherapy plus chemotherapy with radiotherapy alone reported allocation concealment, which could have introduced bias. None of the included trials reported blinding of outcome assessors, which could have introduced bias in the assessment of disease progression; hence the meta-analysis of deaths is likely to have greater validity than that of disease progression. Inadequate concealment of allocation and lack of blinding are often associated with an exaggeration of the effects of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). None of the trials provided information about QoL.</P>
<P>The trials of <LINK REF="STD-Peters-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Peters 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Protocol-CE3005" TYPE="STUDY">Protocol CE3005</LINK> provide consistent evidence about overall and PFS, however, we downgraded this evidence due to the small size of the trials and the limited period of follow-up. Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimates of effect and may change the estimates. In particular, the trial of <LINK REF="STD-Tattersall-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Tattersall 1992</LINK> may have yielded an inconclusive result because it was so small that it did not have adequate statistical power. It is possible that the limited number of patients enrolled in these studies could be due to the low incidence of cervical cancer in the countries (Australia, UK, USA) in which these trials were conducted. In Australia (<LINK REF="REF-SACR-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">SACR 2003</LINK>), the incidence of cervical cancer is declining. Only 43 new cases of invasive cervical cancer were diagnosed in 2001. The incidence of cervical cancer was reduced by 38% between the years of 1997 to 1999, in comparison with the period of 1977 to1981 (<LINK REF="REF-SACR-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">SACR 2001</LINK>). In addition, the incidence in 2001 showed a 25% reduction when compared with the incidence seen in 1998 to 2000. This downward trend is attributed mostly to the screening and detection of precursor lesions, and their early treatment. The same has occurred in the USA, where the incidence of cervical cancer declined from 13 cases/100,000 women per year in 1975 to 1979 to eight cases/100,000 women in the year 2000 (<LINK REF="REF-NCI-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCI 2004</LINK>). In developing countries, on the other hand, the numbers are markedly different, with incidences of cervix cancer as high as 58 cases/100,000 women per year and 31 cases/100,000 women per year in Bolivia and Brazil, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-PAHO-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">PAHO 2003</LINK>). Therefore, large multicentre RCTs should include centres in developing countries, where there is a higher prevalence of this disease.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-11-03 13:48:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>A comprehensive search was performed, including searches of conference abstracts and clinical trial registers for unpublished results; and all studies were sifted and data extracted by at least two review authors independently for the first version of this review. We restricted the included studies to RCTs as they provide the best evidence available. Hence, we have attempted to reduce bias in the review process.</P>
<P>The greatest potential bias in this review was that the report of <LINK REF="STD-Peters-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Peters 2000</LINK> was based on an interim analysis of the data which rejected the null hypothesis of no benefit of chemotherapy and so may over-estimate the benefit of the combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy.

Similar results were found in a systematic review of concurrent chemoradiation for locally advanced cancer of the uterine cervix (stage IB to IVA), giving an absolute benefit of 10% in OS and of 13% in PFS (<LINK REF="REF-Green-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 2005</LINK>). In the meta-analysis of <LINK REF="REF-Green-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 2005</LINK>, acute toxicity, predominantly haematological and gastro-intestinal, was increased in the combined arms (concomitant chemoradiation) of all trials evaluating locally advanced cervical cancer. The <LINK REF="REF-CCCMAC-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">CCCMAC 2010</LINK> review of individual patient data found an absolute OS benefit of chemoradiation versus radiotherapy of 6% (P &lt; 0.001) in locally advanced cervical cancer. Furthermore, they found that the earlier stage lesions may be associated with a greater benefit (10% for stage IA to IIA).</P>

<P>Women with operable early stage cervical cancer (IA2 to IIA) may benefit from the addition of cisplatin-based chemotherapy to adjuvant radiotherapy. However, since subgroup analyses according to stage and size were not possible, it is not clear that the survival benefits apply equally to all early stage lesions. Severe acute toxicities are more likely to occur with chemoradiation than with radiotherapy alone. There is insufficient evidence on late toxicity.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-11-03 13:48:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>There are very few trials in this area due to difficulties in accrual. We identified three ongoing trials: one trial comparing primary radiotherapy with primary chemoradiation in stage IB to IIB cervical cancer with no high-risk factors (<LINK REF="STD-Hong-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Hong 2013</LINK>) and two multicentre trials comparing adjuvant chemoradiation with adjuvant radiotherapy in stages I to IIA with intermediate- and high-risk factors (<LINK REF="STD-GOG-0263" TYPE="STUDY">GOG 0263</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NCT-00806117" TYPE="STUDY">NCT 00806117</LINK>). In addition to these ongoing trials, RCTs comparing adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy with adjuvant radiotherapy and/or chemoradiation for early invasive cervical cancer would be helpful to our understanding of the treatment options for this condition. Such trials should be stratified by FIGO stage and should include evaluation of QoL and toxicity. Since cervical cancer is much more prevalent in developing countries, researchers should collaborate with centres in these regions.</P>

<LI>For continuous outcomes (e.g. quality of life (QoL) measures), we planned to pool the mean differences between the treatment arms at the end of follow-up using the mean difference method if all trials measured the outcome on the same scale, or using the standardised mean difference method otherwise.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with clinical stage IA(2), IB, and IIA carcinoma of the cervix, initially treated with radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy, and who had positive pelvic lymph nodes and/or positive margins and/or microscopic involvement of the parametrium were eligible for this study. Patients were randomized to receive RT or RT + CT. Patients in each group received 49.3 GY RT in 29 fractions to a standard pelvic field. Chemotherapy consisted of bolus cisplatin 70 mg/m(2) and a 96-hour infusion of fluorouracil 1,000 mg/m(2)/d every 3 weeks for four cycles, with the first and second cycles given concurrent to RT. RESULTS: Between 1991 and 1996, 268 patients were entered onto the study. Two hundred forty-three patients were assessable (127 RT + CT patients and 116 RT patients). Progression-free and overall survival are significantly improved in the patients receiving CT. The hazard ratios for progression-free survival and overall survival in the RT only arm versus the RT + CT arm are 2.01 (P =.003) and 1.96 (P =. 007), respectively. The projected progression-free survivals at 4 years is 63% with RT and 80% with RT + CT. The projected overall survival rate at 4 years is 71% with RT and 81% with RT + CT. Grades 3 and 4 hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity were more frequent in the RT + CT group. CONCLUSION: The addition of concurrent cisplatin-based CT to RT significantly improves progression-free and overall survival for high-risk, early-stage patients who undergo radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy for carcinoma of the cervix.&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2016-10-24 10:07:13 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">

Our group has previously demonstrated the tolerability of weekly paclitaxel combined with cisplatin during radiation therapy. We sought to determine the efficacy of this regimen in patients with &amp;quot;high risk&amp;quot; cervical cancer, and to determine the short- and long-term toxicity of this approach. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled surgically staged patients with positive peritoneal cytology, resectable nodal metastases, or primary tumor &amp;gt; 6 cm. Patients were treated using external beam radiation with concomitant cisplatin (50 mg/m2) during weeks 1, 4, and 7, and weekly paclitaxel (50 mg/m2), followed by four courses of adjuvant cisplatin (50 mg/m2) and paclitaxel (135 mg/m2). Toxicity, overall, and disease-free survival were evaluated. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients were enrolled, and 21 were evaluable. Patient allotment by FIGO stage was: IB1 - seven, IB2 - five, IIA - two, IIB - four, IIIB - two, IV - three. Twenty patients (95%) completed radiation treatment (median dose to point A was 8278 cGy). Seventeen patients (81%) completed all chemotherapy. At a median follow-up of 58 months the overall survival was 68%. Overall survival for patients with clinical Stage I and II disease was 82% at a median of 64 months. Hematologic toxicity was common but rarely resulted in treatment delays. Late complications requiring intervention (obstruction, fistula, significant lymphocyst) occurred in 11 patients (52%). CONCLUSION: The combination of paclitaxel and cisplatin appears efficacious in &amp;quot;high-risk&amp;quot; cervical cancer patients. Hematologic toxicity was common but tolerable. Long-term survival was common in these patients, however late toxicity was significant. This regimen should be investigated in collaborative phase III trials.&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2016-10-24 10:07:35 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">

In recent publications, patients with high risk cervical cancer had with adjuvant simultaneous radio-chemotherapy a better disease free and overall survival but a higher toxicity compared with patients received an adjuvant radiotherapy alone. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 34 patients with at least 2 risk factors for recurrence of cervical cancer were treated with adjuvant chemotherapy after radical hysterectomy. The protocol consisted of 3 cycles of ifosfamide 1.6 g/m2 (d 1-3) and carboplatin (AUC 4, d1) every three weeks. For cell protection 21 patients received amifostine 740 mg/m2 d1-3; this was followed by standard radiation therapy (50.4 Gy percutaneous and high-dose-rate-after-loading for 21 patients, 2 x 5 Gy). The dose determination of the substances and their toxicity were investigated. RESULTS: Patient (p) data: Median age 43 years (range: 25-70); pT1b-2a: n = 22; pT2b: n = 12; pN1: n = 28; pN0: n = 6; G3: n = 10; adeno- and adenosquamous carcinoma: n = 9, G3: n = 10, R1-resection: n = 5. 70.6% of these high-risk patients were disease-free after a median observation time of 40 (18-62) months. Median number of cycles of chemotherapy: 2.8. There was no more dose escalation than carboplatin according to AUC 4 possible. Hematologic toxicity (CTC grading, % of 96 documented cycles): anemia-grade 3-4: 30; -grade 1-2: 10.4; leukopenia-grade 3-4: 13, -grade 1-2: 21.7; alopecia-grade 3: all p.; cerebral neurotoxicity-grade 3-4: 8.3, -grade 1-2; 17.7; diarrhea under radiotherapy-grade 3-4: 2 p., -grade 1-2: 6 p. CONCLUSION: This combined sequential adjuvant therapy was effective and had an acceptable level of toxicity. A phase III study comparing adjuvant sequential chemo-radiotherapy with and without Erythropoeitin to counteract the negative effects of anemia started in Germany in 1999 and had randomized now about 270 patients.&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2016-10-24 10:07:44 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">

Patients with lymph node involvement at surgery are at high risk of recurrence and may benefit from adjuvant therapy, but many patients are treated with radical radiotherapy. At present there is no method of accurately identifying patients at high risk of recurrence in the latter group. A retrospective analysis of 141 surgically managed cases with stage I/II a cervical cancer is presented. The study aims were to characterize patients at high risk of relapse, identify independent prognostic variables predicting for relapse and, using these variables, develop a model, that would accurately predict high-risk patients. Univariate analysis identified depth of invasion, substage, lymph node involvement, lymphatic and blood vessel invasion and tumour differentiation as significant prognostic variables. After stratification for depth of invasion, which did not conform to the proportional hazards assumption implicit in the Cox model, Cox regression analysis showed substage, lymphatic and vascular invasion and histological tumour type to be independent prognostic variables. Using these variables, classification models were constructed that would be applicable to patients treated with either surgery or radiotherapy. Applying the models to 110 cases with greater than 18 months follow-up, 11/18 (61%) and 11/19 cases (58%) predicted as being at high risk of relapse have developed recurrence. Highly active chemotherapy is now available for this disease. We have demonstrated that combined bleomycin, ifosfamide and cisplatin (BIP) is one of the most active regimens in this disease. BIP produces cytoreduction in around 70% of patients with recurrent and primary advanced disease. Responses are achieved rapidly and acute radiotherapy toxicity is not enhanced by giving chemotherapy prior to radical local radiotherapy. A multicentre, prospective randomized trial testing the role of BIP as adjuvant therapy in patients with positive nodes at radical hysterectomy is now in progress. A complementary study testing the role of adjuvant chemotherapy in high-risk patients treated with radical radiotherapy is in preparation.&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2016-11-03 15:10:45 +0000" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">

METHODS: Prospective multicenter randomized Phase III trial. Patients with Stage IB-IIA cervical cancer undergoing RH-PLND were eligible. Risk factors include deep cervical invasion, tumor &amp;gt; or = 4 cm, parametrial involvement, nonsquamous histology, and/or pelvic lymph node metastasis. Chemotherapy consisted of cisplatin and bleomycin, alone or in combination with whole pelvic RT. Survival was determined by Kaplan-Meier estimate. RESULTS: Eighty-nine patients were entered from 1987 to 1994. Seventy-five patients had a Stage IB cancer and 14 patients had Stage IIA. Twenty-five patients had &amp;gt; or = 3 risk factors. Forty-four patients received chemotherapy alone vs 45 patients treated with chemotherapy and RT. Nineteen patients had recurrences and 16 patients have died. Nine of 44 (20%) patients receiving chemo alone recurred compared to 10/45 (22%) patients receiving chemo and RT (P=ns).

Ninety five patients received adjuvant postoperative external radiotherapy (average 4800 cGY). One hundred twenty patients were F.I.G.O. stage IB, and 25 were clinical stage IIA. Indications for adjuvant radiotherapy included 3 categories of patients with high risk factors: 1) pelvic lymph node metastases, 2) parametrial invasion and/or surgical margins involvement, 3) large volume, deep stromal penetration or uterine extension. Four percent of the patients suffered major gastrointestinal complications, 8.9% had major genito-urinary complications, 19 patients had lymphocytes and 2 patients complained of thromboembolic episodes. Of the 19 patients with major gastrointestinal or genito-urinary morbidity, 7 (38.8%) were related to radiotherapy. Thirty-nine patients had node involvement, 38 of these patients received radiotherapy and 5-year survival rate was 43.5% versus 87.7% in other cases (p &amp;lt; 0.001).

Here we present the results of concomitant chemo-radiation at high-risk situation of patients with cervical cancer after surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study comprised 34 patients with median age of 40 years (26-63 years) after Wertheim surgical technique for cervical cancer at the FIGO Stages IB (n = 19) and IIB (n = 15). All patients were treated between November 1995 and June 1999 by a schedule of concomitant chemoradiation. The indication for this treatment was given by the positive histological proof of lymph node metastasis, microvessel or lympho-vascular space involvement as well as a G3 grading. The chemo-therapy was given in week 1 and 5 (day 1-5 and day 29-33). The dosage of cisplatin was 20 mg/m2/d on every day and 5-FU was given as a 120-h infusion with 600 mg/m2/d. The external beam radiotherapy was applied to the pelvis with 1.8 Gy per fraction up to 50.4-54 Gy. In two patients the paraaortal region was irradiated too because of the involvement of these lymph nodes. RESULTS: The median observation time was 48 months (3-68 months). 30 patients are alive (88%) in complete response. Four patients died. The mean survival was 61 +/- 3 months. We have seen only slight acute toxicities of grade 1 and 2. Three patients suffered from a grade 3 diarrhea and three patients developed a grade 3 leukopenia. In seven patients we found a secondary lymphedema as a late toxicity. CONCLUSION: The concomitant chemoradiation containing cisplatin in high-risk situation for cervical cancer after surgery improves the outcome and survival in these patients.&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2012-05-14 11:23:52 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">

METHODS: One hundred one women with invasive cervical carcinoma (stage IB through early stage IIB) underwent radical hysterectomy at Saga Medical School Hospital. Of these patients, 53 with squamous or adenosquamous carcinoma were classified as high risk, based on the presence of one or more of the following high-risk factors for recurrence: 1) lymph node metastasis, 2) deep cervical stromal invasion (greater than 3/4 thickness), and 3) parametrial invasion. Adjuvant chemotherapy with a combination of cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (CDDP), vincristine, mitomycin C, and peplomycin (POMP), was prescribed. The outcome was compared with that for 127 patients who were classified as high risk under the same criteria and who received adjuvant radiotherapy at Kyushu University Hospital. RESULTS: The 5-year survival rates were much the same: 83.0% for adjuvant chemotherapy and 81.7% for adjuvant radiotherapy. In the chemotherapy group, intra- and extrapelvic recurrences accounted for 85 and 23% of all recurrences, respectively, whereas recurrences were noted for 38 and 71% in the radiotherapy group, respectively (P &amp;lt; .01). CONCLUSION: The use of adjuvant chemotherapy reduces extrapelvic recurrences.

METHODS: Two hundred and five FIGO stage bulky IB and IIB patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix treated with CCRT were divided into 2 groups: (1) CCRT alone (n=103, Group A) and (2) CCRT plus adjuvant chemotherapy (n=102, Group B), and treatment outcomes were retrospectively compared between the two patient groups. RESULTS: Only 63% of patients received all three planned cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy, while 16% received only one cycle because of increased treatment-related morbidity or other causes. There were no treatment-related deaths. Although 37 patients experienced failures after completion of treatment, no significant differences were found in patterns of local and regional failures between the two groups. The incidence of distant metastasis, including para-aortic or supraclavicular lymph node metastases, was not reduced in patients of Group B (8% in Group A vs. 7% in Group B). Overall five-year actuarial survival rates for Group A and Group B patients were 85% vs. 80%, and five-year disease-free survival rates were 83% vs. 78%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our data failed to show discernable therapeutic advantage of adjuvant chemotherapy with given after CCRT for the management of FIGO stage bulky IB and IIB uterine cervical cancer patients.

Analysis of patterns of failure after radical hysterectomy led to better stratification of patients into risk groups and incorporated testing of systemic agents in those considered at high risk of distant failure. Two recently reported randomized, clinical trials have greatly advanced our understanding of the role of postoperative therapy in cervix cancer. In patients with positive nodes, the use of combined adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation significantly improves relapse-free survival and overall survival, compared with radiation alone. For node-negative patients with other primary tumor risk features, pelvic radiation significantly improves relapse-free survival, compared with no further therapy. An observed improvement in survival for irradiated patients awaits statistical confirmation after maturation of the data. Further improvements in adjuvant therapy for high risk, early stage cervical cancer will come from enhanced definition of prognostic variables, better patient selection, and refinements in both local and systemic therapies.&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2009-04-20 11:21:51 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">

However, it has not been clearly demonstrated that adjuvant radiation, adjuvant chemotherapy, or both improve the outcome. To evaluate the effect of adjuvant treatment in patients with high-risk cervical cancer after radical hysterectomy, the Austrian Gynecologic Oncology Group conducted a prospective, randomized, multicenter clinical trial between 1989 and 1995. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seventy-six patients with stage IB-IIB cervical cancer treated with radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymph node metastases and/or vascular invasion randomly received adjuvant chemotherapy (400 mg/m2 carboplatin, and 30 mg bleomycin), standardized external pelvic radiation therapy, or no further treatment. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 4.1 years (range, 2-7) there were no statistically significant differences (P = 0.9530) in disease-free survival among the three treatment arms. CONCLUSION: The data suggest that adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation do not improve survival or recurrence rates in high-risk cervical cancer patients after radical hysterectomy. The most important treatment for these patients seems to be radical abdominal hysterectomy with systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy.&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2016-10-24 10:08:55 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">

However the optimal&lt;br&gt;postoperative therapy for node-positive patients remains to be defined.&lt;br&gt;MATERIALS AND METHODS: To determine the role of adjuvant therapy in stage Ib-IIa cervical carcinoma patients who had pelvic node metastases after radical&lt;br&gt;hysterectomy, a single institutional randomized controlled trial with factorial&lt;br&gt;design, comparing concurrent chemo-radiotherapy (CT + RT) versus chemotherapy (CT) or radiotherapy (RT) alone was conducted. Study endpoints included site of recurrence, time to recurrence, relapse-free and overall survivals, and toxicity of treatment. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 61 months, the 6-year relapse-free and overall survival rates of the 39 patients entered into this&lt;br&gt;trial were 78.2% and 85.2%, respectively. This trial was prematurely closed due&lt;br&gt;to suboptimal accrual and protocol violation. It is inconclusive regarding the&lt;br&gt;efficacy of CT because of the limitation of the sample size and the imbalance of&lt;br&gt;prognostic features by actual treatment. A model for risk group classification&lt;br&gt;of patients with stage Ib-II cervical carcinoma with pelvic node metastases from&lt;br&gt;a retrospective analysis was validated by this prospective cohort. The results&lt;br&gt;of this failed trial suggest that adjuvant CT alone seemed comparable to RT&lt;br&gt;alone or CT + RT in survival but was associated with significantly less&lt;br&gt;morbidity.

METHODS: Eight hundred ninety-one patients with Stage IB or II cervical carcinoma who underwent radical hysterectomy and bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy as primary treatment at a single institution were analyzed. Potential prognostic variables were studied.&lt;br&gt;RESULTS: Among the variables that could be assessed before treatment, depth of cervical stromal invasion (determined by magnetic resonance imaging), clinical&lt;br&gt;stage, tumor size, grade of differentiation, and DNA index (determined by flow&lt;br&gt;cytometry) were independent predictors of outcome in multivariate analysis using&lt;br&gt;a Cox regression model. Three distinct prognostic groups (low, intermediate, and&lt;br&gt;high risk) were defined using these variables. Five-year recurrence free&lt;br&gt;survival (RFS) rates for the low, intermediate, and high risk groups were 94.6%,&lt;br&gt;82.7%, and 62.3%, respectively (P = 0.0001), and overall survival (OS) rates&lt;br&gt;were 98.4%, 84.5%, and 68.7%, respectively (P = 0.0001). Among patients with&lt;br&gt;pelvic lymph node metastases who were free of parametrial extension, those who&lt;br&gt;received postoperative chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy had significantly&lt;br&gt;better RFS (P = 0.017) and OS (P = 0.043) than those who received no adjuvant&lt;br&gt;therapy. Among patients without pelvic lymph node metastases but at high risk of&lt;br&gt;recurrence, those who received adjuvant radiotherapy had significantly better&lt;br&gt;RFS (P = 0.015) and marginally improved OS (P = 0.087) compared with those who received no adjuvant therapy. CONCLUSIONS: A model containing assessable pretreatment variables for predicting the prognoses of patients with early stage cervical carcinoma was formulated. Subsets of patients for whom postoperative chemotherapy or radiotherapy might be beneficial were identified. The data from this retrospective review may be useful when future prospective trials of the treatment of early stage cervical carcinoma are designed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2016-10-24 10:09:13 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">

STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a&lt;br&gt;retrospective review of 482 surgically-treated patients of clinical stage Ib and&lt;br&gt;IIa cervical carcinoma from July 1986 to December 1994 at Kaohsiung Chang Gung&lt;br&gt;Memorial Hospital. Of these, 96 patients had pelvic lymph node metastases.&lt;br&gt;Clinicopathological variables, including the level of pretreatment squamous cell&lt;br&gt;carcinoma antigen (SCC-Ag), DNA flow cytometry analysis, and the use of&lt;br&gt;different adjuvant therapies were studied. RESULTS: Disease-free survival was&lt;br&gt;significantly worse among patients with S-phase fraction greater than 20% and&lt;br&gt;pretreatment SCC-Ag level above 5 ng/ml. Utilizing these significant variables,&lt;br&gt;we identified two distinct risk groups. Those patients without any of the risk&lt;br&gt;variables were categorized as the low-risk group. Those patients with either one&lt;br&gt;or both risk variables were categorized as the high-risk group.

Methods: Between Mar 1998 and Aug 2002, 162 patients of cervical cancer with Ib-IIa stage were investigated. 21 patients with bulky tumors ((greater-than or equal to4cm) were managed by cisplatin-based chemotherapy followed by radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy (Bulky-chemo group, BC group). The change of tumor size, the depth of stromal Invasion, lymph node metastasis and the involvement of surgical specimens were assessed after operation and compared with those in 57 patients with bulky tumors (Bulky-nonchemo group, BN group) and 84 patients with the tumor size less than 4cm (small group, S group) who underwent surgery as the first step of treatment. Chemotherapy with the same regimen was offered for another 1-2 cycles after operation and the survival situation was followed up. Results- The tumor size of 21 patients in BC group were decreased to varying degrees after chemotherapy, 15 patients were shown as clinical effectiveness (71.43%). And the blood loss during operation (352.35&amp;#177;19.01ml) was significantly lower than that in BN group (619.05&amp;#177;35.58mi), t=4.37) and that in S group (568.07&amp;#177;45.23mi, t=3.36) patients. The incidence of lymph node metastasis (9/78) in patients with bulky tumors was greatly higher than those with tumor size less than 4cm (3/84, X(2)=4.416); its prevalence rate of deep wall infiltration (8/78)(8n8) was also higher than that of the latter group (2/84), while with no statistical significance (X(2)=3.089). Histology showed that there was no case of marginal involvement in all patients. The ratio of both deep stromal invasion (1/21) and positive lymph node (2/21) in BC group was lower than that in BN group (7/57, 7/57 respectively), but neither with statistical significance (X(2)=0.0103 and 0.8193 respectively).

Further subgrouping of this category is therefore necessary to define the optimal treatment approach for individual cases. The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging system stratifies stage I tumors into two broad categories, stage IA (microinvasive) and stage IB (gross tumor). Management of women with stage IA disease is controversial. In the United States, patients with stromal invasion of less than 3 mm and no lymphvascular involvement are usually treated conservatively with simple hysterectomy. In selected patients who desire fertility, cone biopsy with negative surgical margins is also considered. Patients with invasion of more than 3 mm or lymphvascular space involvement are at risk for pelvic lymph node metastasis and are most often treated with radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy. Stage IB1 cervical cancer is managed by either radical surgery or radiotherapy with equivalent recurrence and survival rates. In patients with tumors less than 4 cm in diameter, the decision between radical surgery and radiotherapy is guided by patients' overall health and treatment preferences. For younger women, radical surgery is preferred because ovarian function can be preserved and vaginal stenosis secondary to radiation can be avoided. Radiation therapy is preferred for women who may not tolerate radical surgery. We always prefer primary radiation therapy for patients with tumors larger than 4 cm in diameter. Recent data convincingly demonstrate that the addition of cisplatin-based chemotherapy significantly improves overall survival rates in cervical cancer patients who undergo radiation therapy.&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2009-04-17 14:24:57 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">

Between 1990 and 1997, 403 women with advanced cervical cancer confined to the pelvis (stages IIB through IVA or stage IB or IIa with a tumor diameter of at least 5 cm or involvement of pelvic lymph nodes) were randomly assigned to receive either 45 Gy of radiation to the pelvis and para-aortic lymph nodes or 45 Gy of radiation to the pelvis alone plus two cycles of fluorouracil and cisplatin (days 1 through 5 and days 22 through 26 of radiation). Patients were then to receive one or two applications of low-dose-rate intracavitary radiation, with a third cycle of chemotherapy planned for the second intracavitary procedure in the combined-therapy group. RESULTS: Of the 403 eligible patients, 193 in each group could be evaluated. The median duration of follow-up was 43 months. Estimated cumulative rates of survival at five years were 73 percent among patients treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy and 58 percent among patients treated with radiotherapy alone (P=0.004). Cumulative rates of disease-free survival at five years were 67 percent among patients in the combined-therapy group and 40 percent among patients in the radiotherapy group (P&amp;lt;0.001). The rates of both distant metastases (P&amp;lt;0.001) and locoregional recurrences (P&amp;lt;0.001) were significantly higher among patients treated with radiotherapy alone. The seriousness of side effects was similar in the two groups, with a higher rate of reversible hematologic effects in the combined-therapy group. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of chemotherapy with fluorouracil and cisplatin to treatment with external-beam and intracavitary radiation significantly improved survival among women with locally advanced cervical cancer.&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2016-10-24 10:09:22 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">

METHODS: 72 patients, suffering from squamous cell&lt;br&gt;cervical carcinoma Stage IB-IIB (FIGO) who underwent radical hysterectomy with&lt;br&gt;lymph-node involvement confirmed at the final histological examination, were&lt;br&gt;enrolled. All the patients were treated with adjuvant chemotherapy (AC), which&lt;br&gt;included cisplatin, bleomycin and vinblastine, and were followed for a minimum&lt;br&gt;period of six years. The results were compared with those obtained with a&lt;br&gt;historical group of 78 patients, with comparable age, stage and lymph-node&lt;br&gt;involvement, on whom only radical surgery (RS) was performed. RESULTS: the&lt;br&gt;average total survival rate of the two groups (RS + AC vs RS) at five years was&lt;br&gt;63.9% and 55.1%, respectively (chi2 = 1.191; p = NS).

<REFERENCE MODIFIED="2016-10-24 10:09:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell" NOTES="&lt;p&gt;NON-RANDOMISED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Introduction: The traditional indications for adjuvant pelvic radiotherapy (RT) for International Federation of Obstetrics and Gynecology (FIGO) stage Ib1 lymph nodes-negative cervix carcinoma following radical surgery based on histopathological factors, such as deep stromal invasion and lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI), were often inconsistently applied. The perceived risk of relapse was subjectively determined. This pilot study attempts to determine if the treatment outcome will be affected when the indication for RT is based on the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) Risk Score (RS) and the field of adjuvant RT is tailored to the RS. Materials and Methods: From 1997 to 1999, 55 patients with FIGO stage Ib1 lymph nodes-negative cervical carcinoma limited to the cervix were prescribed RT following radical surgery, based on their RS, as follows: RS &amp;lt;=40, RT is omitted; RS &amp;gt;40 to &amp;lt;=120, modified (smaller) field RT; and RS &amp;gt;120, standard field pelvic RT. Their incidence and site of recurrence were compared with a similar cohort of 40 patients who were treated prior to 1997. Results: Prior to 1997, of the 40 patients, 10 patients were given standard field RT. There were 2 (5%) recurrent diseases. The mean duration of follow-up was 61.6 months (range, 1 to 103 months). The RS of 23 of the 30 patients who were not given RT were available. The mean RS was 22 with 5 patients having a score of &amp;gt;40. From 1997 onwards, of the 55 patients, 28 (51%) did not require RT, 13 (23%) were treated with modified (smaller) field RT and 14 (26%) were given standard field RT. There were 2 (3.6%) cases of relapse. The mean duration of follow-up was 36.4 months (range, 5 to 60 months). All patients with a RS of &amp;lt;40 did not suffer any relapse. Their survival outcomes were better when compared to patients who did not have any RT in the GOG Study. Conclusions: The results of this study indicated that postoperative adjuvant RT given to patients with a high GOG RS of &amp;gt;120, significantly improved their 5-year recurrence rate and disease-free survival, as compared with the similar group of patients who were without adjuvant therapy in the GOG study. Patients with a GOG risk-score of &amp;lt;40 may be safely spared from adjuvant pelvic RT. The current treatment protocol did not compromise the outcome in patients, compared with the use of a less precise treatment protocol in the past.&lt;br&gt;PMID: 15329758 &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2016-10-24 10:09:31 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">

METHODS: From July 1994 to June 2001, we retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 151 patients who had undergone radical abdominal hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy and paraaortic lymph nodes dissection at Ajou University Hospital for early cervical cancer (stages IA2, IB, IIA). CCRT was performed in 30 patients with high-risk factors such as positive pelvic lymph nodes, parametrial involvement, or positive surgical margins. Adjuvant chemotherapy consisted of cisplatin (70 mg/m(2) on day 1) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU; 1000 mg/m(2) on days 2-5) for four cycles every 4 weeks beginning 2-3 weeks after surgery. Pelvic radiotherapy was started concurrently at the second and third cycle of chemotherapy. We also analyzed the recurrence pattern and survival rates of 114 patients (control group) who received no adjuvant therapy after surgery. The mean follow-up period was 49 months (24-98 months). RESULTS: There were recurrences in three patients after CCRT (10%) and in five patients in the control group (4.4%). The actuarial 5-year overall survival rates for patients in CCRT and control group were 96.7% vs. 97.7%, respectively. The progression-free survival rates were 88.7% for the high-risk group and 95.4% for the non-high-risk group. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms good local control and 5-year overall and progression-free survival rates in high-risk cervical cancer patients after CCRT, which is comparable with the results of the control group. Our results indicate that adjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy seems to be effective in stages IA2-IIA cervical cancer patients with high-risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2009-04-17 14:24:56 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">

However, there&lt;br&gt;have been many problems to be solved. Five-year survival following treatment of&lt;br&gt;curative intent is reported to be 87% for stage I, 40% for stage III, and 14%&lt;br&gt;for stage IV. These 66% for stage II, have been unchanged for last two decades&lt;br&gt;and almost similar to those of patients with ovarian cancer. However, much&lt;br&gt;attention has not been paid to the unsatisfactory results for patients with&lt;br&gt;advanced stage, because the success of cytologic techniques in the diagnosis of&lt;br&gt;neoplastic changes in the epithelium of the uterine cervix resulted in dramatic&lt;br&gt;decrease in the incidence of cervical invasive malignancies, leading to the&lt;br&gt;improvement of the survival of all patients with cervical malignancies. To&lt;br&gt;improve such poor prognosis, effective systemic chemotherapy is required. This&lt;br&gt;review will focus on current data on chemotherapy mainly from USA and our&lt;br&gt;institute where our unique protocol, low-dose consecutive CDDP dosing method, is&lt;br&gt;being carried out. The encouraging chemotherapeutic results will prompt&lt;br&gt;investigators to challenge the new approaches to therapy that combine&lt;br&gt;chemotherapy which may precede operation or radiation therapy for advanced stage&lt;br&gt;disease or may follow the main treatment modalities in the adjuvant setting for&lt;br&gt;early stage disease with high risk factors for recurrence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2009-04-17 14:24:57 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">

Carcinoma of the cervix appears to be behaving like a systemic disease. Therefore, systemic measures should be considered in its therapy. The authors report the initial experience with the use of mitomycin C as a single agent adjuvant in 16 patients with Stage IB carcinoma of the cervix who had undergone Wertheim radical hysterectomy and were thought to be in this high-risk group. Fourteen of the patients are alive and free of disease after durations of follow-up ranging from 16 to 38 months, the disease-free survival at a median follow-up of 29 months being 87.5%. One patient required discontinuation of adjuvant chemotherapy because of severe marrow toxicity; however, in view of the presence of a multiple risk factors, pelvic irradiation was given instead.

In the 7-year period 1983 to 1989, 239 patients with stage IB and early IIA disease had radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy. One hundred and eight patients (45.2%) had various poor prognostic histological features and received adjuvant chemotherapy--70 had cisplatin, vinblastine, bleomycin (PVB), 16 had mitomycin C (MMC) and 22 others received mitomycin C + 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Although not randomised, the risk factors present in each group were identical. These patients have now been followed up for periods ranging from 8 to 14 years. All recurrences, except one, occurred within 23 months of surgery; in the remaining this occurred 8 years later. This suggests that very close long-term follow-up is needed. Recurrences were markedly higher in the group who refused adjuvant chemotherapy (31.6%). The 10-year survival in patients without risk factors was 97.2%. In those patients with risk factors refusing adjuvant therapy it was 73.7%. The adjuvant chemotherapy group had a better survival of 86.1% (P = 0.001). The 10-year survivals in patients with positive nodes were similar--66.7% in the MMC group and 71.4% in the PVB group. The 10-year survival in patients with squamous cell carcinoma was significantly better (90.3%) in the mitomycin C (and MMC + 5-FU) group compared to the PVB group (80.1%) (P = 0.005). The 10-year survival in patients with adenocarcinoma and adenosquamous carcinoma was significantly better (96.3%) in the PVB group compared to those receiving MMC (and MMC + 5-FU) (57.1%) (P = 0.01). It would, thus, appear that the adjuvant chemotherapy of choice for patients with squamous cell carcinoma would be MMC (and MMC + 5-FU) and for those with adenocarcinoma, the PVB regime.&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2009-04-17 14:24:57 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">

We evaluated the safety and efficacy of concomitant chemoradiation with cisplatin and high-dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy in patients with cervical cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 27 patients were included in our phase-II trial: 13 locally advanced cases (group A) and 14 adjuvant-therapy patients in high-risk situations (group B). A definitive radiotherapy was performed with 25 fractions of external beam therapy (1.8 Gy per fraction/middle shielded after eleven fractions). Brachytherapy was delivered at HDR schedules with 7 Gy in point A per fraction (total dose 35 Gy) in FIGO Stages IIB-IIIB. The total dose of external and brachytherapy was 70 Gy in point A and 52-54 Gy in point B. All patients in stage IVA were treated without brachytherapy. Adjuvant radiotherapy was performed with external beam radiotherapy of the pelvis with 1.8 Gy single-dose up to 50.4 Gy. Brachytherapy was delivered at HDR schedules with two fractions of 5 Gy only in patients with tumor-positive margins or tumor involvement of the upper vagina. The chemotherapeutic treatment schedule provided six courses of cisplatin 40 mg/m2 weekly recommended in the randomized studies GOG-120 and -123. RESULTS: A total of 18/27 patients (66.7%) completed all six courses of chemotherapy. Discontinuation of radiotherapy due to therapy-related morbidity was not necessary in the whole study group. G3 leukopenia (29.6%) was the only relevant acute toxicity. There were no differences in toxicity between group A and B. Serious late morbidity occurred in 2/27 patients (7.4%). 12/13 patients (92.3%) with IIB-IVA cervical cancer showed a complete response (CR). 13/14 adjuvant cases (92.8%) are free of recurrence (median follow up: 19.1 months). CONCLUSION: Concomitant chemoradiation with cisplatin 40 mg/m2 weekly x 6 using HDR brachytherapy represents a promising treatment of cervical cancer with an acceptable toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2016-10-24 10:09:39 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">

The patients were histologically classified into the squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) group and the adenocarcinoma (AD) group. In the SCC group (n = 518), 163 patients were given more than 300 mg/day of antimetabolite tablets for one year or more after the main therapy (hysterectomy or pelvic irradiation). In the AD group (n = 66), 36 patients were treated with the same dose of antimetabolites. The Kaplan-Meier overall and cancer specific survival analysis estimates that the chronic administration of antimetabolites did not improve the cumulative 5-year survival in the SCC group. In contrast, the cumulative 5-year survival rate in the AD group treated with antimetabolites (88%) was significantly higher than that without chemotherapy (64%) by Kaplan-Meier analysis. This significant improvement in the survival rate in the AD group due to antimetabolites was notable in patients in FIGO stage I or II treated with radical or semiradical hysterectomy, these results indicate that oral adjuvant chemotherapy with antimetabolites is useful for cervical adenocarcinoma, but not for squamous cell carcinoma.&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2016-10-24 10:09:48 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">

We determined the optimal CDDP dose for both weekly and monthly schedules during primary and adjuvant CCRT in patients with UCC. METHODS: The study was conducted as a phase I, dose-escalation trial. Concurrent CDDP was started at the dose of 30 mg/m(2) for the weekly schedule and at 50 mg/m(2) for the monthly schedule, and the doses were steadily escalated to the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). RESULTS: A total of 45 patients with UCC (25 receiving primary CCRT and 20 receiving adjuvant CCRT) were entered in the study. In both the primary and adjuvant CCRT patients, the MTD was observed to be 40 mg/m(2) for the weekly schedule and 80 mg/m(2) for the monthly schedule. Dose-limiting toxicity was observed in 10 patients (granulocytopenia in 9 patients and diarrhea in 1 patient). Disease recurrence was confirmed in 6 patients in the primary CCRT group during a mean follow-up period of 22.4 +/- 13.2 months, and in patients 3 in the adjuvant CCRT group during a mean follow-up period of 17.7 +/- 6.8 months. CONCLUSION: For Japanese patients with UCC receiving primary or adjuvant CCRT therapy, the recommended CDDP dose was determined to be 30 mg/m(2) for the weekly schedule and 75 mg/m(2) for the monthly schedule.&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2009-04-17 14:24:58 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">

Patients at high risk of recurrence include those with involved pelvic lymph nodes, lymphatic or vascular invasion in the cervix, tumor size &amp;gt;4 cm, grade 3 lesions, adenosquamous histology, parametrial invasion, and evidence of locally metastatic (noncontiguous) disease. We report the results of adjuvant chemotherapy (cisplatin and bleomycin) and pelvic radiotherapy in 32 patients with cervix cancer deemed to be at high risk of recurrence after radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy. The continuous disease-free survival rate for the 32 evaluable patients is 84% at a mean and median follow-up time of 28 months. Three patients are dead of disease and 2 patients are alive after treatment of local recurrences giving a survival rate of 91%. The 2 patients who are alive after disease recurrence demonstrated only locally recurrent disease while the 3 patients who have died with recurrent disease relapsed both locally and systemically. Complications of this treatment program were not significantly greater than those observed in prior studies using the combination of surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy without chemotherapy. When compared with the results from historical controls in a large series of similar patients at the same institution, the results in this pilot study are encouraging and would seem to justify a randomized prospective clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2012-05-14 11:23:52 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">

However, women with risk factors such as nodal metastasis may benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy, which was studied in women having surgery alone or surgery plus radiotherapy. Patients having surgery alone (S) (n=623) or surgery and radiotherapy (SR) (n=919) were randomly assigned to receive or not receive oral 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) for 1 year. The effect of various factors on survival was studied by multivariate analysis. Patients who received S obtained no benefit from 5-FU, whereas 5-FU-treated SR patients had significantly better 5-year survival than those not receiving chemotherapy (P=0.043). The SR patients without nodal metastases had a better survival rate if they received 5-FU (P&amp;lt;0.001), whereas those with nodal metastases did not.

METHODS: Clinical and pathologic data between 1985 and 1999 were reviewed. Associations between clinical and pathologic variables were tested using the Fisher's exact test. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method with significance being calculated using the Log Rank test. RESULTS: Six hundred radical hysterectomies were performed during the study period. Fifty-eight of these women (9.6% of all radical hysterectomies) were diagnosed with FIGO stage IB2 cancers. Sixteen patients (28%) had positive pelvic lymph nodes. Forty-six patients (79%) had invasion involving the outer 1/3 of the cervical stroma, six had positive vaginal margins while five had occult parametrial extension. After retrospective review of the histopathologic data from this case series, criteria from two recently published prospective multicenter Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) trials were applied to this data set. According to criteria established by GOG protocol 92, 30 (52%) patients should have theoretically received adjuvant pelvic radiation while 21 (36%) would have qualified for adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation according to the results of GOG protocol 109. In actual fact, only 35 patients (60%) received adjuvant radiotherapy and one received adjuvant chemo-radiation. Severe toxicity was unusual with two developing urinary fistulae and one having a pulmonary embolism. Despite the lack of adjuvant therapy in most cases, only 21 women (38%) recurred of whom 11 failed on the pelvic wall, with an estimated 5-year survival of 62.1%. CONCLUSIONS: Radical hysterectomy and tailored adjuvant radiation therapy in stage IB2 cervical cancer is feasible. Even without the liberal use of adjuvant therapy, survival in this high-risk group compares favorably to primary chemotherapy and radiation. According to recently published randomized clinical trials, most patients should receive adjuvant postoperative therapy. The benefits of this multimodality approach require randomized study.&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2009-04-17 14:24:57 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">

A combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy might improve the control of microscopic metastases. In this prospective study, 28 patients with risk factors after surgery for cervical carcinoma underwent a sequential treatment consisting of two courses of chemotherapy with vincristine, bleomycin, mitomycin c and cis-platin (VBMP), followed by radiotherapy with 54 Gy to the pelvis and the aortic nodes. Risk factors mainly consisted of nodes metastases (25 patients), but patients with parametrial invasion or histologic evidence of neoplastic vascular permeation outside the tumor were also included in the study. The treatment was well tolerated and all patients received the planned dose of chemotherapy and radiotherapy; in the follow-up one patient died of ileal necrosis and one died of pulmonary embolism after being medically treated for subocclusion. With a minimal follow-up of 70 months, 15 patients are alive and free of disease, two have died of complications (one with local recurrence), one has died of intercurrent disease and 10 have died of disease (six distant, four local). The site of recurrence was outside the field of irradiation in six cases (lungs in two cases, liver and para-aortic nodes in one and distant nodes in three). This treatment is feasible but control of distant metastases in high-risk patients after surgical treatment remains unsatisfactory.&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2016-11-03 15:17:28 +0000" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">
