<P>Surfactant is essential to normal lung function in babies. Surfactant is deficient in the lungs of many babies born prematurely, and is one aspect of lung immaturity leading to a lung disease known a respiratory distress syndrome (RDS).</P>
<P>Surfactant can be given both to prevent and treat this respiratory problem. Although the initial studies suggested that infants intubated and treated with prophylactic surfactant had improved clinical outcome, more recent studies suggest that stabilization with using continuous "back pressure" (using a device known a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)) and surfactant treatment of only those infants who develop breathing problems may be more effective than the more aggressive approach. Prophylactic use of surfactant in babies at high risk of developing RDS does not lead to clinical improvement and may increase the risk of lung injury or death, especially when compared to an approach that incorporates early stabilization on continuous distending pressure.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-03-13 15:54:52 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-03-13 15:54:52 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) occurs in very preterm infants who have immature lung structure, an immature cardiovascular system, and a very distensible chest wall. RDS is associated with a deficiency or dysfunction of pulmonary surfactant. Surfactant lines the alveolar surface and prevents atelectasis at end expiration. Pulmonary surfactant is predominantly dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) with lesser amounts of other phospholipids including phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylinositol. In addition, pulmonary surfactant also contains neutral lipids and four distinct surfactant proteins (SP-A, SP-B, SP-C and SP-D). These proteins may play a role in surfactant secretion, recycling, cooperative functioning with other surfactant proteins and phospholipids (<LINK REF="REF-Possmayer-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Possmayer 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_rch-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schürch 1992</LINK>) and innate host defense of the lung (<LINK REF="REF-Wright-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 1997</LINK>). The physiologic functions of surfactant include the ability to lower surface tension and the ability to rapidly adsorb, spread, and reform a monolayer in the dynamic conditions associated with the respiratory cycle (<LINK REF="REF-Jobe-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jobe 1993</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-03-13 15:54:52 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Surfactant therapy has been proven to improve the immediate need for respiratory support and the clinical outcome of very preterm newborns (<LINK REF="REF-Soll-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soll 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jobe-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jobe 1993</LINK>). Trials have studied a wide variety of surfactant preparations used either to prevent (prophylactic or delivery room administration) (<LINK REF="REF-Soll-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soll 2010</LINK>) or treat (very early, selective or rescue administration) (<LINK REF="REF-Soll-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soll 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seger-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seger 2009</LINK>) RDS (<LINK REF="REF-Soll-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soll 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soll-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soll 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pfister-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pfister 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pfister-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pfister 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seger-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seger 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soll-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soll 2010</LINK>). Using either approach to treatment, surfactant therapy has been proven to reduce the need for ventilator support and decrease the risk of pneumothorax, death and the combined outcome of death of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) (<LINK REF="REF-Engle-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Engle 2008</LINK>). However, the risk of BPD in preterm infants of less than 30 weeks&#8217; gestation who received prophylactic surfactant compared with those who received later selective treatment is unclear (<LINK REF="REF-Soll-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soll 2001b</LINK>). Widespread use of surfactant therapy has been credited with significant improvements in survival in preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Horbar-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horbar 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schwartz-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwartz 1994</LINK>), without a change in the incidence of neurologic, or developmental disability of preterms followed through infancy and school age (<LINK REF="REF-Palta-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palta 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Angio-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Angio 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>For the purpose of this review, a "prophylactic strategy" for surfactant administration was defined as a strategy that mandated intubation and bolus administration of surfactant immediately after birth (either prior to the first breath or after a brief period of resuscitation). "Selective" surfactant therapy was defined as administration of surfactant once the infant had evidence of RDS, also known in the literature as "treatment" or "rescue" surfactant.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-10-21 07:57:21 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although both prophylactic surfactant administration and surfactant treatment of infants with established RDS are successful treatment strategies, there are theoretical advantages and disadvantages to each approach. Prophylactic administration offers the theoretical advantage of replacing surfactant before the onset of respiratory insufficiency, decreasing the need for ventilator support and avoiding barotrauma that may result from even short periods of assisted ventilation (<LINK REF="REF-Nilsson-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nilsson 1978</LINK>). Surfactant may distribute more homogeneously when given immediately at birth into lungs still filled with fluid, leading to improvement in response and decreasing the risk of lung injury (<LINK REF="REF-Jobe-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jobe 1984</LINK>). Surfactant treatment reserved for infants with established RDS offers the advantage of treating only infants with clinical disease, eliminating the potential risks and costs of treating surfactant sufficient infants who would receive no benefit from treatment.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-03-13 15:54:52 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Multiple systematic reviews have addressed the use of animal derived surfactant preparations or synthetic surfactant preparations in the prevention or treatment of RDS (<LINK REF="REF-Soll-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soll 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soll-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soll 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soll-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soll 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pfister-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pfister 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pfister-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pfister 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seger-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seger 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soll-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soll 2010</LINK>). Other treatment strategies, such as the intubation of spontaneously breathing infants and surfactant treatment with rapid extubation and restabilization on nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) are addressed in other reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Stevens-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevens 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>In recent years, the increased utilization of antenatal steroids, more gentle resuscitation in the delivery room and the routine use of early delivery room CPAP may have changed the risk/benefit analysis of aggressive universal prophylactic intubation and treatment of infants at high risk of RDS (<LINK REF="REF-Gittermann-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gittermann 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sahni-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sahni 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lindner-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindner 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Finer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finer 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rojas-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Rojas 2009</LINK>). This analysis updates previous reviews of the prophylactic versus selective use of any surfactant preparation in preventing morbidity and mortality in preterm infants and allows for subgroup analyses of recent studies that utilize early stabilization on CPAP.</P>

<P>The standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group were employed. In addition, for the update in 2011, the following issues were evaluated and entered into the 'Risk of bias' table (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>(1) Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias). Was the allocation sequence adequately generated? For each included study, we categorized the method used to generate the allocation sequence as: <I>low risk </I>(any truly random process e.g. random number table; computer random number generator); <I>high risk </I>(any non random process e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number) or <I>unclear risk</I>. </P>
<P>(2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias). Was allocation adequately concealed? For each included study, we categorized the method used to conceal the allocation sequence as: <I>low risk </I>(e.g. telephone or central randomization; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes); <I>high risk</I> (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);or <I>unclear risk</I>. </P>
<P>(3) Blinding (checking for possible performance bias). Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study? At study entry? At the time of outcome assessment? For each included study, we categorized the methods used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. Blinding was assessed separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes. We categorized the methods as: <I>low risk</I>, <I>high risk</I> or <I>unclear</I> for participants; adequate, inadequate or unclear for personnel; <I>adequate</I>, inadequate or <I>unclear</I> <I>risk </I>for outcome assessors. </P>
<P>(4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations). Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed? For each included study and for each outcome, we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We noted whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomized participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported or supplied by the trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses. We categorized the methods as: <I>low risk</I> (&lt; 20% missing data); <I>high risk</I> (&#8805; 20% missing data) or <I>unclear risk</I>. </P>
<P>(5) Selective reporting bias. Are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting? For each included study, we described how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We assessed the methods as: <I>low risk</I> (where it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported); <I>high risk</I> (where not all the study&#8217;s prespecified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported); or <I>unclear risk</I>. </P>
<P>(6) Other sources of bias. Was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a high risk of bias? For each included study, we described any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias (for example, whether there was a potential source of bias related to the specific study design or whether the trial was stopped early due to some data-dependent process). We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as: <I>low risk</I>; <I>high risk</I>; or <I>unclear risk</I>.  </P>
<P>If needed, we planned to explore the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Dunn-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dunn 1991</LINK>: Conducted a randomized controlled trial evaluating the influence of the timing of surfactant treatment for the treatment of neonatal RDS. One hundred and eighty-two neonates of less than 30 weeks' gestation were randomly assigned prior to birth to one of three study groups: control (dummy instillation of air given at birth), early surfactant (surfactant given at birth), or late surfactant (surfactant given at less than six hours of age). Neonates in the late surfactant group could avoid treatment if they had a clear chest x-ray and required no supplemental oxygen at a mean airway pressure of less than 7 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O. Of the 60 neonates randomly assigned to late treatment, 29 (48%) were deemed surfactant sufficient and thereby avoided treatment; the other 31 received their first dose at a mean age of 2.9 hours. There was a significant improvement in gas exchange during the first week of life in both surfactant groups compared with the control group, reflected by differences in fraction of inspired oxygen, arterial/alveolar oxygen tension ratio<SUB> </SUB>(a/A pO<SUB>2</SUB>) and ventilation index (peak pressure x rate on the ventilator). Surfactant therapy resulted in a lower incidence of pulmonary air leak and severe CLD (defined as requirement for respiratory support beyond 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA)). There were no differences between early and late surfactant groups in any of these parameters. The only statistically significant difference between the surfactant groups was that the early group had a higher incidence of mild CLD (respiratory support beyond 28 days of age) than the late treatment group. Neonates in the late treatment group were extubated earlier and had a shorter neonatal intensive care unit stay than control neonates, whereas those in the early group were not significantly different from control neonates in these parameters.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Kendig-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Kendig 1991</LINK>: Conducted a randomized, multicenter trial of surfactant prophylaxis versus selective treatment. Prior to delivery, 479 infants with an estimated gestational age of less than 30 weeks were randomly assigned to receive surfactant as prophylaxis (n = 235) or rescue therapy (n = 244). The infants in the prophylaxis group received a 90 mg intratracheal dose of an exogenous calf lung surfactant extract at the time of delivery, whereas the infants in the rescue therapy group received 90 mg of the surfactant several hours after delivery if the FiO<SUB>2</SUB> was at least 0.40 or if the mean airway pressure (MAP) was at least 7 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O, or both. Infants in both groups received additional doses of surfactant at intervals of 12 to 24 hours if these criteria were met. The proportion of infants surviving until discharge to their homes was significantly higher in the prophylaxis group than in the rescue therapy group (88% versus 80%). This difference was due primarily to the longer survival of very preterm infants (less than or equal to 26 weeks' gestation) in the prophylaxis group than in the rescue therapy group (75% versus 54%). Infants in the prophylaxis group who were delivered at 26 weeks' gestation or earlier had a lower incidence of pneumothorax than similar infants in the rescue therapy group (7% versus 18%).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Merritt-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Merritt 1991</LINK>: Conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of human surfactant given intratracheally at birth (prophylactic) versus rescue administration after the onset of severe RDS in preterm infants born at 24 to 29 weeks of gestation. Singleton fetuses were randomly assigned to receive (1) placebo (air), (2) prophylactic surfactant treatment, or (3) rescue surfactant treatment. Infants of multiple births received either (1) prophylactic or (2) rescue treatment. Preterm infants randomly assigned to receive prophylactic treatment received surfactant soon after birth; those assigned to receive rescue surfactant had instillation at a mean age of 220 minutes if the lecithin-sphingomyelin ratio was less than or equal to 2.0 and no phosphatidylglycerol was detected in either amniotic fluid or initial airway aspirate, oxygen requirements were an FiO<SUB>2</SUB> greater than 0.5, and MAP greater than or equal to 7 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O from two to 12 hours after birth. Up to four doses (or air) were permitted within 48 hours. Approximately 60% of surfactant-treated infants required two or more doses. Indices of oxygenation and ventilation were improved in surfactant recipients during the first 24 hours. An intention-to-treat analysis found no significant differences between infants given placebo and surfactant treated infants or between prophylactic and rescue treated infants.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Egberts-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Egberts 1993</LINK>: Conducted a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the immediate effects of prophylactic administration of poractant (Curosurf) and to compare clinical outcomes after prophylactic or expectant management. Porcine surfactant (Curosurf 200 mg/kg) was administered intratracheally within 10 minutes of birth to preterm neonates with a gestational age of 26 to 29 weeks (n = 75); rescue eligible neonates (n = 72) were initially subjected to a sham maneuver. After six to 24 hours, a similar dose of surfactant was given to the neonates of both the prophylaxis and the rescue eligible group, if they needed mechanical ventilation with an FiO<SUB>2</SUB> greater than or equal to 0.6. At six hours the prophylaxis group had significantly higher tcPO<SUB>2</SUB>/FiO<SUB>2 </SUB>ratios and less severe RDS by radiological scoring. Severe RDS was present in 19% of the prophylactically treated neonates versus 32% in the rescue eligible group. There were no differences in the incidence or severity of pneumothorax, pulmonary interstitial emphysema, cerebral hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, patent ductus arteriosus, in the duration of mechanical ventilation or time in supplemental oxygen, or in mortality.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Kattwinkel-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kattwinkel 1993</LINK>: Conducted a randomized controlled trial to evaluate prophylactic versus selective surfactant treatment in infants born between 29 and 32 weeks gestational age. One thousand three hundred ninety-eight neonates estimated to be 29 through 32 weeks' gestation were randomized to receive calf lung surfactant extract (CLSE) at birth or to wait until development of mild RDS. After exclusions for malformations and other factors, data from 1248 were analyzed. Prophylaxis was associated with less development of moderate RDS (7% versus 12%), less need for retreatment (5% versus 9%), less need for mechanical ventilation or supplemental oxygen during the first four days, and fewer deaths or less requirement for supplemental oxygen at 28 days (5% versus 9%). Although one minute Apgar scores were significantly lower in the prophylaxis group, the difference disappeared by the five-minute score and there was no difference in the incidence of asphyxia-related complications. Sixty percent of the neonates assigned to early treatment received endotracheal intubation and 43% received calf lung surfactant extract at a median age of 1.5 hours. When data were analyzed by gestational age and birth weight subgroups, most of the differences could be attributable to babies born at 30 weeks or less or weighing less than 1500 g, probably because of the higher incidence of surfactant deficiency in this more immature subgroup.<BR/>

<LINK REF="STD-Walti-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Walti 1995</LINK>: Conducted a randomized controlled trial to evaluate prophylactic versus selective surfactant treatment in infants born between 25 and 31 weeks gestational age. The primary outcome was the effect of prophylactic porcine surfactant on survival without BPD. Compared with rescue therapy (n = 122), prophylactic surfactant administration (n = 134) led to an increase in survival without BPD (60% versus 46%), decreased the incidence of severe intraventricular hemorrhage (3% versus 16%), decreased the incidence of ROP (2% versus 11%) and decreased the need for oxygenation and ventilator support within 3 to 72 hours.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Bevilacqua-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bevilacqua 1996</LINK>: Conducted a prospective, randomized, multicenter trial to evaluate the efficacy of modified porcine surfactant (Curosurf) administered at birth to prevent the development of RDS in preterm infants. Two hundred and eighty-seven infants with a gestational age of 24 to 30 weeks were randomized to prophylactic treatment with Curosurf (200 mg/kg) or to a control group receiving no surfactant treatment in the delivery room. Infants in both groups were eligible for rescue treatment with surfactant (200 mg/kg) if they developed clinical symptoms of RDS and required mechanical ventilation. The main endpoint was to obtain a 30% reduction in the incidence of grade 3 to 4 RDS. There was a 32% reduction in the incidence of grade 3 to 4 RDS in the prophylaxis group. This was associated with a significant reduction in mean maximum FiO<SUB>2</SUB> (57% versus 66%), a decreased incidence of pulmonary interstitial emphysema (7% versus 14%) and a lowered mortality (21% versus 35%). Combined unfavorable outcome (mortality + BPD and/or grade 3 to 4 intraventricular hemorrhage and/or grade 2 to 4 ROP) was significantly lower in the prophylaxis than in the second group (41% versus 58%). The favorable effects of prophylactic treatment were noted in all the age groups, including the infants with the lowest gestational age (24 to 25 weeks).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Bevilacqua-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bevilacqua 1997</LINK>: Conducted a randomized controlled trial of prophylactic versus selective surfactant treatment to reduce mortality and incidence of 3 to 4 radiological grade RDS. Two neonatal intensive care units (NICU) in Italy, one NICU in Bulgaria and one NICU in Romania were involved in a randomized controlled clinical trial of prophylaxis versus rescue treatment of RDS. Infants with gestational age 26 to 30 weeks were randomized before birth to prophylaxis in the delivery room with 200 mg/kg of porcine surfactant (prophylaxis) or to routine assistance (control). Subsequently, infants developing RDS requiring mechanical ventilation and an FiO<SUB>2 </SUB>&#8805; 0.4 to maintain PaO<SUB>2</SUB> of 50 mmHg were allowed to be treated with poractant (Curosurf 200 mg/kg). A sample size of 174 infants was required to demonstrate a 40% reduction in mortality and the incidence of radiological grade 3 to 4 RDS. Due to logistic problems, the study was stopped after enrollment of 93 infants. Intention-to-treat analysis did not demonstrate a significant difference in mortality or radiological evidence of severe RDS. The PaO<SUB>2</SUB>/FiO<SUB>2 </SUB>ratio was significantly improved in the infants given prophylaxis for the first 12 hours of life versus the controls. Fewer infants given prophylaxis required subsequent rescue treatment compared with controls. There was no difference in other complications such as intraventricular hemorrhage, air leak syndromes and infections.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Iar_x016d_kova-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Iar&#365;kova 1999</LINK>: Conducted a single center randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of prophylactic surfactant versus selective surfactant on the incidence of RDS grades III and IV in infants born less than 32 weeks gestational age. The study was carried out in a specialized maternity hospital in Bulgaria. Infants were randomized before delivery to receive either prophylactic surfactant or therapeutic surfactant if indicated later. Infants in the prophylactic arm were intubated immediately after birth, before the first neonatal breath or within the first 20 minutes of life and received 200 mg/kg of Curosurf, followed by manual ventilation (via ambu bag) and then extubated or placed on mechanical ventilation (MV). Infants in the "therapeutic surfactant" arm received 200mg/kg of Curosurf if they need a FiO<SUB>2</SUB> was &gt; 40% to maintain a PaO<SUB>2 </SUB>&gt; 50mmHg. In all infants, the FiO<SUB>2</SUB> and the heart rate were monitored with pulse oximetry for two hours on the first day and then daily for the following four days and again at 28 days of life. A second dose of surfactant was administered to infants that required a FiO<SUB>2</SUB> &gt; 40% to maintain a PaO<SUB>2 </SUB>&gt; 50 mmHg. Compared with rescue therapy (n = 11), prophylaxis (n = 17) showed a decreased risk in the RDS grades 3 and 4; 73% of infants in the control group required a second dose of surfactant compared with 12% in the prophylactic group (P &lt; 0.05); duration on MV was lower in the prophylactic group as well as the duration with oxygen supplementation. No statistically significant differences were noted in other assessed outcomes such as pneumothorax, pulmonary interstitial emphysema, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) or sepsis.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-SUPPORT-2010" TYPE="STUDY">SUPPORT 2010</LINK>: Finer and coworkers conducted a multicenter randomized controlled trial as part of the Neonatal Research Network of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Heath and Human Development. Infants between 24 to 27 weeks of gestation at birth were randomized before delivery to receive: CPAP at birth or prophylactic surfactant within the first 60 minutes after birth followed by conventional ventilation in NICU. Subsequently, infants in the surfactant group were extubated after meeting all of the following criteria: PaCO<SUB>2</SUB>&lt; 50mmHg, pH &gt;7.3; FiO<SUB>2 </SUB>&lt; 0.35 and SpO<SUB>2 </SUB>of 88% or higher. Infants in the CPAP group were intubated if they met any of the following criteria: FiO<SUB>2</SUB> &gt; 0.5 required to have a SpO<SUB>2</SUB> above 88% for one hour and partial pressure of PaCO<SUB>2</SUB> greater than 67 mmHg. A sample size of 1310 infants was required to demonstrate a 10% reduction in the incidence of BPD and the rate of death or survival with neurodevelopmental impairment at 18 to 22 months.</P>
<P>After adjustment for gestational age, center or familial clustering, the rates of the combined outcome death or BPD at 36 weeks PMA did not differ significantly between the two groups. No differences were noted in death or BPD when analyzed independently. No interactions were evident between gestational age strata and treatment strategy with respect to BPD. More infants in the CPAP group than in the surfactant group were alive and free from the need for mechanical ventilation by day seven (P = 0.01), and infants in the CPAP group required fewer days of ventilation than did those in the surfactant group (P = 0.03). The rate of postnatal corticosteroids use was lower in the CPAP group. Secondary outcomes such as air leak syndrome, pneumothorax, NEC, PDA, severe intraventricular hemorrhage or severe ROP did not show significant differences between intervention groups.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Dunn-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Dunn 2011</LINK>: Dunn and coworkers conducted a multicenter randomized controlled trial in 27 centers of the Vermont Oxford Network (VON). Infants between 26 to 29 + 6 weeks gestation at birth were enrolled and randomly assigned to one of three study groups: prophylactic surfactant followed by a period of assisted ventilation (PS), intubation-surfactant treatment and rapid extubation to nasal CPAP (ISX) or early stabilization in nasal CPAP (NCPAP).The study was stopped before reaching the desired sample size (876) due to difficulties in the enrollment. A total of 648 infants were recruited in two randomization strata (26 to 27 + 6 weeks PMA and from 28 to 29 + 6 weeks PMA). No differences were seen in the primary outcome "death or CLD at 36 weeks PMA" between groups. The authors failed to identify differences in mortality or in other complications of preterm birth or in the composite outcome "death or major morbidity" perhaps because of the reduced power of this trial.</P>
<P>Follow-up was available from two of the studies. <LINK REF="REF-Vaucher-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vaucher 1993</LINK> followed the infants enrolled in the trial of <LINK REF="STD-Merritt-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Merritt 1991</LINK> at one year of age. <LINK REF="REF-Sinkin-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sinkin 1998</LINK> followed the infants born at one of the centers participating in the trial of <LINK REF="STD-Kendig-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Kendig 1991</LINK> at five to eight years.</P>

<B> </B>compared the neurodevelopmental outcome of infants enrolled in the trial of <LINK REF="STD-Merritt-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Merritt 1991</LINK>. One hundred and forty-five infants were alive at one year of adjusted age, at which time growth, neurosensory, and neurologic outcome were similar in all three treatment groups at both centers. Cerebral palsy occurred in 20% overall. Five infants (3.5%) were functionally blind. However, infants treated at birth had lower mean mental and motor scores on the Bayley Scales of Infant Development compared with those of infants rescued with surfactant after the onset of RDS (Mental Development Index: 78 versus 96, P = 0.02; Psychomotor Development Index: 73 versus 87, P = 0.04).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Sinkin-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sinkin 1998</LINK> published pulmonary and neurodevelopmental outcomes of a cohort of infants enrolled in the <LINK REF="STD-Kendig-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Kendig 1991</LINK> trial. At 4.5 to eight years of age, all survivors from one of the three centers were located and 96% were evaluated. The follow-up test battery included a health assessment questionnaire, spirometry, 88% saturation test, neurologic examination, and the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities (MSCA) and the Conners' Parent Rating Scale-48. Educational achievement was determined by school class placement and teachers' reports of achievement. Of the 192 children originally enrolled, 154 survived. Evaluations were performed on 148 of these infants. An abnormal pulmonary history was found in 45 (30%) of the children: 16 (22%) in the prophylactic group and 29 (39%) in the rescue group. Formal pulmonary function was evaluated in 81 children; 29 (78%) in the prophylactic group and 33 (75%) in the rescue group were considered abnormal. No significant differences were found between the two groups on either cognitive or motor subscales of the MSCA, the Conners' Parent Rating Scale-48, the neurologic examination, the education services received in school, or the teacher ratings of below-average academic performance. Intelligence scores measured on the MSCA were low-normal for both groups. Some level of educational assistance was being provided to 72 (49%) of the cohort studied and both groups had below average educational performance and increased needs for educational assistance.</P>
<P>
<B>Summary: </B>Although all studies attempted to include infants thought to be at risk of developing RDS, the entry criteria differ between studies. Nine of the studies enrolled infants less than 30 weeks gestation. <LINK REF="STD-Kattwinkel-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kattwinkel 1993</LINK> studied infants with gestational age 29 to 32 weeks. The studies of <LINK REF="STD-Dunn-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dunn 1991</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Merritt-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Merritt 1991</LINK> excluded infants with mature lung profiles.

<P>Only the <LINK REF="STD-SUPPORT-2010" TYPE="STUDY">SUPPORT 2010</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Dunn-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Dunn 2011</LINK> trials routinely stabilized infants in the selective surfactant group on NCPAP.</P>
<P>Study primary outcomes included the incidence of RDS or the need of mechanical ventilation, CLD, composite outcomes such as death or BPD and death or CLD. As secondary outcomes, a variety of complications of preterm birth including pneumothorax, pulmonary interstitial emphysema, patent ductus arteriosus, NEC, intraventricular hemorrhage and ROP were assessed in the majority of trials.</P>
<P>
<B>Studies excluded from this review:</B>
</P>
<P>Trials where the administration of surfactant was given early after birth (within the first 30 minutes of infants' life), but only to those infants with evidence of RDS, were classified as "early surfactant" and not as "prophylactic", therefore, excluding them from this review. Trials were excluded when the comparison group was assigned to "early surfactant" instead of selective administration of surfactant.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Morley-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Morley 2008</LINK> conducted an international multicenter randomized controlled trial, in perinatal centers of Australia, New Zealand, United States, Canada and Europe. Infants were enrolled in the study if they met the following criteria: gestational age at delivery between 25 weeks zero days and 28 weeks six days, no known condition that might adversely affect breathing after birth apart from prematurity, birth in a hospital participating in the trial, and an ability to breathe at five minutes after birth but needing respiratory support because of increased respiratory effort, grunting respiration, or cyanosis. Infants were randomly assigned to receive either NCPAP or intubation and ventilation. Randomization was stratified according to center and gestational age (25 or 26 weeks and 27 or 28 weeks). The primary outcome was death or BPD (defined as the need for oxygen treatment at 36 weeks gestational age). The trial was excluded from this review because the trial did not give "prophylactic" treatment to all infants in a high-risk group, but selected those infants who neither needed acute resuscitation or had no signs of RDS. In the remaining infants, surfactant treatment was not mandated and followed local protocols.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Rojas-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Rojas 2009</LINK> conducted a multicenter randomized controlled trial in eight neonatal intensive care units from eight centers in Colombia. Infants born between 27 and 31weeks&#8217; gestation with evidence of RDS and treated with supplemental oxygen in the delivery room were randomly assigned within the &#64257;rst hour of life to intubation, very early surfactant, extubation, and NCPAP (treatment group) or NCPAP alone (control group). Infants in the control group who met treatment-failure criteria subsequently received an initial dose of surfactant in a standardized manner (selective use of surfactant). A total of 279 infants were randomly assigned, in two randomization strata (27 to 29 weeks PMA and from 30 to 31 weeks PMA),141 to the treatment group and 138 to the control group. The need for mechanical ventilation was lower in the treatment group (26%) compared with the control group (39%). Air-leak syndrome occurred less frequently in the treatment group (2%) compared with the control group (9%). The incidence of CLD (oxygen treatment at 36 weeks&#8217; postmenstrual age) was 49% in the treatment group compared with 59% in the control group. All other outcomes, including mortality, intraventricular hemorrhage, and periventricular leukomalacia were similar between the groups. This trial was excluded from this review because the treatment group received surfactant as "very early surfactant" once first RDS signs appeared instead of prophylactic administration of surfactant.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Sandri-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sandri 2010</LINK> conducted an international multicenter randomized controlled trial in centers in Europe. Infants between 25 to 28 + 6 weeks gestation at birth were enrolled and randomly assigned to one of two study groups: prophylactic surfactant intubation-surfactant treatment and rapid extubation to NCPAP or NCPAP alone. In the event of NCPAP failure and after obtaining a chest radiograph, early selective surfactant was administered (Curosurf 200 mg/kg). A total of 208 infants were recruited in two randomization strata (25 to 26 weeks PMA and from 27 to 28 weeks PMA). No differences were seen in the primary outcome "need of mechanical ventilation within the first 5 days of life". There were no differences in mortality or in other complications of prematurity or CLD. Results of this trial showed that in spontaneously breathing preterm newborns who were treated with NCPAP, prophylactic surfactant was not superior to early selective surfactant in terms of requirement of mechanical ventilation in the first five days of life. This trial was excluded from this review because the comparison group received surfactant as "early surfactant" instead of selective administration of surfactant.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-03-13 15:54:53 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The initial animal models supported the early prophylactic use of surfactant therapy. In animal studies, more uniform distribution of surfactant was achieved when surfactant was administered into a fluid-filled lung (<LINK REF="REF-Jobe-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jobe 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seidner-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seidner 1995</LINK>). Even brief (15 to 30 minute) periods of mechanical ventilation prior to surfactant administration were shown to cause acute lung injury resulting in alveolar-capillary damage, leakage of proteinaceous fluid into the alveolar space and release of inflammatory mediators (<LINK REF="REF-Ikegami-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ikegami 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jobe-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jobe 1998</LINK>) and to decrease the subsequent response to surfactant replacement (<LINK REF="REF-Rider-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rider 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bjorklund-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bjorklund 1997</LINK>). Surfactant deficient animals who receive assisted ventilation develop necrosis and desquamation of the bronchiolar epithelium as early as five minutes after the onset of ventilation (<LINK REF="REF-Nilsson-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nilsson 1978</LINK>).</P>
<P>We identified eleven studies that compared prophylactic administration of surfactant to surfactant treatment of established RDS (selective treatment). Five of these studies were not included in the previous review (<LINK REF="REF-Soll-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soll 2001b</LINK>). All of these studies utilized an animal derived surfactant extract in both treatment groups. Although all of the eleven studies attempted to identify high risk infants, entry criteria differ between them; importantly, two were done in the context of current clinical care practices (<LINK REF="STD-SUPPORT-2010" TYPE="STUDY">SUPPORT 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dunn-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Dunn 2011</LINK>) including the routine use of CPAP and increased utilization of antenatal steroids.</P>
<P>To address these differences in the baseline risk of the population (the increased utilization of antenatal steroids) as well as the introduction of less invasive methods of respiratory support (CPAP), we conducted several subgroup analyses: the primary analysis evaluated studies with routine application of CPAP and studies without routine application of CPAP. We carried out separate subgroup analyses for infants less than 30 weeks of gestation at birth and those infants who had mostly received steroids.</P>
<P>According to the results from the previous version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Soll-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soll 2001b</LINK>), prophylactic surfactant administration significantly decreased the risk of pneumothorax, the risk of pulmonary interstitial emphysema, the risk of mortality and the risk of BPD or death in comparison with surfactant treatment of established RDS. The updated meta-analysis including the newest trials shows similar findings for those studies without routine application of CPAP. However, for the subgroup analysis of studies with routine application of CPAP, the benefit of the prophylactic surfactant administration is not as clear; in fact, the risk of CLD or death is lower in the arm that allowed stabilization on CPAP and selective treatment with surfactant compared with the prophylactic arm. For other important clinical outcomes such as neonatal mortality, BPD, CLD, any air leak, or sepsis, there was no statistical difference in risk associated with the use of prophylactic surfactant.</P>
<P>It is known that CPAP might reduce the work of breathing and augment gas exchange by facilitated diffusion (<LINK REF="REF-Greenough-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenough 2007</LINK>). CPAP was introduced into neonatal intensive care in the 1970s. However, the potential magnitude of the benefits of CPAP were not fully appreciated until the survey conducted by Avery and coworkers in 1987 (<LINK REF="REF-Avery-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Avery 1987</LINK>). Avery and coworkers conducted a retrospective study involving 1,625 infants with birth weights between 700 to 1,500 g admitted to eight premier intensive care nurseries in North America between January 1982 to December 1984. Avery sought to identify differences between centers regarding the incidence of CLD. Even when birth weight, race, and sex were taken into consideration through a multivariate logistic regression analysis, significant differences were found between institutions in the incidence of CLD. The NICU at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital was the center that demonstrated the best outcomes in low birth weight infants and the lowest incidence of CLD. The Columbia group routinely placed all infants who showed signs of RDS on NCPAP (<LINK REF="REF-Avery-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Avery 1987</LINK>). Ho and colleagues conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (<LINK REF="REF-Ho-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ho 2002</LINK>) to determine if continuous distending pressure (CDP) reduces the need for Intermitent Positive Pressure Ventilation (IPPV) and associated morbidity without adverse effects in spontaneously breathing preterm infants with RDS. Some of the included trials were conducted in the presurfactant era (performed in the 1970s). The meta-analysis demonstrated that in preterm infants with RDS, the application of CDP as CPAP is associated with a reduced risk of respiratory failure and mortality, but is associated with an increased risk of pneumothorax. The early management of preterm infants at risk of pulmonary respiratory failure with CPAP has been associated with a reduced need for assisted ventilation and thereby protecting the lung of preterm infants from developing BPD (<LINK REF="REF-Ho-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ho 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nowadsky-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nowadsky 2009</LINK>). A large randomized controlled trial (<LINK REF="STD-Morley-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Morley 2008</LINK>) conducted to investigate whether NCPAP rather than intubation and ventilation shortly after birth would reduce the rates of death or BPD in spontaneously breathing preterm infants demonstrated that in infants born at 25 to 28 weeks PMA, early nasal CPAP (NCPAP) was associated with lower need of oxygen supplementation at 28 days and fewer days of mechanical ventilation.</P>
<P>The growing appreciation of the role of non-invasive support using CPAP leads us to rethink the real benefit of using prophylactic surfactant in high risk preterm infants. Evidence from recent randomized controlled trials (<LINK REF="STD-Rojas-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Rojas 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sandri-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sandri 2010</LINK>) suggest that for patients treated with CPAP, an "early strategy" of surfactant treatment (administration of surfactant during a brief period of intubation soon after the first symptoms of RDS appears) may in fact be a better approach than immediate intubation and prophylactic surfactant administration.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Rojas-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Rojas 2009</LINK> conducted a multicenter trial to address the question of whether the use of very early surfactant therapy (within the first hour of life) in addition to the early use of NCPAP in spontaneously breathing preterm infants with RDS would further improve their outcomes in comparison with the early use of NCPAP and selective use of surfactant in more established RDS. Infants 27 to 31 weeks gestational age were eligible if within the first 60 minutes of life they presented evidence of increased work of breathing (tachypnea, intercostal retractions, nasal flaring, or grunting) and need for supplemental oxygen administration. All eligible infants were initially placed on NCPAP of 6 cm H2O. Infants in the treatment group were temporarily intubated for surfactant administration and received a dose of 100 mg/kg of surfactant in two aliquots, two minutes apart. Infants in control group remained on NCPAP. The authors found that the need for mechanical ventilation was lower in the treatment group compared with the control group. Airleak occurred less frequently in the treatment group compared with the control group. The incidence of CLD (oxygen treatment at 36 weeks&#8217; postmenstrual age) was 49% in the treatment group compared with 59% in the control group. All other outcomes, including mortality, intraventricular hemorrhage, and periventricular leukomalacia were similar between the groups.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Sandri-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sandri 2010</LINK> conducted a randomized, controlled trial to investigate whether prophylactic surfactant followed by NCPAP compared with early NCPAP application with early surfactant would reduce the need for mechanical ventilation in the first five days of life. Newborn infants with gestational ages from 25 weeks zero days and 28 weeks six days were included. Infants who were randomly assigned to prophylactic surfactant were intubated for administration of a dose of 200 mg/kg of porcine surfactant. Infants who were assigned to NCPAP were stabilized on NCPAP alone. Results from this trial showed that in spontaneously breathing preterm newborns who were treated with NCPAP, prophylactic surfactant given within 30 minutes of birth was not superior to early selective surfactant in terms of requirement of mechanical ventilation in the first five days of life and there were no significant differences between groups for any secondary outcome, even when the two GA strata were analyzed separately. Prophylactic surfactant treatment within 15 minutes of birth was not associated with reduced risk of mortality in comparison with the early surfactant group, in any gestational age subgroup.</P>
<P>Others changes in practice may have influenced the results of these studies. There is strong evidence that supports the effectiveness of the use of a single course of antenatal corticosteroids to accelerate fetal lung maturation in women at risk of preterm birth (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2006</LINK>). Use of antenatal steroids has almost tripled in the last two decades. The trials included in the original review in general had a low rate of steroid exposure; in fact, antenatal steroid use was not even reported in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Merritt-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Merritt 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kattwinkel-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kattwinkel 1993</LINK>). In those studies that commented on the use of antenatal steroids, antenatal steroids were administered to mothers prior to delivery in as few as 14% (<LINK REF="STD-Walti-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Walti 1995</LINK>) to as many as 50% (<LINK REF="STD-Dunn-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dunn 1991</LINK>) of pregnancies. In two of the new trials in this updated review (<LINK REF="STD-SUPPORT-2010" TYPE="STUDY">SUPPORT 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dunn-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Dunn 2011</LINK>) at least 50% of population had received steroids. As these trials dominate the subgroup analysis regarding antenatal steroid exposure, the results are consistent with the findings regarding the routine stabilization on NCPAP. It is interesting to speculate that these two interventions could act synergically to reduce the risk of lung damage.</P>
<P>We analyzed a subgroup of infants less than 30 weeks gestation. Meta-analysis shows that in infants less than 30 weeks gestational age without routine application of CPAP, the use of prophylactic surfactant reduces the risk on neonatal mortality. As with the other analyses, the risk of CLD or death is decreased in patients that received CPAP routinely. This again reflects the difference in fundamental study design and the probable benefits of early stabilization on CPAP.</P>
<P>With the evidence provided by these recent studies, the real benefit of the prophylactic surfactant administration in infants treated under current practices is no longer clear. It seems that infants who have received antenatal steroids and are able to be stabilized early after birth on CPAP, may not need to be treated with prophylactic surfactant and could have better outcomes if they are treated with early selective surfactant.</P>

<P>In studies conducted in the 1990's, organized before the widespread use of antenatal steroids and early CPAP, prophylactic surfactant administration to infants judged to be at risk for developing RDS compared with selective use of surfactant in infants with established RDS demonstrated improved clinical outcomes. In this study population, infants who received prophylactic surfactant had a decreased risk of pneumothorax, a decreased risk of pulmonary interstitial emphysema and a decreased risk of mortality. However, recent large trials that reflect current practice (including greater utilization of maternal steroids and routine post delivery stabilization on CPAP) do not support these differences and demonstrate less risk of chronic lung disease or death when using early stabilization on CPAP with selective surfactant administration to infants requiring intubation.</P>
