<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-03-29 15:59:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This Cochrane Review summarizes trials that evaluated the benefits and potential risks of providing deworming drugs (antihelminthics) to people infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). After we searched for relevant trials up to 29 September 2015 we included eight trials that enrolled 1612 participants.</P>
<P>
<B>What are deworming drugs and why might they delay HIV disease progression</B>
</P>
<P>Deworming drugs are used to treat a variety of human helminth infections, such as soil-transmitted helminths, schistosomiasis, onchocerciasis, and lymphatic filariasis. In areas where these infections are common, the World Health Organization currently recommends that targeted populations are routinely treated every six to 12 months without prior confirmation of an individual's infection status. The use of empiric therapy, or treating all at-risk populations presumptively, is preferred to test-and-treat strategies because deworming drugs are inexpensive and well tolerated. Additionally, a strategy of testing before treatment is considered less cost-effective given that available diagnostic tests are relatively expensive and can exhibit poor sensitivity.</P>
<P>Helminth infections are known to affect the human immune system. In people with HIV, some studies have suggested that helminth infections may reduce the number of CD4+ cells (which are a critical part of the immune response to HIV) and compromise a person's ability to control HIV viral replication. Thus, treatment of helminth infections could have important benefits for people living with HIV beyond the benefits observed in the general population as a result of deworming.</P>
<P>
<B>What the evidence in this review suggests</B>
</P>
<P>Treating all HIV-positive adults with deworming drugs without knowledge of their helminth infection status may have a small suppressive effect on viral load at six weeks (<I>low quality evidence</I>), but repeated dosing over two years appears to have little or no effect on either viral load (<I>moderate quality evidence</I>) or CD4+ cell count (<I>low quality evidence</I>). These findings are based on two included studies.</P>
<P>Providing deworming drugs to HIV-positive adults with diagnosed helminth infection may result in a small suppressive effect on mean viral load at six to 12 weeks (<I>low quality evidence</I>) and a small favourable effect on mean CD4+ cell count at 12 weeks (<I>low quality evidence</I>). However, these findings are based on small studies and are strongly influenced by a single study of praziquantel for schistosomiasis. Further studies from different settings and populations are needed for confirmation.</P>
<P>Adverse events were not well reported (<I>very low quality evidence), </I>and trials were too small to evaluate the effects on mortality (<I>low quality evidence</I>). However there is no suggestion that deworming drugs are harmful for HIV-positive individuals<I>.</I>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-03-29 15:59:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Helminth infections, such as soil-transmitted helminths, schistosomiasis, onchocerciasis, and lymphatic filariasis, are prevalent in many countries where human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is also common. There is some evidence from observational studies that HIV and helminth co-infection may be associated with higher viral load and lower CD4+ cell counts. Treatment of helminth infections with antihelminthics (deworming drugs) may have benefits for people living with HIV beyond simply clearance of worm infections.</P>
<P>This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2009 and we have expanded it to include outcomes of anaemia and adverse events.</P>

<P>To evaluate the effects of deworming drugs (antihelminthic therapy) on markers of HIV disease progression, anaemia, and adverse events in children and adults.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-03-22 21:36:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this review update, we searched online for published and unpublished studies in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICRTP), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO Global Health Library up to 29 September 2015. We also searched databases listing conference abstracts, scanned reference lists of articles, and contacted the authors of included studies.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-03-22 21:44:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared antihelminthic drugs with placebo or no intervention in HIV-positive people.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-04-05 11:53:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trials for eligibility and risk of bias. The primary outcomes were changes in HIV viral load and CD4+ cell count, and secondary outcomes were anaemia, iron deficiency, adverse events, and mortality events. We compared the effects of deworming using mean differences, risk ratios (RR), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-04-05 11:46:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Eight trials met the inclusion criteria of this review, enrolling a total of 1612 participants. Three trials evaluated the effect of providing antihelminthics to all adults with HIV without knowledge of their helminth infection status, and five trials evaluated the effects of providing deworming drugs to HIV-positive individuals with confirmed helminth infections. Seven trials were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa and one in Thailand.</P>
<P>
<I>Antihelminthics for people with unknown helminth infection status</I>
</P>
<P>Providing antihelminthics (albendazole and praziquantel together or separately) to HIV-positive adults with unknown helminth infection status may have a small suppressive effect on mean viral load at six weeks but the 95% CI includes the possibility of no effect (difference in mean change &#8722;0.14 log<SUB>10</SUB> viral RNA/mL, 95% CI &#8722;0.35 to 0.07, P = 0.19; one trial, 166 participants, <I>low quality evidence)</I>.</P>
<P>Repeated dosing with deworming drugs over two years (albendazole every three months plus annual praziquantel), probably has little or no effect on mean viral load (difference in mean change 0.01 log<SUB>10</SUB> viral RNA, 95% CI: &#8722;0.03 to &#8722;0.05; one trial, 917 participants, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>), and little or no effect on mean CD4+ count (difference in mean change 2.60 CD4+ cells/킠, 95% CI &#8722;10.15 to 15.35; P = 0.7; one trial, 917 participants, <I>low quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>
<I>Antihelminthics for people with confirmed helminth infections</I>
</P>
<P>Treating confirmed helminth infections in HIV-positive adults may have a small suppressive effect on mean viral load at six to 12 weeks following deworming (difference in mean change &#8722;0.13 log<SUB>10</SUB> viral RNA, 95% CI &#8722;0.26 to &#8722;0.00; P = 0.04; four trials, 445 participants, <I>low quality evidence</I>). However, this finding is strongly influenced by a single study of praziquantel treatment for schistosomiasis. There may also be a small favourable effect on mean CD4+ cell count at 12 weeks after deworming in HIV-positive populations with confirmed helminth infections (difference in mean change 37.86 CD4+ cells/킠, 95% CI 7.36 to 68.35; P = 0.01; three trials, 358 participants, <I>low quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>
<I>Adverse events and mortality </I>
</P>
<P>There is no indication that antihelminthic drugs impart additional risks in HIV-positive populations. However, adverse events were not well reported (<I>very low quality evidence</I>) and trials were underpowered to evaluate effects on mortality (<I>low quality evidence</I>)<I>.</I>
</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-04-11 09:43:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is low quality evidence that treating confirmed helminth infections in HIV-positive adults may have small, short-term favourable effects on markers of HIV disease progression. Further studies are required to confirm this finding. Current evidence suggests that deworming with antihelminthics is not harmful, and this is reassuring for the routine treatment of confirmed or suspected helminth infections in people living with HIV in co-endemic areas.</P>
<P>Further long-term studies are required to make confident conclusions regarding the impact of presumptively deworming all HIV-positive individuals irrespective of helminth infection status, as the only long-term trial to date did not demonstrate an effect.</P>

<P>Helminths, which include the soil-transmitted helminths (STH), schistosomiasis, onchocerciasis, and lymphatic filariasis (LF), infect nearly one-quarter of the world&#8217;s population (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2014</LINK>). Communities with the highest helminth prevalence are often also areas with high prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and over half of HIV-positive people living in helminth endemic areas are estimated to be co-infected with at least one helminth infection (<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Helminth infections have a significant effect on the human immune system, and it is hypothesized that helminth infections may modulate the host's ability to control the HIV virus (<LINK REF="REF-Lawn-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawn 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Modjarrad-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Modjarrad 2010</LINK>). More specifically, studies have shown that amongst HIV-positive individuals with helminth co-infections.</P>
<UL>
<LI>There may be a more rapid decline in the CD4+ T-cells responsible for immunologic function in HIV-positive people, and increased cellular susceptibility to HIV infection (<LINK REF="REF-Eggena-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eggena 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shapira_x002d_Nahor-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shapira-Nahor 1998</LINK>).</LI>

<LI>There may be increased suppression of the antiviral T helper (Th)1 lymphocyte due to helminth-associated Th2 lymphocyte propagation (<LINK REF="REF-Borkow-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borkow 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brown-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kinter-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kinter 2007</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>There may be higher levels of eosinophilia, increased immunoglobulin (Ig) E levels, and stimulation of other immunosuppressive cytokine responses (<LINK REF="REF-Bentwich-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bentwich 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Blish-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Blish 2010</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>In HIV-positive individuals, co-infection with helminths may lead to the accelerated destruction of the host immune system and earlier onset of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining illnesses and death (<LINK REF="REF-Nesheim-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nesheim 2007</LINK>). Even amongst HIV-positive patients treated with antiretroviral (ART) drugs for HIV, helminth infections may adversely influence HIV clinical outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Ivan-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Ivan 2015</LINK>). Given these profound effects on host immunity, helminth infections have been suggested to play an important role in the pathogenesis of HIV in Africa (<LINK REF="REF-Bentwich-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bentwich 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fincham-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fincham 2003</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-03-29 15:59:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Current World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines recommend that high-risk populations living in endemic areas participate in regular mass drug administration with antihelminthic medicines (deworming drugs) without the need for prior confirmatory diagnostic testing. This is also known as preventive chemotherapy. In settings where community prevalence of STH infections exceed 20%, the WHO recommends annual treatment with albendazole or mebendazole for all preschool-age children, school-age children, and pregnant women in their second and third trimester (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The rationale for mass treatment rather than a test and treat approach is the safety of the drugs, low cost of the drugs (often donated by pharmaceutical companies), the relatively high cost of diagnostic testing, and the high prevalence of infection in some areas. The cost of these programmes is estimated to be as low as USD 0.25 per treatment, including delivery costs (<LINK REF="REF-Bundy-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bundy 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Partnership-for-Child-Development-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Partnership for Child Development 1998</LINK>). Mass deworming programs are scaling up rapidly in part due to the WHO NTD Roadmap for Implementation and the 2012 WHO-endorsed London Declaration, which calls for the control or elimination of 10 neglected tropical diseases including STHs, schistosomiasis, LF, and onchocerciasis by 2020 (<LINK REF="REF-Uniting-to-Combat-NTDs-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uniting to Combat NTDs 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>In research settings deworming treatment may require prior confirmatory testing or treatment may be delivered empirically as customary in preventative chemotherapy campaigns. For example, specific age groups may be targeted and recruited to receive deworming medications during community-based household recruitment, at HIV clinics, at tuberculosis (TB) clinics, or during antenatal care.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-03-22 22:39:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>If helminth co-infection plays a significant detrimental role in HIV disease progression it is possible that effective treatment or prevention of helminth infections could slow the progression of HIV (<LINK REF="STD-Kallestrup-2005-ZWE" TYPE="STUDY">Kallestrup 2005 ZWE</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wolday-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Wolday 2002</LINK>). Relatively modest increases in viral load (0.3 to 0.5 log<SUB>10</SUB> copies/mL) may increase the annual risk of progression to an AIDS-defining illness or death by as much as 25% to 44% (<LINK REF="REF-Modjarrad-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Modjarrad 2008</LINK>). Mathematical modelling suggests that a reduction in HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) levels of 0.5 log<SUB>10</SUB> copies/mL could slow the onset of AIDS by 3.5 years and could delay the need for ART medications by almost a full year (<LINK REF="REF-Gupta-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 2007</LINK>). The potential increases in HIV RNA associated with helminth co-infection suggest that for every 100 HIV-positive individuals with an STH infection in sub-Saharan Africa, there could be 3.1 (95% CI: 0.1 to 14.9) excess HIV-1 transmission events. The trend is similar for other helminth infections, with 8.5 (95% CI 0.2 to 38.6) excess HIV transmission events attributed to schistosomiasis and 13.3 (95% CI 0.3 to 89.2) to filariasis (<LINK REF="REF-Baggaley-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baggaley 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>Observational studies of the effects of deworming drugs on markers of HIV disease progression have had conflicting results. Several studies have noted delays in HIV disease progression following deworming (<LINK REF="STD-Brown-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ivan-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Ivan 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lankowski-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Lankowski 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mulu-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Mulu 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Muok-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Muok 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wolday-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Wolday 2002</LINK> ), while others have reported no association (<LINK REF="STD-Brown-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elliott-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Elliott 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hosseinipour-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hosseinipour 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kleppa-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Kleppa 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lawn-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lawn 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Modjarrad-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Modjarrad 2005</LINK>). In the previous version of this systematic review we found some evidence from randomized controlled trials of short term benefits with deworming but also the need for further larger studies (<LINK REF="REF-Walson-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walson 2009</LINK>).</P>

<P>Given that a substantial number of individuals targeted by helminth control programmes may be exposed to or infected with HIV, it is important to establish the safety of deworming drugs in HIV-positive populations and the potential for drug interactions, particularly as an increased incidence of drug reactions has been observed in patients with advanced HIV infection (<LINK REF="REF-Gordin-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gordin 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nunn-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nunn 1991</LINK>). Available data from a recent systematic review also suggested the potential for an interaction between both mebendazole and albendazole and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors appears low, although no formal pharmacokinetic studies exist. The review also reported that interactions may exist between praziquantel and protease inhibitors via enzyme inhibition (<LINK REF="REF-Seden-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seden 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Since the publication of our initial Cochrane Review of this topic in 2009 (<LINK REF="REF-Walson-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walson 2009</LINK>), deworming campaigns have been dramatically scaled up and it has become increasingly important to understand not only the effects of deworming on HIV disease progression but also the safety of treating these unique patient populations. In this update, we have expanded the scope of this Cochrane Review to include trials that evaluate the impact of deworming on anaemia and iron deficiency, as well as markers of HIV disease progression and safety.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2016-03-23 15:48:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors (ARM and PB) independently evaluated the methodological quality of included clinical trials using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' assessment tool described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>We followed the guidance to assess whether adequate steps were taken to reduce the risk of bias across five domains: sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding of participants and personnel; blinding of outcome assessors; and incomplete outcome data.</P>
<P>For sequence generation and allocation concealment, we reported the methods used. For blinding, we described who was blinded and the blinding method. For incomplete outcome data, we reported the percentage and proportion of participants lost to follow-up. We categorized our 'Risk of bias' judgements as either 'low', 'high', or 'unclear'. Where risk of bias was unclear, we attempted to contact the trial authors for clarification and resolved any differences of opinion through discussion.<BR/>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2016-04-05 11:53:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We summarized dichotomous outcomes using risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CIs). We summarized continuous outcomes using mean differences with 95% CIs. For some studies we utilized only data from HIV-positive participants and the trial authors provided the raw data accordingly.</P>
<P>HIV disease progression is associated with a decline in CD4+ cell counts and an increase in viral load. A favourable effect of deworming drugs on CD4+ cell count therefore refers to either a larger increase in CD4+ cell count or a smaller depletion in CD4+ cell count. A suppressive effect on viral load refers to either a reduction in viral load, or a smaller increase in viral load.</P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2016-03-29 16:04:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For trials with repeat outcome measurements over time, we utilized and reported the study's final outcome measure reflecting the whole follow-up time for each individual participant. For studies with 2 x 2 factorial designs in which there were more than one treatment group we chose not to combine experimental intervention groups into a single group and risk loss of information regarding the effects of different antihelminthic treatments. Rather, we chose to present the interventions separately and divide the total number of participants in the control group to account for multiple comparisons in meta-analyses. The means and standard deviations were left unchanged as recommended in Section 16.5.4 of the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). This method only partially overcomes the unit-of-analysis error (because the resulting comparisons remain correlated). However, an advantage of this approach is that it allows for investigations of heterogeneity across intervention arms.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Kelly-1996-ZMB" TYPE="STUDY">Kelly 1996 ZMB</LINK> administered albendazole twice daily for two weeks to adults with chronic diarrhoea, and reported seven adverse events in the treatment group and three in the control group. Of the seven adverse events with albendazole, one participant had a cutaneous reaction that resolved within one week of discontinuing the drug, and four complained of dizziness, headache, cough, and difficulty swallowing. The trial authors noted that the symptoms were indistinguishable from symptoms of the underlying illness. <LINK REF="STD-Walson-2012-KEN" TYPE="STUDY">Walson 2012 KEN</LINK> administered praziquantel annually and albendazole every three months for two years, and reported 16 severe adverse events in the treatment group and 18 in the control group.

In the pooled analysis, treatment was associated with a point estimate of a 33% reduction in mortality, but the CIs included no effect (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.14; P = 0.19, five trials, 1627 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>). Most deaths occurred in the oldest study where participants were chronically unwell (had chronic diarrhoea) and were probably not on ART (<LINK REF="STD-Kelly-1996-ZMB" TYPE="STUDY">Kelly 1996 ZMB</LINK>).

<P>Only one trial captured data regarding changes in serum haemoglobin levels (<LINK REF="STD-Kallestrup-2005-ZWE" TYPE="STUDY">Kallestrup 2005 ZWE</LINK>). The trial authors reported a mean difference in haemoglobin of &#8722;0.25 g/dL (95% CI &#8722;0.58 to &#8722;0.08) in the HIV-positive participants that received praziquantel relative to the untreated participants over three months follow-up (unpublished data).</P>
<P>A secondary analysis of the primary <LINK REF="STD-Nielsen-2007-TZA" TYPE="STUDY">Nielsen 2007 TZA</LINK> trial examined the effect of antihelminthic treatment on micronutrient indicators in LF and HIV co-infected individuals (Nielsen 2009). The study found that serum ferritin levels increased in co-infected individuals 12 weeks after treatment. The study authors observed a log mean increase of 0.07 킽/L in the treatment group, while they noted a log mean increase of 0.04 킽/L in the non-treated group. The mean difference in log ferritin levels between baseline and 12 weeks follow-up in the treated group relative to the control group was thus 0.03 킽/L (95% CI &#8722;0.30 to 0.35) (unpublished data provided by the study authors). As the study authors did not observe the same increase in ferritin in the HIV-positive LF-uninfected groups, the study authors hypothesize that the serum ferritin changes may be related to the immune mechanisms involved in killing of filaria.</P>

<P>In human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected antiretroviral (ART)-naive adults with unknown helminth infection status, provision of deworming drugs (albendazole and praziquantel together or separately) may have a small suppressive effect on viral load at six weeks. However, these data come from a small single trial and the 95% confidence interval (CI) includes the possibility of no effect (<I>low quality evidence</I>). Repeated dosing over two years appears to have little or no effect in HIV-positive ART-naive adults (<I>moderate quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>Treating helminth infections in HIV-positive individuals with confirmed helminth infections may have a small suppressive effect on mean viral load at six to 12 weeks (<I>low quality evidence</I>). However, this finding is strongly influenced by a single study of praziquantel for schistosomiasis and further studies from different settings and populations are needed for validation. There may also be a small favourable effect on mean CD4+ cell count at 12 weeks.</P>
<P>Most of the included trials did not consistently or rigorously report adverse events (<I>very low quality evidence)</I> and trials were underpowered to evaluate effects on mortality (<I>low quality evidence). </I>However, there is no indication of excessive risk associated with deworming HIV-positive populations<I>.</I>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-03-29 15:59:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite the publication of five new RCTs since the previous edition of this Cochrane Review, <LINK REF="REF-Walson-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walson 2009</LINK>, there is still insufficient evidence to make definitive conclusions about the effects of deworming drugs on markers of HIV disease progression. The eight trials included evaluate different drugs used to treat different helminth infections, which limits our ability to make broad generalizations.</P>
<P>For preventive chemotherapy programmes, in which deworming drugs are provided presumptively to all individuals, this Cochrane Review includes only two relevant trials and only one that reported long-term effects. In the short-term trial there is a suggestion of a short-term benefit to deworming, however the trial is too small to prove an effect. Similarly, while the single long-term trial found no evidence of benefit, further trials from other settings with different helminth endemicities are necessary before the possibility of long-term beneficial effects can be fully excluded.</P>
<P>Only short-term evidence is available when we limit the analysis to HIV-positive adults with confirmed helminth infections. The finding of a suppressive effect on viral load in this group is highly reliant on a single trial of praziquantel for schistosomiasis. While the effect estimate of the pooled analysis is small (&#8722;0.13 log<SUB>10</SUB>), mathematical modelling exercises estimate that a decrease in viral load of 0.3 log<SUB>10</SUB> in heterosexual couples could decrease HIV transmission by an average of 20% and AIDS-related illnesses or death by 25% (<LINK REF="REF-Modjarrad-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Modjarrad 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is also important to note that none of the trials included children, and only one trial included a significant number of people taking ART (<LINK REF="STD-Abate-2014-ETH" TYPE="STUDY">Abate 2014 ETH</LINK>). These are therefore important groups for further research.</P>
<P>While overall few adverse events were reported in the included trials (23 in total in treated participants and 21 in total in non-treated participants), it is important to note that only three trials defined adverse events, one with a detailed definition of qualifying adverse events (<LINK REF="STD-Kelly-1996-ZMB" TYPE="STUDY">Kelly 1996 ZMB</LINK>), and two with more generalized definitions (<LINK REF="STD-Suputtamongkol-2011-THA" TYPE="STUDY">Suputtamongkol 2011 THA</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Webb-2012-UGA" TYPE="STUDY">Webb 2012 UGA</LINK>). Only one trial reported how adverse events were monitored, using patient record-keeping cards and house visits (<LINK REF="STD-Kelly-1996-ZMB" TYPE="STUDY">Kelly 1996 ZMB</LINK>). Despite these biases, most randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reported no adverse events following antihelminthic therapy and there is no evidence of excessive harm associated with deworming in HIV-positive populations. To validate review findings, larger RCTs should be conducted with well-documented and active adverse event identification, as well as frequent follow-up points to assess how deworming may affect HIV-positive populations of all ages over time.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-03-24 17:42:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We have presented the GRADE assessment of the quality of evidence in the included trials in the 'Summary of findings' tables (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>)<I>. </I>The overall assessment of quality ranges from moderate (representing a moderate level of certainty in the result) to very low (where we are very uncertain of the result).</P>
<P>The primary reason for downgrading the quality of evidence was 'indirectness', where we had too few trials to make broad generalizations about the potential effects. This is a particular problem for trials that evaluate deworming in populations with unknown helminth infection status as helminth endemicity varies substantially across settings, undoubtedly influencing observed findings. Although we had more data from trials that evaluated deworming drugs in participants with documented helminth infections, the substantial heterogeneity in populations and deworming drugs used again decreased our confidence in making broad generalizations. The second most common reason for downgrading the quality of evidence was 'imprecision' in effect estimates. Many of the included trials were small, and had wide 95% CIs, which included the possibility of both clinically important effects and no effect.</P>

Subsequently two additional RCTs were published (<LINK REF="STD-Nielsen-2007-TZA" TYPE="STUDY">Nielsen 2007 TZA</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walson-2008-KEN" TYPE="STUDY">Walson 2008 KEN</LINK>), and a Cochrane Review of all three RCTs concluded that treatment of helminth co-infection appeared to result in favourable effects on markers of HIV-1 disease progression (<LINK REF="REF-Walson-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walson 2009</LINK>). Specifically, the pooled analysis of the data suggested that treatment of helminth co-infection may attenuate increases in HIV-1 RNA and result in slower decline in CD4+ counts.</P>
<P>The findings of this Cochrane Review update are consistent with the previous edition (<LINK REF="REF-Walson-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walson 2009</LINK>). However, we used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence, which caused us to downgrade the quality of the evidence. As we stratified by helminth infection status, we also separately provide evidence for individuals who were helminth-infected or of unknown infection status.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-03-29 15:59:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-03-29 15:59:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is low quality evidence that treating confirmed helminth infections in HIV-positive adults has a short-term favourable effect on markers of HIV disease progression. Further studies are necessary to confirm this finding. However, there is no evidence that deworming is harmful. This is reassuring for the routine treatment of confirmed or suspected helminth infections in people living with HIV in co-endemic areas.</P>
<P>Further long-term studies would be required to make conclusions about the likely impact of a policy of deworming all HIV-positive individuals irrespective of helminth infection status (i.e. preventive chemotherapy) as the only trial to date did not demonstrate an effect.</P>
<P>Given the large favourable effect of ART on HIV disease progression, the additive effect of regular deworming, if any, is unknown.</P>

<P>Further long-term studies are required to make conclusions regarding the likely impact of deworming all HIV-positive individuals irrespective of helminth infection status, as the only trial to date did not demonstrate an effect.</P>
<P>Future RCTs should consider measuring both helminth infection status and long-term HIV disease progression outcomes repeatedly between baseline and end line to understand how disease progression changes over differential amounts of follow-up time. These RCTs should have well-documented and active adverse event identification. Given that deworming is often targeted at preschool and school-age children, it is also important to identify the benefit in HIV-positive children.</P>

<P>Length of follow-up: all subjects were followed-up at 1, 12, 13, and 24 weeks after the 1st round of treatment. The data presented in the published manuscript considered the 12-week visit as the initial visit and the 24-week visit as the final visit. Individuals treated at the initial visit with diethylcarbamazine (DEC) were then considered as the 'placebo' arm and those who were not treated until the 12-week visit were the 'treatment' arm. For the purposes of this analysis, we considered only individuals with confirmed HIV-1 infection who were also filariasis-infected at the baseline visit. We considered individuals treated with DEC at the initial visit to be in the 'treatment' arm and those who did not receive treatment to be in the 'placebo' arm. We reported outcomes as indicated for the 12-week visit. As all participants were treated with DEC by the 12 week visit, we did not include data from the 24-week follow-up period.</P>
<P>Monitoring and diagnostics: diagnosis of infection with lymphatic filariasis (LF) infection with <I>W. bancrofti </I>was performed using immunochromatographic tests (ICT) followed by ELISA testing for circulating filarial antigens (CFA) in serum samples.
