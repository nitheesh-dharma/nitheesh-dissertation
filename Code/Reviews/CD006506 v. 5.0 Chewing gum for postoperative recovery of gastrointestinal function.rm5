<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>When people have surgery on their abdomen, the digestive system can stop working for a few days. This is called ileus, and can be painful and uncomfortable. There are different causes of ileus, and several ways of treating or preventing it. One possible way of preventing ileus is by chewing gum. The idea is that chewing gum tricks the body into thinking it is eating, causing the digestive system to start working again. It is important to do this review because ileus is common: it is estimated that up to a third of people having bowel surgery suffer from ileus.</P>
<P>
<B>Main Findings</B>
</P>
<P>This review found 81 relevant studies that recruited over 9000 participants in total. The studies mainly focussed on people having bowel surgery or caesarean section, but there were some studies of other surgery types. There were few studies of children. Most studies were of poor quality, which may mean their results are less reliable. We found some evidence that people who chewed gum after an operation were able to pass wind and have bowel movements sooner than people who did not chew gum. We also found some evidence that people who chewed gum after an operation had bowel sounds (gurgling sounds heard using a stethoscope held to the abdomen) slightly sooner than people who did not chew gum. There was a small difference in how long people stayed in hospital between people who did or did not chew gum. There were no differences in complications (such as infection or death) between people who did or did not chew gum. There was also no difference in the overall cost of treatment between people who did or did not chew gum.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusions</B>
</P>
<P>There is some evidence that chewing gum after surgery may help the digestive system to recover. However, the studies included in this review are generally of poor quality, which meant that their results may not be reliable. We also know that there are many factors affecting ileus, and that modern treatment plans attempt to reduce risk of ileus. Therefore to further explore using chewing gum after surgery, more studies would be needed which are larger, of better quality, include different types of surgery, and consider recent changes in health care systems.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-12-08 14:48:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Ileus commonly occurs after abdominal surgery, and is associated with complications and increased length of hospital stay (LOHS). Onset of ileus is considered to be multifactorial, and a variety of preventative methods have been investigated. Chewing gum (CG) is hypothesised to reduce postoperative ileus by stimulating early recovery of gastrointestinal (GI) function, through cephalo-vagal stimulation. There is no comprehensive review of this intervention in abdominal surgery.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-12-08 14:48:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (via Ovid), MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE (via Ovid), CINAHL (via EBSCO) and ISI Web of Science (June 2014). We hand-searched reference lists of identified studies and previous reviews and systematic reviews, and contacted CG companies to ask for information on any studies using their products. We identified proposed and ongoing studies from clinicaltrials.gov, World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and <I>meta</I>Register of Controlled Trials.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-02-18 16:23:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two authors independently collected data and assessed study quality using an adapted Cochrane risk of bias (ROB) tool, and resolved disagreements by discussion. We assessed overall quality of evidence for each outcome using Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). Studies were split into subgroups: colorectal surgery (CRS), caesarean section (CS) and other surgery (OS). We assessed the effect of CG on time to first flatus (TFF), time to bowel movement (TBM), LOHS and time to bowel sounds (TBS) through meta-analyses using a random-effects model. We investigated the influence of study quality, reviewers&#8217; methodological estimations and use of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) programmes using sensitivity analyses. We used meta-regression to explore if surgical site or ROB scores predicted the extent of the effect estimate of the intervention on continuous outcomes. We reported frequency of complications, and descriptions of tolerability of gum and cost.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-05-19 18:26:54 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified 81 studies that comprised 9072 participants for inclusion in our review. We categorised many studies at high or unclear risk of the bias' assessed. There was statistical evidence that use of CG reduced TFF [overall reduction of 10.4 hours (95% CI: -11.9, -8.9): 12.5 hours (95% CI: -17.2, -7.8) in CRS, 7.9 hours (95% CI: &#8211;10.0, -5.8) in CS, 10.6 hours (95% CI: -12.7, -8.5) in OS]. There was also statistical evidence that use of CG reduced TBM [overall reduction of 12.7 hours (95% CI: -14.5, -10.9): 18.1 hours (95% CI: -25.3, -10.9) in CRS, 9.1 hours (95% CI: -11.4, -6.7) in CS, 12.3 hours (95% CI: -14.9, -9.7) in OS]. There was statistical evidence that use of CG slightly reduced LOHS [overall reduction of 0.7 days (95% CI: -0.8, -0.5): 1.0 days in CRS (95% CI: -1.6, -0.4), 0.2 days (95% CI: -0.3, -0.1) in CS, 0.8 days (95% CI: -1.1, -0.5) in OS]. There was statistical evidence that use of CG slightly reduced TBS [overall reduction of 5.0 hours (95% CI: -6.4, -3.7): 3.21 hours (95% CI: -7.0, 0.6) in CRS, 4.4 hours (95% CI: -5.9, -2.8) in CS, 6.3 hours (95% CI: -8.7, -3.8) in OS]. Effect sizes were largest in CRS and smallest in CS. There was statistical evidence of heterogeneity in all analyses other than TBS in CRS.</P>
<P>There was little difference in mortality, infection risk and readmission rate between the groups. Some studies reported reduced nausea and vomiting and other complications in the intervention group. CG was generally well-tolerated by participants. There was little difference in cost between the groups in the two studies reporting this outcome.</P>
<P>Sensitivity analyses by quality of studies and robustness of review estimates revealed no clinically important differences in effect estimates. Sensitivity analysis of ERAS studies showed a smaller effect size on TFF, larger effect size on TBM, and no difference between groups for LOHS.</P>
<P>Meta-regression analyses indicated that surgical site is associated with the extent of the effect size on LOHS (all surgical subgroups), and TFF and TBM (CS and CRS subgroups only). There was no evidence that ROB score predicted the extent of the effect size on any outcome. Neither variable explained the identified heterogeneity between studies.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-02-19 10:53:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review identified some evidence for the benefit of postoperative CG in improving recovery of GI function. However, the research to date has primarily focussed on CS and CRS, and largely consisted of small, poor quality trials. Many components of the ERAS programme also target ileus, therefore the benefit of CG alongside ERAS may be reduced, as we observed in this review. Therefore larger, better quality RCTS in an ERAS setting in wider surgical disciplines would be needed to improve the evidence base for use of CG after surgery.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-02-18 16:16:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although there is not currently one widely accepted definition of ileus (<LINK REF="REF-Vather-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vather 2013</LINK>), this condition has previously been described as a transient impairment of bowel motility after abdominal surgery or other trauma (<LINK REF="REF-Holte-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holte 2000</LINK>). Ileus is therefore considered to be an inevitable consequence of abdominal surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Tu-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tu 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gervaz-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gervaz 2006</LINK>), and commonly occurs following colorectal, gynaecological, thoracic and urological surgical procedures (<LINK REF="REF-Bashankaev-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bashankaev 2009</LINK>). Prevalence of ileus is difficult to estimate due to the lack of accurate reporting and lack of a standardised definition (<LINK REF="REF-Barletta-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barletta 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vather-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vather 2013</LINK>). Evidence indicates that ileus is most prolonged following large bowel surgery, and reports in this surgical discipline range from 3 to 32% of patients (<LINK REF="REF-Kronberg-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kronberg 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vasquez-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vasquez 2009</LINK>). There is evidence however that the introduction of laparoscopic surgery may reduce incidence of ileus (<LINK REF="REF-Fujii-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fujii 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hosono-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hosono 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Resolution of ileus is an important factor in the speed of postoperative recovery. Ileus can lead to nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2009</LINK>), increased length of hospital stay (LOHS) (<LINK REF="STD-Schuster-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Schuster 2006</LINK>) and therefore increased costs (<LINK REF="REF-Fitzgerald-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fitzgerald 2009</LINK>). Additionally, it has been suggested that postoperative ileus can result in poorer wound healing, delays in time to mobilisation and resumption of oral intake, and reduced patient satisfaction (<LINK REF="REF-Behm-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Behm 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The pathogenesis of postoperative ileus is multifactorial (<LINK REF="STD-Bonventre-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Bonventre 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Le-Blanc_x002d_Louvry-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Le Blanc-Louvry 2002</LINK>), as numerous factors influencing the surgical stress response contribute to the development and duration of ileus. These include degree of bowel manipulation, level of surgical trauma, anaesthesia and effects of postoperative modifiers such as pain management with opiates (<LINK REF="REF-Holte-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holte 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lim-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Lim 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tu-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tu 2014</LINK>). Additionally, suggested risk factors for postoperative ileus include increasing age, high body mass index and ethnic minority (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Svatek-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Svatek 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Resolution of ileus usually occurs two to five days postoperatively (<LINK REF="REF-Livingston-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Livingston 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Warren-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warren 2011</LINK>). Generally the small intestine is the first part of the digestive system to recover postoperatively within 24 hours, followed by the stomach within 24 to 48 hours, and the large bowel after 48 to 72 hours (<LINK REF="REF-Gervaz-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gervaz 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nimarta-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Nimarta 2013</LINK>). Various approaches have been investigated to prevent onset and reduce duration of ileus, incorporating both reducing surgical stress and optimising postoperative care. These include providing nasogastric decompression, performing minimally invasive surgery, promoting early ambulation, avoiding preoperative bowel preparation, limiting intravenous fluid administration, using prokinetic agents, using epidural analgesia and reducing opiate use for pain management (<LINK REF="REF-Story-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Story 2009</LINK>). Many of these practices have been incorporated into the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) programme endorsed across UK National Health Service (NHS) hospitals nationally. Early postoperative feeding is another component of ERAS that may stimulate gut motility, thereby reducing onset and duration of ileus (<LINK REF="REF-Fanning-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fanning 2011</LINK>). However, early postoperative feeding is not universally accepted, as it is not always well tolerated by patients. For example, vomiting and the risk of postoperative complications such as aspiration may be increased (<LINK REF="REF-Basaran-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Basaran 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lewis-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Additionally, a number of non-clinical approaches to reduce postoperative ileus have been suggested. These include drinking coffee, herbal formulae, acupuncture, mechanical abdominal massage and rocking-chair motion (<LINK REF="REF-Endo-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Endo 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Garcia-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Le-Blanc_x002d_Louvry-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Le Blanc-Louvry 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Massey-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Massey 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-M_x00fc_ller-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Müller 2012</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-05-19 18:30:30 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It has been suggested that chewing gum (CG) postoperatively may help recovery of gastrointestinal (GI) function by stimulating earlier resumption of bowel activity (<LINK REF="STD-Asao-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Asao 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lim-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Lim 2013</LINK>). CG is a form of sham feeding that replicates the process of eating without ingestion of food. Thus, it may stimulate GI function without producing the complications associated with early feeding e.g. nausea, vomiting. CG is a cheap and widely available product which most people have previously experienced. Therefore it is an intervention which is likely to be well tolerated by individuals postoperatively.</P>

<P>In 2002, results from a small randomised controlled trial (RCT) suggested that use of CG may hasten postoperative recovery (<LINK REF="STD-Asao-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Asao 2002</LINK>). Since that time, a number of trials have examined the effect of CG on postoperative ileus, and several have demonstrated benefits (<LINK REF="STD-Abd_x002d_El_x002d_Maeboud-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Abd-El-Maeboud 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ledari-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ledari 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marwah-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Marwah 2012</LINK>). It is thought that there are three main mechanisms by which CG may reduce duration and prevent onset of ileus (<LINK REF="REF-Tandeter-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tandeter 2009</LINK>). First, stimulation of gut motility by cephalo-vagal stimulation which in turn leads to release of GI hormones. Second, &#8216;sham feeding&#8217; tricks parts of the digestive system and stimulates motility. Third, encouragement of release of pancreatic juices and saliva (<LINK REF="REF-Tandeter-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tandeter 2009</LINK>). This intervention may provide a means to reduce the duration of postoperative ileus without the adverse effects of increased vomiting and nausea associated with early postoperative feeding. In addition, this may provide an intervention in patients where food cannot be tolerated.</P>
<P>Serious adverse events are unlikely to occur with this intervention; studies have reported no adverse events (<LINK REF="STD-Choi-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Choi 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Husslein-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Husslein 2013</LINK>). However incidents such as indigestion or bloating, potentially due to aerophagia whilst chewing, may occur (<LINK REF="STD-Zaghiyan-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Zaghiyan 2013</LINK>). Additionally CG may cause choking in individuals with dysphagia and in people who have difficulty chewing, such as individuals with dental problems, poor/loosely fitting dentures and young children.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-02-18 13:33:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Chewing gum may offer an innovative intervention for improving postoperative GI function recovery. Earlier resolution of ileus may result in reductions in patient discomfort, complications and LOHS. Considering the number of people who undergo abdominal operations each year globally, and the high prevalence of ileus within these, this could have implications for healthcare costs and recovery. It is therefore essential that benefits and costs are carefully evaluated. This systematic review (SR) summarises the available evidence on the use of CG in reducing the onset and duration of ileus by improving the rate of return of postoperative GI function.</P>

</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2015-02-19 12:40:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The objective of this review is to examine whether chewing gum (CG) after surgery hastens the return of gastrointestinal (GI) function. The review considers the impact of CG on indicators of bowel function [time to first flatus (TFF), bowel movement (TBM) and bowel sounds (TBS)] and on recovery [length of hospital stay (LOHS) and postoperative complications]. The review also considers tolerability of CG and the financial costs and benefits associated with using this intervention.</P>

<P>Two review authors (VS and GH) independently examined the titles and abstracts of studies identified through the search strategy.

We obtained full-text papers for all studies that could not be excluded on the basis of title and abstract. The same review authors then independently refined their selection by examining the selected articles and excluding those not relevant to this review. Review authors recorded agreement on trial inclusion, and disagreement was resolved by predetermined co-review authors (ST and SJL for clinical disputes, RP and CP for methodological disputes). We contacted original study authors where further clarity was needed in order to select a study for inclusion. We documented decisions on all studies and these are presented in the PRISMA flow chart (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>).</P>

<P>Two review authors (VS and either GH or RP) independently extracted data from each study. Review authors were blinded to each other&#8217;s data. We developed a data extraction form adapted for this review from the original provided by Cochrane. Three authors (VS, GH and RP) examined this on several studies selected for inclusion, and revised it for ease of extraction and to include further useful data items. We extracted data regarding participant demographics, participant disease status, surgical procedures, control group postoperative care and the intervention (frequency and duration of CG) using these predesigned data extraction forms. In order to ensure accurate data extraction, three review authors (VS, GH and RP) independently extracted and compared data from 16 (20%) studies for consistency.</P>
<P>Many of the identified studies were published in other languages. Titles and abstracts were generally available in English, and where studies appeared to meet the inclusion criteria, they were either translated or directly extracted onto the data extraction form.

<P>Either two or three review authors (VS and either GH or RP) independently assessed risk of bias (ROB).

We developed this as data extraction continued. We included specific examples and numerical cut-off points in the adapted ROB tool (<LINK REF="APP-07" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 7</LINK>), to ensure consistency of ROB assessments. We then discussed ROB for all studies to ensure uniformity and agreement. Where possible, we sought protocols to aid assessment of selective outcome reporting bias. We reported use of sample size/power calculations and intention-to-treat analyses as measures of methodological quality. We labelled ROB as &#8216;high&#8217;, &#8216;low&#8217; or &#8216;unclear&#8217; for the following categories: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of personnel, blinding of outcome assessment (for TFF, TBM, LOHS, TBS and complications), incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and &#8216;other&#8217; risks (e.g. differences in baseline demographics, study sample size).</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2015-02-19 10:37:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We performed analyses in RevMan 5.3. Analyses comprised only within-study comparisons rather than individual-level data. Comparisons were based on an intention-to-treat analysis. We used a random-effects model for the meta-analysis of results, as there was a high level of heterogeneity among included studies. Three authors (VS, CP and RP) discussed results for each outcome measure within each study, to determine the inclusion of data in the meta-analyses. Where data were not provided in the form of a mean and standard deviation, we derived these from the reported test statistics or estimated them from the reported data if suitable test statistics were not reported. We used the following methods to transform or estimate data:</P>
<P>· We estimated missing standard deviations using the most conservative reliable standard deviation from another study in the same surgical subgroup</P>
<P>· We considered medians as means if reported alone, and applied the most conservative reliable standard deviation from another study in the same surgical subgroup</P>
<P>· Where results were presented as median and range, we calculated mean and standard deviation using the formulae described by <LINK REF="REF-Hozo-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hozo 2005</LINK>
</P>
<P>· Where complications were reported as % incidence, we converted this into the number of participants who experienced complications.</P>
<P>Co-authors checked 100% of continuous outcome data entered into Revman for included studies.

<P>We conducted subgroup analyses to determine the sensitivity of overall conclusions to the surgical site. The key surgical disciplines reporting trials in this research area are colorectal surgery (CRS) and caesarean section (CS); we therefore created three subgroups: &#8216;CRS&#8217;, &#8216;CS&#8217; and &#8216;other surgery&#8217; (OS).</P>
<P>We used meta-regression to assess whether the overall effect size was associated with the surgical site and whether this was a source of heterogeneity between studies using the 'metareg' package for the statistical software 'Stata 13' (<LINK REF="REF-StataCorp-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">StataCorp 2013</LINK>). We also assigned each study a ROB score based on the combination of high and unclear risks for random sequence generation, allocation concealment, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting or &#8216;other&#8217; types of bias (a score of one was given for each unclear risk and a score of two for each high risk). Based on the spread of ROB scores, we categorised studies into subgroups by overall score: zero to three, four to five and six to ten. We used meta-regression to assess the association between ROB score and overall effect size and whether this was a source of heterogeneity between studies.<BR/>

There was no difference between the intervention and control groups in LOHS: analysis of 724 participants from 4 studies showed an increase of 0.1 days (95% CI -0.4, 0.5). <LINK REF="STD-Atkinson-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Atkinson 2014</LINK> was the only study conducted in an ERAS context that reported TBS.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Meta-regression</HEADING>
<P>Meta-regression was considered more appropriate than the standard Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test available in the RevMan software due to the differences in our subgroups (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) (discussed in <LINK TAG="APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS" TYPE="SECTION">Overall completeness and applicability of evidence</LINK>). As observed in the overall analyses, meta-regression models indicated an association between surgical site and effectiveness of the intervention (see <LINK REF="APP-14" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 14</LINK>). Effects were greatest in CRS, followed by OS, with the smallest effect sizes in the CS subgroup. There was weak evidence that the extent of effect of CG on LOHS was greater in both the CRS and OS subgroups than the CS subgroup (CRS compared to CS: regression coefficient = -0.9 days, P = 0.026; OS compared to CS: regression coefficient = -0.7 days, P = 0.045). There was also weak evidence that the extent of effect of CG on TFF and TBM was greater in the CRS subgroup than the CS subgroup (TFF: regression coefficient = -4.7 hours, P = 0.067; TBM: regression coefficient = -8.7 hours, P = 0.047). There was no evidence of an influence of surgical site on the extent of effect of CG on TBS. ROB score was not associated with the extent of effect of CG on TFF, TBM, TBS or LOHS. In a mutually adjusted model, adjusting for both surgical site and ROB score, the association between surgical site and extent of effect on LOHS and TBM persisted (LOHS CRS subgroup: regression coefficient = -0.9 days, P = 0.035; LOHS OS subgroup: regression coefficient = -0.8 days, P = 0.026; TBM CRS subgroup: regression coefficient = -8.9 hours, P = 0.044), and there was evidence of a weak association between ROB score and TBS (TBS ROB score 6 to 10 subgroup: regression coefficient = 6.5 hours, P = 0.047). There was no longer evidence for an influence of surgical site on extent of effect on TFF. I<SUP>2</SUP> values did not support surgical site or ROB score as a source of heterogeneity between studies.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-12-08 14:58:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our review shows that there is some evidence for a reduction in TFF and TBM with use of postoperative CG (reductions of 10.4 and 12.7 hours respectively), with a modest clinical difference in LOHS and TBS. There was also no clear difference in mortality, infection and readmissions between groups. Although we were unable to formally meta-analyse complications, some studies reported reduced nausea and vomiting and other complications in the intervention group. CG was generally well-tolerated by participants. There was little difference in cost between groups, but only two studies reported this outcome. Findings are summarised in the <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>.</P>
<P>Sensitivity analyses for study quality and use of estimated data showed no clinically important changes to the findings. The effect of CG on outcomes was generally reduced in the analysis of studies conducted within an ERAS context. Meta-regression analyses indicated that surgical site is associated with the effectiveness of chewing gum on LOHS (for all surgical subgroups), and TFF and TBM (for CS and CRS). ROB score was not associated with the extent of effect of the intervention.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Completeness</HEADING>
<P>We attempted to identify and synthesise all existing research to provide a comprehensive estimate of the effect of CG on postoperative recovery of GI function. We included 81 studies that comprised 9072 participants; the largest SR to date prior to ours included only 17 RCTs that recruited 1374 participants (<LINK REF="REF-Li-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 2013</LINK>). However, our search strategies may not have identified all of the existing literature. Additionally, eight identified publications could not be located through our library resources (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>), potentially biasing our results. Several studies also reported results in a format that could not be used in the review (see <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). However, where possible we estimated and made assumptions about the data, which allowed us to use the majority of identified information.</P>
<P>We looked at similar outcomes to other SRs, but further outcomes reported in studies such as time to first solid food consumption could have been assessed as another marker of recovery. Inclusion of reports of subjective markers of recovery, such as self-report measures of pain, hunger and fatigue may also have been helpful to incorporate into this review. Nonetheless, the outcomes that we have presented are useful measures of postoperative recovery of GI function.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Applicability</HEADING>
<P>Most studies applied exclusion criteria to individuals for study participation. These frequently included previous abdominal surgery, thereby limiting the applicability of findings for people with recurrent surgical problems. Many studies also had upper or lower age restrictions, and children have been particularly neglected in this research area (only four studies in this review were conducted in children). Furthermore, studies often excluded individuals with intraoperative or postoperative complications, and common co-morbidities such as diabetes. This restricts the applicability of findings for groups other than &#8216;healthy&#8217; people.</P>
<P>Studies included in this review were conducted in various countries, incorporating a range of cultures and health care systems which may have an effect on outcomes. For example, <LINK REF="STD-Shang-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Shang 2010</LINK> state that in Chinese culture it is not acceptable for women to take anti-emetics during lactation. Therefore CG following CS may be more effective in minimising nausea and vomiting among women living in China. Future analyses focusing on country or health care system may be useful to determine the applicability of results to different parts of the world. In addition, standard health care practice is likely to vary across countries. For example, ERAS is employed to different degrees internationally, which may impact on the effectiveness of CG.</P>
<P>A priori, we grouped studies into CRS, CS and OS subgroups. However, we had not anticipated the volume of studies or the broad range of surgical disciplines encompassed by the OS subgroup. Therefore, the overall meta-analysed result may not be applicable to the individual surgical specialties. Future reviews could further sub-divide this category by specific surgery type, such as gynaecological procedures or cholecystectomy. We conducted an exploratory analysis investigating gynaecological studies from the OS subgroup, which demonstrated a smaller effect of CG on TFF, but little difference in other outcomes (data not shown).</P>
<P>There are likely to be a number of important differences between our chosen subgroups. For example, the CS participants (of childbearing age) are generally much younger than the CRS subgroup. In addition, CS participants are likely to be a healthier population than the other subgroups, as surgery is for pregnancy rather than disease. Therefore these underlying assumptions about the overall surgical population should be considered when interpreting our results and for any comparisons between subgroups that may be made.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Methodology</HEADING>
<P>Methodological quality and ROB were difficult to assess in many studies due to poor reporting. Those with available information were of variable methodological rigour. Several studies applied inadequate methods for randomisation sequence generation and allocation concealment. Allocation concealment methods were the most poorly reported of all evaluated ROB elements. There were also few reports of attempts to to blind outcome assessors and other personnel. The majority of ROB assessments were therefore classified as &#8216;unclear&#8217; or &#8216;high&#8217; risk. However, the sensitivity analyses refining by study quality did not change the direction or extent of effect estimates. Meta-regression also did not identify an association between ROB score and effectiveness of the intervention for any outcome.</P>
<P>Few studies reported use of sample size or power calculations; of those that did, several did not meet the target sample size. Many other studies included small sample sizes, reducing the power of the trial to observe clinically important differences in outcomes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Outcome Assessment</HEADING>
<P>Ileus is the clinical outcome of interest in this research area. However, there is not currently a widely accepted definition of ileus (<LINK REF="REF-Vather-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vather 2013</LINK>). Instead, TFF, TBM and TBS are used as proxy markers of ileus resolution. A more consistent outcome using a combination of individual markers as described in <LINK REF="REF-Tan-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tan 2006</LINK> would allow for a more precise measure of ileus resolution, which could improve the quality of the evidence base.</P>
<P>TFF and TBM rely on self-report. Postoperative participants may feel unwell or disorientated; hence these self-reported outcomes may be open to misreporting or bias. Additionally blinding of participants with this intervention is not possible, and an awareness of treatment allocation may result in participants misreporting these outcomes. However, this risk of bias is applicable to all studies reporting these outcomes, as TFF and TBM cannot be more accurately recorded by any another means. Reporting of TBS may also be inaccurate as it is generally dependent on clinicians&#8217; availability to listen as opposed to actual time to event. Furthermore, protocols for listening for bowel sounds may differ across studies. Finally, LOHS is likely to be influenced by variation in discharge criteria, which may result in differences between studies. This lack of uniformity across centres may introduce variability among some outcomes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">3. Heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>Considerable heterogeneity was observed in all of our results. Despite this, we are confident that this heterogeneity indicates variation in size of effect as opposed to direction, given that most studies&#8217; findings suggested a beneficial effect of CG on postoperative recovery outcomes. Our meta-regression analyses did not identify surgical site or ROB score as key sources of heterogeneity between studies. Additionally, visual inspection of the forest plots and associated data did not indicate that size of study affected effect size. However, visual inspection of the funnel plots for each continuous outcome indicated that publication bias may be present for TBM and LOHS (see <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>, <LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK>, <LINK REF="FIG-09" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 9</LINK>, <LINK REF="FIG-11" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 11</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Search strategy</HEADING>
<P>Although we believe that our electronic and hand-searching strategies identified the majority of relevant trials, it is possible that we may have missed some available literature or unpublished material. We stopped hand-searching at the end of August 2014, and in the time period until publication other trials may have been published or made available. These will be incorporated into future updates to this review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Assumptions about the mechanism of effect</HEADING>
<P>CG is assumed to work through cephalo-vagal stimulation for GI hormone production, &#8216;sham feeding&#8217; to cause GI motility, and release of pancreatic juices and saliva (<LINK REF="REF-Tandeter-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tandeter 2009</LINK>). The chewing action may not be the only mechanism by which CG might improve postoperative GI recovery. It has been suggested that the ingredients in some types of gum (particularly sugar-free gum) such as hexitols, may have a laxative effect (<LINK REF="REF-Tandeter-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tandeter 2009</LINK>). These may produce the GI stimulatory effect which is generally associated with the chewing action of gum. Our focus on the action of the CG intervention, rather than the ingredients, may have limited our approach and analyses. However, only one study used sugared gum, therefore stratification by intervention was not feasible in this review. Additionally, the small dosages of hexitols within a CG protocol [estimated to be approximately 3.75g of sorbitol per day, plus maxitols (<LINK REF="REF-Tandeter-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tandeter 2009</LINK>)] may not be great enough to produce considerable GI stimulation effects.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">3. Assumptions about the meta-analyses and results</HEADING>
<P>We may have introduced bias in the review process through the degree of data manipulation required to conduct meta-analyses. A diverse range of outcome metrics were reported across studies, requiring conversion to common units for use in this review. In addition, a large number of studies did not report data completely or conventionally. We therefore had to make estimations and assumptions using the available data (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). We conducted a sensitivity analysis removing all results that had been estimated, and the direction of effect for each subgroup within each outcome remained the same. Effect sizes remained similarly unchanged when less conservative estimates were applied to results, indicating that the quality of our statistical manipulations did not substantially affect our findings. Given the extent of heterogeneity present between studies a random-effects model was deemed appropriate (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). This may have resulted in smaller studies being granted a larger weighting than necessary, potentially biasing the overall meta-analysed results. As publication bias was identified from visual inspection of the funnel plots (see <LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK>, <LINK REF="FIG-09" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 9</LINK>), which may explain some of the heterogeneity between studies, we also ran the main meta-analyses using a fixed-effect model. This diminished effect estimates (by 1.3 hours, 3.5 hours, 0.5 days and 0.7 hours for TFF, TBM, LOHS and TBS respectively), but the direction of effect remained the same (see <LINK REF="APP-08" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 8</LINK>).</P>
<P>Studies reported a diverse range of complications which did not fall into natural categories. The categories we developed may therefore not completely represent the data, especially given that &#8216;other complications&#8217; ranged in severity from dry mouth to myocardial infarction. Nonetheless, we feel that the groups presented encompassed the complications of interest and relevance to this review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">4. Assumptions about study methodology</HEADING>
<P>We made a number of assumptions about the comparability of study methodology, including the control and intervention protocols, and compliance to the intervention.</P>
<P>There were a variety of care pathways for controls across studies including standard care, ERAS, early ambulation/exercise and nil-by-mouth. We combined all of these to form one control group, which may have given a different effect size compared to analyses stratified by control group care. In an exploratory analysis we expanded the ERAS sensitivity analysis by including a further ten studies employing early mobilisation (one of the components of ERAS) (<LINK REF="STD-Bahena_x002d_Aponte-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bahena-Aponte 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chen-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gong-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Gong 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guangqing-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Guangqing 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huang-2012b" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2012b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2012a" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2012a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Matros-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Matros 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tan-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yi-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Yi 2013</LINK>). Results did not differ greatly from those of the original analyses (data not shown).</P>
<P>Similarly, our analyses did not adjust for differences in CG protocols. Timing of intervention commencement, duration and frequency differed greatly across studies. It is possible that results may have varied due to a dose-response effect or threshold effect, but we feel that this was unlikely to have greatly affected our findings.</P>
<P>We recorded reports of compliance in the included studies (see <LINK REF="APP-15" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 15</LINK>). Sixteen studies described methods to monitor or improve compliance; of these, only six studies reported compliance levels, stated as high in five trials. Based on this, we assumed good compliance levels generally, despite poor reporting. As we were unable to test compliance, our results may underestimate the effect of CG through our assumption of high compliance across studies. It is also possible that control participants may have independently decided to chew gum, and if this was the case then the overall effect of CG on recovery of postoperative GI function may have been attenuated.</P>

<P>Several SRs have been published on this topic, with similarly positive results. Compared to a recent meta-analysis of 17 abdominal surgery studies (<LINK REF="REF-Li-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 2013</LINK>), we observed a slightly greater reduction in TFF, and similar reductions in TBM and LOHS. Authors conducted the same subgroup analyses as in our review: CRS (eight studies), CS (four studies) and OS (five studies). Our review showed greater reductions in TFF in the CRS subgroup (12.5 hours compared to 7.2 hours), greater reductions in TBM and LOHS in the CS subgroup (9.1 hours compared to 6.24 hours and 0.8 days compared to 0.21 days), and a smaller reduction in TBM in the OS subgroup (12.3 hours compared to 21.36 hours). All other results were comparable between reviews. <LINK REF="REF-Li-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 2013</LINK> also showed statistical evidence of heterogeneity, but found no evidence of publication bias.</P>
<P>Several SRs have demonstrated reductions in TFF and TBM, with less consistent effects on LOHS (<LINK REF="REF-Chan-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Noble-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noble 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parnaby-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parnaby 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vasquez-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vasquez 2009</LINK>). Variation in results may be due to differences in exclusion criteria; for example, one review excluded trials with unclear methodology and unclear statistical analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Parnaby-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parnaby 2009</LINK>). Our review included all of the studies meta-analysed in previous SRs, with the exception of one non-RCT (<LINK REF="REF-Kouba-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kouba 2007</LINK>) that was included in <LINK REF="REF-Noble-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noble 2009</LINK>. In agreement with our review, all previous SRs reported heterogeneity between included studies.</P>
<P>The most recent CRS SR that we are aware of identified 10 RCTs (<LINK REF="REF-Ho-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ho 2014</LINK>). However, compared to both our review and previous SRs, they reported markedly reduced effect sizes (0.517 hours, 0.502 hours and 0.5 days for TFF, TBM and LOHS respectively). For their analyses they used standard mean difference rather than weighted mean difference (as in our review and previous reviews), and the validity of their reported effect sizes has recently been questioned (<LINK REF="REF-Zhuang-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhuang 2014</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Ho-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ho 2014</LINK> reported similarly reduced effect sizes compared to our review for an ERAS specific sensitivity analysis of two trials. <LINK REF="REF-Ho-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ho 2014</LINK> suggested that CG does not provide any additional benefit to ERAS, whereas our results indicate that there may be some small further benefit for GI recovery outcomes. However, it is difficult to draw valid conclusions with only four studies. A temporal decrease in effect size can be seen across SRs, with newer SRs showing smaller effect estimates compared to older SRs (<LINK REF="REF-Chan-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Purkayastha-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Purkayastha 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Li-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yin-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yin 2013</LINK>). It is possible that this may reflect general improvements in care over time and factors such as the implementation of ERAS programmes, which may have diminished the effect of CG seen in older trials. One study in this review pre-empted the possible reduced effect of CG in an ERAS context, and chose not to use a fast-track programme so as not to mask the extent of effect observed with the intervention alone (<LINK REF="STD-Bonventre-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Bonventre 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although many trials and SRs have investigated CRS, there have been several SRs of CG use following CS. <LINK REF="REF-Zhu-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhu 2014</LINK> reported similar results to our review, with reductions of 6.42 hours, 6.58 hours, 3.62 hours and 5.94 hours in TFF, TBM, TBS and LOHS, based on results from six CS RCTs. TBS has not been frequently meta-analysed in surgical disciplines outside of CS.</P>
<P>Unlike previous SRs (<LINK REF="REF-Chan-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parnaby-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parnaby 2009</LINK>), we did not meta-analyse complications due to the diverse range reported in studies. Our results indicated that there may be reductions in nausea and vomiting and other general complications, but there was little difference in infections, mortality or readmissions between groups. Several previous reviews have suggested little or no effect of CG on frequency of complications (<LINK REF="REF-Belghazi-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belghazi 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chan-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Noble-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noble 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parnaby-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parnaby 2009</LINK>). However, some SRs have reported a lower risk of complications with use of CG (<LINK REF="REF-Ho-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ho 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Li-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 2013</LINK>), as well as suggestions that CG may be associated specifically with a reduction in risk of ileus (<LINK REF="REF-Craciunas-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Craciunas 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yuan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yuan 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>One prior review considered complications due the chewing gum itself (<LINK REF="REF-Parnaby-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parnaby 2009</LINK>); no complications were found, which is in agreement with our overall findings. Previous SRs have not reported on tolerability of gum in detail; our review suggests that CG is generally well-tolerated. Cost has not been commonly reported in SRs, but one previous review found that there was no difference between groups (<LINK REF="REF-Belghazi-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belghazi 2012</LINK>). Our results support these findings, although they are based on only two studies.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-02-18 18:02:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Ileus is a common problem following abdominal surgery. We found low quality evidence suggesting a clinically relevant decrease in TFF and TBM with CG. These results are based on many small, poor quality trials, with evidence of heterogeneity and publication bias for some outcomes. Our sensitivity analysis suggests that there is a reduced benefit of CG in the ERAS era. This is unsurprising, given that ERAS incorporates a range of components targeting ileus. This questions the benefit of adding CG to postoperative care within an established ERAS programme, although it must be noted that our findings are based on only four studies that explicitly stated that they were conducted within the context of an ERAS programme. However, there is also little chance of CG causing any adverse events. CG may be most clinically beneficial in centres where ERAS or fast track programmes are not in place, or where the application of some ERAS components is not practical, for example in people who cannot tolerate food or who have severe nausea and vomiting (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2014</LINK>
<U>)</U>.</P>
<P>The effect of CG on postoperative recovery outside CRS is also unclear. Our results suggest that the greatest benefits from CG may occur in CRS, and the least benefit in CS. This is not surprising given the differences in surgical trauma/duration of surgery, both of which can affect the extent of ileus. Given the overall poor quality of the evidence, it is not possible to draw firm conclusions regarding the inclusion of CG as part of routine practice.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-02-18 18:04:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Now that ERAS is becoming more widespread, the usefulness of CG in the context of an ERAS programme is the relevant question to be answered. The majority of studies included in this review do not state use of ERAS or &#8216;fast-track&#8217; protocols, but these are becoming increasingly popular. The limited number of ERAS trials included in this review demonstrate a need for RCTs within an ERAS context: RCTs comparing ERAS with or without the use of gum would be required. Additionally, the increasing application of ERAS internationally may reduce heterogeneity across future trials. Furthermore, future work could also focus on groups that are at high risk of developing ileus (due to longer or more complicated surgery), where the potential benefits of CG may be more apparent. Future studies could also include exploration of other less commonly investigated outcomes which may be clinically relevant, such as time to first food consumption, use of nasogastric tube insertion, pain and discomfort. Additionally, preoperative informed consent with postoperative randomisation may reduce attrition rates due to intraoperative and postoperative complications. The poor quality and small size of the trials to date also emphasise the necessity for large, better quality, well-designed trials.</P>
<P>The available literature largely focusses on CRS or CS. Our results show greater effects in CRS than CS, but further work would be required to establish the potential role of CG in other surgical disciplines. Similarly, the literature is also mainly limited to adults; further trials in children may be warranted.</P>
<P>Future trials would need to be higher quality and large, as differences between groups are likely to be smaller in ERAS populations. Given the modest effect size in ERAS trials in this review, the chance that such trials will show a clinically important difference is debatable. Therefore better quality, larger-scale trials would be required to provide further evidence and greater confidence in findings.</P>

<P>Studies in which the intervention consisted of gum in combination with another intervention were not considered. Frequency of complications were reported rather than incidence, as stated in the protocol.</P>
<P>We did not state in the protocol that we planned to search Google Scholar every two weeks up to page 20 with various combinations of key terms such as &#8220;gum, ileus&#8221;, &#8220;gum, bowel&#8221; and &#8220;gum, gastrointestinal&#8221;, or that we would contact authors for information on references from their reference lists if we could not access or identify them ourselves.</P>
<P>Both CP and RP resolved inconsistency between review authors regarding articles for full-text reading. Three authors (VS, GH and RP) extracted data for 20% of studies to ensure accurate data extraction, and for some studies ROB was assessed by these three authors to ensure consistent categorisations.</P>
<P>We stated in the protocol that we would use the ROB tool described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>); however we developed a more detailed tool tailored to this review, based on the criteria provided by Cochrane.</P>
<P>In the protocol we did not state that we would do post-hoc meta-analyses of continuous outcomes using a fixed-effect model.</P>
<P>In the protocol we stated that we would use the I<SUP>2</SUP> measurement to assess degree of statistical heterogeneity; in the review we also visually inspected forest plots and used the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> measurement (cut off of P &lt; 0.01), and stated that 50% would be used as a cut off I<SUP>2 </SUP>value for significant heterogeneity.</P>
<P>We assessed all of our outcomes using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) protocol. In the protocol we stated that we would do a further subgroup analysis to assess the effect of the intervention in studies that applied an ERAS protocol compared to those that did not; in the review we explored use of CG in an ERAS context using a sensitivity analysis instead.</P>
<P>In the protocol we stated that we would only use meta-regression to look at the association between surgical site and extent of effect, and whether this was a source of heterogeneity. In the review, we also looked at the association between ROB score and extent of effect, and considered whether either variable explained heterogeneity between studies.</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>2 members of the research team checked for bowel sounds on each participant using a standard stethoscope every 2 h beginning 3 h postoperatively until first bowel sounds were noticed. Observer blinding was achieved as a result of partition of gum chewing (every 2 h, starting 2 h postoperatively) and examination times (every 2 h, starting 3 h postoperatively). Participants and nursing staff were educated to keep the group allocation secret. The cardboard including the chewing gum was at all times hidden from the research team by being placed in the participants' personal bedside locker</P>

<P>Participants in the gum chewing arm were asked to record when, and for how long, they chewed gum, to retain wrappers and the chewed pieces of gum, and to return any unused gum. A log book was provided for recording all gum-chewing activities. Participants were asked to follow the gum chewing protocol for five days or until discharge; therefore, all data pertaining to compliance with the intervention were collected during their hospital stay. Participants in the control group were asked at the time of discharge if they chewed gum during their inpatient stay and, if so, how often</P>

<P>To ensure compliance, nurses were asked to administer the gum intervention as a medication 3 times a day in the morning (10:00 AM), afternoon (2:00 PM), and evening (6:00 PM), in the hope that this would provide a convenient time for nurses to remind participants about the importance of protocol compliance. If the participant was unable or unwilling to chew gum for 1 hour at the prescribed time (e.g. the participant was asleep or off the unit for a procedure, etc.), they were told that they could chew gum at any time prior to the next scheduled gum chewing time. Nurses documented participants&#8217; gum chewing on a standardised data collection instrument</P>

<P>The chewing gums were separately packed in a cellophane bag and stapled onto cardboard. A total of 10 pieces of chewing gum were stapled on each piece of cardboard. Each chewing gum was numbered. Participants stopped gum chewing after first passage of flatus and returned the cardboard. From this the number of pieces of gum chewed could be calculated</P>
