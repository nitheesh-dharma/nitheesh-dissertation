<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Evidence on beneficial or harmful effects of bicyclol for chronic hepatitis C is not found</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Bicyclol is a novel synthetic 'anti-hepatitis' drug, used primarily in China for patients with chronic hepatitis C. Only one small, short-term randomised clinical trial was found evaluating the efficacy of bicyclol for patients with chronic hepatitis C. Clinicians should be aware of the lack of evidence for bicyclol. </P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Bicyclol is a novel synthetic 'anti-hepatitis' drug, used in China for chronic hepatitis C. Until now, systematic reviews on bicyclol therapy have not been performed.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To study the benefits and harms of bicyclol for patients with chronic hepatitis C.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched <I>The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register</I> (July 2005), the <I>Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials</I> in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (Issue 2, 2005), <I>MEDLINE</I> (1994 to July 2005), <I>EMBASE</I> (1994 to July 2005), <I>Science Citation Index Expanded</I> (1994 to July 2005), <I>The Chinese Biomedical Database</I> (1994 to August 2005), <I>Chinese Journals Full-article Database (1994 to August 2005), VIP Chinese Science and Technique Journals Database (1994 to August 2005), and China National Infrastructure (CNKI) (1994 to August 2005).</I> We also contacted manufacturers and researchers in the field. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised clinical trials on bicyclol versus no intervention, placebo, or other interventions in patients with chronic hepatitis C were included, irrespective of blinding, publication status, or language.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>The primary outcome measures were total and liver-related mortality and liver-related morbidity (eg, cirrhosis and carcinoma). Secondary outcome measures were viral response and liver histology.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>The search identified one randomised clinical trial comparing bicyclol with placebo for 39 patients with chronic hepatitis C. The follow-up was three months. In the trial, there was no evidence that bicyclol was superior to placebo for clearance of HCV RNA (RR 3.80, 95% CI 0.47 to 31.0) and anti-HCV antibodies, but bicyclol was associated with statistically significant decrease in alanine aminotransferase activity at 12-th week after treatment (WMD -69 IU/L, 95% CI -115 to -24).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Only one randomised clinical trial has examined bicyclol for patients with chronic hepatitis C. This small, short-term trial found no evidence to support or refute its use. Large, randomised, double-blind clinical trials with long-term follow-up are needed to examine the possible benefits and harms associated with bicyclol. Bicyclol can only be recommended for use in randomised trials.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-17 13:34:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-10-17 13:23:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>Hepatitis C is a serious liver disease caused by a hepatitis C virus (<LINK REF="REF-Zhao-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhao 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dhawan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dhawan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jinhanfang-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jinhanfang 2003</LINK>). Hepatitis C virus is predominantly transmitted by means of percutaneous exposure to infected blood, such as blood and serum transfusion, and may also be transmitted by means of acupuncture, tattooing, and sharing razors (<LINK REF="REF-Zhao-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhao 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dhawan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dhawan 2003</LINK>). Sexual and maternal-fetal transmission may as well play a role in the transmission (<LINK REF="REF-Dhawan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dhawan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jinhanfang-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jinhanfang 2003</LINK>). The virus is a spherical, enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Flaviviridae family (<LINK REF="REF-Dhawan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dhawan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2003</LINK>). Hepatitis C virus encodes a single polyprotein of 3011 amino acids that is processed into 10 structural and regulatory proteins. Structural components include the core and two envelope proteins, E1 and E2. Two regions of the E2 protein have an extremely high rate of mutation. E2 contains the binding site for CD-81, a receptor expressed on hepatocytes and B lymphocytes. Hepatitis C virus also encodes a virus-specific helicase, protease, and polymerase, all of which are critical for viral replication. These enzymes are attractive targets for antiviral therapy. Similarly, the untranslated regions at both ends of the viral RNA, 5'-UTR and 3'-UTR, are highly conserved. These sites are involved in critical stages of viral replication and may be logical targets for therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Dhawan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dhawan 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>More than 170 million individuals throughout the world are infected with hepatitis C virus (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2003</LINK>). The prevalence rates in healthy blood donors are 0.01% to 0.02% in the United Kingdom and northern Europe, 1% to 1.5% in southern Europe, and 6.5% in parts of equatorial Africa. Prevalence rates as high as 20% are reported in Egypt; these rates are attributed to the use of parenteral antischistosomal therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Deuffic_x002d_Burban-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deuffic-Burban 2006</LINK>). Progression of hepatitis C to liver cirrhosis may occur in up to 20% of patients who have chronic infection (<LINK REF="REF-Dhawan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dhawan 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Interferon alfa is used alone for treatment of hepatitis C, but the curative effect depends on the dose, period of treatment, the severity of the disease, and the difference of the virus genotype (<LINK REF="REF-Myers-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Myers 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Myers-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Myers 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Myers-2004c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Myers 2004c</LINK>). Recurrence often happens in about half a year if one stops taking the drug. The adverse effects include fatigue, bone marrow suppression, and neuropsychiatric effects (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2004</LINK>). Combination therapy with pegylated interferon/ribavirin is the current standard of care in patients with chronic hepatitis C (<LINK REF="REF-Dhawan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dhawan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brok-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brok-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2005b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Bicyclol is a novel synthetic anti-hepatitis drug that was patented by Liu Gengtao (<LINK REF="REF-NNPP-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">NNPP 2006</LINK>). Experimental studies have shown that bicyclol protects cell membrane through elimination of free radicals. It can protect hepatocyte nuclear DNA from damage and reduce the apoptosis induced by immuno-stimulating compound concanavalin A (Con A). Bicyclol has been claimed to possess hepato-protective and anti-virus effects (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhao-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhao 2001</LINK>). Phase II and phase III clinical trials have demonstrated that the elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels of most of the patients with chronic hepatitis C became normal during bicyclol administration (<LINK REF="STD-Yao-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Yao 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NNPP-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">NNPP 2006</LINK>). No obvious adverse events were observed in clinical trials (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Liu-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhao-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhao 2001</LINK>). Based on these data, bicyclol has been approved for clinical use in China (<LINK REF="REF-NNPP-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">NNPP 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>We have been unable to identify meta-analyses or systematic reviews on bicyclol for chronic hepatitis C.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To review systematically the benefits and harms of bicyclol for patients with chronic hepatitis C. </P>

<BR/>XY and TW independently extracted data using a data extraction form. We extracted data on study characteristics including methods, participants, interventions, and outcomes. We resolved any disagreements by referring to the trial report and through discussion. If data from the trial reports were insufficient or missing, we contacted the authors for additional information. For binary outcomes, we recorded the number of participants experiencing the event in each group of the trial. For continuous outcomes, we extracted the arithmetic means and standard deviations.</P>
<P>
<B>Data analysis </B>
<BR/>Due to the only one randomised clinical trial included, we could not follow the statistical plan below.</P>
<P>We planned to use the statistical package RevMan 4.2 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>) provided by the Cochrane Collaboration. We had expected to find both event (dichotomous) data and continuous data. The relative risk (RR) and control events rates were to have been used for reporting dichotomous data. We intended to calculate the risk difference (RD) and convert the RD into the number needed to treat (NNT) or the number needed to harm (NNH) if follow-up time and control event rates were similar for the different trials. Continuous data were to have been expressed as weighted mean differences (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Overall results were to have been calculated based on the random-effects model. Heterogeneity was to have been tested for significance set at P &lt; 0.1. Possible sources of heterogeneity were to have been assessed by sensitivity and subgroup analyses as described below. Potential bias was to have been tested for using the funnel plot or other analytical methods depending on the number of clinical trials included in the systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>).<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>
<I>Subgroup analyses </I>
</B>
<BR/>We aimed at performing subgroup analyses in order to explore effect size difference as follows:<BR/>(1) doses or routes;<BR/>(2) different comparison interventions;<BR/>(3) different stages/duration of disease, depending on data.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Sensitivity analysis</I>
</B>
<BR/>We aimed at performing sensitivity analyses in order to explore the influence of the following factors on effect size:<BR/>(1) Repeating the analysis, excluding unpublished studies (if there were any).<BR/>(2) Repeating the analysis, taking into account quality, as specified above.<BR/>(3) Repeating the analysis, excluding any trials with long duration or large studies to establish how much they dominate the results.<BR/>(4) Repeat the analysis excluding trials using the following filters: diagnostic criteria, language of publication, source of funding (industry versus other), country.</P>
<P>The robustness of the results were also planned to be tested by repeating the analysis using different measures of effects size (risk difference, odds ratio, etc.) and different statistic models (fixed- and random-effects models).</P>

<P>The searches found a total of eight publications (<LINK REF="STD-Weng-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Weng 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yao-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Yao 2002</LINK> (two publications on the same trial); <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Guo 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sun-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sun 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Yin 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 2005</LINK>) and two trials met the initial inclusion criteria at first pass (<LINK REF="STD-Yao-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Yao 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Guo 2003</LINK>). However, through inquiring the original authors by telephone, one study was confirmed by the authors to involve non-random allocation and was excluded from the review (<LINK REF="STD-Guo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Guo 2003</LINK>). Subsequently, only one randomised clinical trial met our inclusion criteria for this review (<LINK REF="STD-Yao-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Yao 2002</LINK>). Summary details of the trial are given in the 'Characteristics of Included Studies' section and the 'Characteristics of Excluded Studies' section.</P>
<P>
<B>Design</B>
<BR/>The included trial (<LINK REF="STD-Yao-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Yao 2002</LINK>) used multicentre, parallel group design and was placebo controlled.</P>
<P>
<B>Participants</B>
<BR/>A total of 39 participants were included in the trial. All were recruited from hospitals in China. The trial was conducted in Shanghai Jinan Medical Center, The First Hospital of Beijing University, the Ruijin Hospital of Fudan University, The Eighth Guangzhou People's Hospital, the Beijing Ditan Hospital, the Beijing Youan Hospital, and the Huashan Hospital of Shanghai Medical University, China.</P>
<P>
<B>Interventions</B>
<BR/>The treatment was conducted in two steps. Firstly, patients in the intervention group were given 25 mg bicyclol three times a day and patients in the control group were given placebo for 12 weeks. During the next 12 weeks, both the groups used bicyclol 25 mg three times a day.</P>
<P>
<B>Outcome</B>
<BR/>Normalisation of ALT, loss of HCV RNA and anti-HCV, relief of the prior clinical manifestations, and adverse events were reported. Outcome measurement was carried out respectively at the end of 2nd, 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, 20th, 24th week of the trial, and 4th, 8th, 12th week after treatment finished.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2008-10-17 13:33:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>The published report of the included trial (<LINK REF="STD-Yao-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Yao 2002</LINK>) did not include any information on the methodology in order to assess the methodological quality of the trial, but stated that it was conducted following the good clinical practice (GCP) guidelines of the Chinese State Food and Drug Administration. After contacting the authors, we obtained the information that the trial had used a computer to carry out the random allocation of the participants and that the trial investigators and the participants were blinded to the group allocation. Consequently, generation of the randomisation sequence and allocation concealment were assessed as 'adequate'. Intention-to-treat analysis was used in the study. Because of this additional information the trial turned out to be of high-quality, ie, low risk of bias (see 'Table 1').</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-10-17 13:23:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>We were only able to identify one randomised clinical trial with a small number of participants with chronic hepatitis C in which bicyclol was compared with placebo. Except reduction of the ALT level, bicyclol did not differ from placebo and did not show any significant benefit on any other outcome measures.</P>
<P>Although the included trial was stated to be conducted following the good clinical practice guidelines and after the obtained oral information from the authors was assumed by the authors of the review of being conducted with low risk of bias (ie, having high methodological quality), considerations for the sample size were not reported. Therefore, the reported significant P-value should be regarded as an 'orphan' P-value that could be due to a random low (or high). It is also possible that the trial cannot detect the difference between the two groups, which may be due to low test power. In addition, we caution about the low-bias risk grading of the trial included in our review. The information that the trial was conducted with adequate methodology was not obvious from the original report of the trial. We have no chance to verify the information obtained through personal communication with the authors. Furthermore, the trialists did not check the success of blinding or at least have not reported such data. Other obvious limitations of this trial include the lack of long-term follow-up. Moreover, the included trial observed only a small number of adverse events in each of the groups, and the description was vague. Future trials ought to report on adverse events according to the International Conference on Harmonization Expert Working Group (CFR &amp; ICH 1997) and CONSORT (www.consort-statement.org).</P>
<P>Finally, our impression is that some of the Chinese trials claim to be randomised, but having asked the trialists about the methodology they had used, it turned out that these studies were, in fact, not randomised (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2003</LINK>). This finding may suggest that misunderstanding of the concept of a randomised clinical trial exist, thus leading to selection bias.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is no evidence to support the use of bicyclol for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. We cannot rule out the possibility of harmful effects from bicyclol either. Clinicians who use bicyclol for chronic hepatitis C should do it cautiously and as part of a randomised clinical trials.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>High-quality randomised clinical trials testing bicyclol versus placebo or interventions with a well-known effect on hepatitis C with long-term follow-up are needed. They ought to follow the CONSORT statement in their reporting (www.consort-statement.org) (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>).</P>

<CHAR_METHODS>
<P>Parallel design. Double blind, multicentre study. </P>
<P>The design and performance were done according to the GCP standard of Chinese SFDA.</P>
<P>We asked the authors by telephone about the randomisation procedure, and we were told that the random blocks design was used to centrally generate random sequence, and allocation concealment was performed centrally. So, we considered both allocation sequence generation and allocation concealment as adequate.</P>
<P>Bicyclol and placebo had the same appearance and both the health provider and the participants were blinded. Adequate.</P>
<P>Sample size calculation was not performed.</P>
</CHAR_METHODS>
<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Thirty-nine patients with chronic hepatitis C, from 16 to 60 years old were included. The patients were diagnosed with presence of HCV-RNA or were anti-HCV positive for at least half a year, ALT were at high level in the past 12 weeks, and the ALT level was twice to five times higher than normal at screening. </P>
<P>Twenty patients were allocated to the bicyclol group and 19 to the control treatment group.</P>
<P>Sample size was determined by a statistician according to SFDA policy.</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Patients in the bicyclol group received oral bicyclol of 25 mg, three times a day, and the control treatment group received oral placebo with the same appearance as bicyclol three times a day during a 12-weeks scheme. Then the two groups received oral bicyclol 25 mg, three times a day, during the following 12-weeks scheme.</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>(1) HCV makers: anti-HCV, HCV-RNA.<BR/>(2) ALT<BR/>(a) marked improvement: normalised of ALT and AST;<BR/>(b) improvement: reduced to lower than 1.5 folders of normal level;<BR/>(c) inefficacy: still keep on a high level.<BR/>(3) SB (serum bilirubin)<BR/>(4) Prothrombin time, serum albumin and globulin, serum creatinine, and routine urine examination.<BR/>Tests took place at before taking the medicine, and week 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 after taking the medicine, and week 4, 8, 12 after end of treatment.</P>
