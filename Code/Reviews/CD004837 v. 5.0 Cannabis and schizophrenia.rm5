<P>Many people with the serious mental illness schizophrenia smoke cannabis but it is not known why people do so or the effects of smoking cannabis. It is unclear what the best methods are that help people to reduce or stop smoking cannabis. Cannabis is the most consumed illicit drug in the world &#8211; amounting to 120 to 224 million users. Cannabis, which is usually smoked or eaten, gives a feeling of well-being, but in high doses it may also cause mental illness or psychosis. Clinical evidence suggests people who have schizophrenia have a worse overall outcome from using cannabis, however, there are some people with schizophrenia who claim that using cannabis helps their symptoms and reduces the side effects of antipsychotic medication. This review aims to look at the effects of cannabis, both its use and withdrawal, in people who have schizophrenia. A search for trials was conducted in 2013, eight randomised trials, involving 530 participants were included. Five trials investigated the effects of using a specific psychotherapy aimed at reducing cannabis intake, two investigated the effects of antipsychotic medication for cannabis reduction and one investigated the use of cannbidiol (a compound found in cannabis) as a treatment for the symptoms of schizophrenia.</P>
<P>The results of the review are limited as trial sizes were small and data were poorly reported.</P>
<P>Overall, there is currently no evidence for any intervention, whether it is psychological therapy or medication, being better than standard treatment or each other in reducing or stopping the use of cannabis. More research is needed to explore the benefits of medication or psychological therapy for those with schizophrenia who use cannabis. It is unclear if cannabidiol has an antipsychotic effect.</P>

</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-05-27 16:15:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register, 12 August 2013, which is based on regular searches of BIOSIS, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PUBMED and PsycINFO.</P>
<P>We searched all references of articles selected for inclusion for further relevant trials. We contacted the first author of included studies for unpublished trials or data.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2014-10-01 10:25:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included all randomised controlled trials involving cannabinoids and schizophrenia/schizophrenia-like illnesses, which assessed:</P>
<P>1) treatments to reduce cannabis use in people with schizophrenia;</P>
<P>2) the effects of cannabinoids on people with schizophrenia.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-10-13 11:43:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We independently inspected citations, selected papers and then re-inspected the studies if there were discrepancies, and extracted data. For dichotomous data we calculated risk ratios (RR) and for continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD), both with 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention-to-treat basis, based on a fixed-effect model. We excluded data if loss to follow-up was greater than 50%. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and used GRADE to rate the quality of the evidence.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-10-01 10:25:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified eight randomised trials, involving 530 participants, which met our selection criteria.</P>
<P>For the cannabis reduction studies no one treatment showed superiority for reduction in cannabis use. Overall, data were poorly reported for many outcomes of interest. Our main outcomes of interest were medium-term data for cannabis use, global state, mental state, global functioning, adverse events, leaving the study early and satisfaction with treatment.</P>
<P>
<B>1. Reduction in cannabis use: adjunct psychological therapies (specifically about cannabis and psychosis) versus treatment as usual</B>
</P>
<P>Results from one small study showed people receiving adjunct psychological therapies specifically about cannabis and psychosis were no more likely to reduce their intake than those receiving treatment as usual (n = 54, 1 RCT, MD -0.10, 95% CI -2.44 to 2.24, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>). Results for other main outcomes at medium term were also equivocal. No difference in mental state measured on the PANSS positive were observed between groups (n = 62, 1 RCT, MD -0.30 95% CI -2.55 to 1.95, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>). Nor for the outcome of general functioning measured using the World Health Organization Quality of Life BREF (n = 49, 1 RCT, MD 0.90 95% CI -1.15 to 2.95, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>). No data were reported for the other main outcomes of interest</P>
<P>
<B>2. Reduction in cannabis use: adjunct psychological therapy (specifically about cannabis and psychosis) versus adjunct non-specific psychoeducation </B>
</P>
<P>One study compared specific psychological therapy aimed at cannabis reduction with general psychological therapy. At three-month follow-up, the use of cannabis in the previous four weeks was similar between treatment groups (n = 47, 1 RCT, RR 1.04 95% CI 0.62 to 1.74, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>). Again, at a medium-term follow-up, the average mental state scores from the Brief Pscychiatric Rating Scale-Expanded were similar between groups (n = 47, 1 RCT, MD 3.60 95% CI - 5.61 to 12.81, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>). No data were reported for the other main outcomes of interest: global state, general functioning, adverse events, leaving the study early and satisfaction with treatment.</P>
<P>
<B>3. Reduction in cannabis use: antipsychotic versus antipsychotic </B>
</P>
<P>In a small trial comparing effectiveness of olanzapine versus risperidone for cannabis reduction, there was no difference between groups at medium-term follow-up (n = 16, 1 RCT, RR 1.80 95% CI 0.52 to 6.22, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>). The number of participants leaving the study early at medium term was also similar (n = 28, 1 RCT, RR 0.50 95% CI 0.19 to 1.29, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>). Mental state data were reported, however they were reported within the short term and no difference was observed. No data were reported for global state, general functioning, and satisfaction with treatment.</P>
<P>With regards to adverse effects data, no study reported medium-term data. Short-term data were presented but overall, no real differences between treatment groups were observed for adverse effects.</P>
<P>
<B>4. Cannabinoid as treatment: cannabidiol versus amisulpride</B>
</P>
<P>Again, no data were reported for any of the main outcomes of interest at medium term. There were short-term data reported for mental state using the BPRS and PANSS, no overall differences in mental state were observed between treatment groups.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-10-13 10:52:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Results are limited and inconclusive due to the small number and size of randomised controlled trials available and quality of data reporting within these trials. More research is needed to a) explore the effects of adjunct psychological therapy that is specifically about cannabis and psychosis as currently there is no evidence for any novel intervention being better than standard treatment,for those that use cannabis and have schizophrenia b) decide the most effective drug treatment in treating those that use cannabis and have schizophrenia, and c) assess the effectiveness of cannabidiol in treating schizophrenia. Currently evidence is insufficient to show cannabidiol has an antipsychotic effect.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-10-01 10:25:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Schizophrenia is a complex mental condition that affects approximately 1% of the population at some stage in their life (<LINK REF="REF-Kolliakou-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kolliakou 2011</LINK>). It is characterised by three symptom categories: positive symptoms, including delusions, thought and speech disorders, and hallucinations that range from visual to gustatory; negative symptoms, such as blunted affect, avolition, anhedonia and asociality; and cognitive dysfunction related to executive function, attention and working memory (<LINK REF="REF-Tanda-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tanda 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lynskey-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lynskey 2002</LINK>). Schizophrenia is a condition that can be severely disabling, producing multiple effects which impact on sufferers, their relatives, and ln the broader social context. Schizophrenia is associated with low rates of employment, low levels of activity, a low prevalence of intimate relationships, and a quality of life that links with anxiety, depression and substance abuse (<LINK REF="REF-Miles-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miles 2001</LINK>). The dramatic impact of schizophrenia as an affective disorder is represented in the mortality rates of sufferers, which are significantly higher than in the wider population, and which highlight the fact that suicide is the largest single cause of this excess mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Henquet-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henquet 2008</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-10-01 10:25:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cannabis (<I>Cannabis sativa</I> and <I>Cannabis indica</I>) is a plant that grows wild throughout the world (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). It has been used to make rope and material, and has been used as a psychoactive drug for at least 2700 years (<LINK REF="REF-Russo-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Russo 2008</LINK>). When used as a recreational drug it is normally either as a compressed resin or made from the flowering tops and leaves, which is then either smoked or ingested. There are around 60 chemical compounds within the plant which have been described as &#8220;cannabinoids&#8221;; these are cannabis-related compounds either derived from the cannabis plant or synthetically manufactured. Of these, the major active cannabinoid is the psychoactive constituent delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). THC produces a euphoric high, feeling of relaxation, and intensification of sensation, but it can cause some short-lived schizophrenic symptoms in some healthy people (<LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Souza-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Souza 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Cannabis is at present the most consumed illicit drug in the world &#8211; the prevalence of which in 2010 was 2.6% to 5.0%, amounting to 120 to 224 million users.  It is produced and consumed in every country in the world, and in amounts which far exceed other illicit drugs. Within developed countries the amount of consumption is broadly stable, although in many developing countries it is increasing (<LINK REF="REF-UNODOC" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNODOC</LINK>). The proportion of people with schizophrenia who use cannabis varies, yet surveys commonly find prevalence rates to be about 40% (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>), much higher than the general population. Cannabis is used to reduce distressing psychotic symptoms as a form of self-medication (<LINK REF="REF-Dixon-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dixon 1990</LINK>), or to reduce the unpleasant adverse effects caused by antipsychotic drug treatment. It has also been proposed that the negative symptoms of schizophrenia (affective flattening, poor volition, poverty of thought, social withdrawal) may be improved by the use of cannabis (<LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Souza-2005" TYPE="STUDY">D'Souza 2005</LINK>). This theory may be corroborated by recent literature that suggests therapy with cannabidiol can lead to significant clinical improvement in psychotic symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Casadio-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casadio 2011</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-10-01 10:25:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is some research evidence supporting the theory that reducing the intake of cannabis can help prevent and improve the symptoms of schizophrenia. The use of cannabis has been associated with an increased risk of developing psychosis and also exacerbating the symptoms of schizophrenia. Although there has been suggestions that the increased risk of developing schizophrenia could be due to confounders such as other drug use, urbanicity or social class; or be due to reverse causality, whereby people who are at risk of developing schizophrenia, start taking cannabis in order to diminish their prodromal symptoms; however, even when taking these factors into account, cannabis has been associated with an increased risk of developing schizophrenia (<LINK REF="REF-Matheson-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matheson 2011</LINK>). Multiple meta-analyses have demonstrated an increased risk due to cannabis. An increase in psychosis has been significantly associated with cannabis use in several meta-analyses with odds ratios of 1.41 and 2.93 reported.This effect also appeared to be dose-dependent and more acute with use at an early age (<LINK REF="REF-Henquet-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henquet 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Semple-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Semple 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Souza-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Souza 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Conversly, some research suggest cannabinoids in small doses can have a beneficial effect on the symptoms of schizophrenia. Cannabinoids (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>) exert their effect through cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2. CB1 receptors are distributed within the central nervous system (brain and spine) and in various peripheral organs and tissues. The location of CB receptors may explain the effects of cannabis use on learning, memory, emotion, motivation and motor (control of muscle) ability (<LINK REF="REF-Freund-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freund 2003</LINK>). Normally, these receptors are activated by endogenous cannabinoids - these are chemicals with a similar structure to cannabinoids found within cannabis but which are made by the body. The major effect of these endogenous cannabinoids is control of neurotransmitter release such as GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) and glutamate within the brain.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-10-01 10:25:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Substance misuse has been reported to be the most prevalent co-morbid condition associated with schizophrenia (<LINK REF="REF-Regier-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Regier 1990</LINK>) and cannabis is the most frequently used substance (<LINK REF="REF-Sinclair-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sinclair 2008</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Kavanagh-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kavanagh 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Hall-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Farrell-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrell 1998</LINK>). The reported rates of cannabis abuse among people with schizophrenia vary widely both within and between different countries, but are consistently higher than in other people with mental illnesses or in the general population (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>The association between schizophrenia and cannabinoids has been well documented; as a result this review aims to look at methods that assist patients in altering their consumption of cannabis, and if consumption of cannabinoids affects the symptoms of a person with schizophrenia.</P>

<P>We extracted data onto standard, simple forms.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.2 Scale-derived data</HEADING>
<P>We included continuous data from rating scales only if:<BR/>a. the psychometric properties of the measuring instrument have been described in a peer-reviewed journal (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>); and<BR/>b. the measuring instrument has not been written or modified by one of the trialists for that particular trial.</P>
<P>Ideally, the measuring instrument should either be i. a self-report or ii. completed by an independent rater or relative (not the therapist). We realise that this is not often reported clearly; we have noted whether or not this is the case in <LINK TAG="STUDY_DESCRIPTION" TYPE="SECTION">Description of studies</LINK> and in the 'Risk of bias' tables.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.3 Endpoint versus change data</HEADING>
<P>There are advantages of both endpoint and change data. Change data can remove a component of between-person variability from the analysis. On the other hand, calculation of change needs two assessments (baseline and endpoint), which can be difficult in unstable and difficult to measure conditions such as schizophrenia. We decided primarily to use endpoint data, and only use change data if the former were not available. We combined endpoint and change data in the analysis as we used mean differences (MD) rather than standardised mean differences throughout (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>, Chapter 9.4.5.2).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.4 Skewed data</HEADING>
<P>Continuous data on clinical and social outcomes are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data, we aimed to apply the following standards to all data before inclusion: a) standard deviations (SFs) and means are reported in the paper or obtainable from the authors; b) when a scale starts from the finite number zero, the SD, when multiplied by two, is less than the mean (as otherwise the mean is unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>)); c) if a scale started from a positive value (such as the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS, <LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>), which can have values from 30 to 210), we modified the calculation described above to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skew is present if 2 SD &gt; (S-S min), where S is the mean score and S min is the minimum score. Endpoint scores on scales often have a finite start and end point and these rules can be applied. We entered skewed endpoint data from studies of fewer than 200 participants as other data within the data and analyses section rather than into statistical analysis. Skewed data pose less of a problem when looking at mean if the sample size is large; we would have entered skewed endpoint data from studies with over 200 participants into statistical analyses.</P>
<P>When continuous data are presented on a scale that includes a possibility of negative values (such as change data), it is difficult to tell whether data are skewed or not, we entered skewed change data into statistical analyses.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.5 Common measure</HEADING>
<P>To facilitate comparison between trials, we intended to convert variables that can be reported in different metrics, such as days in hospital (mean days per year, per week or per month) to a common metric (e.g. mean days per month).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.6 Conversion of continuous to binary</HEADING>
<P>Where possible, we made efforts to convert outcome measures to dichotomous data. This can be done by identifying cut-off points on rating scales and dividing participants accordingly into 'clinically improved' or 'not clinically improved'. It is generally assumed that if there is a 50% reduction in a scale-derived score such as the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS, <LINK REF="REF-Overall-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1988</LINK>) or the PANSS (<LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>) this could be considered as a clinically significant response (<LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005a</LINK>). If data based on these thresholds were not available, we used the primary cut-off presented by the original authors.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.7 Direction of graphs</HEADING>
<P>Where possible, we entered data in such a way that the area to the left of the line of no effect indicated a favourable outcome for the relevant intervention in each case. Where keeping to this made it impossible to avoid outcome titles with clumsy double-negatives (e.g. 'Not improved') we reported data where the left of the line indicates an unfavourable outcome. This was noted in the relevant graphs.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Binary data</HEADING>
<P>For binary outcomes, we calculated a standard estimation of the risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). It has been shown that RR is more intuitive (<LINK REF="REF-Boissel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boissel 1999</LINK>) than odds ratios and that odds ratios tend to be interpreted as RR by clinicians (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2000</LINK>). If heterogeneity had been identified (<LINK TAG="HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT" TYPE="SECTION">Assessment of heterogeneity</LINK>), we would have used a random-effects model. For statistically significant results, we used 'Summary of findings' tables to calculate the number needed to treat/harm for an additional beneficial/harmful outcome statistic and its 95% CI.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Continuous data</HEADING>
<P>For continuous outcomes, we estimated mean difference (MD) between groups. We prefer not to calculate effect size measures (standardised mean difference (SMD)). However, if scales of very considerable similarity had been used, we would have presumed there was a small difference in measurement, and calculated effect size and transformed the effect back to the units of one or more of the specific instruments.</P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2014-10-01 10:25:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Cluster trials</HEADING>
<P>Studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice), but analysis and pooling of clustered data pose problems. Authors often fail to account for intra-class correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>), whereby P values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This causes type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>If we had included any cluster trials, and found cases where clustering was not accounted for in primary studies, we would have presented data in a table, with an (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review, if any cluster trials are identified, we will seek to contact first authors of such studies to obtain intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) for their clustered data and to adjust for this by using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Had clustering been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we would have presented these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, with adjustment for the clustering effect.</P>
<P>We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a 'design effect'. This is calculated by using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the ICC [Design effect = 1 + (m1) * ICC] (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). Again, if we had found any cluster trials, or if subsequent versions of this review should identify such trials, when the ICC is not reported it will be assumed to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Cross-over trials</HEADING>
<P>A major concern of cross-over trials is the carry-over effect. It occurs if an effect (e.g. pharmacological, physiological or psychological) of the treatment in the first phase is carried over to the second phase. As a consequence, on entry to the second phase the participants can differ systematically from their initial state, despite a wash-out phase. For the same reason cross-over trials are not appropriate if the condition of interest is unstable (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). As both effects are very likely in severe mental illness, we planned to use only the data of the first phase of cross-over studies. However, although one study would have required this method, we were unable to obtain the requisite data, and so none of the studies included in the final review required this.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Studies with multiple treatment groups</HEADING>
<P>Had a study involved more than two treatment arms, if relevant, we planned to present the additional treatment arms in comparisons. If data were binary, we would simply have added these and combined them within the two-by-two table. If data were continuous, we would have combined data following the formula in section 7.7.3.8 (Combining groups) of the <I>Handbook </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). If the additional treatment arms were not relevant, we would not have reproduced these data. However, none of the studies included in the final review required this.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Overall loss of credibility</HEADING>
<P>At some degree of loss of follow-up, data must lose credibility (<LINK REF="REF-Xia-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xia 2009</LINK>). We chose that, for any particular outcome, should more than 50% of data be unaccounted for, we would not reproduce these data or use them within analyses. If, however, more than 50% of those in one arm of a study were lost, but the total loss was less than 50%, we would address this within the 'Summary of findings' tables by down-rating quality. Finally, we also downgraded quality within the 'Summary of findings' tables where loss was 25% to 50% in total.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Binary</HEADING>
<P>In the case where attrition for a binary outcome is between 0% and 50% and where these data were not clearly described, we presented such data on a 'once-randomised-always-analyse' basis (an intention-to-treat analysis). Those leaving the study early were all assumed to have the same rates of negative outcome as those who completed. We undertook a sensitivity analysis to test how prone the primary outcomes were to change when data only from people who complete the study to that point were compared to the intention-to-treat analysis using the above assumptions.</P>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">3.2 Standard deviations</HEADING>
<P>If standard deviations (SDs) were not reported, we first tried to obtain the missing values from the authors. If not available, where there are missing measures of variance for continuous data, but an exact standard error (SE) and confidence intervals available for group means, and either 'P' value or 't' value available for differences in mean, we can calculate them according to the rules described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systemic reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>): When only the SE is reported, SDs are calculated by the formula SD = SE * square root (n). Chapters 7.7.3 and 16.1.3 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systemic reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) present detailed formulae for estimating SDs from P values, t or F values, confidence intervals, ranges or other statistics. If these formulae do not apply, we can calculate the SDs according to a validated imputation method which is based on the SDs of the other included studies (<LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2006</LINK>). Although some of these imputation strategies can introduce error, the alternative would be to exclude a given study&#8217;s outcome and thus to lose information. We nevertheless examined the validity of the imputations in a sensitivity analysis excluding imputed values.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">3.3 Last observation carried forward</HEADING>
<P>We anticipated that in some studies the method of last observation carried forward (LOCF) would have been employed within the study report. As with all methods of imputation to deal with missing data, LOCF introduces uncertainty about the reliability of the results (<LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2007</LINK>). Therefore, where LOCF data had been used in the trial, if less than 50% of the data have been assumed, we presented and used these data and indicated that they are the product of LOCF assumptions.</P>

An I<SUP>2 </SUP>estimate greater than or equal to around 50% accompanied by a statistically significant Chi<SUP>2</SUP> statistic was interpreted as evidence of substantial levels of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).

<P>We understand that there is no closed argument for preference for use of fixed-effect or random-effects models. The random-effects method incorporates an assumption that the different studies are estimating different, yet related, intervention effects. This often seems to be true to us and the random-effects model takes into account differences between studies even if there is no statistically significant heterogeneity. There is, however, a disadvantage to the random-effects model: it puts added weight onto small studies, which often are the most biased ones. Depending on the direction of effect, these studies can either inflate or deflate the effect size. We chose the fixed-effect model for all analyses. The reader is, however, able to choose to inspect the data using the random-effects model.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">1.1 Clinical state, stage or problem</HEADING>
<P>We proposed to undertake this review and provide an overview of the effects of the interventions for people with schizophrenia in general. In addition, however, we tried to report data on subgroups of people in the same clinical state, stage and with similar problems. However as there were not enough data to produce any comparisons, it was impossible/unnecessary to subgroup.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Investigation of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>If inconsistency was high, we have reported this. First, we investigated whether data had been entered correctly. Second, if data were correct, we visually inspected the graph and successively removed outlying studies to see if homogeneity was restored. For this review we decided that should this occur with data contributing to the summary finding of no more than around 10% of the total weighting, we would present data. If not, then we would not pool data but would discuss these issues. We know of no supporting research for this 10% cut-off, but we use prediction intervals as an alternative to this unsatisfactory state. Should unanticipated clinical or methodological heterogeneity be obvious, we will simply state hypotheses regarding this observation for future reviews or versions of this review. However none of the studies included in the final review required this.</P>

<P>We would have applied the following sensitivity analyses to only primary outcomes of this review if required, however none of the studies finally included did require this.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Implication of randomisation</HEADING>
<P>We aimed to include trials in a sensitivity analysis if they were described in some way so as to imply randomisation. For the primary outcomes we would have included these studies and if there was no substantive difference when the implied randomised studies were added to those with better description of randomisation, then we would have entered all data from these studies. However none of the studies included in the final review required this.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Assumptions for lost binary data</HEADING>
<P>Where assumptions had to be made regarding people lost to follow-up and missing SD data (see <LINK TAG="MISSING_DATA" TYPE="SECTION">Dealing with missing data</LINK>), we planned to compare the findings on primary outcomes when we used our assumption compared with complete data only. We planned to undertake a sensitivity analysis to test how prone results were to change when 'completer' data only were compared to the imputed data using the above assumption. If there was a substantial difference, we would have reported results and discussed them but continued to employ our assumption.However none of the studies included in the final review required this.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>We planned to analyse the effects of excluding trials that were judged to be at high risk of bias across one or more of the domains of randomisation (implied as randomised with no further details available): allocation concealment, blinding and outcome reporting for the meta-analysis of the primary outcome. If the exclusion of trials at high risk of bias did not substantially alter the direction of effect or the precision of the effect estimates, then we would have included data from these trials in the analysis. However none of the studies included in the final review required this.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">4. Imputed values</HEADING>
<P>We also planned to undertake a sensitivity analysis to assess the effects of including data from trials where we used imputed values for ICC in calculating the design effect in cluster randomised trials.</P>
<P>If we noted substantial differences in the direction or precision of effect estimates in any of the sensitivity analyses listed above, we would not have pooled the data from the excluded trials with the other trials contributing to the outcome, but would have presented them separately.

<P>Participants included in the studies were all diagnosed with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder plus current co-morbid substance use problems and were diagnosed using the DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) schedule. One study used the ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases) criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Hjorthoj-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Hjorthoj 2013</LINK>); all others used DSM-IV. <LINK REF="STD-Edwards-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Edwards 2006</LINK> specifically used first episode psychosis criteria; <LINK REF="STD-Leweke-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Leweke 2012</LINK> used "acutely exacerbated schizophrenia". All other studies used a broad criteria for inclusion: any DSM IV diagnosis of psychotic disorder i.e. schizophrenia, schizophreniform, schizoaffective, delusional disorder, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder with psychotic features, psychosis not otherwise stated, and brief reactive psychosis.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">4.5 Interventions</HEADING>
<P>Seven studies compared treatments in reducing cannabis use. One compared two different psychological treatments (<LINK REF="STD-Edwards-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Edwards 2006</LINK>), and three compared psychological treatments versus treatment as usual (<LINK REF="STD-Madigan-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Madigan 2012</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hjorthoj-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Hjorthoj 2013</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Bonsack-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Bonsack 2011</LINK>). Two trials compared the effects of using different antipsychotics on cannabis use (<LINK REF="STD-Akerele-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Akerele 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-van-Nimwegen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">van Nimwegen 2008</LINK>), and one compared the effects of clozapine versus continuing with previous antipsychotic (<LINK REF="STD-Brunette-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Brunette 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Leweke-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Leweke 2012</LINK>), investigated cannabis as a treatment using drug intervention: amisulpride versus cannabidiol.</P>
<P>
<I>4.5.1 Psychoeducation versus psychological treatment (cannabis and psychosis therapy)</I>
</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Edwards-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Edwards 2006</LINK> compared cannabis and psychosis therapy - an individually delivered cognitive behaviour therapy involving ideally 10 (mean = 7.6) weekly 20- to-60 minute sessions over three months designed to influence behaviour change. Delivered over three months, it involves education about cannabis and psychosis, motivational interviewing, goal setting, and relapse prevention. Participants receive a booster session three months after the end of treatment.</P>
<P>The active control was psychoeducation; this involved ideally 10 (mean = 8.4) individual sessions guided by presentation slides and covering the nature of psychosis, treatment and relapse, but avoided discussing cannabis.</P>
<P>The treatments were given by four clinical psychologists trained in cognitive behaviour therapy and first episode psychosis.</P>
<P>In addition to the above interventions, participants also received standard care, which included regular psychiatric review and medication. access to mobile assessment and treatment, family and group work and a recovery clinic</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">4.5.2 Treatment as usual versus psychological treatment</HEADING>
<P>Three studies compared psychological treatment versus treatment as usual. In two of those studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hjorthoj-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Hjorthoj 2013</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Bonsack-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Bonsack 2011</LINK>), patients in the treatment as usual arm still received some psychological input that they would have received if they were not within the trial but in standard care.</P>
<P>Each study tested a different specific psychological intervention that had been developed within the centre. Broadly, these included motivational interviewing, cognitive behavioural therapy and psychoeducation.</P>
<P>The intervention in <LINK REF="STD-Madigan-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Madigan 2012</LINK> was Group Psychological Intervention (plus treatment as usual) once a week for 12 weeks plus one booster session six weeks afterwards, provided by a clinical psychologist. The intervention included anxiety management, motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioural therapy. The techniques used were based on <LINK REF="STD-Edwards-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Edwards 2006</LINK>.</P>
<P>Treatment as usual in <LINK REF="STD-Madigan-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Madigan 2012</LINK> involved care from a multidisciplinary team including medication and regular review.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Hjorthoj-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Hjorthoj 2013</LINK> the intervention was CapOpus. It lasted six months and consisted of ideally two sessions a week for the first month and one weekly session for the remaining five months. The intervention started with motivational interviewing and then moved between cognitive behavioural therapy and repeat motivational interviewing depending on individual need, there was also development of personalised strategies.</P>
<P>The control was treatment as usual, which was provided by staff not involved by CapOpus. The treatment involved anti psychotic medication and cognitive behavioural therapy but not specifically targeted at cannabis use. Treatment as usual continued after the six months.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Bonsack-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Bonsack 2011</LINK>, the intervention was motivational Intervention + treatment as usual. The main aim of motivational intervention is reduction of cannabis use. The sessions were on an individual basis and consisted of four to six motivational Intervention sessions; the first session consisted of 60 minutes, followed by a feedback session of 45 to 60 minutes within the next week. Two to four booster sessions of 30 to 45 minutes took place during the first six months; these sessions explored the connection between cannabis use and psychosis, and would discuss the advantages and disadvantages of cannabis use. In addition, participants were offered three optional group motivational sessions.</P>
<P>Treatment as usual consisted of psychiatric management by a clinical team consisting of a psychiatrist and a nurse/clinical psychologist, with access to community or inpatient treatment. Treatment included medication, regular visits within the community or clinic, rehabilitation, and standard psychoeducation and counselling on substance abuse. Participants were not exposed to any specific motivational intervention, and no attempt was made to standardise treatment, as this was based on the participants needs.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">4.5.3 Clozapine versus any antipsychotic; olanzapine versus risperidone</HEADING>
<P>Three studies looked at differing antipsychotic medication interventions and their effect on cannabis usage. Two studies looked at olanzapine versus risperidone, the other study looked at clozapine versus the participant's current antipsychotic medication.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Akerele-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Akerele 2007</LINK> participants received either olanzapine (dose 5 to 20 mg/day or risperidone: dose 3 to 9 mg/day). The trial was divided into three phases; during the first two weeks participants were kept on their current medication; during the second phase participants were tapered off their current medication on to either olanzapine or risperidone. The final phase lasted 10 weeks during which the participants were maintained on the intervention, either risperidone or olanzapine.</P>
<P>Doses were increased in a steps; in the risperidone group, participants received 3 mg/day for three days, then 6 mg/day for four days, then 9 mg until the end of the study.</P>
<P>In the olanzapine group, participants received 5 mg/day for three days, then 10 mg/day for the next four days, then 15 mg/day for the next five days, then 20 mg/day until the end of the study.</P>
<P>Doses were adjusted if a participant's symptoms worsened. Participants met the research team three times per week for the entire 14 weeks of the study for monitoring of symptoms.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-van-Nimwegen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">van Nimwegen 2008</LINK> also compared olanzapine versus risperidone. In the first week, participants received flexible dosing of olanzapine (dose: 5, 10, 15, or 20 mg/day); or risperidone (dose: 1.25, 2.5, 3.75, or 5 mg/day), which was then given as a fixed dose for the following five weeks. All participants also received psychoeducation about psychosis, substance abuse and social skills training.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Brunette-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Brunette 2011</LINK>, if the participant was randomised to clozapine, their dose of clozapine was increased over four weeks to reach an ideal daily dose of 400 mg; during this period the participant's current medication was gradually reduced and then stopped within four weeks. The dose was adjusted according to response and side effects, so if required the maximum daily dose of clozapine could be increased to 550 mg per day subsequently.</P>
<P>Those randomised to stay on their current medication were kept on a steady dose if possible, but if symptoms or side effects increased the dose was adjusted accordingly.</P>
<P>Participants attended weekly visits over 12 weeks and were assessed at each visit.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">4.5.4 Amisulpride versus cannabidiol</HEADING>
<P>Only one study <LINK REF="STD-Leweke-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Leweke 2012</LINK>, compared amisulpride versus cannabidiol (a non-psychotropic component of cannabis). Participants had no medication at all for the first three days, then received either amisulpride or cannabidiol, both starting with 200 mg per day and then increasing stepwise to 200 mg four times a day (total daily dose was 800 mg) within the first week; this dose then continued for a further three weeks. If there were increased side effects, the total daily dose could be reduced to 600 mg per day. In addition, up to 7.5 mg per day of lorazepam was allowed during the study if necessary.</P>

<P>4.6.1.1.1 Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale-E (BPRS) (<LINK REF="REF-Overall-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1988</LINK>)<BR/>The BPRS is an 18-item scale measuring positive symptoms, general psychopathology and affective symptoms. The original scale has 16 items, but a revised 18-item scale is commonly used. Scores can range from zero to 126. Each item is rated on a seven-point scale varying from 'not present' to 'extremely severe', with high scores indicating more severe symptoms. The BPRS-E is an expanded positive symptom subscale formed by summing conceptual disorganisation, hallucinations, unusual thought content and suspiciousness items. Higher scores indicate a worse outcome.</P>
<P>4.6.1.1.2 Beck Depression Inventory (BDI SF) (<LINK REF="REF-Beck-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beck 1972</LINK>)<BR/>This is a 13-item self-rating scale for depression. Each item comprises four statements (rated zero to four) describing increasing severity of the abnormality concerned. The person completing the scale is required to read each group of statements and identify the one that best describes the way they have felt over the preceding week. A total of 12/13 is an indicative score for presence of significant depression.</P>
<P>4.6.1.1.3 Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) (<LINK REF="REF-Andreasen-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andreasen 1983</LINK>)<BR/>This scale allows a global rating of the following negative symptoms of schizophrenia: alogia (impoverished thinking), affective blunting, avolition-apathy, anhedonia-asociality and attention impairment. Assessments are made on a six-point scale (0 = not at all to 5 = severe). Higher scores indicate more symptoms.</P>
<P>4.6.1.1.3 Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS) (<LINK REF="REF-Andreasen-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andreasen 1984</LINK>)</P>
<P>This scale allows a global rating of the following positive symptoms of schizophrenia: hallucinations, delusions, formal thought disorder and bizarre behaviour. Assessments are made on a six-point scale (0 = not at all to 5 = severe). Higher scores indicate more symptoms.</P>

<P>This outcome measured whether the participant had used cannabis in the past four weeks, either yes or no. The outcome was then scored as a percentage of participants who had used cannabis in the past four weeks. It was used in <LINK REF="STD-Edwards-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Edwards 2006</LINK>.</P>
<P>4.6.2.2 Cannabis use 7 - traces of cannabis breakdown products in urine</P>
<P>Urine was screened three times a week for cannabis, and either classed as positive or negative, the cut-off point for positive was 100 nanograms/mL. If any of the three screens in a week were positive, that week was classed as positive. This was used in <LINK REF="STD-Akerele-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Akerele 2007</LINK>.</P>
<P>4.6.2.3 Adverse effects - Measured adverse events</P>
<P>Participants reporting any adverse events were noted, the number of participants and type of adverse event was recorded. This was used in <LINK REF="STD-Brunette-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Brunette 2011</LINK>.</P>
<P>4.6.2.4 Adverse effects 2 - weight gain (kg)</P>
<P>Body weight (kg) was measured to quantify side effects of medication. This was used in <LINK REF="STD-Leweke-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Leweke 2012</LINK>.</P>
<P>4.6.2.5 Adverse effects 3 - prolactin (nanograms/L)</P>
<P>Serum prolactin (nanograms/L) was measured to quantify side effects of medication. This was used in <LINK REF="STD-Leweke-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Leweke 2012</LINK>.</P>
<P>4.6.2.6 Leaving the study early - reasons</P>
<P>Reasons for leaving were grouped into not interested, intolerable adverse effects, needing hospital admission. This outcome was used by <LINK REF="STD-Akerele-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Akerele 2007</LINK>.</P>
<P>4.6.2.7 Leaving the study early - time in treatment (weeks)</P>

<P>Of our included studies, five displayed a low risk of bias. These studies utilised single rater blinding or double blinding, and in most cases those using a single blind method employed independent parties to run the blinding. One of our included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Akerele-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Akerele 2007</LINK>) displayed an unclear risk of bias due to blinding not being tested. Two of our included studies displayed a high risk of bias: <LINK REF="STD-Brunette-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Brunette 2011</LINK> because clinicians and participants were not blinded; and <LINK REF="STD-Hjorthoj-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Hjorthoj 2013</LINK> because 14 patients or managers accidentally broke the blind.</P>

<P>The key area of concern with regards to other potential sources of bias in the studies we included was the source of funding. <LINK REF="STD-Akerele-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Akerele 2007</LINK> was funded by a company with pecuniary interest in the results (Eli Lilly - producers of olanzapine), thus the risk of bias was found to be high. It is however unclear to what extent this may have influenced the trial. In contrast, although <LINK REF="STD-van-Nimwegen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">van Nimwegen 2008</LINK> was also funded by Eli-Lilly, it was stated clearly within this study that the company was not involved in the design of the study, analyses or interpretation of results and therefore the risk of bias here was considered to be low. The risk of bias in <LINK REF="STD-Brunette-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Brunette 2011</LINK> was also found to be low as the authors reported no financial relationships or commercial interest with regard to the present study. In all of the other included studies there were no allusions to other potential sources of bias, thus the risk of bias was deemed to be unclear.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. The search</HEADING>
<P>The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's register of trials is the most comprehensive register of its kind. It is compiled by searching mainstream and less well known bibliographic databases and from manual searches of key journals and conference proceedings. We were able to include eight studies and found one additional study (<LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Souza-2005" TYPE="STUDY">D'Souza 2005</LINK>), which was added to awaiting assessment whilst further information is sought. Trials published in languages other than English (we found no studies published in any language other than English), and those with equivocal results are often difficult to find, and our search relied heavily on English phrases. However, it seems unlikely that well designed and reported randomised trials went unnoticed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-10-13 11:37:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. COMPARISON 1: CANNABIS REDUCTION: ADJUNCT PSYCHOLOGICAL THERAPY versus TREATMENT AS USUAL</HEADING>
<P>This section of the review compared treatment as usual versus psychological intervention specifically targeted at cannabis use (to encourage reduction in cannabis consumption) combined with treatment as usual. For a summary of the primary outcomes of interest and ratings of the quality of the evidence for each comparison, view <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.1 Behaviour: Cannabis use</HEADING>
<P>The main aim of the three studies selected was to see if there was a decrease in cannabis consumption and if there was any subsequent improvement in schizophrenia symptoms, however the comparison suffered due to the trials being small and little data were directly comparable. None of the studies demonstrate any significant difference between treatment as usual and the psychological intervention being tested for outcomes of cannabis use; mental state or general functioning.</P>
<P>The majority of the data for this outcome was skewed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.2 General functioning</HEADING>
<P>For one of the four subgroup outcomes the data were skewed. Each outcome was reported by a single paper, as such it is difficult to make any meaningful conclusion. None of the outcomes showed a significant difference in general functioning between psychological intervention and treatment as usual.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.3 Mental state</HEADING>
<P>All the data for mental state from <LINK REF="STD-Bonsack-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Bonsack 2011</LINK> was skewed; the remaining data were from <LINK REF="STD-Madigan-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Madigan 2012</LINK>. Again, no significant difference was found between the two treatments.</P>
<P>The studies ranged in size from n = 103 to n = 44; and only three could be included, the small size and small number of studies means that it is difficult to draw meaningful conclusions from the studies</P>
<P>There were seven other studies that could have been included on the basis of our inclusion criteria, but they could not be included as the data were not provided in time for publication of the review. Several of the trials involved people with schizophrenia with multiple drug consumption, and although they were stratified for cannabis use, the stratified data were not available at time of publication.</P>
<P>More research needs to be conducted to see if the extra psychological interventions improve outcomes, as the data stand at the moment, they provide no evidence of improvement.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. COMPARISON 2: CANNABIS REDUCTION: PSYCHOLOGICAL THERAPY (SPECIFICALLY ABOUT CANNABIS AND PSYCHOSIS) versus NON-SPECIFIC PSYCHOEDUCATION</HEADING>
<P>This section of the review compared cannabis and psychosis therapy versus psychoeducation. For a summary of the primary outcomes of interest and ratings of the quality of the evidence for each comparison, view <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.1 Cannabis use</HEADING>
<P>The key aim of this study was to minimise the usage of cannabis in people with first episode psychosis. None of the outcomes revealed any significant difference between groups. Had the study been larger, differences may have emerged. Given the lack of trial-based data in this area this study provides a welcome appraisal, and hopefully more studies will shed light on the impact of cannabis in people with psychoses.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.2 Global state</HEADING>
<P>The Knowledge About Psychosis Questionnaire (KAPQ) questionnaire was used to inform participants about psychosis, but did not reveal any differences in the groups understanding at the three- and nine-month assessment points. It is possible that the lack of significant differences to emerge may, in part, have been due to using an active control group.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.3 Mental state</HEADING>
<P>From the available data on the positive symptoms of psychosis measured with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) scale, no differences emerged that demonstrated an overall benefit for Cannabis and Psychosis (CAP) therapy compared with psychoeducation. Other scales were used but these reported skewed data which we had pre-stated we would not use due to too much inconsistency.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.4 Social functioning</HEADING>
<P>The participants' social functioning did not improve in either group during the trial whilst interventions were given for three months, or at the follow-up stage six months later.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">3. COMPARISON 3: CANNABIS REDUCTION - ANTIPSYCHOTIC 'A' versus ANTIPSYCHOTIC 'B'</HEADING>
<P>This section of the review compared antipsychotic medication in those with schizophrenia and who used cannabis, comparing the ability to alter the amount of cannabis consumed, and comparing antipsychotic side-effect profile in specifically that group of patients. For a summary of the primary outcomes of interest and ratings of the quality of the evidence for each comparison, view <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3.1 Cannabis use</HEADING>
<P>The objective of the three trials that measured the impact of antipsychotics on cannabis usage was to deduce whether use and/or cravings subsided differentially when comparing exposure to certain drugs. In none of the outcomes did any study provide evidence for significant differences between groups. Each trial was limited by a small sample size and skewed data, therefore reliable conclusions regarding the comparative effect of antipsychotics cannot be drawn. In <LINK REF="STD-Brunette-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Brunette 2011</LINK>, data suggest therapy with clozapine may reduce cannabis use more than treatment as usual among patients with schizophrenia and co-occurring cannabis use disorder, however data are skewed and the sample size small. There appears to be scope for further exploration of the comparative utility of antipsychotics in future trials with larger sample sizes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3.2 Adverse events</HEADING>
<P>Two trials recorded the adverse effects of interventions that relate to this comparison. In <LINK REF="STD-Brunette-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Brunette 2011</LINK>, significant differences in somnolence and hypersalivation were observed that suggest clozapine associates with better outcomes here. In all other adverse effects measured in <LINK REF="STD-Brunette-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Brunette 2011</LINK> there were no significant differences between groups, however in several instances (including constipation, weight gain and dizziness), the differences were almost significant. In <LINK REF="STD-Akerele-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Akerele 2007</LINK>, there was no significant difference in terms of movement disorders between groups using the Simpson-Angus Scale; the study noted that sedation was reported as the most common side effect by both groups; however no patient was withdrawn due to side effects, suggesting a limited need for future investigations into the comparative side effects of olanzapine and risperidone in this context.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3.3 Leaving the study early</HEADING>
<P>There were no significant differences in time until dropout in the olanzapine and risperidone groups in <LINK REF="STD-Akerele-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Akerele 2007</LINK>, and nor were there any significant differences in the reasons for dropout between participants across the two groups. In neither group were intolerable side effects cited by participants as a reason for dropping out. Future trials with larger sample sizes may be better able to elicit differences in motivations for dropping out amongst participants.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3.4 Mental state</HEADING>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-van-Nimwegen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">van Nimwegen 2008</LINK> there were no significant differences found between groups relating to the Obsessive-Compulsive Drug Use Scale (OCDUS), which pertains to craving for cannabis. The study noted that most of the changes associated with the scale took place in the first week of the trial, thus a trial extension is unlikely to have uncovered further changes. Measures of changes in mental state relating to cannabis craving that affects usage would be welcome in future studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">4. COMPARISON 4: CANNABINOID AS TREATMENT - CANNABIDIOL versus AMISULPRIDE</HEADING>
<P>This section of the review compared treatment of schizophrenia with cannabidiol versus amisulpride. For a summary of the primary outcomes of interest and ratings of the quality of the evidence for each comparison, view <LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">4.1 Mental state</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Leweke-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Leweke 2012</LINK> recorded data relating to mental state outcomes. BPRS total endpoint scores appear to favour cannabinoid compared to amisulpride at 7 days, however the difference in scores was not significant and this slight advantage for cannabinoid was not apparent at day 14, 21 and 28. <LINK REF="STD-Leweke-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Leweke 2012</LINK> also measured mental state using the PANSS and found no found differences in mental state using this scale. The apparent difference in mental state at 7 days is an interesting finding, as there is some slight suggestion that cannabidiol may be have some antipsychotic characteristics, however this result is based on one short term follow-up and from a very small trial, this overall lack of effect may have been because there was a lack of power to detect a difference in this one very small study. Future studies into its mechanism, efficacy and clinical viability could be of great benefit regarding its potential role as an antipsychotic. Furthermore, research into its antipsychotic role within cannabis could help explain more about associations between cannabis and schizophrenia.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">4.2 Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>In relation to adverse effects, (<LINK REF="STD-Leweke-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Leweke 2012</LINK>) the side-effect profile for cannabidiol appears to be superior to that of amisulpride. The data are heavily skewed however, thus future studies would be required to clarify whether this is the case.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Completeness</HEADING>
<P>Overall, the completeness of evidence was poor; for two comparisons only three of the seven main outcomes were reported, one comparison had two outcomes, and one comparison had no data for any of the seven main outcomes.</P>
<P>There was also a lack of trials for each comparison and for each main outcome; generally there was only one trial for each outcome. The trials were all of moderate quality.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Applicability of evidence</HEADING>
<P>Generally the evidence was applicable, all the trials involved patients who were diagnosed on the basis of international standardised diagnostic criteria. All trials took place in developed countries. It is assumed that the healthcare standard amongst these countries is broadly similar; however there are differences in funding structure of health care within these group of countries (private versus publicly funding health care), the main divide being between trials conducted within the United States of America and Western Europe. It is unclear whether these differences in funding would make comparison between trials more difficult. However the lack of comparable data limited the applicability of the evidence to consumers, health professionals and policy makers.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-10-01 10:25:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In general, the quality of the evidence was moderate: the main issue with the data were lack of multiple studies, there was usually only one randomised controlled trial (RCT) for each analysis, thus reducing the ability to draw a conclusion. There was also an issue with skewed data. The lack of data are the main limitation with this review.</P>
<P>Generally the trials did attempt to follow the CONSORT statement, however none of the trials adhered very well to the statement, and as a result there was a lack of transparency in several studies, where certain steps or processes within the trial were not clear to the reader. Some trials were excluded due to this lack of transparency, we attempted to contact the authors in order to clarify data or methodology but in several cases no reply was given.</P>
<P>Overall, this review encountered low levels of bias in the studies fit for inclusion. (See <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>.) Potential exceptions occurred in one trial that was funded by a company with pecuniary interest in the result.The only other notable area of bias came where blinding was disrupted or not carried out, this occurred in two trials. Please see the GRADE rating in <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2014-10-13 11:38:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There were changes between the first published protocol and the protocol we published above. The key differences were that we partially changed the primary outcomes: we kept relapse and clinically important mental state change; but we did remove hospitalisation. We did this before conducting the review, so any potential bias would be considered unlikely: it would not have affected the selection process of the trials, but it will have changed the results in the discussion. We did not remove or add any main outcomes, however we reordered them, and reclassified death under adverse events,. We also changed the time period for the primary outcomes so that they were all medium term - this was to avoid any ambiguity and to reduce the risk of bias in carrying out the review. Further, we grouped the outcomes within different timeframes of short, medium and long term; this was to ensure applicability of data, and to ensure fair comparison.</P>
<P>We reworded the comparisons, again to avoid ambiguity and reduce risk of bias. In the original protocol, four types of intervention including placebo, cannabinoids, and any other intervention were simply listed; the updated protocol reorganised those four interventions into two specific comparisons: firstly: looking into interventions which affected cannabis use and secondly intervention which involved giving any form of cannabinoids. We believe that did not affect which papers were included in the study, although we did remove the vague intervention of "any other"; there were no papers which we screened that would have come under this category.</P>
<P>There are no known conflicts of interest amongst the authors, none of the authors received any direct funding for the completion of this review.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2014-09-06 21:30:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The scope of this review focuses specifically on schizophrenia and cannabis, an area not directly dealt with by any other reviews. One key review that demonstrates some overlap in findings is <LINK REF="REF-Hunt-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hunt 2013</LINK>, which agrees overall with the conclusions made in Comparison 2 of this review: that not any one psychosocial treatment is favourable in reducing substance abuse or mental state in people with severe mental illnesses. The specific nature of this review means that there is little wider overlap with other studies and reviews.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-10-01 10:25:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-10-01 10:25:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The question most frequently asked in reference to the relationship between cannabis and schizophrenia is that of whether using cannabis increases the chance of suffering the disorder. However, due to the nature of data available at the time of writing, this review focusses primarily on interventions directed at <I>reducing</I> cannabis use in people with schizophrenia and whether cannabinoids reduce symptoms. There are not enough data to answer these questions.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. For people with schizophrenia</HEADING>
<P>Cannabis could relieve some of the psychological difficulties that come as part of the illness of schizophrenia, or as reaction to having schizophrenia. However, taking this compound could also make things worse. The evidence is just not clear from the trials. It would seem reasonable that people with schizophrenia who are being advised to stop their cannabis use, when no clear detrimental effect is evident, require better evidence from researchers. People who have schizophrenia and want to stop their cannabis use should also expect better evidence around techniques by which this is assisted.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. For clinicians</HEADING>
<P>For some people with schizophrenia, cannabis use clearly makes 'positive' symptoms worse. For many, however, using cannabis seems only to have the expected mild soporific effects that probably compound 'negative' symptom languor. Trial-based research is so limited that it is uninformative. Whether adding the drug is harmful - or helpful is unclear. How best to help people stop when they ask for help in doing so is not well-researched. There is much work to be done.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. For policy makers</HEADING>
<P>Adjunctive use of cannabinoid drugs for people with schizophrenia is experimental. Techniques to help people reduce or stop the cannabis are poorly tested.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. General</HEADING>
<P>Public registration of a study before participants are randomised would ensure that participants could be confident that people would know that the study had at least taken place. Strict compliance with CONSORT (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>), both on the part of authors and editors, would help to clarify methodology and ensure outcomes are reported in a manner that is accessible and usable to others. Failure to comply with CONSORT guidelines results in loss of data and confusion in results, neither of which helps clinicians, patients, managers or researchers.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Methods</HEADING>
<P>Future trials should ensure that a clear description of the interventions are given. Such a study would only be meaningful if undertaken within usual resources available to routine care and measured outcomes of relevance to clinicians and recipients of care as well as researchers. Study samples should include people with schizophrenia and closely related disorders, or at least allow data on this group of people to be extracted from the paper. Trials conducted in the future would also benefit from increased sample sizes to corroborate study findings.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">3. Data</HEADING>
<P>Future trials should ensure that data are presented clearly and thoroughly, which would ensure that it was available for analysis and interpretation. Often data have been inconsistent and missing, which results in difficulty reaching meaningful conclusions; reduced clarity and raises suspicion of bias, when perhaps there is none. We reiterate the importance of researchers to adhere to the Consort Statement, and support the All Trials campaign to ensure all data are published.</P>

<P>See <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> and <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_AWAITING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of studies awaiting classification</LINK>. All studies described within these tables could be possibly included in future reviews as they match inclusion criteria, however at the time of review, no usable data were received and therefore they could not be included.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">5. Suggestions for future trials</HEADING>
<P>We recognise that much planning must go into production of a trial protocol but we have now looked at existing evidence is some detail and suggest designs for trials to help people with schizophrenia stop cannabis (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>), and, if intent on continuing to use we think that investigating the best antipsychotic to employ (specifically clozapine) could be justified (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>).</P>

<APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2014-09-26 11:56:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>1. Study selection<BR/>We (JR, HV) independently inspected all identified citations for relevance independently. Citations were checked again by HM. Where disagreement occurred we attempted to resolve this by discussion, where doubt still remained we acquired the full article for further inspection. We independently decided whether the selected studies met the review criteria. Again, where disagreement occurred attempts were made to resolve this through discussion; if doubt still remained we added these trials to the list of those awaiting assessment pending acquisition of further information.</P>
<P>2. Assessment of quality<BR/>We assessed the methodological quality of included studies using the criteria described in the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2006</LINK>), which is based on the degree of allocation concealment. Poor concealment has been associated with overestimation of treatment effect (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). Category A includes studies in which allocation has been randomised and concealment is explicit. Category B studies are those which have randomised allocation but in which concealment is not explicit. Category C studies are those in which allocation has neither been randomised nor concealed. Only trials that are stated to be randomised (categories A or B of the handbook) will be included in this review. The categories are defined below:</P>
<P>A. Low risk of bias (adequate allocation concealment)<BR/>B. Moderate risk of bias (some doubt about the results)<BR/>C. High risk of bias (inadequate allocation concealment).</P>
<P>When disputes arose as to which category a trial should be allocated, again we attempted resolution by discussion. When this was not possible we did not enter the data and the trial was added to the list of those awaiting assessment until further information could be obtained.</P>
<P>3. Data collection<BR/>We (JR, HV) independently extracted data from selected trials. When disputes arose we attempted to resolve these by discussion. When this was not possible and further information was necessary to resolve the dilemma, we did not enter data and added the trial to the list of those awaiting assessment.</P>
<P>4. Data synthesis<BR/>4.1 Intention-to-treat analysis<BR/>We excluded data from studies where more than 50% of participants in any group were lost to follow-up (this did not include the outcome of 'leaving the study early'). In studies with less than 50% dropout rate, we assumed that participants had a poor outcome and were included in the analysis (intention-to-treat /ITT analysis); except for the event of death, or adverse events in studies using a placebo comparator group. We analysed the impact of including studies with high attrition rates (30-50%) in a sensitivity analysis. If inclusion of data from this latter group resulted in a substantive change in the estimate of effect, we did not add their data to trials with less attrition, but presented them separately.</P>
<P>4.2 Binary data<BR/>For binary outcomes (improved/not improved etc.) we calculated the relative risk (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) based on a fixed-effect model. Relative Risk is more intuitive (<LINK REF="REF-Boissel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boissel 1999</LINK>) than odds ratios, and odds ratios tend to be interpreted as RR by clinicians (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2000</LINK>). This misinterpretation then leads to an overestimate of the impression of the effect. When the overall results were significant and homogeneous we calculated the number needed to treat (NNT) and the number needed to harm (NNH).</P>
<P>Where possible, efforts were made to convert outcome measures to binary data. This can be done by identifying cut-off points on rating scales and dividing participants accordingly into "clinically improved" or "not clinically improved". It was generally assumed that if there had been a 50% reduction in a scale-derived score such as the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS, <LINK REF="REF-Overall-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1988</LINK>) or the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS, <LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>), this could be considered as a clinically significant response (<LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005a</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005</LINK>b). It was recognised that for many people, especially those with chronic or severe illness, a less rigorous definition of important improvement (e.g. 25% on the BPRS) would be equally valid. If individual patient data were available, the 50% cut-off was used for the definition in the case of non-chronically ill people and 25% for those with chronic illness. If data based on these thresholds were not available, we used the primary cut-off presented by the original authors.</P>
<P>4.3 Continuous data<BR/>4.3.1 Normal distribution<BR/>Continuous data on outcomes in trials relevant to mental health issues are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data we applied the following standards to continuous final value endpoint data before inclusion: (a) standard deviations and means were reported in the paper or were obtainable from the authors; (b) when a scale started from zero, the standard deviation, when multiplied by two, should be less than the mean (otherwise the mean is unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution - <LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>); In cases with data that are greater than the mean they were entered into 'Other data' table as skewed data. If a scale starts from a positive value (such as PANSS, which can have values from 30 to 210) the calculation described above in (b) should be modified to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skewness is present if 2SD&gt;(S-Smin), where S is the mean score and Smin is the minimum score. We reported non-normally distributed data (skewed) in the 'other data types' tables.</P>
<P>For change data (mean change from baseline on a rating scale) it is impossible to tell whether data are non-normally distributed (skewed) or not, unless individual patient data are available. After consulting the ALLSTAT electronic statistics mailing list, we presented change data in RevMan graphs to summarise available information. In doing this, we assumed either that data were not skewed or that the analysis could cope with the unknown degree of skew.</P>
<P>4.3.2 Final endpoint value versus change data<BR/>Where both final endpoint data and change data were available for the same outcome category, we only presented final endpoint data . We acknowledge that by doing this much of the published change data may be excluded, but argue that endpoint data are more clinically relevant and that if change data were to be presented along with endpoint data, it would be given undeserved equal prominence. Where studies reported only change data we contacted authors for endpoint figures.</P>
<P>4.3.3 Summary statistic<BR/>For continuous outcomes we estimated a weighted mean difference (WMD) between groups based on a fixed effects model. Continuous data presented without use of summary statistics (i.e. mean, SD, SE) were not considered good evidence, though the existence of these data were noted in the text.</P>
<P>4.3.4 Conversion to a common metric<BR/>To facilitate comparison between trials, we converted variables (such as days in hospital) that could be reported in different metrics (mean days per year, per week or per month) to a common metric (e.g. mean days per month).</P>
<P>4.4 Rating scales<BR/>A wide range of instruments are available to measure mental health outcomes. These instruments vary in quality and many are not valid, and are known to be subject to bias in trials of treatments for schizophrenia (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>). Therefore continuous data from rating scales were included only if the measuring instrument had been described in a peer-reviewed journal.</P>
<P>4.5 Cluster trials<BR/>Studies increasingly employ cluster randomisation (such as randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Firstly, authors often fail to account for intra class correlation in clustered studies, leading to a unit-of-analysis error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) whereby p values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This causes Type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Where clustering was not accounted for in primary studies, we presented the data in a table, with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review we will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intra-class correlation co-efficient of their clustered data and to adjust for this using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Where clustering has been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we will also present these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjusted for the clustering effect.</P>
<P>We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a design effect. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the intraclass correlation co-efficient (ICC) [Design effect=1+(m-1)*ICC] (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC was not reported it was assumed to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>). If cluster studies had been appropriately analysed taking into account intra-class correlation coefficients and relevant data documented in the report, we synthesised these with other studies using the generic inverse variance technique.</P>
<P>5. Investigation for heterogeneity<BR/>Firstly, we considered all the included studies within any comparison to judge for clinical heterogeneity. Then we visually inspected graphs to investigate the possibility of statistical heterogeneity. We supplemented this by using primarily the I-squared statistic. This provides an estimate of the percentage of variability due to heterogeneity rather than chance alone. Where the I-squared estimate was greater than or equal to 50%, we interpreted this as indicating the presence of considerable levels of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). Where heterogeneity was present, reasons for this were investigated. If it substantially altered the results, data were not summated, but presented separately and reasons for heterogeneity investigated.</P>
<P>6. Addressing publication bias<BR/>We entered data from all included studies into a funnel graph (trial effect against trial size) in an attempt to investigate the likelihood of overt publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>7. Sensitivity analyses<BR/>We analysed the effect of including studies with high attrition rates in a sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>8. General<BR/>Where possible, we entered data in such a way that the area to the left of the line of no effect indicated a favourable outcome for cannabis/cannabinoids.</P>

<P>The cannabis plant (Cannabis sativa L.) grows in temperate and tropical areas. Herbal cannabis consists of the dried flowering tops and leaves. Cannabis resin is a compressed solid made from the resinous parts of the plant, and cannabis oil (hash) is a solvent extract of cannabis. Cannabis is usually smoked but occasionally ingested in foodstuffs.<BR/>
<BR/>Cannabinoids are present in the flowers, leaves, seeds and stalks of cannabis sativa, otherwise known as the hemp plant (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). Cannabinol was first isolated in 1895. An anonymous British physician working in British Guyana in 1893 (<LINK REF="REF-Tunving-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tunving 1985</LINK>) indicated that the use of cannabis might be a cause of mental illness. Dr Warnock in 1895, from his experience with inmates of the Cairo asylum in Egypt (<LINK REF="REF-Warnock-1903" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warnock 1903</LINK>), also related abuse of hashish to mental illness and wondered how those outside the asylum could enjoy the drug without becoming ill. Concerns about its psychoactive properties date from 1928, when Egyptian and South African doctors stated that heavy use could cause mental disturbances (<LINK REF="REF-Berridge-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berridge 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Schizophrenia-like experiences have been described in cannabis smokers (<LINK REF="REF-Talbot-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Talbot 1969</LINK>) and there have been anecdotal sporadic reports of cannabis-linked psychosis (<LINK REF="REF-Varma-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Varma 1972</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Chopra-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chopra 1974</LINK>) including the earliest reported British case of psychosis associated with cannabis abuse (<LINK REF="REF-Davison-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davison 1972</LINK>). The diagnostic label of "cannabis psychosis" is less fashionable than it once was. It tended to be attached to young Afro-Caribbean patients (<LINK REF="REF-McGovern-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGovern 1987</LINK>), a practice which was rightly disputed (<LINK REF="REF-Carney-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carney 1984</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Littlewood-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Littlewood 1988</LINK>). However, the relationship between cannabis and schizophrenia remains controversial.</P>
<P>In general, substance misuse has been reported to be the most prevalent comorbid condition associated with schizophrenia (<LINK REF="REF-Regier-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Regier 1990</LINK>) and cannabis is the most frequently used substance (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Farrell-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrell 1998</LINK>). The reported rates of cannabis abuse among people with schizophrenia vary widely both within and between different countries, but are consistently higher than in other people with mental illnesses or in the general population (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1994</LINK>). The proportion of people with schizophrenia who use cannabis varies, but surveys commonly find prevalence rates to be about 40% ( <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Cannabis contains the psychoactive constituent cannabinoid delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Concerns have been raised that THC concentrations in cannabis are higher than in the past, and therefore today cannabis usage poses a greater risk to health. Cannabis produced from intensive indoor cultivation methods has a higher concentration of THC than imported sources, which typically are not intensively cultivated. The higher concentrations have been attributed to the use of specific seed strains from the female plant which are grown in artificial light and prevented from undergoing fertilization or seed production. However, the majority of cannabis used in the UK originates from North Africa and the available data does not indicate an upward trend in potency from imported cannabis into Europe (<LINK REF="REF-EMCDDA" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMCDDA</LINK>).</P>
<P>Cannabis as precipitant<BR/>A longitudinal follow-up study of Swedish conscripts <LINK REF="REF-Andreasson-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andreasson 1987</LINK> has shown that the relative risk for schizophrenia was up to six times greater in people who had reported high cannabis use (on more than 50 occasions) compared with non users, and cannabis was felt to be an independent risk factor for schizophrenia. Similar results were obtained in studies at five years post-conscription, to exclude the prodromal cases (<LINK REF="REF-Zammit-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zammit 2002</LINK>). This was replicated by <LINK REF="REF-Van-Os-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Os 2002</LINK>, and <LINK REF="REF-Arseneault-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arseneault 2002</LINK> in separate studies. A WHO study (<LINK REF="REF-Jablensky-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jablensky 1992</LINK>) has shown that the use of cannabis early in the onset of schizophrenia is a predictor of a poor outcome. Another theory is that the continuous heavy use of cannabis can induce a psychotic illness, which is distinct from schizophrenia (<LINK REF="REF-Nunez-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nunez 2002</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Cannabis as bidirectional perpetuant<BR/>In general cannabis use is felt to have a negative effect on the course and prognosis of the illness (<LINK REF="REF-Negrete-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Negrete 1986</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Linszman-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Linszman 1994</LINK>). A number of hypotheses have been put forward regarding the association between cannabis and schizophrenia. A recently published study (<LINK REF="REF-Hides-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hides 2006</LINK>) examined the influence of cannabis use on psychotic relapse and the influence of psychotic symptom severity on relapse in cannabis use in the six months following hospital admission. They found that a higher frequency of cannabis use was predictive of psychotic relapse, after controlling for medication adherence, other substance use and duration of untreated psychosis. Also, an increase in psychotic symptoms was predictive of relapse to cannabis use. They concluded that the relationship between cannabis and psychosis might be "bidirectional".</P>
<P>Self-medication<BR/>An alternative theory is that cannabis is used by people with distressing psychotic symptoms as a form of self-medication (<LINK REF="REF-Dixon-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dixon 1990</LINK>), or to reduce the unpleasant adverse effects caused by antipsychotic drug treatment. It has also been proposed that the negative symptoms of schizophrenia (affective flattening, poor volition, poverty of thought, social withdrawal) may be improved by use of cannabis.</P>
<P>Technical background<BR/>The major active principle in all cannabis products is delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>) It was first identified in 1964 (<LINK REF="REF-Gaoni-1964" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gaoni 1964</LINK>) and this compound seems responsible for most of the psychological effects of marijuana (<LINK REF="REF-Isbell-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Isbell 1967</LINK>). As cannabis or the cannabinoids lead to dopamine release (<LINK REF="REF-Tanda-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tanda 1997</LINK>) it would seem plausible that its use could precipitate or exacerbate illness.</P>
<P>Cannabinoids are a group of terpenophenolic compounds present in cannabis. Cannabinoids exert their effect through specific endogenous cannabinoid receptors. THC exerts its effect by interaction with neuronal (CB1) receptors which are found in the cerebral cortex, limbic areas, basal ganglia, thalamus and brain stem. Within the brain, THC and other cannabinoids are differentially distributed with high concentrations in cortical, limbic, sensory and motor areas. CB2 receptors have also been identified in macrophages and other immune cells. The cannabinoid system of the brain is modulated by endogenous cannabinoids which include anandamide and palmitoylethanolamide. Concentrations of endogenous cannabinoids have been found to be significantly higher in the cerebrospinal fluid of people with schizophrenia than in non-schizophrenic controls (<LINK REF="REF-Leweke-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leweke 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>THC produces a euphoric effect, but it can cause perceptual alterations, impaired short term memory and attention, anxiety and panic attacks (<LINK REF="REF-Ashton-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ashton 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Thomas-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 1996</LINK>), and may lead to a withdrawal (<LINK REF="REF-Kouri-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kouri 1999</LINK>) or dependence syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Stephens-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stephens 1993</LINK>). In high doses, visual and auditory hallucinations, delusions and thought disorder may result (<LINK REF="REF-Lishman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lishman 1998</LINK>).</P>
