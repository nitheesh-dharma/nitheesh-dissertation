<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Hepatitis B vaccine, hepatitis B immunoglobulin, and hepatitis B vaccine plus immunoglobulin prevent perinatal transmission of hepatitis B</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Hepatitis B vaccination and hepatitis B immunoglobulin are considered as preventive measures for newborn infants of HBsAg positive mothers. When all the identified trials were combined, hepatitis B vaccine alone, hepatitis B immunoglobulin alone, and hepatitis B vaccine plus hepatitis B immunoglobulin reduced perinatal transmission of hepatitis B compared with placebo or no intervention. Hepatitis B vaccine plus hepatitis B immunoglobulin were superior to hepatitis B vaccination alone. Adverse events were rare and mostly non-serious.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B immunoglobulin are considered for newborn infants of HBsAg-positive mothers to prevent hepatitis B infection.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of hepatitis B vaccines and hepatitis B immunoglobulin in newborn infants of HBsAg-positive mothers.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Trials were identified through <I>The Cochrane Neonatal Group Controlled Trials Register</I>, <I>The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials </I>in <I>The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, </I>and <I>EMBASE </I>(until February 2004), authors of trials, and pharmaceutical companies.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised clinical trials comparing: plasma-derived vaccine (PDV) or recombinant vaccine (RV) versus no intervention, placebo, or other active vaccines; hepatitis B immunoglobulin versus no intervention, placebo, or other control immunoglobulin; as well as PDV or RV plus hepatitis B immunoglobulin versus no intervention, placebo, or other control vaccines or immunoglobulin.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Outcomes are assessed at maximal follow-up. The primary outcome measure was hepatitis B occurrence, based on a blood specimen positive for HBsAg, HBeAg, or antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc). Binary outcomes are reported as relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Subgroup analyses were performed with regard to methodological quality of the trial, mother's HBe-Ag status, and time of immunisation after birth.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>We identified 29 randomised clinical trials, five of which were considered high quality. Only three trials reported inclusion of hepatitis B e-antigen negative mothers. Compared with placebo/no intervention, vaccine reduced hepatitis B occurrence (RR 0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.20 to 0.40, 4 trials). No significant differences of hepatitis B occurrence were found comparing recombinant vaccine (RV) versus plasma-derived vaccine (PDV) (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.42, 4 trials) and high-dose versus low-dose vaccine (PDV: RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.68, 3 trials; RV: RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.94, 1 trial). Compared with placebo/no intervention, hepatitis B immunoglobulin or the combination of vaccine plus hepatitis B immunoglobulin reduced hepatitis B occurrence (hepatitis B immunoglobulin: RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.60, 1 trial; PDV plus hepatitis B immunoglobulin: RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.17, 3 trials). Compared with vaccine, vaccine plus hepatitis B immunoglobulin reduced hepatitis B occurrence (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.73, 10 trials). Hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B immunoglobulin seem safe, but few trials reported on adverse events. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Vaccine, hepatitis B immunoglobulin, and vaccine plus hepatitis B immunoglobulin prevent hepatitis B occurrence in newborn infants of HBsAg positive mothers. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-27 23:32:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Hepatitis B virus is a global acute and chronic communicable disease that causes major hepatic disease, with an estimated 350 million people infected (<LINK REF="REF-Beasley-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beasley 1984</LINK>). Mother to child transmission occurs frequently either in uterus (when the baby is still in the womb), through placental leakage, or through exposure to blood or blood contaminated fluids at or around the time of birth. Such perinatal transmission is believed to account for 35% to 50% of hepatitis B carriers (<LINK REF="REF-Yao-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yao 1996</LINK>). The risk of perinatal transmission is associated with the HBeAg status of the mother. If the mother is both HBsAg and HBeAg positive, 70% to 90% of the children become chronically infected (<LINK REF="REF-Stevens-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevens 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Akhter-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akhter 1992</LINK>). If the mother is HBsAg positive but HBeAg negative, the risk is significantly reduced (<LINK REF="REF-Okada-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Okada 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Beasley-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beasley 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Beasley-1983b" TYPE="STUDY">Beasley 1983b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nayak-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nayak 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Aggarwal-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aggarwal 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two types of vaccines have been licensed. One is derived from human plasma (plasma-derived vaccine (PDV)) and the other is derived from DNA recombinant technology (recombinant vaccine (RV)) from yeast or mammalian cells (<LINK REF="REF-Assad-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Assad 1999</LINK>). Repeated injections over months are required to mount an effective antibody response with vaccination. Hepatitis B immunoglobulin is an immune globulin, which contains a high level of antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs). Hepatitis B immunoglobulin is considered immediately effective and seems protective for several months after which it wanes (<LINK REF="REF-Beasley-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beasley 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nair-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Nair 1984</LINK>). </P>
<P>We have been unable to identify meta-analyses or systematic reviews on hepatitis B immunisation for newborn infants of HBsAg positive mothers. A narrative review regarding the efficacy of hepatitis B vaccine in neonates (<LINK REF="REF-Andre-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andre 1994</LINK>) and several international guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2002</LINK>) have been published. However, they do not represent systematic reviews containing an assessment of the methodological quality of the trials and presenting original data.</P>

<B>Selection of trials for inclusion<BR/>
</B>CL made the decisions on which trials to be included, and the selection was validated by YG, JB, and CG. We were unblinded with regard to the names of the authors, investigators, institutions, and results. Excluded trials were identified and listed with the reasons for exclusion.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Data extraction<BR/>
</B>CL, YG, and JB independently extracted the data from the included randomised trials. We wrote to the authors of trials if data were missing in the report.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>
</B>We extracted: primary author; number of participants; inclusion and exclusion criteria; HBeAg status of the mother; methodological quality (see below); dosage and types of vaccines; site of injection; vaccination schedules; duration of follow-up; outcome measures; and number and type of adverse events in the intervention and the control groups.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Methodological quality<BR/>
</B>Methodological quality is defined as the confidence that the design and report restrict bias in the intervention comparison (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>). Due to the risk of overestimation of intervention effects in randomised trials with inadequate methodological quality (<LINK REF="REF-Schultz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schultz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>), the methodological quality was assessed by using the following criteria:<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>
<I>Generation of the allocation sequence<BR/>
</I>
</B>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Adequate, if the allocation sequence was generated by a computer or random number table. Drawing of lots, tossing of a coin, shuffling of cards, or throwing dice was considered as adequate if a person who was not otherwise involved in the recruitment of participants performed the procedure.</LI>
<LI>Unclear, if the trial was described as randomised, but the method used for the allocation sequence generation was not described.</LI>
<LI>Inadequate, if a system involving dates, names, or admittance numbers were used for the allocation of patients. Such quasi-randomised studies were excluded.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<B>
<BR/>
<I>Allocation concealment<BR/>
</I>
</B>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Adequate, if the allocation of patients involved a central independent unit, on-site locked computer, identically appearing numbered drug bottles or containers prepared by an independent pharmacist or investigator, or sealed envelopes.</LI>
<LI>Unclear, if the trial was described as randomised, but the method used to conceal the allocation was not described.</LI>
<LI>Inadequate, if the allocation sequence was known to the investigators who assigned participants.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<B>
<I>Blinding (or masking)<BR/>
</I>
</B>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Adequate, if the trial was described as double blind and the method of blinding involved identical placebo or active drugs.</LI>
<LI>Unclear, if the trial was described as double blind, but the method of blinding was not described.</LI>
<LI>Not performed, if the trial was not double blind.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<B>
<I>Follow-up<BR/>
</I>
</B>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Adequate, if the numbers and reasons for dropouts and withdrawals in all intervention groups were described or if it was specified that there were no dropouts or withdrawals.</LI>
<LI>Unclear, if the report gave the impression that there had been no dropouts or withdrawals, but this was not specifically stated.</LI>
<LI>Inadequate, if the number or reasons for dropouts and withdrawals were not described.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<B>
<BR/>
</B>We <I>post hoc</I> defined high-quality trials when at least two out of the three quality components were adequate: generation of the allocation sequence, allocation concealment, and blinding. This was due to the fact that only a single trial had high quality regarding all three components.</P>
<P>
<B>Statistical methods<BR/>
</B>Review Manager 4.2. was used to perform meta-analyses. Data were analysed by both a random-effects model (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>) and a fixed-effect model (<LINK REF="REF-DeMets-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeMets 1987</LINK>). If the results of both analyses gave the same overall results regarding significance, only the results of the fixed-effect model analysis was reported.</P>
<P>We presented binary outcome measure as relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI), and continuous outcome measure as weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% CI. Heterogeneity was explored by chi-squared test with significance set at P &lt; 0.10 and the quantity of heterogeneity was measured by I<SUP>2</SUP> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2002</LINK>).<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>
</B>Meta-regression analysis was performed by STATA<SUP>® </SUP>on hepatitis B occurrence, when more than 10 trials were included. Meta-regression analysis examined the intervention effect in relation to methodological quality of trials, dosage of hepatitis B immunoglobulin and vaccine, and time of immunisation.</P>
<P>Subgroup analyses were performed to compare the effects of vaccines in mothers with HBsAg (+)/HBeAg(+) compared to HBsAg (+)/HBeAg(-), doses (high-dose versus low-dose), as well as methodological quality of the trials (high-quality versus low-quality). The difference between the estimates of two subgroups was estimated according to <LINK REF="REF-Altman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 2003</LINK>.<BR/>
<BR/>Regarding the hepatitis B occurrence, we included newborn infants with incomplete or missing data in the sensitivity analyses by imputing them in the following analyses (the last four being intention-to-treat analyses):<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Available data analysis: data on only those whose results are known, using the total number of patients who completed the trial as denominator;</LI>
<LI>Assuming poor outcome: dropouts in both experimental and control group had the primary outcome;</LI>
<LI>Assuming good outcome: none of the dropouts in the experimental and control group had the primary outcome;</LI>
<LI>Extreme case favouring experimental intervention: none of the dropouts in the experimental group but all in the control group had the primary outcome;</LI>

<B>Hepatitis B vaccines versus placebo or no intervention (Comparison 01-01 to 01-05)<BR/>
</B>Compared with placebo/no intervention, hepatitis B vaccination significantly decreased the risk of hepatitis B occurrence (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.40, 4 trials). The analysis showed heterogeneity (P = 0.07, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 54.2%). The results of sensitivity analyses regarding dropouts were consistent. Analyses of PDV and RV individually showed that both vaccines significantly decreased the risk of hepatitis B occurrence. </P>
<P>Subgroup analyses did not find a significant difference between high- and low-quality trials, the mother's HBeAg status, or time of vaccine injection (tests of interaction, P = 0.25, 0.07, and 0.11, respectively). <I>Post hoc</I> subgroup analysis according to vaccine schedules (0-1-6 months versus 0-1-2-6 or -12 months) showed no significant difference (test of interaction, P = 0.75).

<P>
<B>RV versus PDV (Comparison 02-01 to 02-05)<BR/>
</B>We found no significant difference between RV and PDV on hepatitis B occurrence (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.42, 4 trials). Heterogeneity was moderate (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 29.4%). The results of sensitivity analyses regarding dropouts confirmed the finding. Subgroup analyses did not find a significant difference regarding the methodological quality or the mother's HBeAg status (both tests of interaction, P = 0.21).</P>
<P>Significantly fewer newborn infants on RV compared to PDV had anti-HBs less than 10 IU/L (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.72, 3 trials). </P>
<P>
<B>High-dose versus low-dose vaccine (Comparison 03-01 to 03-05)<BR/>
</B>We found no statistical difference on hepatitis B occurrence comparing high-dose versus low-dose vaccine (PDV: RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.68, 3 trials; RV: RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.94, 1 trial). There was no significant difference between high-dose versus low-dose vaccine on anti-HBs less than 10 IU/L (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.82, 1.27, 2 trials).</P>
<P>
<B>Three-dose PDV versus two-dose PDV (Comparison 04-01 to 04-02)<BR/>
</B>Three-dose PDV plus hepatitis B immunoglobulin did not significantly prevent hepatitis B occurrence compared with two-dose PDV plus hepatitis B immunoglobulin (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.05 to 5.28, 1 trial). However, three-dose PDV plus hepatitis B immunoglobulin resulted in significantly less newborn infants who had anti-HBs less than 10 IU/L compared with two-dose PDV plus hepatitis B immunoglobulin (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.78, 1 trial).</P>
<P>
<B>PDV at birth versus PDV at one month (Comparison 05-01)<BR/>
</B>PDV administered for the first time at birth did not significantly differ from PDV administered for the first time at one month of age regarding the number of newborn infants having hepatitis B occurrence (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.18 to 2.77, 1 trial).</P>
<P>
<B>One type of PDV versus another type of PDV (Comparison 06-01)<BR/>

</B>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lolekha-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lolekha 2002</LINK>) compared one type of RV with four vaccinations (0-1-2-12 months) versus the same RV with three vaccinations (0-1-6 months). No significant differences were found on hepatitis B occurrence (RR 1.49, 95% CI 0.51 to 4.37) or anti-HBs level less than 10 IU/L (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.77). </P>

<P>
<B>Hepatitis B immunoglobulin versus placebo or no intervention (Comparison 09-01 to 09-08)<BR/>
</B>Overall, hepatitis B immunoglobulin significantly decreased the risk of hepatitis B occurrence in newborn infants (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.63, 11 trials). Compared with placebo/no intervention, hepatitis B immunoglobulin alone significantly reduced hepatitis B occurrence (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.60, 1 trial). Compared with vaccination, vaccination plus hepatitis B immunoglobulin was likewise superior (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.73, 10 trials). The sensitivity analyses regarding dropouts were consistent, indicating the robustness of the findings. In the meta-regression analyses, none of the trial characteristics (methodological quality, dosage of hepatitis B immunoglobulin, or time of hepatitis B immunoglobulin injection) was significantly associated with the effect of hepatitis B immunoglobulin (P = 0.92, 0.67, and 0.79, respectively). Subgroup analyses did not find a significant difference between high- and low-quality trials, the mother's HBeAg status, or time of hepatitis B immunoglobulin injection (tests of interaction, P = 0.70, 0.62, and 0.63, respectively).</P>
<P>Hepatitis B immunoglobulin had no significant effect on the number of newborn infants with anti-HBs level less than 10 IU/L (RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.89 to 2.73, 4 trials). </P>
<P>Few trials reported adverse events. If reported, the authors did not specify in which intervention group these events occurred. Therefore we were not able to perform a meta-analysis on adverse events. In one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Beasley-1983a-AB" TYPE="STUDY">Beasley 1983a AB</LINK>/<LINK REF="STD-Beasley-1983a-CB" TYPE="STUDY">Beasley 1983a CB</LINK>), one infant receiving hepatitis B immunoglobulin died. The death appeared unrelated to hepatitis B immunoglobulin.</P>
<P>Neither the Egger's nor the Begg's graphs and their corresponding tests on hepatitis B occurrence provided evidence for asymmetry (Egger's test, P = 0.31; Begg's test, P = 0.23).</P>
<P>
<B>Multiple hepatitis B immunoglobulin versus single hepatitis B immunoglobulin administration (Comparison 10-01)<BR/>
</B>Multiple hepatitis B immunoglobulin plus PDV versus single hepatitis B immunoglobulin plus PDV did not significantly reduced the risk of hepatitis B occurrence (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.30 to 2.47, 2 trials) with no heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%).</P>
<P>
<B>PDV plus hepatitis B immunoglobulin versus placebo or no intervention (Comparison 11-01 to 11-06)<BR/>
</B>Compared with placebo/no intervention, PDV plus hepatitis B immunoglobulin significantly reduced hepatitis B occurrence (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.17, 3 trials). The sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the finding. Subgroup analyses did not find a significant difference between high- and low-quality trials, the mother's HBeAg status, or time of hepatitis B immunoglobulin injection (tests of interaction, P = 0.13, 0.28, and 0.22, respectively). </P>
<P>One trial reported the number of adverse events: 3 out of 71 infants given vaccination versus 5 out of 34 in control group (<LINK REF="STD-Ip-1989-AD" TYPE="STUDY">Ip 1989 AD</LINK>/<LINK REF="STD-Ip-1989-BD" TYPE="STUDY">Ip 1989 BD</LINK>). The results showed no significant difference (0.29, 0.07 to 1.13)</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-10-27 23:32:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our systematic review demonstrates that hepatitis B vaccine, hepatitis B immunoglobulin, or the combination of vaccine plus hepatitis B immunoglobulin given to newborn infants of HBsAg-positive mothers prevent hepatitis B occurrence. Further, the combination of vaccine plus hepatitis B immunoglobulin was superior to vaccine alone. These benefits were not significantly associated with the methodological quality of the trials, the mother's HBeAg status, time of immunisation, or the number of infants dropping out. </P>
<P>Our review has several potential limitations. First, some analyses include few trials and a small number of newborn infants. Second, most trials had low methodological quality. However, we did not find strong association between the methodological quality and the trial results. This supports the robustness of our results, but does not exclude the possibility of bias affecting our results (<LINK REF="REF-Schultz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schultz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Als_x002d_Nielsen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Als-Nielsen 2004</LINK>). Third, although we did not find funnel plot asymmetries, we cannot exclude publication bias. Fourth, only few investigators responded to our request for further information and often the information was that the details were lost. Fifth, most trials only reported surrogate outcomes (HBsAg status or anti-HBs level) and not long-term clinical outcomes. Of note is the fact that one trial with long-term follow-up found more patients with chronic hepatitis in the PDV plus hepatitis B immunoglobulin group compared with the PDV group (<LINK REF="STD-Ip-1989-AC" TYPE="STUDY">Ip 1989 AC</LINK>). Such an increase of chronic hepatitis could be due to contamination of hepatitis B immunoglobulin with hepatitis C virus.</P>
<P>Our results convincingly demonstrate that hepatitis B vaccination reduces hepatitis B infection in newborn infants of hepatitis B surface antigen-positive mothers. We found no significant difference between RV and PDV on hepatitis B infections (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.42). However, a greater number of newborn infants on PDV did not achieve anti-HBs level above 10 IU/L (RR 1.96, 95% CI 1.39 to 2.78). The advantage of RV might be due to the difference in chemical and physical characteristics of the antigens components of the vaccines (<LINK REF="REF-Heijtink-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heijtink 2002</LINK>). RV is the vaccine used in high-income countries due to the fear of human immuno-deficiency virus infection and other infections, including transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (<LINK REF="REF-MacGregor-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacGregor 2004</LINK>). Our finding seems to support the introduction of RVs in clinical practice.</P>
<P>The recommended prevention regimen for immune prophylaxis varies among countries (<LINK REF="REF-David-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">David 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CDC-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 1999</LINK>). Similarly in our included trials, the reported doses and schedules varied substantially (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). In general, we were unable to demonstrate significant differences among different doses, different schedules, and different forms of PDV and RV on hepatitis B occurrence. Furthermore, our subgroup analyses did not show strong associations between timing of injection (within 12, 24, or 48 hours) and magnitude of effects. The number of newborn infants evaluated in these comparisons was small. Therefore, future trials ought to be much larger before equivalence or non-inferiority can be claimed. </P>
<P>Our meta-analyses demonstrated that hepatitis B immunoglobulin alone or when added to hepatitis B vaccine significantly decreased the risk of hepatitis B infection (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.63). A recent non-randomised study reported no benefit of adding hepatitis B immunoglobulin to vaccine in HBeAg-negative mothers (<LINK REF="REF-Yang-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yang 2003</LINK>). In our analysis, only one small trial out of 11 trials included newborn infants of HBeAg-negative mothers (<LINK REF="STD-Xu-1995-AB" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 1995 AB</LINK>). Our subgroup analysis, not surprisingly, did not find any statistically significant difference between newborn infants of HBeAg-negative and of HBeAg-positive mothers. Accordingly, more randomised trials on adding hepatitis B immunoglobulin to vaccine for newborn infants of HBeAg-negative mothers seem warranted. It should be noticed that hepatitis B immunoglobulin, as PDV, has the potential of transmitting blood-borne infections (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>Few trials reported on adverse events. According to what has been reported, hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B immunoglobulin seem safe. These results are in accordance with two recent Cochrane reviews on hepatitis B vaccination for dialysis patients and health-care workers (<LINK REF="REF-Niu-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Niu 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2005</LINK>). Furthermore, several cohort studies found that hepatitis B vaccination is well tolerated and severe adverse events are rare (<LINK REF="REF-ICH-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICH 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Niu-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Niu 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-DuVernoy-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">DuVernoy 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kojouharova-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kojouharova 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lewis-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bohlke-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bohlke 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2003</LINK>). However, one cohort study found that vaccine increased the risk of chronic arthritis and acute ear infections (<LINK REF="REF-Fisher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fisher 2001</LINK>). We are unable to determine if this is a reliable finding due to the methodological weakness of cohort studies (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 1999</LINK>). On the other hand, randomised clinical trials may overlook adverse events due to relatively low numbers of participants and/or poor reporting of adverse events (<LINK REF="REF-Hayashi-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hayashi 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ioannidis-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ioannidis 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Etminan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Etminan 2004</LINK>). Further trials ought to focus on these adverse events following ICH-GCP (<LINK REF="REF-ICH-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICH 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>The risk of perinatal transmission from HBeAg-negative mothers is considered much lower than in HBeAg-positive mothers (<LINK REF="REF-Okada-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Okada 1976</LINK>). If infected, the newborn infants of HBeAg-negative mothers often clear an asymptomatic infection (<LINK REF="REF-Dusheiko-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dusheiko 1998</LINK>). Our findings are mainly based on immune prophylaxis for newborn infants of mothers being HBsAg and HBeAg positive. Evidence from randomised clinical trials is insufficient to either support or refute immune prophylaxis for infants of hepatitis B e antigen negative mothers. The applicability of our findings to mothers negative for HBeAg, which are of high proportions in eg, the States and northern Europe, is therefore limited (<LINK REF="REF-Funk-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Funk 2002</LINK>). </P>
<P>Cost-effectiveness studies indicate that hepatitis B vaccination for newborn infants of HBsAg-positive mothers are cost effective in countries with low (<LINK REF="REF-Bloom-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bloom 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tormans-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tormans 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Da-Villa-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Da Villa 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harris-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harris 2001</LINK>), intermediate, and high prevalence of hepatitis B (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Liu-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Margolis-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Margolis 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sriprakash-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sriprakash 1997</LINK>). We identified no cost-effectiveness studies assessing the effects of adding hepatitis B immunoglobulin to vaccine. As hepatitis B immunoglobulin seems able to reduce the risk of hepatitis B infection, the need to perform cost-effectiveness studies based on randomised trials seems justified.</P>
<P>Two trials examined a new way to prevent vertical transmission of hepatitis B, which could not be included according to our inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2004</LINK>). The two trials randomised pregnant women positive for hepatitis B surface antigen to hepatitis B immunoglobulin versus no intervention before delivery (<LINK REF="REF-Zhu-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhu 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Li-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 2003</LINK>). In the group receiving immunoglobulin, fewer infants were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen at follow-up. The methodological quality of the two trials was low. Furthermore, the mothers are at risk of developing immune complex disease due to hepatitis B immunoglobulin reacting with their own circulating hepatitis B surface antigens. More trials are therefore needed before this intervention should be adopted.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>
<B>HBsAg positive mothers who are HBeAg positive </B>
<BR/>Evidence suggests that hepatitis B vaccine, hepatitis B immunoglobulin, and the combination of hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B immunoglobulin reduce the risk of perinatal transmission of hepatitis B in newborn infants of HBsAg positive mothers who are also positive for HBeAg. However, the optimal treatment regimen remains unclear.</P>
<P>
<B>HBsAg positive mothers who are HBeAg negative</B>
<BR/>There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of hepatitis B vaccine, hepatitis B immunoglobulin, and the combination of hepatitis B vaccine and immunoglobulin in newborn infants of HBsAg postive mother who are HBeAg negative. The number needed to treat to prevent a hepatitis B event is probably much larger than in mothers who are both HBsAg and HBeAg positive.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The potential adverse events related to hepatitis B prophylaxis should be studied further, especially the risk for ear infection and chronic arthritis. The new way of preventing hepatitis B prophylaxis in newborn infants - the hepatitis B immunoglobulin administration to the pregnant mother - need to be examined in randomised clinical trials of high quality. The cost-effectiveness of hepatitis B vaccination and hepatitis B immunoglobulin ought to be further evaluated based on results from randomised clinical trials. Further trials need to examine the effects of hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B immunoglobulin in newborn infants of HBsAg positive mothers who are HBsAg negative. Further trials need to examine the effects of hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B immunoglobulin in preterm infants and low birth-weight infants of HBsAg-positive mothers. Further trials need to examine if hepatitis B vaccine plus multiple hepatitis B immunoglobulin doses is superior to hepatitis B vaccine plus a single dose of hepatitis B immunoglobulin.</P>

<P>1. A protocol for a systematic review on this topic was first published in Issue 2, 1998 of The Cochrane Library and continued to be published until Issue 1, 2004 with a title 'Vaccines for preventing hepatitis B in high risk newborn infants'. The authors, Jefferson TO, Pratt M, Buttery J, and El-Shukri N, have abandoned the systematic review. This necessitated an update of the protocol and the conduct of the review be performed by a new team of reviewers who now consists of Lee C, Gong Y, Brok J, Boxall EH, and Gluud C.<BR/>2. We modified the definition of hepatitis B occurrence as shown in the present review.<BR/>3. In our protocol we demanded that each trial had to assess serological outcome in two and more consecutive blood specimens. We realized that this requirement was not detainable in the majority of the trials. We therefore decided to delete this requirement.</P>
