<P>Immunisation of Rhesus negative women with anti-D after the birth of a Rhesus positive infant reduces the chances of developing Rhesus antibodies.</P>
<P>Mothers and babies may have incompatible blood characteristics (such as Rhesus positive babies and Rhesus negative mothers). After the birth of a Rhesus positive infant, Rhesus negative women are given an injection of anti-D, which aims to prevent the women forming antibodies that would attack the red cells of a Rhesus positive baby in a future pregnancy. Such antibodies may make the baby anaemic and if severe enough can cause the baby to die. This review of six trials, involving over 10,000 women, found that anti-D given to Rhesus negative women within 72 hours of giving birth to a Rhesus positive infant decreased the likelihood of the women developing Rhesus antibodies within six months of the birth and in their next pregnancy.</P>

<P>Six eligible trials compared postpartum anti-D prophylaxis with no treatment or placebo. The trials involved over 10,000 women, but trial quality varied. Anti-D lowered the incidence of RhD alloimmunisation six months after birth (risk ratio (RR) 0.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 0.06), and in a subsequent pregnancy (RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.23). These benefits were seen regardless of the ABO status of the mother and baby, when anti-D was given within 72 hours of birth. Higher doses (up to 200 micrograms) were more effective than lower doses (up to 50 micrograms) in preventing RhD alloimmunisation in a subsequent pregnancy.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-06-04 13:44:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>Rhesus D (RhD) alloimmunisation leading to haemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn remained a major cause of perinatal mortality, morbidity, and long-term disability until the 1970s. With the development of Rhesus immunoglobulin and its evaluation and then utilisation in clinical practice, severe RhD alloimmunisation is rarely seen today. The dramatic reduction in deaths from Rhesus haemolytic disease by the use of postpartum anti-D immunoglobulin has been a major obstetrical achievement. Nevertheless Rhesus haemolytic disease is unlikely to disappear and is still a problem for women and their babies who are affected.</P>
<P>Over 100 years ago, Von Dungern (<LINK REF="REF-Von-Dungern-1900" TYPE="REFERENCE">Von Dungern 1900</LINK>) showed that active immunisation can be prevented in the presence of a passive antibody to a particular antigen. However, it was another 60 years before it was shown that sensitisation to Rhesus positive blood could be prevented by administering anti-D antibody (<LINK REF="REF-Stern-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stern 1961</LINK>). After this pioneering work, studies continued, mainly in the UK and North America (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-1963" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 1963</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Freda-1964" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freda 1964</LINK>) culminating in the clinical trials of Rhesus prophylaxis after childbirth - an international collaborative effort. With anti-D being in short supply in some countries, it is important to be able to determine minimum effective doses (<LINK REF="REF-NHMRC-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHMRC 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>For trials of Rhesus prophylaxis during pregnancy, <I>see</I> the Cochrane review 'Anti-D administration in pregnancy for preventing Rhesus alloimmunisation' (<LINK REF="REF-Crowther-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowther 1999</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2010-05-05 14:14:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In all five trials of postpartum anti-D prophylaxis versus no prophylaxis, Rhesus D (RhD) alloimmunisation was less common six months after birth in women who received anti-D (risk ratio (RR) 0.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 0.12, random-effects model). In the four trials for which data were available, the administration of anti-D immunoglobulin reduced the incidence of RhD alloimmunisation in a subsequent pregnancy, (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.35, random-effects model). These beneficial effects were seen regardless of the ABO status of mother and baby, when anti-D is given within 72 hours of birth. Significant heterogeneity was detected between trials for these outcomes, but no reasons were found to explain this. Use of the random-effects model made little change to the RR or 95% CIs.</P>
<P>In doses available for comparison, 200 ug (1000 international units (IU)) anti-D and above, the risk of sensitisation at six months after delivery (RR 0.04, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.64) and in a subsequent pregnancy were reduced (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.78), compared with no prophylaxis.</P>
<P>Sensitivity analyses, excluding the three trials given a C rating for quality of treatment allocation, did not alter the beneficial results seen.</P>
<P>The data on comparative doses show that up to 50 ug (250 IU) anti-D compared with higher doses up to 200 ug (1000 IU) increased the risk of sensitisation in a subsequent pregnancy. No evidence was seen that a lower dose of 100 ug (500 IU) anti-D was substantially less effective than a higher dose of 150 ug (750 IU) anti-D, although the number of immunisations were few.</P>
<P>
<I>See</I> summary of analyses tables.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Prophylaxis with postpartum anti-D immunoglobulin is effective in reducing the risk of sensitisation after pregnancy and in a subsequent pregnancy irrespective of the ABO status of mother and baby. From these trials, effective prophylaxis is shown when anti-D is given within 72 hours of birth.</P>
<P>The evidence on the optimal amount of anti-D to recommend for prophylaxis is limited. Recommendations in different countries will depend on the relative availability and costs of anti-D, and the costs of laboratory assessments of the volume of feto-maternal haemorrhage. In the UK, postnatal administration of at least 100 ug (500 IU) is recommended (<LINK REF="REF-RCOG" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCOG</LINK>), in Australia 125 ug (625 IU) (<LINK REF="REF-NHMRC-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHMRC 1999</LINK>) and in the USA and parts of Europe 200 ug to 300 ug (1000 IU to 1500 IU). It is generally accepted that 25 ug (125 IU) anti-D protects against 1 ml of fetal anti-D cells or 2 ml of whole blood. Therefore, 100 ug (500 IU) should protect against a feto-maternal haemorrhage of up to 8 ml and 300 ug anti-D against a feto-maternal haemorrhage of up to 30 ml of fetal blood. A feto-maternal haemorrhage of 30 ml or more is uncommon but does occur in up to 0.6% of births (<LINK REF="REF-Zipursky-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zipursky 1977</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is a paucity of information about the attitudes of women towards anti-D prophylaxis and the health of infants in subsequent pregnancies. No adverse effects of the treatment are reported, though risks of rare adverse effects of sensitivity reactions and transmission of infectious diseases remain possible.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Anti-D, given within 72 hours after childbirth, reduces the risk of Rhesus D alloimmunisation in Rhesus negative women who have given birth to a Rhesus positive infant.<BR/> <BR/>The clear results of this review support the policy of giving anti-D immunoglobulin prophylaxis within 72 hours (irrespective of ABO status) to all Rhesus negative women, without anti-D antibodies, who give birth to a Rhesus positive baby or a baby whose Rhesus status cannot be determined.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>No further placebo controlled trials are warranted to establish the effectiveness of anti-D given within 72 hours after birth. </P>
<P>As the evidence on the optimal amount of anti-D to recommend for postpartum prophylaxis is limited, further good quality comparative trials would be appropriate. In particular, the cost-effectiveness of smaller doses of anti-D immunoglobulin, combined with screening for the degree of feto-maternal haemorrhage and administering additional anti-D as necessary, should be compared with the use of larger doses of anti-D. </P>
<P>In further trials, the attitudes of women towards anti-D prophylaxis and the health of infants born in subsequent pregnancies should be evaluated. Any adverse effects of the treatment, including sensitivity reactions and transmission of infectious diseases, should be documented.</P>
