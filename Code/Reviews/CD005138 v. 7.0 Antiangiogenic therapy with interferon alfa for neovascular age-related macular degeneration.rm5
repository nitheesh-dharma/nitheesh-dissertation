<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Interferon alfa for the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a progressive and degenerative disease of the retina, causing blood vessels to develop under the retina which eventually lead to visual impairment. Antiangiogenic therapy is a new approach to the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration. Interferon is one antiangiogenic agent thought to function by preventing the growth of vascular endothelial cells which help to form these new blood vessels. This review included one randomized controlled trial with 481 participants, all aged over 50 years from 45 different centers. The trial compared interferon alfa therapy to placebo with a follow up of 52 weeks. The proportion of participants who had lost at least three lines of vision at 52 weeks did not differ significantly between the control and treatment groups. The results of the trial were inconclusive and suggested that if anything, the intervention could be harmful. Since several new antiangiogenic interventions are now available, it is unlikely that further studies on interferon alfa can be justified.</P>

<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Antiangiogenic therapy is a new approach to the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration. Interferon alfa is one antiangiogenic agent thought to function by inhibiting the migration and proliferation of vascular endothelial cells. It has been used in the treatment of hepatitis, solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The aim of this review was to investigate interferon alfa as a treatment modality for neovascular age-related macular degeneration. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched and identified trials from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register, in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (Issue 3, 2007), the National Research Register (Issue 3, 2007), MEDLINE (1966 to July 2007), EMBASE (1980 to July 2007), LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Literature Database) (July 2007) and the reference lists of included studies.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We included randomized controlled trials evaluating interferon alfa therapy in people with neovascular age-related macular degeneration who were followed for at least one year.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Both review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. No data synthesis was conducted as only one trial met the inclusion criteria.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>The one included trial enrolled and randomized 481 participants from 45 centers worldwide into four groups. The study allowed for analysis of the number of participants who had lost three or more lines of vision at 52 weeks in three interferon alfa-2a groups versus placebo. The results show an odds ratio of 1.60 (95% Confidence Interval 1.01 to 2.53) indicating that interferon is associated with a 60% increased odds of losing three or more lines at 52 weeks. This finding is marginally statistical with a P value of 0.04 and indicates that the treatment has the potential for harm rather than benefit.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>At present there is not enough evidence to recommend the use of interferon alfa-2a for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Introduction</HEADING>
<P>Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a progressive and degenerative disease of the retina. The two major types of AMD are non-neovascular and neovascular AMD. This review is concerned with neovascular AMD. The hallmark of this type of AMD is choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Choroidal neovascularization is the process by which a vascular membrane originating in the choroid grows under and through the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and Bruch's membrane to spread beneath the retina. These vessels may leak and bleed causing exudative or hemorrhagic retinal detachments, or both. The process usually evolves into a fibrous scar which replaces the outer layers of the retina, the RPE, and the choriocapillaris. The scarring of the retina results in greatly diminished visual function.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Epidemiology</HEADING>
<P>Age-related macular degeneration increases in prevalence with age and is the leading cause of irreversible vision loss in the elderly (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 1995</LINK>). While the non-neovascular type is much more common, it is the neovascular type that is responsible for the most serious loss of vision. Neovascular AMD occurs in only 10% of people with AMD, yet 80% of those with severe visual loss (less than 20/200 Snellen acuity) have the neovascular form (<LINK REF="REF-Leibowitz-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leibowitz 1980</LINK>).</P>
<P>Population-based epidemiologic studies have shown that neovascular AMD is rare before 55 years of age and becomes more common in persons older than 75 (<LINK REF="REF-Friedman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedman 2004</LINK>). In the population-based Beaver Dam Eye Study, the 10-year incidence of neovascular AMD was 1.4% in those 43 to 54 years of age increasing to 4.1% in people over 75 years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Klein-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 2002</LINK>). Data from recent studies have confirmed clinical observations of a higher prevalence of neovascular AMD and geographic atrophy in white people compared with black people (<LINK REF="REF-Friedman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedman 2004</LINK>). Few population studies exist comparing other racial and ethnic populations for incidence and prevalence of AMD. As life expectancy rises in the next few decades, the number of people affected by this age-related blinding disease is projected to increase.</P>
<P>Besides age and family history, few consistent risk factors for AMD have been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Friedman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedman 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Piguet-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Piguet 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seddon-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seddon 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Silvestri-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silvestri 1994</LINK>). Cigarette smoking, hypertension, and cataract surgery appear to increase the risk of progression to neovascular AMD (<LINK REF="REF-AREDS-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">AREDS 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Friedman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedman 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mitchell-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitchell 2002</LINK>). The effect of stopping smoking and reducing blood pressure in hypertension on the progression of disease is not known (<LINK REF="REF-Friedman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedman 2004</LINK>). There are no studies to show that modifiable factors such as lipid levels, light exposure, or alcohol intake put people at greater risk in developing AMD. While the Age-Related Eye Disease study (<LINK REF="REF-AREDS-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">AREDS 2001</LINK>) has shown possible benefit of antioxidant-zinc supplementation in reducing blindness due to AMD, there remains a significant population of persons at risk in whom no preventive approaches can, as yet, be recommended.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Presentation and diagnosis</HEADING>
<P>Neovascular age-related macular degeneration usually affects one eye at a time. The symptoms of AMD are metamorphopsia (distortions while looking at objects), scotomata (missing spots) and blurry vision. Individuals with AMD may be unaware of the change in their vision or may note difficulty with normal activities such as reading and writing, watching television, driving and recognizing faces. If AMD affects only one eye, visual loss may go undetected until monocular testing at routine eye examinations or by chance occlusion of the better eye. Frequently, people are unaware that their disturbed binocular vision is caused by changes in only one eye.</P>
<P>The diagnosis of AMD can be made clinically and with the help of imaging such as angiography. At the onset of symptoms fundus examination often reveals subretinal exudation of fluid, lipid, or blood. Fluorescein angiography may be necessary to detect subtle exudation in some patients with a recent change in vision. Choroidal neovascularization has several characteristic patterns on fluorescein angiography. Classic CNV is defined as a well-demarcated area with early hyperfluorescence and increasing fluorescein leakage on late frames of the angiogram. Occult CNV occurs in the two patterns of fibrovascular pigment epithelial detachment (PED) and late leakage of an undetermined source.</P>
<P>Two other tests may aid in studying patients with neovascular AMD: indocyanine green angiography images the choroidal circulation better than fluorescein and may show 'hot' spots under the RPE that are amenable to treatment. Optical coherence tomography (OCT), a non-invasive imaging modality, shows cross-sectional images of the retina, RPE, and choroid. Recent papers define the characteristic appearance of the different stages of the disease process on OCT (<LINK REF="REF-Ting-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ting 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Kerckhoven-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Kerckhoven 2001</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Treatment options</HEADING>
<P>Currently there is no cure for neovascular AMD. Therapy options are based on angiographic pathology appearance; whether the AMD includes classic or occult lesions. Treatments most frequently used for neovascular AMD include argon green laser photocoagulation and photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, laser photocoagulation used to obliterate neovascularization causes full thickness retinal burns and, in the case of subfoveal lesions, leads to immediate vision loss. Lesions that are treated with thermal laser need to be well-defined extrafoveal or juxtafoveal membranes to avoid producing a central scotoma. Only a small percentage of patients with exudative neovascular AMD fit the criteria for argon laser treatment and those that can undergo laser treatment experience a 50% recurrence rate (<LINK REF="REF-MPSG-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">MPSG 1991</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Photodynamic therapy was designed to treat CNV without damaging the overlying retina. This more selective treatment is advantageous for subfoveal lesions. A photosensitizing drug is injected intravenously and this preferentially adheres to the CNV. Focusing a non-thermal laser light on the patient's CNV activates the dye. The highlighted CNV vessels are preferentially occluded when treated with the appropriate laser dose without permanent damage to the adjacent choroid and retina. Photodynamic therapy with verteporfin (Visudyne) has been approved by the Food and Drugs Association (FDA) in the US to treat classic subfoveal CNV. However, only approximately one third of all patients with neovascular AMD have classic subfoveal CNV. More than 90% of these patients require retreatment after three months and most need multiple treatments during the first year (<LINK REF="REF-TAP-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">TAP 1999</LINK>). A Cochrane review of PDT is published in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Wormald-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wormald 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Antiangiogenic therapy is a new approach to the treatment of neovascular AMD. Angiogenesis is a complex process that results in new blood vessel formation. This process requires interactions between different factors that can be either stimulatory or inhibitory. These factors have been identified in CNV formation in animal models and human tissue (<LINK REF="REF-Aiello-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aiello 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kvanta-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kvanta 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lopez-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lopez 1996</LINK>). Antiangiogenic treatments work by either blocking stimulatory factors or promoting the inhibitory ones. One of the potential antiangiogenic treatments is interferon therapy. Interferon functions as an antiangiogenic agent by inhibiting the migration and proliferation of vascular endothelial cells (<LINK REF="REF-Brouty_x002d_Boye-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brouty-Boye 1980</LINK>). Interferon alfa has been shown to inhibit iris neovascularization in animal models (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1993</LINK>). It has also been used in the treatment of hepatitis, solid tumors, and hematologic malignancies in humans (<LINK REF="REF-Baron-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baron 1991</LINK>). Antiangiogenic therapies provide a promising means of treating AMD. A Cochrane review of antiangiogenic therapy with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) modalities for AMD has been published (<LINK REF="REF-Vedula-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vedula 2008</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Types of participants</HEADING>
<P>Participants in the trial were people aged over 50 years with neovascular age-related macular degeneration. The participants were enrolled by 45 centers during a nine-month period. The study randomly assigned 481 patients to placebo or to one of three interferon alfa-2a (Roferon-A) groups (1.5 million international units (MIU), 3 MIU, and 6 MIU). The demographic and baseline characteristics of these groups were well balanced. The median age of the participants in the study was 73.1 years (range 50.2 to 89.3 years). The study population comprised 61% female and 39% male patients. The majority of participants (99%) were white. Each group had a similar breakdown of AMD lesion types with 38% to 39% on average being occult, 34% classic, 16% to 18% recurrent, and 10% to 11% hemorrhage. The baseline visual acuity score in number of letters were 55.3 plus or minus 15.0 for the placebo group, 53.4 plus or minus 14.7 for the 1.5 MIU treatment group, 56.2 plus or minus 14.4 for the 3 MIU treatment group, and 54.6 plus or minus 14.8 for the 6 MIU group.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Types of intervention</HEADING>
<P>The trial compared interferon alfa-2a at concentrations of 1.5 MIU, 3 MIU, and 6 MIU to placebo. The test medication was provided either as 1 ml sterile solution or lyophilized powder together with ampules of 1 ml of sterile water for reconstitution of the medication.

<P>The primary outcome used in the trial was visual acuity change, defined as a loss of at least three lines of vision measured at the end of 52 weeks. Visual acuity testing was performed by the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study protocol (Snellen equivalent). Adverse effects were reported but no other outcome measures of interest to this review were reported.</P>

</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>The randomization procedure for the trial was done through a centralized randomization system for all the centers by an independent biostatistical center in Belgium (International Institute for Drug Development). Randomization occurred with the use of a computer program that used a minimization algorithm that accounted for the center and lesion type to evenly distribute variables across all four treatment groups. The allocation concealment as described for this process seemed adequate as randomization was centrally performed and data were monitored by a centralized data-entry center. No further information was provided about the randomization or concealment process. No information was provided about how soon after randomization treatment was provided.</P>
<P>Participants, care providers, and outcome assessors were all masked. </P>
<P>Losses to follow up over the 52 week study period accounted for a total of 18.8% of the study population (12% placebo group, 16% 1.5 MIU interferon group, 22% 3 MIU group, and 26% 6 MIU group). The authors of the article provided only percentages for the losses to follow up. Calculation of approximate participant numbers are as follows - 14/119 in placebo group, 20/122 in the 1.5 MIU group, 26/119 in the 3 MIU group, and 32/121 in the 6 MIU group. These losses may have altered the results found in the study, as losses accounted for up to 26% of the results of a treatment group. Additionally, losses accrued through the weeks, with 7% total data missing at week 12, 12% missing at week 24, and 15% missing at week 36. The analysis of visual acuity outcome was reported for participants for whom complete outcome data were available. </P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Visual acuity</HEADING>
<P>The proportion of participants who had lost at least three lines of vision at 52 weeks did not differ significantly between the control group and the three treatment groups combined (P = 0.06). Pairwise comparisons of the control group and each treatment group did not differ for the 1.5 MIU and 3 MIU treatment groups, with a statistically significant difference found only for the 6 MIU group in favor of the placebo (P = 0.02). This value is statistically significant but must also be considered within the setting of 26% of participants from this group not available for follow up and not included in the analysis, which could have skewed the results toward or away from therapy. (<I>See</I> '<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>'.)</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-PTMDSG-1997" TYPE="STUDY">PTMDSG 1997</LINK> study allowed for analysis of interferon alfa-2a participants in all three treatment groups versus placebo for number of participants who had lost three or more lines of vision at 52 weeks based on the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study protocol with Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study charts. In evaluating visual acuity, participants were asked to read charts and could receive maximum credit of 17 lines with credit given for the smallest line read with one or no errors. From the follow-up measurement the lines of change from the baseline measurement was then determined. Visual acuity scores were also then determined on the basis of exact number of letters read with a maximum credit of 85 letters. The results show an odds ratio of 1.60 (95% confidence interval 1.01 to 2.53) indicating that interferon is associated with a 60% increased odds of losing three or more lines at 52 weeks. This finding is marginally significant with a P value of 0.04 and relates to the treatment having the potential for harm rather than benefit. Individual analyses of the different interferon dosages were not done as only percentages rather than actual patient numbers were reported.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Subgroup analyses</HEADING>
<P>No significant differences were found for any of the subgroup analyses controlling for lesion type (classic, occult, recurrent, or hemorrhage), baseline visual acuity (20/64 or better versus worse than 20/64), or age of CNV at time of treatment (onset of four months or more versus onset of less than four months). Subgroup analysis of US centers versus non-US centers was performed which showed no evidence of treatment effect in the US centers as a group but did find a significant difference (P = 0.03) favoring the control group for patients entered in the non-US centers.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Adverse events</HEADING>
<P>Safety evaluations from the report of adverse events showed a high percentage of participants who experienced at least one adverse event, with a greater percentage as treatment dosage increased. The placebo group also experienced a high adverse event rate with 86% reporting at least one event. For the interferon alfa-2a treatment groups, 93% of the 1.5 MIU group, 94% of the 3 MIU group, and 98% of the 6 MIU group reported at least one event. The types of adverse events ranged from ophthalmic side effects to systemic effects and a range of severity with most being mild to moderate. Signs of interferon-associated retinopathy, or retinal hemorrhage and/or cotton-wool spots, were noted in participants given placebo and treatment. Retinal hemorrhages were noted in one participant taking placebo (1%), two participants in the 1.5 MIU interferon alfa-2a group (2%), two participants in the 3 MIU group (2%), and six participants in the 6 MIU group (5%). Cotton-wool spots were noted in no participants given placebo, one participant in the 1.5 MIU interferon alfa-2a group (1%), three participants in the 3 MIU group (3%), and six participants in the 6 MIU group (5%). Other adverse events were characterized as general without specific complaints for analysis and involved nervous system, cardiovascular, endocrine, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, psychiatric, and skin disorders.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The one randomized, controlled trial included in this review investigated the effect of interferon alfa-2a therapy at three doses (1.5 MIU, 3 MIU, and 6 MIU) as compared to placebo for one year in patients with neovascular AMD. The results of the study do not support the use of interferon in the treatment of AMD, relating potential harm rather than benefit of the therapy. </P>
<P>The strengths of the study are its size and methodological quality. The limitation of the trial is the percentage of participants lost to follow up, with up to one-fourth of participants in the 6 MIU treatment group and 18.8% participants overall being lost to follow up. This reflects some degree of potential skewing of the results since the reason why participants did not present for follow up is not known. One thought is that many participants experienced side effects with placebo and treatment, with a greater number of participants in the higher dose treatment groups experiencing side effects. These participants also tended to report more severe side effects associated with therapy. Another consideration for the large loss to follow up may be the treatment frequency of injections three times a week for one year. Patients may not have been able to donate the time necessary to maintaining therapy. </P>
<P>Two published trials examining interferon alfa-2a therapy for neovascular age-related macular degeneration were excluded from the review due to follow-up periods of less than 52 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Engler-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Engler 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Poliner-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Poliner 1993</LINK>). We did not formally assess the quality of these studies or contact the authors for additional information or verification of data. <LINK REF="STD-Engler-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Engler 1994</LINK> reported the results of a double-masked, placebo-controlled trial of interferon alfa-2a for subfoveal and juxtafoveal choroidal neovascularization. A dosage of 3 MIU of interferon or a matched placebo was administered subcutaneously for a period of eight weeks. The measured outcome of distance visual acuity showed a between-group difference favoring the treatment group (P = 0.023). The results of this short study showed promising prospects for interferon therapy after eight weeks. <LINK REF="STD-Poliner-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Poliner 1993</LINK> studied the effects of interferon alfa-2a on subfoveal subretinal neovascularization secondary to AMD. The results by the six-month follow-up visit showed no difference in visual acuity, average macular sensitivities, or extent of neovascularization. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>At present there is not enough evidence to recommend the use of interferon alfa-2a for the treatment of neovascular AMD.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Based on the data from a single prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial interferon alfa-2a therapy does not seem to be beneficial for CNV secondary to AMD. The trial is viewed as the definitive study on interferon alfa-2a therapy for CNV secondary to AMD. However, it is possible that the results of this one study do not reflect the true effect of interferon on the progression of AMD, especially as a sizeable minority of participants were unavailable for follow up. To provide a definitive answer to the question of the effect of interferon alfa-2a on neovascular AMD we would need to include more trials in this review. These trials have not been done and are now unlikely to be done. Other antiangiogenic methods show promise for the treatment of AMD. </P>

<PUBLIC_NOTES>
<P>As it is unlikely that new trials using interferon will be published in the future due to a shift towards using antiangiogenic treatment, this review will no longer be updated and the results will remain unchanged.</P>
<P>After considering comments from the editorial team of the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group and from external peer reviewers, during both protocol and review development, the authors have declined to include trials with less than 52 weeks of follow up.</P>
<P>Two relevant studies with less than 52 weeks of follow up have therefore been excluded from the review. The results of these trials are presented in the Discussion. The authors of this review did not formally assess the quality of these studies and did not contact the study authors for further information or verification of the data.</P>

<P>Country: US and international centers.<BR/>Age: 72.9 +/- 7.2 (6 MIU); 73.1 +/- 7.1 (3 MIU); 73.3 +/- 7.4 (1.5 MIU); 73.0 +/- 7.0 (placebo).<BR/>Gender (M/F): 48/73 (6 MIU); 51/68 (3 MIU); 44/78 (1.5 MIU); 46/73 (placebo).<BR/>Inclusion criteria: clinical signs of exudated ARMD with subfoveal involvement; CNV defined as primary classic subfoveal CNV; occult CNV with foveal involvement; recurrent classic subfoveal CNV; any of the above with blood encompassing the fovea; best-corrected VA &gt;= 20/320 by ETDRS; age over 50; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1; written consent.<BR/>Exclusion criteria: CNV &gt; 12 macular photocoagulation study disc areas by fluorescein angiography; additional eye disease that could compromise VA; history of class III or IV CVD; significant other systemic disease; current use of other investigational new drugs, cytokines, or systemic corticosteroids within 4 weeks before start of study treatment; diabetes with poor control or retinopathy.<BR/>Equivalence of baseline characteristics: yes.</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Treatment: Interferon alfa-2a 1.5 MIU, 3 MIU, and 6 MIU given 3 times per week for 1 year.<BR/>Control: placebo which was identical in appearance (lyophilized powder).<BR/>Duration of follow up: 52 weeks.<BR/>Length of follow up: planned - 52 weeks; actual - same.<BR/>
</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>Visual acuity (EDTRS chart =&gt; 3 lines lost and &gt;= 15 letters lost).<BR/>Eye examined for the outcome: entered in study.<BR/>Intervals at which outcome assessed: weeks 12, 24, 36, 52.<BR/>Other issues with outcome assessment: None.<BR/>Reported adverse effects: <BR/>Ophthalmic - signs of interferon-associated retinopathy (retinal hemorrhage and/or cotton-wool spots);<BR/>Body systems - body as a whole (fatigue, flu-like symptoms), gastro-intestinal (nausea, diarrhea, appetite loss), CNS/PNS (headache, dizziness, chills). Percentages of patients who experienced side effects increased with dose. 86% of patients in the placebo group experienced at least 1adverse event. 93% of patients in the 1.5 MIU group, 94% in the 3 MIU group, and 98% in the 6 MIU group reported at least 1 adverse event. <BR/>Reported quality of life indicators: none.</P>
</CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<CHAR_NOTES>
<P>Funding: Hoffmann-La Roche, Nutley, NJ; Hoffmann-La Roche AG, Basel, Switzerland; Macular Foundation, Inc., NY, NY.<BR/>Study population: healthy.<BR/>Study period: 52 weeks.<BR/>Reported power calculation: no.<BR/>Subgroup analysis reported: no difference in analyses controlling for lesion type, US centers versus European and other non-US centers (treatment effect in non-US was significant), VA at baseline stratification, adjustment for age of CNV at time of treatment. A significant difference favoring the placebo group was seen when the analysis was limited to patients in the non-US centers.<BR/>Notes on interventions, outcomes, conclusion of the authors: none.</P>
