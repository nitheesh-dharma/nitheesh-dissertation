<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-10-04 10:36:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>This review of 32 studies (6597 women) looks at assisted or instrumental vaginal deliveries in women in the second stage of labour. The importance of this review is due to the fact that Instrumental delivery is a frequent intervention in childbirth and in some cases may result in harmful outcomes for either mother or baby or both.</P>
<P>The main comparisons are between the forceps or the ventouse. There are also comparisons between different types of ventouse. The outcomes which are analysed are the success of the particular instrument in achieving the delivery and the rate of complications for both mother and baby. Not all studies considered all outcomes, and in particular, there were differences in the types of complications encountered by mothers and babies. In addition, we identified no studies for some comparisons.</P>
<P>The results showed that the forceps was the better instrument in terms of achieving a successful delivery. However, it was also associated with higher rates of complications for the mother. These were perineal trauma, tears, requirements for pain relief and incontinence. There were risks of injury to the baby with both types of instrument.</P>
<P>Comparisons between different types of ventouse revealed that the metal cup was better at achieving successful delivery than the soft cup,.but with more risk of injury to the baby. There were no significant differences between the handheld and the standard vacuum.</P>
<P>Decisions as to which instrument is best will, therefore, depend upon individual situations where the urgency with which the baby needs to be delivered will be balanced against potential risks to the mother and baby.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-10-05 11:20:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 32 studies (6597 women) in this review. Forceps were less likely than the ventouse to fail to achieve a vaginal birth with the allocated instrument (risk ratio (RR) 0.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45 to 0.94). However, with forceps there was a trend to more caesarean sections, and significantly more third- or fourth-degree tears (with or without episiotomy), vaginal trauma, use of general anaesthesia, and flatus incontinence or altered continence. Facial injury was more likely with forceps (RR 5.10, 95% CI 1.12 to 23.25). Using a random-effects model because of heterogeneity between studies, there was a trend towards fewer cases of cephalhaematoma with forceps (average RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.11).<BR/>
</P>
<P>Among different types of ventouse, the metal cup was more likely to result in a successful vaginal birth than the soft cup, with more cases of scalp injury and cephalhaematoma. The hand-held ventouse was associated with more failures than the metal ventouse, and a trend to fewer than the soft ventouse.</P>
<P>Overall forceps or the metal cup appear to be most effective at achieving a vaginal birth, but with increased risk of maternal trauma with forceps and neonatal trauma with the metal cup.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-09-13 10:18:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>There is a recognised place for forceps and all types of ventouse in clinical practice. The role of operator training with any choice of instrument must be emphasised. The increasing risks of failed delivery with the chosen instrument from forceps to metal cup to hand-held to soft cup vacuum, and trade-offs between risks of maternal and neonatal trauma identified in this review need to be considered when choosing an instrument. </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-10-06 14:48:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>Instrumental or 'assisted' vaginal birth is a frequently and widely practiced obstetric intervention, accounting for 11% of births in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-DOH-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">DOH 2004</LINK>). There are variations in obstetric and midwifery practice worldwide which influence the rates of instrumental or assisted vaginal birth. Maternal position in both the first and second stage of labour may have an effect, albeit a small one, on assisted birth rates. Use of any upright or lateral position when compared with supine or lithotomy position is associated with a small reduction in assisted births (<LINK REF="REF-Gupta-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 2004</LINK>). Immersion in water in the first stage of labour is not associated with a difference in assisted vaginal birth rates (<LINK REF="REF-Cluett-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cluett 2002</LINK>). Continuous maternal support in labour decreases the likelihood of an assisted birth as well as increasing maternal satisfaction with the birth experience (<LINK REF="REF-Hodnett-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodnett 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are widespread procedural variations in assisted vaginal birth that depend on many factors. Operator choice is foremost among these, and this in itself is governed by the clinical scenario, local practice, geographical location, and occasionally consumer preference. The clinical indications for an assisted birth take into account maternal and fetal wellbeing. Maternal indications include exhaustion following prolonged labour, failure to progress in the second stage of labour, and medical conditions such as pre-eclampsia, placental abruption, or acquired or congenital heart disease. Fetal indications are fetal distress in the second stage of labour due either to the maternal condition or occurring independently of it. Other factors which must be taken into account are the station and position of the presenting part, moulding of the fetal head, comfort, morale and co-operation of the mother, as well as experience of the operator and the availability of the necessary equipment. Forceps are classified according to whether traction alone or rotation of the fetal head is required. Vacuum cups may be either metal, plastic or silicone. Again they are classified according to whether rotation of the fetal head is required into posterior cups or anterior cups (<LINK REF="REF-Chalmers-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalmers 1989</LINK>). Forceps may be associated with increased maternal analgesic requirements, increased perineal trauma and episiotomy rates, as well as fetal facial and scalp injuries. Vacuum extraction may be associated with lower rates of perineal trauma but leads to fetal chignon and cephalhematoma. From a maternal viewpoint assisted vaginal birth, especially when associated with severe perineal trauma, may result in a negative psychological effect. Many women experience a sense of personal failure which subsequently delays bonding and impacts on the entire family dynamics. On the other hand, some women may view assisted vaginal birth as preferable to caesarean section. Birth preferences are variable between individuals and may be influenced by cultural backgrounds. In some low-income settings, caesarean section is considered a failure, and having an assisted birth may, by avoiding a caesarean section, help maintain the woman's status within her community.</P>
<P>Historically, the obstetric forceps, which preceded the development of the ventouse by many decades, was the primary instrument used, and in many settings this is still the case. However, more recently this has been superceded by the ventouse in some countries (<LINK REF="REF-Bofill-1996b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bofill 1996b</LINK>). In the United Kingdom there has been an increasing use of vacuum compared to forceps (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Connell-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Connell 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Patel-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 2004</LINK>). The result is that the experience and skill base of practitioners may be limited by the setting in which they have been trained. Where the clinician has access to more than one type of instrument, their choice is determined by the clinical scenario in terms of examination findings and, where maternal or fetal compromise is anticipated, the speed with which delivery must be effected.</P>
<P>The choice of instrument for assisted vaginal birth may be limited by the clinical circumstances. For example, for face presentation and aftercoming head of the breech, forceps but not ventouse may be used (<LINK REF="REF-Patel-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 2004</LINK>); for rotational delivery, rotational forceps or ventouse, but not curved forceps may be used. Ventouse delivery depends on the active participation of the woman to bear down, and may be less appropriate when she is unable to do so (<LINK REF="REF-Patel-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 2004</LINK>). Where more than one instrument is appropriate, the choice should take into account evidence of the relative benefits and risks of the various instruments.</P>
<P>With the introduction of the ventouse, researchers have applied themselves to comparing it with forceps in order to address questions as to which may be the superior instrument. Outcomes which have been measured include both maternal morbidity and neonatal morbidity and mortality. The former include immediate events such as rates of perineal trauma, episiotomies, blood loss and analgesic requirements as well as long-term morbidities including faecal and urinary continence and dyspareunia. Neonatal outcomes include Apgar scores, admissions to neonatal intensive care, and neonatal death as well as a wide range of birth injuries. In addition to the wide variety of outcomes, there are also variations in the type of instruments used, that is, rotational or outlet forceps and soft or rigid cup vacuum devices.</P>
<P>There are two basic designs of forceps: the straight forceps (eg Kjelland's) which may be used for rotational births, and several designs of curved forceps which cannot be rotated as the pelvic curve of the forceps needs to be aligned to the curve of the woman's pelvis. 'Soft' forceps may have the fetal aspect of the blades padded with pliable polyurethane pads with self-adhesive backing (<LINK REF="STD-Hebertson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Hebertson 1985</LINK>) or the blades covered with a permanent soft rubber coating (<LINK REF="STD-Roshan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Roshan 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>A further consideration is that of training and competency with the chosen instrument. Current educational methodology promotes the use of skills and drills scenarios employing mannequins and models to teach clinical skills. For example, most postgraduate deaneries in the United Kingdom require evidence of such training as this forms part of the trainees' core log-book of clinical skills. Thus, methods to achieve, evaluate and maintain competency in assisted vaginal delivery need to be addressed. A high rate of inappropriate placement of the vacuum cup has been cited as a reason for re-addressing training needs (<LINK REF="REF-Sau-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sau 2004</LINK>). Improved safety for mother and baby has been reported following formal postgraduate education and training on assisted birth (<LINK REF="REF-Cheong-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheong 2004</LINK>). This methodology is now being promoted in low-income countries as both UK training programmes, namely Management of Emergency Obstetrics and Trauma (MOET) and Advanced Life Support in Obstetrics (ALSO), as well as those developed specifically for low-income countries, Emergency Maternal and Child Health (EMCH), are now being delivered in such countries. Furthermore 'ownership' of future training in this area is being transferred to workers in these countries by supplementing the courses with a programme of teaching the teachers through a generic instructors' course. A teaching video programme on vacuum extraction is included on the World Health Organization Reproductive Health Library (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-RHL" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO RHL</LINK>).</P>
<P>Given that childbirth is essentially a normal rather than a pathological event, where possible, consumer choice and informed consent should influence practice. Since the publication of <I>Changing Childbirth</I> (<LINK REF="REF-DOH-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">DOH 1993</LINK>) and, more recently <I>Maternity Matters</I> (<LINK REF="REF-DOH-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">DOH 2007</LINK>), user representatives have joined all maternity service groups in the UK, and modern obstetric practice thereby demands that views of all stakeholders be considered in decision making.</P>
<P>The use of epidural analgesia may affect the choice of instrument. For example, differences in analgesic needs are less relevant once effective analgesia is already in place.</P>
<P>Assisted birth in some low- and middle-income country settings may have setting-specific constraints. For example, black African women have a high incidence of contracted pelvis (<LINK REF="REF-Cox-1963" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cox 1963</LINK>). Juveniles below the age of 16 have been shown to have smaller pelves than older women (<LINK REF="REF-Aiman-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aiman 1976</LINK>), and juveniles in a population with a high incidence of contracted pelvis were found to be at high risk of obstetric complications (<LINK REF="REF-Fisk-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fisk 1989</LINK>). In low- and middle-income country settings, caesarean section may be unavailable, or less readily resorted to because of high maternal morbidity and mortality from caesarean section, and the risks of a scarred uterus in future pregnancies when women may labour at home. In these circumstances, assisted birth may be used to overcome relative cephalopelvic disproportion, in the common situation of a small, android pelvis, considerable moulding of the fetal skull, and frequently a persistent occipito-posterior or occipito-transverse position. Evidence from trials in well-resourced settings may not necessarily be applicable to these settings. Vacuum birth may also be used in combination with symphysiotomy when caesarean section is unsafe or unavailable (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2005</LINK>). The trend to reduced prevalence of assisted vaginal birth, for example in sub-Sahara Africa, in recent years, may be related to declining skills and availability of equipment.</P>
<P>Another important issue in some low- and middle-income country settings is the high prevalence of HIV infections and the fact that many women do not have access to or decline to undergo testing. The potential for precipitating mother-to-child transmission of viral infections needs to be taken into account. There is observational evidence to suggest that transmission of herpes simplex virus (HSV) from mother to child is facilitated by vacuum extraction. In a retrospective study, the prevalence of neonatal HSV infection in vacuum-assisted births was 7/1000 live births as compared to 0.95/1000 in infants delivered normally or by caesarean section (risk ratio 7.45; 95% confidence interval 1.99 to 27.42). HSV infection occurred at the site of the ventouse application in 5/11 neonates (<LINK REF="REF-Kohelet-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kohelet 2004</LINK>). Laceration of the fetal scalp by vacuum extraction technique may enhance the acquisition and the early appearance of cutaneous infection in infants exposed to HSV shedding in the genital tract of asymptomatic mothers, as the virus gains access through the lacerated scalp. We could not find data relating to vertical transmission of HIV and instrumental birth. Theoretically, it seems possible that any procedure which breaches the skin of the fetus or neonate may increase the risk of transmission. Soft vacuum cups would in theory be expected to be less harmful than rigid cups in this respect. Scalp laceration has been identified in 0.7% of caesarean sections (<LINK REF="REF-Alexander-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alexander 2006</LINK>). However, the well-established reduced risk of HIV transmission during caesarean than vaginal birth suggests that this is not a major source of infection, probably because the amniotic fluid is usually not infected and exposure to maternal blood is minimal.</P>
<P>Advantages traditionally claimed for vacuum over forceps birth include:</P>
<OL>
<LI>simpler technique to learn;</LI>
<LI>technique less dependent on accurate assessment of the fetal head position;</LI>
<LI>intrinsic limitation to the amount of force which can be applied;</LI>
<LI>has been widely used by trained midwives in midwife-run maternity units;</LI>
<LI>can be used to promote flexion of a deflexed fetal head (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2004</LINK>).</LI>
</OL>
<P>Disadvantages include:</P>
<OL>
<LI>cannot be used for face presentation, aftercoming head of the breech or preterm births;</LI>
<LI>complex equipment requiring maintenance, and more liable to technical failure;</LI>
<LI>dependent on maternal expulsive efforts to assist birth.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Clinical diagnosis of subdural haematoma following birth may underestimate the true prevalence. A prospective study of asymptomatic neonates found magnetic resonance imaging evidence of subdural haemorrhage in 9/86 neonates born vaginally, with and without instruments (<LINK REF="REF-Whitby-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitby 2004</LINK>). Rare complications of vacuum birth include urethral avulsion (<LINK REF="REF-Singh-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Guidelines for operative birth were approved by the Clinical Practice Obstetrics Committee and Executive and Council of the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (<LINK REF="REF-Cargill-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cargill 2004</LINK>).</P>

<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2010-09-23 18:36:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The objective of this review is to answer the overall question: 'When assisted vaginal birth is needed, which instrument would be best?'. We will review individual vacuum devices or forceps used for assisted vaginal delivery in terms of maternal outcome, neonatal outcome and training requirements. The main questions concerning choice of instrument will therefore fall into three categories, namely:</P>
<UL>
<LI>should forceps or ventouse be used;</LI>
<LI>if it were forceps, which type would be best;</LI>
<LI>if it were ventouse, which type would be best?</LI>

<P>We excluded the <LINK REF="STD-Gabrawi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gabrawi 1997</LINK> study because it looked at extractor pumps rather than maternal and neonatal outcomes.

We excluded a study by <LINK REF="STD-Williams-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1993</LINK> because no outcome data were available on the study group in a significant subset of women, and as such this study was deemed to be incomplete. We excluded the <LINK REF="STD-Ehlers-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Ehlers 1974</LINK> study because of non-randomisation.</P>
<P>We included a total of 32 studies (62 publications, 6597 women) in this review. Of these, 28 studies addressed singleton pregnancies greater than 37 weeks' gestation. Two studies included women greater than 36 weeks' gestation (<LINK REF="STD-Afifi-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Afifi 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dell-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Dell 1985</LINK>).

One study (<LINK REF="STD-Bofill-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Bofill 1996a</LINK>) included women greater than 34 weeks' gestation.</P>
<P>Seventeen studies compared ventouse versus ventouse. Comparisions were made between metal versus soft ventouse cups, between different types of metal cups, different types of soft cup or between the hand held ventouse versus the traditional vacuum device. Thirteen studies compared forceps versus ventouse. Two studies compared soft forceps versus regular forceps.</P>
<P>In the 17 trials that compared ventouse with ventouse, ten compared soft versus metal cup ventouse, and one compared two different types of soft cup (<LINK REF="STD-Warwick-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Warwick 1993</LINK>).

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2010-10-05 08:55:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 32 studies (6597 women) in this review.</P>
<P>These studies included a total of 48 potential outcomes looking at maternal, neonatal and service issues. Conclusions were based on the primary outcomes. The largest group of studies was in the first comparison group, forceps versus ventouse, and addressed all but 14 of the potential outcomes. No studies addressed outcomes pertaining to cost, duration or certification of training.  </P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Forceps versus any type of ventouse</HEADING>
<P>Thirteen studies including 3338 women compared forceps with any type of vacuum birth. Of these the largest group, seven including 2419 women, looked at failure to deliver with the allocated primary instrument. The results showed that failure was less likely with the forceps (risk ratio (RR) 0.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45 to 0.94).</P>
<P>Those studies that reported on caesarean section found a trend to more sections with forceps which was not statistically significant (RR 1.76, 95% CI 0.95 to 3.23). This suggests that failure with the ventouse was more commonly followed by delivery with forceps than vice versa.</P>
<P>Forceps were more likely to be associated with maternal perineal trauma. Ten studies reported on third- and fourth-degree tears and found them more likely to occur in the forceps group irrespective of whether an episiotomy had been carried out (RR 1.89, 95% CI 1.51 to 2.37). Vaginal trauma was assessed in eight papers where 464 women out of a total of 2443 women sustained trauma. This was more likely with forceps (RR 2.48, 95% CI 1.59 to 3.87). Only one study involving 130 women by <LINK REF="STD-Fitzpatrick--2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fitzpatrick 2003</LINK> reported on flatus incontinence/altered continence. This outcome was more likely with forceps (RR 1.77, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.62).  </P>
<P>There was considerable heterogeneity in the relationship between instrument and episiotomy use, which was much more common with forceps in one study and no different in the others. This probably reflects a difference in policy regarding indications for episiotomy in different centres. For this reason, the data were not pooled. Those studies that reported on vulval trauma or episiotomy and perineal tear requiring suturing together, showed no evidence of a difference between the forceps or vacuum. While there was no significant evidence of a difference between the two groups in terms of local analgesia requirements for the procedure, or pain experienced on day four, three studies reported on epidural or spinal use and found a trend to regional analgesia being more likely to be used with forceps than ventouse. General anaesthesia was used more often for forceps births.</P>
<P>There was no difference in blood loss between the two groups.</P>
<P>Neonatal outcomes considered in this group included low Apgars, umbilical pH, neonatal admission or length of stay, as well as death or severe morbidity. There was considerable variation in both study size and quality and the overall result was that there was no significant difference between the two groups for these outcomes. Specific neonatal injuries were also reported. Facial injury outcome was found to be significantly more likely with forceps in three studies (RR 5.10, 95% CI 1.12 to 23.25). Nine studies with 2556 women looked at cephalhaematoma, the most widely reported outcome. There was heterogeneity between studies. Using a random-effects model, there was a trend towards fewer cases with forceps (average RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.11).</P>
<P>Only one study in this group (<LINK REF="STD-Bofill-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Bofill 1996a</LINK>) considered shoulder dystocia but the results, which tended to favour forceps, were not statistically significant. </P>

<P>Ten studies with 1558 women compared the soft anterior cup ventouse with the metal cup. Of these the largest group considered failed delivery with allocated instrument (primary). The results were in favour of the metal cup (eight studies with 1076 women; RR 1.63, 95% CI 1.17 to 2.28). Apart from cephalhaematoma (six studies with 669 women; RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.95) and scalp injury (nine studies with 1517 women; RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.86) which were less likely with the soft cup there was no significant difference in neonatal outcome with either group. There was no significant difference in maternal outcomes, ie caesarean section, episiotomy, perineal and vulval trauma between these two groups.    </P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">5. Hand-held vacuum versus any ventouse</HEADING>
<P>Hand-held vacuum (the Kiwi Omnicup) versus any ventouse was considered in four studies with 886 women. Three compared the Kiwi Omnicup with conventional (metal) vacuum. <LINK REF="STD-Dell-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Dell 1985</LINK> compared the Mityvac with the silastic cup (as part of a three-way comparison with forceps). There was significant heterogeneity of results for the outcome failure to deliver with allocated instrument. This was due to the fact that failure was increased with the hand-held vacuum (kiwi omnicup) versus the metal cup in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Attilakos-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Attilakos 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Groom-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Groom 2006</LINK>) (no failures in either group were recorded by <LINK REF="STD-Nor-Azlin-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Nor Azlin 2008</LINK>), whereas there was a trend to reduced failure with the mityvac versus the silastic cup in the study of <LINK REF="STD-Dell-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Dell 1985</LINK>. Data were not pooled for this outcome. There was also heterogeneity between the two studies with data for the outcome episiotomy. Episiotomy was increased with the Kiwi Omnicup versus metal cup in the study of <LINK REF="STD-Groom-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Groom 2006</LINK>, but not in the study of <LINK REF="STD-Attilakos-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Attilakos 2005</LINK>. This difference may reflect differences in episiotomy policy in the two centres. Two studies reported on caesarean section and found no evidence of a significant difference between the groups.</P>
<P>Jaundice was the only neonatal outcome that differed in the two groups, the results favouring the hand-held ventouse. There were no differences in either maternal or neonatal outcomes, the commonest explanation being insufficient data for assessment as one study had very small numbers. </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">9. Regular forceps versus soft forceps</HEADING>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">11. Any metal cup versus any metal cup (primary)</HEADING>
<P>Different metal cup ventouses were compared in three studies with 627 women. The comparisons were between Malmstrom and O&#8217;Neill cups and between the new generation and original Bird cups. No significant difference was observed in any of the groups in either delivery with primary allocated instrument, or maternal and neonatal outcome.</P>
<P>Despite the large number of studies included in this review there were none that included data for subgroup analysis; hence, we were unable to carry out any subgroup analyses.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-10-05 10:18:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lynn Hampson">
<P>The main thrust of this review consists of two stages of comparisons. Firstly whether forceps or ventouse is the better instrument and secondly which type of ventouse or forceps is preferable.</P>
<P>The original intention of the authors was to carry out subgroup analyses if sufficient data were available in some groups, particularly where differences in practice exist between developed and developing countries, and also with regard to the use of major interventions such as epidural use.</P>
<P>Unfortunately there were insufficient data to facilitate this and so we have not carried out any subgroup analyses.</P>
<P>When considering results the following should be noted.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Not all comparisons included data on all outcomes. We compiled a comprehensive list of potential outcomes, in order not to miss any important events. Very few trials considered more than a few outcomes for either mother or baby. Of the primary outcomes, failed delivery and neonatal trauma were the most frequently reported. Of the secondary outcomes, the most reported were the short-term outcomes. Conclusions were based on the primary outcomes.</LI>
<LI>Where no data were available, we deferred from listing outcomes or comparisons in order to avoid unnecessary graph generation.</LI>
</OL>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Forceps versus ventouse</HEADING>
<P>Forceps were more likely to be successful in achieving 'vaginal birth with the allocated instrument'. On the other hand, caesarean section tended to be more likely in the forceps group. This may be because forceps were more often used following a failed vacuum birth, whereas the vacuum was less often used following failed forceps.</P>
<P>The need for general anaesthesia, and significant maternal trauma such as episiotomy, third- or fourth-degree tears (with or without episiotomy), vulval trauma, vaginal trauma, the need for general anaesthesia and the risk of flatus incontinence or altered continence were more likely with forceps. However, there were no significant differences in the following: vulval trauma, need for suturing, perineal pain (day four) and blood loss.</P>
<P>When considering outcomes for the baby, facial injury was less likely with the ventouse, while there was a trend towards cephalhaematoma being less likely with the forceps.</P>
<P>There was no evidence of statistically significant differences between the instruments in the following complications or interventions: shoulder dystocia, need for intubation, intracranial injury, scalp injury, fracture, neonatal unit length of stay, Apgar score at one minute, Apgar score at five minutes, mean umbilical pH, low Apgar at five minutes, low umbilical artery pH, death or severe morbidity (hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy, organ failure, neonatal intensive care admission longer than seven days), death, use of epidural or spinal analgesia, bruising or low Apgar at one minute, jaundice, retinal haemorrhage or admission to neonatal unit.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Metal versus soft cup ventouse</HEADING>
<P>When comparing different types of ventouse the main emphasis is on metal cup versus soft cup, with the exception of those studies which address the newer hand-held devices and those few studies which compared different metal cup designs. The metal cup was more likely to result in a successful vaginal birth and was less likely to result in a caesarean section. This is not unexpected, as measured traction forces achieved with the metal cup are considerably higher than with the soft cup (<LINK REF="STD-Hofmeyr-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hofmeyr 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>In terms of maternal trauma there was no evidence of difference in the incidence of perineal tears or vaginal trauma between the two instruments.</P>
<P>The outcomes when using the soft cup were more favourable for the following: bruising, cephalhaematomata and scalp injury. There was no evidence of statistically significant differences for low Apgar at five minutes, low Apgar at one minute, bruising, ,jaundice, admission to the neonatal intensive care unit, need for intubation, scalp injury, intracranial injury (small study), neonatal unit length of stay (small study), vulval trauma, low umbilical artery pH or retinal haemorrhage.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Hand-held versus any ventouse</HEADING>
<P>Failure with the allocated instrument was more common with the Kiwi Omnicup than the metal ventouse in two studies (the third study had no failures in either group). This may be due the smaller surface area covered by the Kiwi Omnicup (assuming that the standard 60mm metal cup was the comparator). In one study there was a trend to fewer failures with the Mityvac than the silastic ventouse. This is consistent with the greater traction force achievable with rigid than soft cups.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Metal versus metal and soft versus soft ventouse</HEADING>
<P>These studies either compared the Malmstrom with the O'Neil cup or the new generation with the original Bird cup; or the silicone with the santoprene cup. There was no evidence of statistically significant differences in outcomes. There was a trend to more successful vaginal birth and less cephalhaematoma with the Malmstrom cup and less jaundice with the O'Neil cup.</P>

<P>In general these results show trade-offs between the different instruments, with both advantages and disadvantages in most comparisons. The result is that there can be no simplistic conclusion that one instrument is superior to another. What is important is to be aware of the specific advantages and disadvantages of each instrument, so that the optimal choice can be made for each clinical situation.</P>
<P>It is thus important for clinicians to be trained in the use of a range of instruments, so that appropriate choices can be made.</P>
<P>The trials studied did not directly investigate the benefits of policies involving sequential use of more than one instrument. There is indirect evidence that sequential use of the ventouse followed if necessary by forceps may reduce overall failure (need for caesarean section).</P>
<P>The balance of judgement lies between expediting and achieving a vaginal birth, with the minimum of trauma to both mother and baby. Overall forceps appear to be most effective at achieving a vaginal birth, but with the risk of significant maternal trauma. The metal ventouse cup reduces maternal trauma but increases the risk of cephalhaematoma. The soft vacuum cup reduces the risk of trauma to the baby, but has an increased failure rate.</P>
<P>The discussion cannot be concluded without also taking into account the significant maternal risks of second stage caesarean sections.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-10-05 10:17:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lynn Hampson">
<P>Choice of instrument for assisted vaginal birth remains a controversial topic. The variables which have to be considered are: operator skill, choice of instruments available, and clinical setting. These in themselves are dependant on the working environment and access to emergency caesarean section. There is no guaranteed safe instrument for both mother and baby. There is clear evidence that use of forceps is associated with more need for analgesia, and more maternal injury. Neonatal facial injury was more common with forceps, while cephalhaematoma tended to be more common with vacuum birth. There were no statistically significant differences in other important outcomes. While delivery with the allocated instrument was more common with forceps, the fact that forceps were sometimes used to complete delivery after unsuccessful vacuum birth meant that there was a trend to fewer caesarean sections when the initial instrument used was the vacuum. The metal vacuum cup was more effective but associated with more cephalhaematoma and scalp injury than the soft cup.</P>
<P>For situations in which there is no clear clinical indication for a specific instrument, the findings of this review support the use of vacuum extraction as the first line method for assisted birth. Where a relatively easy procedure is anticipated (for example, occipito-anterior position with no signs of relative cephalopelvic disproportion), the soft vacuum has the advantage of less scalp injury and cephalhaematoma. For women who are infected or at high risk for infection with viral infections such as HIV and hepatitis, the risk of scalp injury with the metal vacuum cup is a particular cause for concern, and would favour the use of soft vacuum cup or forceps. For occipito-lateral or occipito-posterior positions or where the need for greater traction force is anticipated, the metal vacuum cup has advantages.</P>
<P>There is a recognised place for both forceps and all types of ventouse in clinical practice. The role of operator training with any choice range of instruments must be emphasised. A video teaching program on use of the vacuum extractor is available on the World Health Organization Reproductive Health Library (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-RHL" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO RHL</LINK>). Changing patterns of obstetric care, in particular availability and acceptability of caesarean section, will undoubtedly influence future practice.</P>

<OL>
<LI>Transmission of infection, e.g. HIV, hepatitis and herpes simplex virus. In particular, the assumption that forceps and soft vacuum cups may be safer in this respect than the rigid vacuum cups needs to be assessed in randomised trials.</LI>
