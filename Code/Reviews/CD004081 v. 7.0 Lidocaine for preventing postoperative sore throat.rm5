<P>New authors have joined the review team.</P>
<P>In general, our updated review reaches the same conclusion as the original published review (<LINK REF="REF-Tanaka-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tanaka 2009</LINK>). However, we have included four new trials and thus have more precise estimates on the effectiveness of both topical and systemic lidocaine for preventing the risk and reducing the severity of postoperative sore throat. Furthermore we applied several sensitivity and subgroup analyses which generally supported the overall results. The summary reflects the high quality of studies and any variations in the results were not statistically significant.</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-07-07 14:43:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We reviewed the evidence of the effect of lidocaine for preventing a sore throat in people following an operation under general anaesthetic. (General anaesthetics are medicines used to send people asleep. They can be given via an intravenous line (IV) into the person's veins, via a mask, or via an endotracheal tube placed through the mouth past the larynx (voicebox) into the trachea. In this review the anaesthetic was given via an endotracheal tube.)<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Sore throat is a common side-effect of having a general anaesthetic. It is usually caused by the endotracheal tube that is inserted through a person's mouth, placed in the airway, to keep their airway open and make sure that person is breathing properly. People sometimes buck and cough when the tube is inserted in their airway and even if they do not, the presence of the tube during the operation can give them a sore throat. It may be possible to use drugs, such as the local anaesthetic lidocaine, to prevent postoperative sore throat. (A local anaesthetic prevents a person feeling pain. It is given to one specific area rather than the whole body.)</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence is current to October 2013. We included 19 randomized controlled trials (1940 participants) in this updated review. (We reran the search in February 2015 and found four studies of interest. We will deal with those studies when we next update the review.) Lidocaine was either put into the cuff (the cuff makes sure that the tube stays in place), sprayed onto the person's vocal cords, or used as a gel smeared on the end of the tube.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>The summarized results of the included studies showed positive results. However, the interpretation of the results should be judged carefully. Though the possible adverse effects of using lidocaine were not reported in the included studies, there are a few case reports about lidocaine toxicity, although this is very rare.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of evidence</B>
</P>
<P>For lidocaine therapy versus control, the quality of the evidence for risk of sore throat was low (according to Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE)). This is because most of the trials did not describe how allocation was concealed and the results of the risk of sore throat were inconsistent, the quality of the evidence of the severity of sore throat , measured by the visual-analogue scale, was moderate (according to GRADE).</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-07-07 14:43:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Sore throat is a common side-effect of general anaesthesia and is reported by between 30% and 70% of patients after tracheal intubation. The likelihood of a sore throat varies with the type, diameter, and cuff pressure of the endotracheal tube used. If intubation is essential, it may be helpful to give drugs prophylactically to alleviate postoperative sore throat. Local anaesthetics and steroids have been used for this purpose. This review was originally published in 2009 and was updated in 2015.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-06-02 11:43:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>We searched CENTRAL (<I>The Cochrane Library </I>2013, Issue 9), MEDLINE (January 1966 to October 2013), and EMBASE (1980 to October 2013). We also contacted manufacturers and researchers in the field. The original search was undertaken in June 2007. We reran the search in February 2015 and found four studies of interest. We will deal with those studies when we next update the review.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-07-07 14:43:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>We included 19 studies involving 1940 participants in this updated review. Of those 1940 participants, 952 received topical or systemic lidocaine therapy and 795 were allocated to the control groups. Topical and systemic lidocaine therapy appeared to reduce the risk of postoperative sore throat (16 studies, 1774 participants, risk ratio (RR) was 0.64 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.48 to 0.85), the quality of the evidence was low), although when only high-quality trials were included (eight studies, 814 participants) the effect was no longer significant (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.09). Lidocaine given systemically in two studies (320 participants) did not reveal evidence of an effect (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.05 ). The severity of sore throat as measured on a visual-analogue scale (VAS) was reduced by lidocaine therapy (six trials, 611 participants, (mean difference (MD) -10.80, 95% CI -14.63 to -6.98). The adverse effects of lidocaine were not reported in these studies, though toxicity is generally rare.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-07-07 14:43:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>In our revised systematic review, although the results of included studies show generally positive results, they should be interpreted carefully. The effect size of lidocaine appeared to be affected by study quality; drug concentration; route of administration; management of cuff pressure during anaesthesia; the included population; and the type of outcome measured.</P>

<P>Sore throat is a frequent side-effect of general anaesthesia and is reported by between 30% and 70% of patients after tracheal intubation (<LINK REF="REF-Combes-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Combes 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Herlevsen-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herlevsen 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Navarro-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Navarro 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xu-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 2012</LINK>). This means more than 0.51 million to 1.2 million patients might experience postoperative sore throat per year in Japan (<LINK REF="REF-Ministry-of-Health_x002c_-Labor-and-Welfare-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare 2012</LINK>) The aetiology of sore throat is thought to involve mucosal erosion caused by the cuff of the endotracheal tube (<LINK REF="REF-Combes-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Combes 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xu-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 2012</LINK>), trauma from intubation, and mucosal dehydration (<LINK REF="STD-Navarro-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Navarro 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stout-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stout 1987</LINK>). Mucosal erosion may be caused by the patient bucking or coughing, or friction between the tracheal mucosa and the endotracheal tube during general anaesthesia. Whilst medical staff may concentrate on avoiding problems during surgery, patients will only be aware of postoperative complications. These complications can affect their satisfaction with treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Estebe-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Estebe 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Macario-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macario 1999</LINK>). The prevalence of postoperative sore throat varies with the diameter and the type of endotracheal tube used (<LINK REF="REF-Mandoe-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mandoe 1992</LINK>), which patients do not know about. The cuff pressure may also influence the prevalence and severity of postoperative sore throat. Use of a laryngeal mask airway is known to reduce the risk of sore throat and can be a good alternative for some types of surgery where tracheal intubation is not essential (<LINK REF="REF-Brimacombe-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brimacombe 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Joshi-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joshi 1997</LINK>). If tracheal intubation is required then prophylactic use of drugs may help to alleviate postoperative sore throat. Local anaesthetics and steroids have been used for this purpose (<LINK REF="REF-Ayoub-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ayoub 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goddard-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goddard 1967</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Herlevsen-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herlevsen 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Navarro-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Navarro 1997</LINK>). These studies showed the effectiveness of such interventions. To reduce heterogeneity, we selected only lidocaine therapy in this review. Steroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may be considered in future systematic reviews. This review was originally published in 2009 (<LINK REF="REF-Tanaka-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tanaka 2009</LINK>); and updated in 2015.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-06-29 08:25:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The interventions used in the studies were lidocaine in the cuff of the endotracheal tube, aerolized lidocaine, intravenous lidocaine, and lidocaine gel on the endotracheal tube. The doses of lidocaine used were: 2% lidocaine in the cuff of the endotracheal tube; 4% spray (aerolized lidocaine); 4% lidocaine gel.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-02-24 13:40:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Patients bucking and coughing at intubation are the main causes of injury to the tracheal mucosa. Lidocaine in the cuff of the endotracheal tube has a pharmacological action during the operation. By preventing these complications lidocaine is effective in reducing sore throat even after its pharmacological action has worn off; the local anaesthetic effect of lidocaine on the upper airway lasts from 20 minutes to 30 minutes. The strong stimulation of laryngoscopy or moving the tube may excite sensory C fibres and produce secondary neuroplasticity, associated with postoperative sore throat and cough. Lidocaine prevents this excitement of sensory C fibres (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 1999</LINK>). Therefore, another possible mechanism for preventing postoperative sore throat is to use lidocaine to suppress excitation of airway sensory C fibres and the release of sensory neuropeptides such as tachykinins that produce bronchoconstriction (<LINK REF="REF-Sloway-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sloway 1991</LINK>). Lidocaine is also thought to be useful in reducing injury to the tracheal mucosa during extubation.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-07-07 14:43:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2009 (<LINK REF="REF-Tanaka-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tanaka 2009</LINK>). The risk of postoperative sore throat is high (30% to 70%) following surgery under general anaesthesia. There are preventive methods for this common and sometimes severe condition; in such cases lidocaine is commonly used. Technological advances in surgery have meant safer anaesthesia with the use of airway management tools including video laryngoscopes and supraglottic airway devices, perioperative assessment by transoesophageal echocardiography (during non-cardiac and cardiac surgery), and new anaesthetic agents and muscle relaxants such as remifentanil and rocuronium bromide. Nowadays, the emphasis is on the quality of a patient's postoperative recovery (<LINK REF="REF-Murphy-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murphy 2011</LINK>); and sore throat is known to affect a patient's perception of the anaesthesia (<LINK REF="STD-Estebe-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Estebe 2002</LINK>). Many randomized controlled studies have been undertaken examining lidocaine for preventing postoperative sore throat; however, there are controversies about the effects of this lidocaine therapy and, therefore, conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis is important.</P>

<P>The conclusion of this updated systematic review remains the same as the original systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Tanaka-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tanaka 2009</LINK>): lidocaine given topically and systemically reduces the risk and severity of postoperative sore throat. The risk of postoperative sore throat was reduced significantly (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.85) after adding four new included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Jaicobandram-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Jaicobandram 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krishnan-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Krishnan 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Navarro-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Navarro 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xu-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 2012</LINK>); and correcting the data of one study (<LINK REF="STD-Hara-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hara 2005</LINK>). The severity of sore throat on a visual analogue scale (VAS) was also reduced significantly (mean difference (MD) -10.80, 95% CI -14.63 to -6.98). We updated our search strategy from 2007 to 2013 and we found 12 new trials from the updated search strategy. Of those 12 studies we included four new studies which met our inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Jaicobandram-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Jaicobandram 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krishnan-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Krishnan 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Navarro-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Navarro 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xu-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 2012</LINK>).

In <LINK REF="REF-Tanaka-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tanaka 2009</LINK>, the previous published version of our review, <LINK REF="STD-Hara-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hara 2005</LINK> favoured lidocaine for reducing the risk of postoperative sore throat (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.59). We responded to feedback (<LINK REF="FBK-01" TYPE="FEEDBACK">Feedback 1</LINK>) and corrected the data, which now favoured the control intervention (RR 1.77, 95% CI 0.63 to 5.00). There were reports about the risk of postoperative sore throat in each of the studies; however we could not find out from the data how many participants were affected by this condition. There were multiple doses of lidocaine so the interpretation of the results may be difficult. Though the possible adverse effects of using lidocaine were not reported in these studies, there were a few case reports about lidocaine toxicoses.

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-07-07 14:43:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>We conducted comprehensive search strategies for finding relevant studies. We included 19 studies and analysed 1940 participants. Therefore, the studies identified might be sufficient to address all of the objectives of our reviews. We identified the relevant participants who underwent surgery under general anaesthesia with endotracheal intubations, testing interventions of topical and systemic lidocaine therapy for preventing postoperative sore throats and outcomes such as risk and intensity of postoperative sore throat. The results of this review are applicable to adults who undergo an operation under general anaesthesia with endotracheal intubations. We excluded children because different anaesthetic techniques may be used from adults, and children cannot always report postoperative sore throat in the same way.  The interventions of topical and systemic use of lidocaine investigated all seemed relevant. The outcome 'postoperative sore throat' is a relevant issue for participants in clinical practices.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-07-07 14:43:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>We included 19 studies involving 1940 participants in the updated review. In all included studies, summary of risk of postoperative sore throat and the intensity of postoperative sore throat showed a statistically positive effect for lidocaine as an intervention (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>). The majority of the trials included were small and many had methodological weaknesses (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). There was substantial heterogeneity (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>); this might be explained by variations in the control, type of intervention, the surgical procedures and risk of bias. The first subgroup analysis of quality study showed that the combined effect size of a high-quality score was not statistically significant (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). That may show that there was an effect of risk of bias. The second subgroup analysis, investigating the route of lidocaine administration, showed that systemic lidocaine, or systemic and topical lidocaine, were not effective statistically for preventing postoperative sore throat (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). This seems to show that effectiveness of lidocaine varies according to the route of administration. The third subgroup analysis was about the control of cuff pressure. The summary effect of studies with the descriptions of controlled cuff pressure were not statistically significant (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). That may mean that the controlled cuff pressure changed the effectiveness of lidocaine for preventing postoperative sore throat. According to the GRADE evaluation, the quality of evidence of lidocaine for preventing the risk of postoperative sore throat was low (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-07-07 14:43:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>We attempted to reduce bias by identifying all relevant studies through a comprehensive systematic search of the literature and using electronic search engines such as EMBASE, MEDLINE and CENTRAL. There was also contact with the authors and pharmaceutical companies for both published and unpublished studies. However in this updated review, unlike the previous review (<LINK REF="REF-Tanaka-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tanaka 2009</LINK>), we did not use Google or Google scholar. We accept that we have possibly overlooked relevant studies and that some publication bias is inevitable and this is indicated by the rather asymmetrical funnel plot (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>); though it was not statistically significant according to Habord's methods (<LINK REF="REF-Habord-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Habord 2006</LINK>). This is likely to lead to an overestimate of effect size of lidocaine, because positive trials are more likely to be published than negative trials. The criteria for sore throat is not standardized. Therefore, the variation of measurement of sore throat may produce biases.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-06-29 07:08:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To our knowledge there is no other systematic review of our research question; therefore, we cannot state that our systematic review agrees or disagrees with other reviews. The conclusion of this review agrees with 11 of the 16 included studies about decreasing the risk of postoperative sore throat. The five studies that disagree may have had their own specific conditions (<LINK REF="STD-Hara-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hara 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Herlevsen-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herlevsen 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klemola-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Klemola 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krishnan-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Krishnan 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Porter-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Porter 1999</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Klemola-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Klemola 1988</LINK> pointed out that lidocaine jelly contains impurities which seemed to affect the results. In <LINK REF="STD-Porter-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Porter 1999</LINK>, all of the included participants were women; an earlier study has shown that late complications are more common in women than in men (<LINK REF="REF-Jensen-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jensen 1982</LINK>); therefore, the population studied may affect the results. In <LINK REF="STD-Herlevsen--1992" TYPE="STUDY">Herlevsen 1992</LINK>, larger intubation tubes, size 9.5 inner diameter, were used for men rather than the size 8.5 inner diameter used for women. Thirty-two participants among the 197 participants were intubated with smaller endotracheal tubes than outlined in the protocol of this study. The prevalence and severity of sore throat after endotracheal intubation were both reduced by using a smaller endotracheal tube in one study (<LINK REF="REF-Stout-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stout 1987</LINK>). In one study, the intervention was lidocaine spray on larynx and trachea (<LINK REF="STD-Hara-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hara 2005</LINK>). The control was saline spray. The authors stated that the reason for the worsening of postoperative sore throat might be because of the additive in the lidocaine spray. Moreover, in this study 15 participants dropped out during the study period. This might break the condition of 'intention to treat' and create bias. In one study, the intervention was 4% lidocaine in the cuff of the endotracheal tube and the control was saline in the cuff (<LINK REF="STD-Krishnan-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Krishnan 2008</LINK>). This study did not show a statistically significant effect of lidocaine. The authors stated that water in the cuff may reduce the risk of sore throat compared with air in the cuff. In a previous positive study, there was air in the cuff of the endotracheal tube (<LINK REF="STD-Navarro-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Navarro 1997</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-07-07 14:43:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>It is common clinical practice to use lidocaine for the prevention of postoperative sore throat. This practice appears to be generally beneficial, though the evidence is weaker when only high-quality trials are considered. The effectiveness of lidocaine would appear to be influenced by the type of participant, the concentration used, the route of administration and the outcomes measured.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-07-07 14:43:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Additional high-quality randomized controlled studies of the topical and systemic use of lidocaine for reducing sore throat will still be useful. Other kinds of drug therapies, such as steroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, could be investigated more actively. One study reported that participants with postoperative sore throat had a negative impression of anaesthesia practice (<LINK REF="STD-Estebe-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Estebe 2002</LINK>). Correlation of studies of satisfaction with anaesthesia with postoperative sore throat may be meaningful. Therefore, studies on preventing postoperative sore throat by any method are warranted.<BR/>

<P>With interest we read the review of Tanaka et al. about the prevention of postoperative sore throat with lidocaine. The authors calculated that topical or systemic lidocaine might effectively prevent sore throat after endotracheal intubations. One of their included studies with high quality was Hara and Maruyama (<LINK REF="STD-Hara-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hara 2005</LINK>). These authors examined the effect of lidocaine and lidocaine spray on postoperative sore throat at the first day after surgery. They found that lidocaine spray applied on the cuff leads to higher incidence of sore throat (10 of 35 patients) versus lidocaine solution (4 of 36 patients) or saline (4 of 36 patients). A significant difference in the incidence of sore throat following application of lidocaine alone (without the additives used in a spray) or saline was not found on the day after surgery. Tanaka et al. used these data for analysis I.1, analysis I.2, analysis I.3 and analysis I.4 of the meta-analysis. However, we think, that some of the data presented are not identical to those in the original publication. The graphs of analysis I.1 to I.4 show at Hara 2005 an incidence of 4 of 36 patients in the lidocaine group and 14 of 71 patients in the saline group. In the original publication [<LINK REF="STD-Hara-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hara 2005</LINK> ] 14 of 71 patients in the lidocaine group and 4 of 36 patients in the saline group had sore throat. The apparent transposition in the calculation of Tanaka et al., may therefore significantly alter the results of the meta-analysis.<BR/>
