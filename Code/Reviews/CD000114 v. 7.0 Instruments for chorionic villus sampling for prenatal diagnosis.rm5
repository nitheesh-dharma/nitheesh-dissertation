<P>More research is needed to identify the best surgical instruments and techniques to use for chorionic villus sampling testing during early pregnancy (before 15 weeks).</P>
<P>Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) is a test where a small piece of placental tissue (chorion) is removed from the pregnant woman's womb (uterus) and used for testing for genetic disorders. The tissue can be removed through the cervix or through the abdomen using plastic or metal tubes (cannulae), biopsy forceps or fine needles. The woman's risk of miscarriage increases if several attempts are needed to obtain sufficient placental tissue or the gestational sac is damaged during the procedure using ultrasound guidance. </P>
<P>The review found there is some evidence that small forceps may be more effective and less painful for the woman than using an aspiration cannula for sampling through the cervix (transcervical CVS). However, there was no difference in risk of miscarriage. When sampling was obtained through the abdomen (transabdominal CVS) using a needle with either a continuous or discontinuous negative pressure aspiration system, there was no difference in the effectiveness of the techniques, the amount of pain or in the risk of miscarriage. Forceps and cannulae were evaluated in five transcervical CVS trials involving 472 women. Two trials involving 285 women compared different needle techniques for transabdominal CVS. These randomised trials are too small to provide reliable evidence in favour of one particular instrument or technique for transcervical or transabdominal chorionic villus sampling.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-10-01 03:56:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Carmen Young">
<P>Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) is the method of choice for obtaining fetal tissue for prenatal diagnosis before 15 weeks of pregnancy. CVS can be performed using either a transabdominal or transcervical approach. The type of instrument and technique used could have a significant impact on the outcome of the procedure. An ability to manoeuvre the instrument within the uterine cavity without puncturing the gestational sac, to see the tip of the instrument on ultrasound scanning and to minimise the number of instrument passes into the uterus are particularly important.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2012-11-20 10:04:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Carmen Young">
<P>To compare the efficacy and safety of different instruments and techniques used to obtain chorionic tissue in early pregnancy by the transabdominal or transcervical route. Primary outcomes included failure to obtain an adequate sample (greater than 5 mg of chorionic villi), need for reinsertion of the instrument, pain, and miscarriage following the procedure. Secondary outcomes included mean weight of tissue obtained, successful culture, difficult instrument insertion, poor visualisation of instrument, vaginal bleeding following the procedure and cost per procedure.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-11-20 10:02:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For transcervical CVS, forceps and cannulae were evaluated in five trials involving 472 women. When a cannula was used, operators failed to obtain an adequate sample (greater than 5 mg of chorionic villi) more often (average risk ratio (RR) 3.81; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.52 to 9.56). There was no difference in the need for reinsertion of instruments (average RR 2.44; 95% CI 0.83 to 7.20). However, inserting a cannula was more painful (RR 1.93; 95% CI 1.11 to 3.37). There was no difference in spontaneous miscarriage when the use of a cannula was compared with biopsy forceps (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.14 to 6.96). One study reported the cost of the procedures and found CVS with a cannula to be more expensive (mean difference (MD) $183.7; 95% CI 152.62 to 214.78).</P>
<P>When different types of cannulae for transcervical CVS were compared, a Portex cannula was more likely to result in an inadequate sample (RR 2.23; 95% CI 1.25 to 3.98) compared with the silver cannula and to result in a difficult (RR 3.26; 95% CI 1.38 to 7.67) or painful (RR 5.81; 95% CI 1.41 to 23.88) procedure when compared with the aluminium cannula.</P>
<P>For transabdominal CVS, two trials comparing different needle techniques were included involving 285 women. One study using an ex vivo system of term placentae was excluded. The included trials compared different continuous negative pressure aspiration techniques with a discontinuous negative pressure system created by a syringe attached to a 20 gauge needle. The studies produced discrepant results. One study found there was no significant difference between groups in the mean weight of chorionic villi obtained (MD 0.40; 95% CI -2.25 to 3.05) or in failure to obtain an adequate sample (more than 5 mg of chorionic villi) on the first attempt (RR 1.02; 95% CI 0.54 to 1.93), whereas the other study found both of these outcomes to be significantly less favourable with the standard discontinuous technique using a syringe (mean weight of chorionic villi obtained: MD -14.80; 95% CI -21.71 to -7.89; failure to obtain an adequate sample on the first attempt: RR 2.73; 95% CI 1.08 to 6.92). There was no difference in rate of miscarriage following the procedure in either study (RR 7.15; 95% CI 0.37 to 136.50; RR 2.93; 95% CI 0.12 to 70.00). Perceived pain by the patient was similar between groups (MD 0.00; 95% CI -0.04 to 0.04) as was success of culture (no failed cases).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-11-20 10:02:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lynn Hampson">
<P>For transcervical CVS, although there is some evidence to support the use of small forceps instead of cannulae, the evidence is not strong enough to support change in practice for clinicians who have become familiar with a particular technique. For transabdominal CVS, based on current evidence, there is no difference in clinically important outcomes with the use of a continuous compared with a discontinuous negative pressure needle aspiration system.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-11-20 10:05:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite its drawbacks, chorionic villus sampling (CVS) remains the method of choice when prenatal diagnosis of possible genetic disorders is required before 15 weeks of pregnancy. Early amniocentesis has been suggested as an alternative, but complication rates (miscarriage rate, talipes equinovarus (club foot)) are too high (<LINK REF="REF-Alfirevic-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alfirevic 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CEMAT-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">CEMAT 1998</LINK>). CVS can be performed transabdominally or transcervically. Ultrasound guidance is essential for both techniques. Transabdominal CVS is very similar to amniocentesis; a needle or small forceps is inserted into the uterus through the abdominal wall using an aseptic technique. Fibroids, obesity and low posterior placenta may cause technical difficulties. The transcervical route involves the passage of an instrument (cannula, forceps) through the cervical canal. Instruments are usually slightly bigger than the ones used for the transabdominal approach and the risk of infection using the vaginal route is likely to be higher.</P>
<P>When needles and cannulae are used, the placental tissue (chorionic villi) required for cytogenetic analysis is obtained by aspiration using negative pressure created by a syringe or a vacuum aspirator. Alternatively, a tissue forceps is passed through a guide needle and a small amount of placental tissue is grasped and removed. The current evidence suggests that the transabdominal approach to sampling is safer (<LINK REF="REF-Smidt_x002d_Jensen-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smidt-Jensen 1992</LINK>), but the transcervical route continues to be used, particularly to allow easy access to the low-lying posterior placentae.</P>
<P>The type of instrument and technique used could have a significant impact on the success rate of the procedure. An ability to manoeuvre the instrument within the uterine cavity without puncturing the gestational sac, and easy visualisation of the tip of the instrument on ultrasound scanning are particularly important. Also, the risk of miscarriage is increased with multiple uterine insertions. It is, therefore, important for an instrument to allow adequate tissue sample to be obtained with as few attempts as possible (preferably one). Several types of instruments (needles, plastic or metal aspiration catheters, biopsy forceps) have been used since CVS was first described in the early 1970s but the choice is still made on the basis of personal preference rather than scientific evidence.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-11-26 09:56:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Carmen Young">
<P>The identified randomised trials are too small to provide reliable evidence in favour of one particular instrument or technique for transcervical or transabdominal chorionic villus sampling (CVS). It is possible that the type of instrument or technique used can have profound effects on the sampling success and subsequent risk of pregnancy loss.</P>
<P>Only three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Barkai-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Barkai 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chalkiadakis-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Chalkiadakis 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-von-Dadelszen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">von Dadelszen 2005</LINK>) studying transcervical CVS techniques enrolled women with ongoing pregnancies (n = 392). Therefore, although the current data are reassuring and there appears to be no difference in the risk of miscarriage with the use of a cannula compared with biopsy forceps, the impact of various instruments for transcervical CVS on important clinical outcomes remains unknown.</P>
<P>There were only two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Battagliarin-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Battagliarin 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Buyukkurt-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Buyukkurt 2010</LINK>) that enrolled women who had transabdominal CVS in ongoing pregnancies (n = 285), each of which studied different continuous negative pressure needle aspiration systems compared with the more common discontinuous negative pressure needle technique created by a syringe attached to a 20 gauge needle. There was no difference in the rate of miscarriage following the procedure in either study. However, the studies produced discrepant findings with the study by<I> </I>
<LINK REF="STD-Battagliarin-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Battagliarin 2009</LINK> finding no significant difference between groups in the mean weight of chorionic villi obtained or in failure to obtain an adequate sample (more than 5 mg of villi) on the first attempt, whereas the study by<I> </I>
<LINK REF="STD-Buyukkurt-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Buyukkurt 2010</LINK> found both of these outcomes to be significantly more favourable with the continuous negative pressure technique. Possible reasons for this heterogeneity include:</P>
<P>i) the difference in operator experience between the two studies and the potential learning curve associated with using the new technique. In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Battagliarin-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Battagliarin 2009</LINK>, there were four operators with different levels of experience, two with intermediate and two with advanced experience, but all were new to the continuous negative pressure technique. In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Buyukkurt-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Buyukkurt 2010</LINK>, only one operator performed the procedure, who had experience with the standard technique. His experience with the novel technique included 10 procedures on pregnant sheep as well as practice using a model.); ii) use of a hand-grip device with the standard syringe control in the study by<I> </I>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-10-12 05:53:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Carmen Young">
<P>On balance, the data from identified randomised trials favour small forceps for transcervical chorionic villus sampling (CVS). Overall, the data on transabdominal CVS suggest there is no clinically important difference in outcomes between the continuous and discontinuous negative pressure needle techniques. However, the methodological weakness of the included studies and the small number of participants make any firm conclusions unreliable for either CVS approach.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-06-22 11:14:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Larger trials are required if differences in the success rate and complications are to be estimated reliably. For example, an increase of 2% in the total perinatal loss with one particular instrument would encourage most clinicians to use a safer alternative. Assuming that the total perinatal loss in women who request prenatal diagnosis in the first trimester is around 10% (<LINK REF="REF-Alfirevic-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alfirevic 1999</LINK>), around 6500 women would need to be recruited to ensure that a 2% difference (if true) is detected. This is relevant to transabdominal CVS for which two different instruments (single needle and double needle) are used regularly, with potentially important differential effects on perinatal loss.</P>
<P>Of greatest need is a large, randomised controlled trial directly comparing transcervical and transabdominal CVS procedures as it is not known if there is a difference in safety and efficacy between these approaches and often the clinical scenario allows for either.</P>

<P>Both sampling techniques used a transabdominal approach with a 20-guage needle. Sampling was done using either a standard technique with discontinuous negative pressure created by a 20 mL syringe OR continuous negative pressure maintained by fixing the 20 mL syringe piston with a metallic clip and controlled with a 3 stopcock. The standard technique required an assistant to hold the ultrasound probe whereas the experimental technique allowed the clinician to self-guide by holding the ultrasound probe.</P>

<APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2012-11-22 10:59:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The following methods were used to assess <LINK REF="STD-Barkai-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Barkai 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chalkiadakis-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Chalkiadakis 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacKenzie-1986" TYPE="STUDY">MacKenzie 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pons-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pons 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-von-Dadelszen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">von Dadelszen 2005</LINK>.</P>
<P>All trials were assessed for methodological quality using the criteria in the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2000</LINK>), with a grade allocated to each trial on the basis of allocation concealment. Allocation concealment was scored as A (adequate) for telephone randomisation and use of consecutively numbered sealed envelopes; B (unclear) for trials where randomisation is not clearly described or prone to bias (e.g. open cards, toss of a coin) or C for quasi-randomised designs, such as alternate allocation and use of record numbers. No other formal or informal qualitative analysis was planned as there were no planned exclusions based on quality.</P>
<P>The data were extracted on the 'hard-copy' data sheets, entered onto the Review Manager computer software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2000</LINK>), checked for accuracy, and analysed using the RevMan software. The data were extracted by allocated intervention, irrespective of compliance with the allocated intervention, in order to allow an 'intention-to-treat' analysis. Women who were randomised and then either excluded or lost to follow-up were assumed to have no event in the main analysis.</P>
<P>In the presence of significant heterogeneity, a subgroup analysis was planned based on the quality of allocation concealment.</P>
