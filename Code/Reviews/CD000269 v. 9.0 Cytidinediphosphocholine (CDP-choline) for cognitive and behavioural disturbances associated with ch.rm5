<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Patients with cognitive deficits associated with chronic cerebrovascular disorders may not respond to anti-dementia treatments in the same manner as can be observed in cases of Alzheimer's dementia. There is some evidence that CDP-choline provides modest but consistent improvement of memory and behaviour in these patients. These findings, however, are limited by the relatively short-term of clinical controlled observations which in all studies but one lasted for no more than three months. Subjective evaluations of these patients as given by their doctors were consistently positive and no noticeable side effects were evidenced in the various studies over the years.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>CDP-choline (cytidine 5'-diphosphocholine) is a precursor essential for the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine, one of the cell membrane components that is degraded during cerebral ischaemia to free fatty acids and free radicals. Animal studies suggest that CDP-choline may protect cell membranes by accelerating resynthesis of phospholipids. CDP-choline may also attenuate the progression of ischaemic cell damage by suppressing the release of free fatty acids. CDP-choline is the endogenous compound normally produced by the organism. When the same substance is introduced as a drug it can be called citicoline. </P>
<P>CDP-choline is mainly used in the treatment of disorders of a cerebrovascular nature. The many years of its presence in the clinical field have caused an evolution in dosage, method of administration, and selection criteria of patients to whom the treatments were given. Modalities of the clinical studies, including length of observation, severity of disturbance, and methodology of evaluation of the results were also heterogeneous. In spite of uncertainties about its efficacy due to these complexities, CDP-choline is a frequently prescribed drug for cognitive impairment in several European countries, especially when the clinical picture is predominantly one of cerebrovascular disease, hence the need for this review. </P>
<P>Due to its effects on the adrenergic and dopaminergic activity of the CNS, CDP-choline has also been used as an adjuvant in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. <BR/>
</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the efficacy of CDP-choline (cytidinediphosphocholine) in the treatment of cognitive, emotional, and behavioural deficits associated with chronic cerebral disorders in the elderly. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The trials were identified from a last updated search of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group on 22 April 2004 using the terms CDP-choline, CDP, citicoline, cytidine diphosphate choline or diphosphocholine. The Register contains records from all major health-care databases and many ongoing trials databases and is updated regularly. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All relevant unconfounded, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trials of CDP-choline for cognitive impairment due to chronic cerebral disorders were considered for inclusion in the review. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers independently reviewed the included studies, extracted the data, and pooled it when appropriate and possible. The pooled odd ratios (95% Confidence Interval (CI)) or the average differences (95% CI) were estimated. No intention-to-treat data were available from the studies included. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Fourteen studies were included in this review. Some of the included studies did not present numerical data suitable for analysis. Description of participants varied over the years and by type of disorders and severity, and ranged from aged individuals with subjective memory disorders to patients with Vascular Cognitive Impairment (mild to moderate), Vascular Dementia or Senile Dementia (mild to moderate). Seven of the included studies observed the subjects for a period between 20 to 30 days, one study was of 6 weeks duration, four studies used periods extending over 2 and 3 months, one study observed continuous administration over 3 months and one study was prolonged, with 12 months of observation. The studies were heterogeneous in dose, modalities of administration, inclusion criteria for subjects, and outcome measures. Results were reported for the domains of attention, memory testing, behavioural rating scales, global clinical impression and tolerability. There was no evidence of a beneficial effect of CDP-choline on attention. There was evidence of benefit of CDP-choline on memory function and behaviour. The drug was well tolerated. <BR/>
</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There was some evidence that CDP-choline has a positive effect on memory and behaviour in at least the short to medium term. The evidence of benefit from global impression was stronger, but is still limited by the duration of the studies. Further research with CDP-choline should focus on longer term studies in subjects who have been diagnosed with currently accepted standardised criteria, especially Vascular Mild Cognitive Impairment (VaMCI) or vascular dementia. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>CDP-choline (cytidine 5'-diphosphocholine) is a precursor essential for the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine. Phosphatidylcholine is one of the cell membrane components that is degraded during cerebral ischaemia to free fatty acids and free radicals, which are highly toxic. Animal studies suggest that CDP-choline may protect cell membranes by accelerating resynthesis of phospholipids. CDP-choline may also attenuate the progression of ischaemic cell damage by suppressing the release of free fatty acids. CDP-choline crosses the blood-brain barrier and, as well as its role in phospholipids synthesis, increases noradrenaline and dopamine levels in the CNS. </P>
<P>CDP-choline is a relatively old compound, developed and produced in Japan, originally introduced for and occasionally still used in the treatment of acute cerebrovascular disorders. After being introduced in some of the European markets, its use has shifted from the treatment of acute, to chronic cerebrovascular disorders. CDP-choline was also occasionally prescribed as an adjuvant to L-Dopa treatment in Parkinsonian patients. In some studies CDP-choline is used in the treatment of primary degenerative dementia or of mild forms of primary cognitive deterioration in groups of elderly patients who did not present with a primarily cerebrovascular pathology. </P>
<P>The prevalent use of this compound in the treatment of disorders of a cerebrovascular nature does not imply an homogeneous and consistent application of this therapy. Dosage, method of administration, and selection criteria of patients have varied. The modalities of the studies including length of observation, severity of disturbance, and methodology of the evaluation of the results were also heterogeneous. In spite of these methodological difficulties in examining its efficacy, CDP-choline is still a frequently prescribed drug for cognitive impairment in several European countries, especially when the clinical picture is predominantly one of cerebrovascular disease. </P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate the evidence for the clinical efficacy of CDP-choline for the symptoms of cognitive, emotional, and behavioural impairment in older patients with dementia and cognitive impairment. </P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Randomized controlled trials of CDP-choline in cases of various clinical forms of cognitive and behavioural impairment associated with dementia and cognitive impairment. </P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Elderly people with cognitive and behavioural disturbances associated with various forms of diagnostic classification, focused on the presence of cognitive deterioration and/or the presence of abnormalities on neuroimaging. <BR/>Descriptions of specific chronic cerebral diseases such as chronic cerebrovascular disorders (CCVD) and primary degenerative dementia have changed over time. For example, the diagnostic criteria for vascular dementia as described in the DSM IV (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK>) include, besides cognitive and behavioural impairment, and clinical neurological signs, a positive evidence of cerebrovascular disease on neuroimaging. In earlier clinical studies this type of examination was not available or required, and a semi-quantitative standardized clinical assessment (Hachinski Ischaemic Score) was often considered as the discriminating instrument for the inclusion of patients. Another major difference that can be found between early and later studies is the likely presence of depression as a therapeutic target in later studies, whilst the same clinical characteristic was an exclusion factor in the protocols applied to early studies. </P>
<P>Age is another variable which has changed its indications for inclusion in this type of studies. In earlier studies the minimum age for inclusion tended to be consistently lower than in later studies (55 years versus 70 years). </P>
<P>Studies were eligible for inclusion only when they clearly indicated that their aim was to evaluate, exclusively, patients with chronic cerebral disorders where the principal disorder consisted of cognitive impairment, whatever operative definition was used for their inclusion criteria at that time. </P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Studies were included only when they were performed according to a randomized placebo controlled design. Variability of dosage of CDP-choline between studies (dosage tends to increase from 100 mg daily to 1000 mg daily when the earlier studies are compared with more recent ones) and heterogeneity of schedules of treatment were found. In some studies, treatment was given continuously while in other studies cycles of treatment were administered, usually of three weeks duration, interspersed by a treatment free period of the same length. </P>

<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>All relevant randomized controlled trials of CDP-choline in aged patients with various clinical forms of cognitive and behavioural impairment, including dementia, were considered.<BR/>The trials were identified from a last updated search of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group on 22 April 2004 using the terms CDP-choline, CDP, citicoline, cytidine diphosphate choline or diphosphocholine. One new trial was found, and the reviewers obtained unpublished data from Wyeth, Italy.</P>
<P>The Specialized Register at that time contained records from the following databases:</P>
<P>CENTRAL: issue 1, 2004;<BR/>MEDLINE: 1966 to 2004/02;<BR/>EMBASE: 1980 to 2004/02;<BR/>PsycINFO: 1887 to 2004/01;<BR/>CINAHL: 1982 to 2004/01;<BR/>SIGLE (Grey Literature in Europe): 1980 to 2002/12;<BR/>ISTP (Index to Scientific and Technical Proceedings): to May 2000;<BR/>INSIDE (BL database of Conference Proceedings and Journals): to June 2000;<BR/>Aslib Index to Theses (UK and Ireland theses): 1970 to March 2003;<BR/>Dissertation Abstract (USA): 1861 to March 2003;<BR/>ADEAR (Alzheimer's Disease Clinical Trials Database): to March 2004;<BR/>National Research Register: issue 1/2004;<BR/>Current Controlled trials (last searched March 2004) which includes:<BR/> Alzheimer Society<BR/> GlaxoSmithKline<BR/> HongKong Health Services Research Fund<BR/> Medical Research Council (MRC)<BR/> NHS R&amp;D Health Technology Assessment Programme<BR/> Schering Health Care Ltd<BR/> South Australian Network for Research on Ageing<BR/> US Dept of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies<BR/> National Institutes of Health (NIH)<BR/>ClinicalTrials.gov: last searched March 2004;<BR/>LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Literature): last searched April 2003.</P>
<P>The search strategies used to identify relevant records in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS can be found in the Group's module.</P>
<P>The reviewers contacted manufacturers of CDP-choline. Takeda (Japan) is the company that originally developed and produced CDP-choline and is the distributor of its commercial brand name in Asia. The company furnished a list of the clinical studies of which it had knowledge. Wyeth, since its acquisition of Lederle, has become the distributor in Italy of CDP-choline, and this company has been helpful but had difficulties in obtaining full details of Lederle's (Cyanamid Italy) past research activities. Ferrer International (Spain) which has developed and is marketing an oral preparation of citicoline has contributed to disclose some data from previous studies saved in its archives. <BR/>
<BR/>No other information was obtained from other sources interested in the development or in the marketing of this drug.</P>

<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>
<B>Selection of studies<BR/>
</B>Irrelevant citations were discarded by a single reviewer based on the title of the publication and its abstract. In the presence of any suggestion that the article could possibly be relevant, it was retrieved for further assessment. Two reviewers (MF and MY) independently selected the trials for inclusion in the review from the culled citation list. Disagreements were resolved by discussion and no persisting differences remained. </P>
<P>
<B>Quality assessment </B>
<BR/>The same two reviewers assessed the methodological quality of randomisation in each trial. Methodological quality in each selected trial was rated using the Cochrane Collaboration guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Mulrow-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mulrow 1997</LINK>). <BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Category A (adequate) is where the report describes allocation of treatment by: (i) some form of centralised randomized scheme, such as having to provide details of an enrolled participant to an office by phone to receive the treatment group allocation; (ii) some form of randomisation scheme controlled by a pharmacy; (iii) numbered or coded containers, such as in a pharmaceutical trial in which capsules from identical-looking numbered bottles are administered sequentially to enrolled participants; (iv) an on-site or coded computer system, given that the allocations were in a locked, unreadable file that could be accessed only after imputing the characteristics of an enrolled participant; or (v) if assignment envelopes were used, the report should at least specify that they were sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes; (vi) other combinations of described elements of the process that provides assurance of adequate concealment. </LI>
<LI>Category B (intermediate) is where the report describes allocation of treatment by: (i) use of a "list" or "table" to allocate assignments; (ii) use of "envelopes" or "sealed envelopes"; (iii) stating the study as "randomized" without further detail. </LI>
<LI>Category C (inadequate) is where the report describes allocation treatment by: (i) alternation; (ii) reference to case record numbers, dates of birth, day of week, or any such approach; (iii) any allocation procedure that is entirely transparent before assignment, such as an open list of random numbers or assignments.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>Empirical research has shown that lack of adequate allocation concealment is associated with bias. Trials with unclear concealment measures (Category B) have been shown to yield more pronounced estimates of treatment effects than trials that have taken adequate measures to conceal allocation schedules, but even so yield less pronounced estimates than inadequately concealed trials (Category C) (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). Thus trials were included if they conformed to categories A or B, while those falling into category C were excluded. </P>
<P>Other aspects of trial quality were not assessed by a scoring system although details were noted of blinding, whether intention-to-treat analyses were extractable from the published data, and the number of patients lost to follow-up. <BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Data extraction</B>
<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Data were independently extracted by the same two reviewers and cross-checked. Any discrepancies were discussed. </LI>
<LI>Data on outcome measures in every patient were not available for most of the studies performed in previous decades. No intention-to-treat analysis was possible where the data were sought irrespective of compliance, whether or not the patient was subsequently deemed ineligible, or otherwise excluded from treatment or follow-up. </LI>
<LI>Only data published in numerical form in tables were utilized in this review. For continuous or ordinal variables the main outcome of interest was the final assessment score. </LI>
<LI>In the only study where a cross-over design was used, only data from the first treatment period were considered eligible for inclusion. </LI>
<LI>No studies were found which included a titration period prior to the randomization phase of the study. </LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>
<B>Data analysis </B>
<BR/>For continuous or ordinal variables (such as psychometric test scores and rating scales) the main outcomes of interest were the final assessment score. If ordinal scale data appeared to be approximately normally distributed or if the analysis that the investigators performed suggested parametric tests were appropriate, then the outcome measures have been treated as continuous data. </P>
<P>For non-continuous and binary outcomes such as clinical global impression and tolerability ratings, the endpoint itself was of interest and the Peto method of the 'typical odds ratio' was used. </P>
<P>A test for heterogeneity of the treatment effect between the trials was made using a standard chi-squared statistic. If a test of heterogeneity was negative then a weighted estimate of the typical treatment effect across trials, the 'typical odds ratio' (i.e. the odds of an unfavourable outcome amongst treatment-allocated patients to the corresponding odds among controls) was calculated using Peto's log-rank test adapted for ordinal data. If, however, there was evidence of heterogeneity of the treatment effect between trials then either only homogeneous results were pooled, or a random-effects model was used (in which case the confidence intervals will be broader than those of a fixed-effect model). </P>
</DATA_COLLECTION>
</METHODS>
<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>All but one of the studies included for analysis fulfilled randomization criteria for category A as defined in the Cochrane Collaboration guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Mulrow-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mulrow 1997</LINK>). The other study (<LINK REF="STD-Motta-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Motta 1985</LINK>) was rated as category B owing to a lack of specific details about the randomization procedure followed. The excluded studies were mostly carried out in open fashion or with a control treatment different from placebo. </P>
<P>The studies identified for this review are spread out over time. The oldest ones were dated from the 1970s and the most recent from year 2003. This long history of the clinical research activity on CDP-choline partly explains the heterogeneity found amongst the studies. For example, only six of the included studies were multicentre in type (<LINK REF="STD-Agnoli-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Agnoli 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barbagallo-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Barbagallo 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Capurso-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Capurso 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Falchi-Delitala-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Falchi Delitala 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Piccoli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Piccoli 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Senin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Senin 2003</LINK>). There was a tendency for the early studies to rely on small numbers of patients seen by a single group of researchers. On the other hand, more recent studies were performed on a multicentre basis and assessed the efficacy of the treatment with a multidimensional approach. This approach includes the cognitive domain, the behavioural domain and the clinical domain. If the evidence of results from these different domains is consistent, this supports the clinical validity of results. </P>
<P>Seven of the included studies were performed on patients affected exclusively by chronic cerebrovascular disorders (<LINK REF="STD-Agnoli-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Agnoli 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Capurso-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Capurso 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Motta-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Motta 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Piccoli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Piccoli 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Senin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Senin 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sinforiani-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Sinforiani 1986</LINK>), one study included both patients with chronic cerebrovascular disorders and patients with senile dementia (<LINK REF="STD-Madariaga-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Madariaga 1978</LINK>), three were performed on subjects with unspecified, abnormal cognitive impairment related to the aging process (<LINK REF="STD-Angeli-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Angeli 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bonavita-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Bonavita 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Falchi-Delitala-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Falchi Delitala 1984</LINK>), two on patients with Alzheimer's disease (<LINK REF="STD-Alvarez-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Alvarez 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barbagallo-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Barbagallo 1988</LINK>), and one on normal older subjects with subjective memory complaints (<LINK REF="STD-Spiers-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Spiers 1996</LINK>). The total number of subjects in the two subgroups defined according to type of pathology, does not allow for a reliable subgroup analysis of subjects with primary degenerative dementia as opposed to vascular dementia. The average age of subjects in all the included studies was over 60 years and many studies included people over 70 years of age. </P>
<P>Another factor which constrained the number of included studies is the shift in research strategy. CDP-choline is a costly parenteral compound which only recently has been used also in an oral formulation. The recent trend in research has focused on the investigation of the efficacy and stability of this type of treatment when administered in cycles and not in a continuous fashion. Unfortunately, most of these cyclical long term studies were open and uncontrolled. Amongst the included studies, dosage of the drug, route of administration, and the period of treatment all varied to a great extent. Twelve of the fourteen studies were performed with a dosage of 1000 mg per day (5 intravenous, 4 intramuscular, and 3 oral), and two other studies were performed with a total daily dosage of 600 mg in one instance given orally and in another intramuscularly. Seven of the included studies observed the subjects for a period between 20 to 30 days, one study was of 6 weeks duration, three studies used cycles extending over 2 and 3 months and three studies observed continuous administration over 3 months. Only one study reported data from 12 months' observation. </P>
<P>The geographical distribution of the studies, mostly from continental Europe, reflects the approval of the drug in specific markets and its clinical use. In fact, a difference has emerged between the prevalent use of CDP-choline in Europe, where it is prescribed for chronic cerebrovascular disorders and/or mild to moderate cognitive deficits of the aged, and in Japan (the first country where the drug was used) where CDP-choline was mainly prescribed for acute cerebrovascular disorders. Studies of the effect of CDP-choline on acute stroke are not included in this review. </P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>The studies all fulfilled Grade A or B criteria for randomization of allocation. All studies were double-blind with a placebo control group.</P>
<P>Two studies reported a small number of dropouts (less than 10%) and these studies used a completers analysis. The other studies did not report any losses between randomization and analysis. </P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>Results are described for the different outcomes comprising attention, memory testing, behavioural rating scales, global clinical impression and tolerability of the drug. </P>
<P>
<B>Attention </B>
<BR/>Reaction time results were obtained from seven of the included studies with a total of 790 subjects, 384 in the CDP-choline group and 406 in the placebo group (<LINK REF="STD-Alvarez-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Alvarez 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barbagallo-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Barbagallo 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Motta-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Motta 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Piccoli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Piccoli 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Senin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Senin 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sinforiani-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Sinforiani 1986</LINK>). In these studies, all data were obtained using paper and pencil procedures. The results from these diverse studies were homogeneous, even though they included patients of different clinical groups and different research procedures for the evaluation of attention reactivity and proficiency. The time period for treatment varied from 4 weeks to 12 months. Using the SMD (standardised mean difference) and FE (Fixed-Effect) model, the summary effect size is -0.09 [-0.23, 0.05]. There was evidence of little effect of CDP-choline on attention. </P>
<P>
<B>Memory </B>
<BR/>Memory assessment was part of the assessment of subjects in the majority of the CDP-choline studies. The meta-analysis of the memory tests from ten studies included a total of 924 subjects, 456 in the CDP-choline group and 468 in the placebo group (<LINK REF="STD-Alvarez-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Alvarez 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barbagallo-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Barbagallo 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bonavita-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Bonavita 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Capurso-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Capurso 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Motta-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Motta 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Piccoli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Piccoli 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Senin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Senin 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sinforiani-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Sinforiani 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spiers-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Spiers 1996</LINK>). Memory is complex and different assessment procedures were used in the studies. For this reason, these studies demonstrated heterogeneity resulting in the use of the SMD and the random-effects model. The effect size was 0.38 [0.11, 0.65] which was statistically significant. When the outlier study (<LINK REF="STD-Bonavita-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Bonavita 1983</LINK>), which used an idiosyncratic non-standardized procedure for memory evaluation, was omitted from the analysis, the remaining studies were homogenous in their outcomes. These memory data were derived from studies with a wide range of clinical descriptions of participants ranging from aged individuals with only subjective memory complaints to patients diagnosed with Vascular Dementia (moderate to severe) or with Senile Dementia (mild to moderate). Despite this the studies were homogenous in outcome and the effect size (for a total of 884 cases) was statistically significant: SMD = 0.19 [0.06, 0.32]. </P>
<P>Using the six studies which reported memory test results in 675 participants with cognitive deficits associated with cerebrovascular disorders (<LINK REF="STD-Capurso-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Capurso 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Motta-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Motta 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Piccoli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Piccoli 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Senin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Senin 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sinforiani-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Sinforiani 1986</LINK>).The meta-analysis of memory function revealed homogeneous results and there was evidence of a statistically significant positive effect on memory: SMD = 0.22 [0.07, 0.37]. </P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Alvarez-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Alvarez 1999</LINK>) which evaluated 30 patients with senile dementia (n = 28 after drop-outs), used the ADAS-cog, but the number was too small and the power of the study insufficient to give a definite indication of the effect of CDP-choline in this type of patient. </P>
<P>
<B>Behaviour </B>
<BR/>Behaviour was measured using five different scales in eight studies with 844 subjects, 412 in the CDP-choline group and 432 in the placebo group (<LINK REF="STD-Barbagallo-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Barbagallo 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Capurso-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Capurso 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Falchi-Delitala-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Falchi Delitala 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Madariaga-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Madariaga 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Piccoli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Piccoli 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Senin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Senin 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sinforiani-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Sinforiani 1986</LINK>). There was heterogeneity in the results (chi-squared test = 48.46, degrees of freedom (df) = 7, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 85.6%). There was evidence of a positive effect of CDP-choline on behaviour: SMD = -0.60 [-1.05, -0.15] using the random-effects model. When the same analysis was carried out without the outlier study (Falchi Delitala 1984) which used the Sandoz Clinical Assessment-Geriatric (SCAG) rating scale, the remaining studies were homogenous even though the percentage of inconsistent variance among studies remained at the level of 42.7%. The effect size for the remaining 814 participants included in this analysis was statistically significant but of modest size: SMD = -0.26 [-0.49, -0.04]. </P>
<P>
<B>Clinical Global Impression </B>
<BR/>Clinical impression was evaluated in four studies with 217 subjects, 115 in the CDP-choline group and 102 in the placebo group (<LINK REF="STD-Agnoli-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Agnoli 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Angeli-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Angeli 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Capurso-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Capurso 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Motta-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Motta 1985</LINK>). The results were homogenous across the studies (chi-squared statistic = 3.07, df = 3). Using a fixed-effect model, the Peto odds ratio (OR) for improvement in the subjects treated with CDP-choline as opposed to the subjects treated with placebo was 8.89 [5.19, 15.22]. </P>
<P>In two studies with 30 Alzheimer's patients (<LINK REF="STD-Alvarez-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Alvarez 1999</LINK>) and 445 CVD patients (<LINK REF="STD-Senin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Senin 2003</LINK>), the CIBIC+ evaluation was used to quantify the clinical changes after treatment. The effect size was small and non-significant: for Alvarez, WMD = -0.50 [-1.26, 0.26] and for Senin WMD = 0.06 [-0.15, 0.27]. The CIBIC+ method of assessment may not be well suited to the clinical appraisal of changes for CVB patients.</P>
<P>
<B>Tolerability </B>
<BR/>Tolerability was assessed in seven studies with 891 subjects, 452 in the CDP-choline group and 439 in the placebo group (<LINK REF="STD-Agnoli-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Agnoli 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Alvarez-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Alvarez 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Capurso-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Capurso 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Motta-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Motta 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Piccoli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Piccoli 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Senin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Senin 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spiers-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Spiers 1996</LINK>). Safety data were homogeneous across studies. Using a fixed-effect model, the Peto OR for no adverse effects of this drug compared with placebo was 1.61 [0.98, 2.65], i.e. CDP-choline tended to be associated with fewer adverse effects than placebo, but this was not statistically significant. </P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This review examines clinical studies of CDP-choline from as long ago as 1978 and with diverse methodological approaches. Despite these technical difficulties, it has been possible to identify and select 14 double-blind, placebo controlled clinical studies with available numeric data and compliancy with the randomization criteria adopted by the Cochrane group. </P>
<P>The included studies were found to be heterogeneous for subject diagnoses, route, dose and duration of treatment with CDP-choline, and for the outcomes in the domains of memory and behaviour. These two instances of heterogeneity can be explained in different ways. The effects on memory were essentially homogenous once one study which utilised an idiosyncratic method of memory assessment was excluded. In the case of behaviour disorders the heterogeneity persisted even after removing the outlier. This probably results from other sources of variation in the determination of therapy effects such as duration of treatment, selections of subjects etc. At the present time, the evidence for efficacy of this drug is based on the majority of participants who were evaluated for 3 months or less; only one study which focused on a relatively small number of participants, evaluated its efficacy beyond that period. </P>
<P>The more recent studies have adopted a multidimensional approach to assess the effects of CDP-choline, including multiple aspects of behaviour and cognition. Some regulatory authorities have preferred to evaluate new drugs for people with cognitive impairment using a single objective outcome approach. This has the advantage of not relying upon multiple comparisons but has the disadvantage of limiting modality of efficacy of the drugs studied. </P>
<P>The multidimensional approach allows for the analysis of convergence of results of the same treatment obtained in diverse domains of the clinical picture. This convergence is a very important factor in evaluating the validity of a treatment in the field of dementia and related disorders. There is no single assessment tool which has been demonstrated to be reliably predictive of the important functions of everyday life (the only valid criteria to a patient, to his/her carers and to his/her physician). </P>
<P>It is a matter of concern that while small positive studies of CDP-choline could be accessed, there were no data available from small negative studies suggesting the possibility of publication bias. </P>
<P>Results of this meta-analysis provide evidence of a positive and consistent effect of CDP-choline on memory and behaviour, and this was confirmed by a generalized positive clinical impression. The lack of evidence concerning the treatment effects on attention can be considered as a sign that CDP-choline affects memory measures and not measures of arousal and generic reactivity of patients. There was no evidence that there were any significant problems in the tolerance of this medication. However, the length of the studies performed with CVD patients was generally of 3 months or less. This relatively short length of controlled observation of these patients when compared with similar studies performed with Alzheimer's disease patients is mostly due to practical reasons in conducting clinical controlled studies with this drug for prolonged periods of time. The most common administration modality for CDP-choline is still by intramuscular injection, once a day. A cyclic pattern of administration has been developed in order to alternate three week injection periods with three week non-injection periods. It is extremely difficult to obtain the authorization from ethical committees to perform clinical studies controlled versus placebo for longer periods of time where sizable numbers of patients should receive daily injections of inactive fluids for prolonged periods of time. The most recent study (<LINK REF="STD-Senin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Senin 2003</LINK>) was performed in a crossover fashion in order to facilitate the approval of the experimental protocol, but it was not possible to prolong the length of each arm of the study for more than three months. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is evidence that CDP-choline has a positive effect on memory and behaviour in at least the medium term and especially with patients suffering of cognitive deficits associated with cerebrovascular disorders. </P>
<P>The number of studies dedicated to primary degenerative dementia patients is too small to permit a comparative analysis between the various traditionally accepted clinical forms of dementia in order to clarify the specific efficacy of CDP-choline in chronic cerebrovascular disorders and other forms of dementia. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further research with CDP-choline should focus on longer term studies in subjects who have been diagnosed with currently accepted standardised criteria, especially vascular dementia. </P>

<P>This multicenter study aimed to evaluate, using a multifocal strategy, the efficacy of CDP-choline in the treatment of cognitive, behavioral, and emotional disturbances of aged patients with chronic cerebral vascular disorders. Measures for each of the three domains were included and there was evidence of improvement of perceptual-motor performance and a stabilization of attention efficiency in patients who received active treatment. These results were in addition to an overall improvement in behavior control, in emotional stability, and in physical well-being.<BR/>There were 4 subjects who were unaccounted dropouts before analysis.<BR/>

Tables 1 and 2 have been reversed and table 1 probably refers to CDP Choline group and Table 2 probably refers to placebo and have been corrected for inclusion in the meta-analysis.<BR/>This study discusses the clinical meaning of "senile brain" and evaluates a series of clinical and laboratory parameters obtained before and after treatment with cyticholine and placebo, using the double-blind method, on a group of 40 patients, all with signs of cognitive and behavioural decline. The conclusion drawn from the results is that cyticholine influences favourably some of the symptoms without any side effects.</P>

<P>This study was aimed to evaluate the efficacy of cytidine diphosphate choline (CDP-choline) on chronic cerebrovascular disease with a multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Cognitive and behavioural functions were evaluated using rating scales and psychometric tests. Several memory scores were improved in the CDP-choline treated group. The GBS rating scale showed improvements in the 4 functions explored, i.e. emotional functions, mental functions, motor functions and common dementia symptoms. In conclusion, patients treated with CDP-choline demonstrated a significant improvement in cognitive functions, while the placebo-treated patients did not show any significant trend. The drug was well tolerated, with no significant adverse effects.</P>

<TITLE>The Clinical cognitive status of cdp choline</TITLE>
<DATE_SUBMITTED>
<DATE DAY="" MONTH="" YEAR=""/>
</DATE_SUBMITTED>
<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<P>Dr Azeez Farooki enquired whether some of the patients from the multiple studies done with Citicoline are still taking it and what their clinical cognitive status has become w/ long term use. Are there any plans to follow these patients up and present the data? What criteria determines the "clinical global impression"? Ostensibly one would think it is a meaningful measure in terms of quality of life for patient and caregiver. Could you clarify this? Why is this drug not being more actively studied in the US?</P>

<FEEDBACK_REPLY>
<P>QUESTION: I am curious whether some of the patients from the multiple studies done with Citicoline are still taking it and what their clinical cognitive status has become w/ long term use. Are there any plans to follow these patients up and present the data?<BR/>REPLY: There was no systematic follow-up of subjects after the clinical trials. Some patients continued to take it up but have not been regularly followed with research instruments. It is difficult however to make inferences on long-term efficacy from open case series. This kind of study is specifically required for safety monitoring and not for efficacy by the regulatory agencies.</P>
<P>QUESTION: I am also curious to know what criteria determine the "clinical global impression"? Ostensibly I would think it is a meaningful measure in terms of quality of life for patient and caregiver. Could you clarify this?<BR/>REPLY: The clinical global impression, before the introduction of the more rigorously standardised CIBIC technique, was just a final question (final in the sense that usually was posted at the end of the data collection form) to the clinician responsible for the patient, asking the rating of the patient's condition on a 7 point scale (usually from "markedly worse" to "markedly improved"). Thus the CGI used in these trials probably does not clearly represent change in quality of life.</P>
<P>After the study done on Alzheimer's disease patients (which is included the review), there have been other recent studies located in the USA, but targeted on acute post-stroke patients, not on chronic CVD patients. </P>
<P>QUESTION: Why is this drug not being more actively studied in the US?<BR/>REPLY: Citicholine (CDP-choline) is available over the counter in the US as a food supplement, and can be obtained in various health food stores and pharmacies.<BR/>In the US it is being developed for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke by Indevus Pharmaceuticals (www.interneuron.com), but initial trials were not convincing. However the company is seeking funding to conduct a phase III trial.<BR/>It is not actively being developed for dementia in the US possibly because there is no profit potential, no exclusivity, a redundant history of inefficacy with phosphatidylcholine, and probably very little interest.</P>
