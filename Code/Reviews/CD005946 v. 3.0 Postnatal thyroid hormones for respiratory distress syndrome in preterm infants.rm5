<P>In preterm infants with breathing problems after birth, there is no evidence that thyroid hormone treatment given immediately after delivery reduces the severity of breathing difficulties or improves outcomes. Infants born prematurely are at risk of breathing problems due to lack of surfactant production by the lungs in the first days after birth. In animal research, thyroid hormones given before birth stimulate surfactant production and reduce the incidence and severity of breathing problems. This review found two small trials that compared the use of thyroid hormones to no treatment in infants with breathing problems in the first hours after birth. No benefit was found from use of these hormones on severity of breathing problems or complications that occurred as a result of these breathing problems. The effect on longer term development was not reported.</P>

<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome are at increased risk of adverse neonatal and developmental outcomes. In animal research, thyroid hormones stimulate surfactant production and reduce the incidence and severity of respiratory distress when given antenatally. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine whether thyroid hormone therapy used postnatally in preterm infants with suspected respiratory distress syndrome results in clinically important improvements in respiratory morbidity and subsequent improvements in neonatal and long term outcomes. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Searches were performed of The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2006), MEDLINE (1966 - March 2006), PREMEDLINE (March 2006), EMBASE (1980 - March 2006), previous reviews including cross references, abstracts and conference proceedings, supplemented by requests to expert informants. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Trials that enrolled preterm infants with suspected respiratory distress syndrome and allocated infants thyroid hormone treatment compared to control commenced in the first 48 hours after birth. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Independent assessment of trial quality and data extraction by each author. Synthesis of data using relative risk (RR) and weighted mean difference (WMD) using standard methods of the Cochrane Collaboration and its Neonatal Review Group. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Two studies enrolled preterm infants with respiratory distress. Amato (1988) allocated infants to L-thyroxine 50 &#956;g/dose at 1 and at 24 hours or no treatment. Amato (1989) allocated infants to L-triiodothyronine 50 &#956;g/day in two divided doses for two days or no treatment. Both studies had methodological concerns including quasi-random methods of patient allocation, no blinding of treatment or measurement and substantial post allocation losses. Neither study reported any significant benefits in neonatal morbidity or mortality from use of thyroid hormones. Meta-analysis of two studies (80 infants) found no significant difference in mortality to discharge (typical RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.47, 2.14). Amato 1988 reported no significant difference in use of mechanical ventilation (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.38, 1.09). No significant effects were found in use of mechanical ventilation, duration of mechanical ventilation, air leak, CLD at 28 days in survivors, patent ductus arteriosus, intraventricular haemorrhage or necrotising enterocolitis. Neurodevelopment was not reported. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is no evidence from controlled clinical trials that postnatal thyroid hormone treatment reduces the severity of respiratory distress syndrome, neonatal morbidity or mortality in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome. </P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Preterm birth is a leading cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Laws-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laws 2004</LINK>). Pulmonary immaturity, manifesting as respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), contributes substantially to this problem. Despite the proven efficacy of antenatal corticosteroids in preventing RDS, they are not effective at preventing all cases of RDS and are limited by the time required to exert an effect on lung maturation and surfactant production before preterm birth (<LINK REF="REF-Crowley-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowley 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2006</LINK>). Experimental studies have shown other hormones, including thyroid hormones, have an effect on lung growth and surfactant production, although not all effects are positive (<LINK REF="REF-Keijzer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keijzer 2000</LINK>). Human foetal lungs contain high levels of triiodothyronine (T3) receptors (<LINK REF="REF-Bernal-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernal 1984</LINK>) and T3 receptors have been demonstrated in rat adult type II pneumocytes that secrete surfactant (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1983</LINK>). In animal models, thyroid hormones stimulate surfactant release synergistically with corticosteroids, but may have negative effects on surfactant synthesis. <LINK REF="REF-Schellenberg-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schellenberg 1987</LINK> (The Liggins' group) reported that simultaneous infusion of cortisol, triiodothyronine and prolactin produced mature lungs in foetal sheep of preterm gestation. Similar results were obtained with thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) and cortisol. However, other combinations of cortisol, triiodothyronine and prolactin did not have the same effects (<LINK REF="REF-Schellenberg-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schellenberg 1987</LINK>). The use of thyroid hormones has the potential to stimulate surfactant release and reduce respiratory morbidity in preterm infants with RDS. </P>
<P>Some infants have low thyroid hormone levels at birth (as measured on cord blood samples), and have reduced postnatal surges of thyroid hormones in the first hours after birth. The levels of thyroid hormones in cord blood, including T4, free T4 (FT4) and T3, are lowest in those infants born at the lowest gestations, with cord blood T4 and FT4 two to three-fold higher in term infants than those born at 25 to 27 weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Oden-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oden 2002</LINK>). In a cohort study, <LINK REF="STD-van-Wassenaer-1997" TYPE="STUDY">van Wassenaer 1997</LINK> reported that sick infants (with RDS requiring mechanical ventilation) failed to have the normal first day total T4 surge, had a FT4 surge that was quantitatively less than seen in healthy infants, had cord blood T3 levels similar to healthy infants, but had a T3 surge that was lower than in the healthy group. Low levels cord blood T3, free T3 and FT4 have also been reported in premature infants born to preeclamptic mothers with placental insufficiency (<LINK REF="REF-Belet-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belet 2003</LINK>). </P>
<P>Antenatal or postnatal thyroid hormones or thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) have been used in an attempt to reduce respiratory morbidity. However, thyroid hormones do not cross the placenta in sufficient quantity to stimulate foetal lung development. As a result, TRH given to the mother to stimulate the foetal thyroid axis or thyroid hormones instilled into the amniotic fluid have been used. However, a systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Crowther-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowther 2004</LINK>) of five trials of antenatal TRH in addition to corticosteroids in women at risk of preterm delivery found TRH did not reduce the risk of neonatal respiratory disease, chronic oxygen dependence or any other foetal, neonatal or childhood outcome. In fact, antenatal TRH increased the risk of infants needing ventilation and was associated with poorer outcomes at childhood follow up. One potential explanation is that although antenatal TRH administration increases thyroid hormones and prolactin in preterm fetuses to levels similar to those normally occurring at term, the pituitary-thyroid axis is transiently suppressed after treatment in the foetus. Infants born during this early phase of suppression do not have the normal postnatal surge in thyroid hormones (<LINK REF="REF-Ballard-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballard 1992</LINK>). Intra-amniotic injection of thyroid hormone has also been described in case series with apparent improvement in foetal lung maturity, but no adequate controlled trial has been reported to date (<LINK REF="REF-Romaguera-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Romaguera 1993</LINK>). Although antenatal strategies using thyroid hormones to promote lung maturity have not resulted in substantial proven benefits, it is possible that giving thyroid hormones to preterm infants with severe RDS may produce a surge in thyroid hormone similar to what occurs in healthy preterm infants, with a resultant increase in surfactant production, improvement in respiratory function and subsequent reduction in neonatal morbidity and mortality. Neonatal morbidity that may be expected to be improved by a reduction in severity of RDS includes duration of mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy, reduction in chronic lung disease and peri/intraventricular haemorrhage. Thyroid hormones have substantial other effects and are important for energy metabolism, metabolism of nutrients and inorganic ions, thermogenesis, and for stimulation of growth and development of various tissues at critical periods including the central nervous system and skeleton (<LINK REF="REF-Ogilvy_x002d_Stuart-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ogilvy-Stuart 2002</LINK>). As such, it is important to examine the short and long term effects of thyroid hormone supplementation on growth and neurodevelopment. </P>
<P>This review examines the evidence from randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of thyroid hormone therapy in preterm infants with respiratory distress for improvement of respiratory morbidity and subsequent neonatal morbidity and mortality. Separate reviews address the use of prophylactic postnatal thyroid hormones for prevention of morbidity and mortality in preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Osborn-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osborn 2007a</LINK>), and postnatal thyroid hormones for treatment of preterm infants with transient hypothyroxinaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Osborn-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osborn 2007b</LINK>). </P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the effect of postnatal thyroid hormone therapy in preterm infants with suspected respiratory distress syndrome on clinically important respiratory morbidity, neonatal morbidity and long term outcomes. </P>
<P>Subgroup analysis was planned to investigate the evidence for the use of different thyroid hormone preparations, doses and timing of treatment; evidence for a gestational specific effect of treatment and evidence for differences in effect according to study quality. As thyroid hormones may act synergistically with corticosteroids, analysis of trials that used a combination of early postnatal thyroid hormones and corticosteroids were planned separately. </P>

</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>The standard search strategy of the Neonatal Review Group was used. This included searches of the Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2006), MEDLINE (1966 - March 2006), PREMEDLINE (March 2006), EMBASE (1980 - March 2006), previous reviews including cross references, abstracts, conferences (SPR-PAS and PSANZ 1998 - 2005), expert informants (authors of published trials and neonatologists) and journal handsearching in the English language. </P>
<P>MEDLINE was searched using MeSH terms '(infant-newborn or infant-premature) and (thyroxine or triiodothyronine)' and text words using '(hypothyroxinemia or hypothyroxinaemia or thyroxine or triiodothyronine) and [MeSH terms] (infant-newborn or infant-premature)'. EMBASE and PREMEDLINE using terms ('hypothyroxinemia or hypothyroxinaemia or thyroxine or triiodothyronine') and 'newborn'. The Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials was searched using the term 'thyroid disease', and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials using 'thyroxine or triiodothyronine or hypothyroxinemia or hypothyroxinaemia'. No language restriction was applied. Abstracts of trials were eligible for inclusion. </P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Independent assessment of trial quality and data extraction was performed by both authors, with synthesis of data using relative risk (RR) and weighted mean difference (WMD) using standard methods of the Cochrane Collaboration and its Neonatal Review Group. Each identified trial was assessed for methodological quality with respect to <BR/>a) masking of allocation <BR/>b) masking of intervention <BR/>c) completeness of follow up <BR/>d) masking of outcome assessment<BR/>Attempts were made to contact authors of studies where details of methodology were unclear. Data was synthesised using relative risk (RR), risk difference (RD) and weighted mean difference (WMD) where appropriate. From 1/RD the number needed to treat (NNT) for benefits and the number needed to harm (NNH) for adverse effects were calculated. All results given include 95% confidence intervals unless otherwise stated. A fixed effects analysis was used. Heterogeneity was examined using the I-squared statistic. In a previous version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Osborn-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osborn 2001</LINK>), an attempt was made to contact the authors of the included studies without success. </P>
<P>Separate comparisons were prespecified for the following: <BR/>1. Postnatal thyroid hormones (any type of preparation) versus control (no treatment or placebo), all dosing strategies<BR/>2. Postnatal thyroid hormones (any type of preparation) versus control (no treatment or placebo), according to dosing strategy used <BR/>3. Postnatal thyroid hormones versus other thyroid hormone strategy (e.g. T3 and T4 versus T4 alone)<BR/>4. Postnatal thyroid hormones (any type of preparation) combined with corticosteroids versus control (no treatment or placebo)<BR/>5. Postnatal thyroid hormones (any type of preparation) combined with corticosteroids versus corticosteroids alone</P>
<P>Subgroup analysis was prespecified to determine if there is a gestational age effect of thyroid hormone treatment with separate analysis of trials enrolling infants: <BR/>1. &lt; 28 weeks gestation<BR/>2. 28 - 31 weeks gestation<BR/>3. &gt; 31 weeks gestation</P>
<P>Subgroup analysis was prespecified for those trials using adequate methodology as defined by the use of a random method of allocation to treatment or control, if steps were taken to ensure allocation concealment, if there was adequate blinding or treatment and if there was at least 90% follow up of survivors. </P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Two small studies enrolling a total of 98 infants (but reporting outcomes for 80 infants) studied the effects of substantial doses of thyroid hormones in the first hours after birth in very preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome. One study used L-thyroxine, whereas the other study used triiodothyronine. Both studies had substantial methodological concerns including quasi-random methods of patient allocation, no blinding of treatment or measurement and substantial post-allocation losses. Neither study reported long term neurodevelopment. No significant effects were found for neonatal mortality or morbidity including need for mechanical ventilation, incidence of air leak, duration of mechanical ventilation or incidence of chronic lung disease (oxygen at 28 days). No significant difference was reported by one study for patent ductus arteriosus, intraventricular haemorrhage or end stage retinopathy of prematurity. Neither study reported the effect of thyroid hormone replacement on the levels of free (T3 or T4) or active (FT4) hormone levels, so the effects of the dosing strategies used on active and free thyroid hormone levels are unclear. Given the small size and methodological concerns of the eligible trials, it is possible that these studies failed to detect a moderate effect of postnatal thyroid hormones in preterm infants with respiratory distress. In view of the concerns regarding antenatal TRH treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Crowther-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowther 2004</LINK>) and a lack of postnatal animal research supporting the use of thyroid hormones for treatment of respiratory distress syndrome, further trials of postnatal thyroid hormone treatment for infants with respiratory distress syndrome would be difficult to justify. Further research is needed using immature foetal or postnatal animal models with respiratory distress syndrome to determine the potential role of interventions affecting the thyroid axis in prevention or treatment of respiratory distress. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is no evidence from controlled clinical trials that postnatal thyroid hormone treatment reduces severity of respiratory distress syndrome, neonatal morbidity or mortality in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further research is needed using immature foetal or postnatal animal models with respiratory distress syndrome to determine the potential role of interventions affecting the thyroid axis in prevention or treatment of respiratory distress. Additional human trials of postnatal thyroid hormones for treatment if infants with respiratory distress do not appear to be justified unless basic research provides new data suggesting a potential benefit. </P>
