<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Upper gastrointestinal bleeding is a common reason for emergency hospital admission. The prognosis is serious. Some patients may die as the result of uncontrolled bleeding.</P>
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic agent. This drug reduces the breakdown of fibrin; fibrin provides the framework for the formation of a blood clot, which is needed to stop the bleeding. Clinical trials suggest that tranexamic acid could reduce mortality in upper gastrointestinal bleeding.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>This review includes data from eight randomised trials on tranexamic acid. Two trials also assessed antiulcer drugs. Only one trial used additional endoscopic therapy, as the remaining trials were performed before this intervention was introduced into clinical practice.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>These trials found that tranexamic acid appears to have a beneficial effect on mortality, but a high dropout rate in some trials means that we cannot be sure of these findings until additional research is published . Tranexamic acid did not reduce mortality in the trials that included antiulcer drugs or endoscopic therapy. Additional randomised controlled trials are needed before we can determine whether tranexamic acid has a beneficial effect on serious or uncontrolled upper gastrointestinal bleeding.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Many patients who were randomly assigned were subsequently excluded from the assessment. The main source of bias was therefore attrition. The overall quality of the evidence was moderate to low.</P>

<P>We used the standard methodological procedures of the The Cochrane Collaboration. All-cause mortality, bleeding and adverse events were the primary outcome measures. We performed fixed-effect and random-effects model meta-analyses and presented results as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and used I as a measure of between-trial heterogeneity. We analysed tranexamic acid versus placebo or no intervention and tranexamic acid versus antiulcer drugs separately. To analyse sources of heterogeneity and robustness of the overall results, we performed subgroup, sensitivity and sequential analyses.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-11-13 11:36:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included eight randomised controlled trials on tranexamic acid for upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Additionally, we identified one large ongoing pragmatic randomised controlled trial from which data are not yet available. Control groups were randomly assigned to placebo (seven trials) or no intervention (one trial). Two trials also included a control group randomly assigned to antiulcer drugs (lansoprazole or cimetidine). The included studies were published from 1973 to 2011. The number of participants randomly assigned ranged from 47 to 216 (median 204). All trials reported mortality. In total, 42 of 851 participants randomly assigned to tranexamic acid and 71 of 850 in the control group died (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.87; P value 0.007; I = 0%). The analysis was not confirmed when all participants in the intervention group with missing outcome data were included as treatment failures, or when the analysis was limited to trials with low risk of attrition bias. Rebleeding was diagnosed for 117 of 826 participants in the tranexamic acid group and for 146 of 825 participants in the control group (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.00; P value 0.07; I = 49%). We were able to evaluate the risk of serious adverse events on the basis of only four trials. Our analyses showed 'no evidence of a difference between tranexamic acid and control interventions regarding the risk of thromboembolic events.' Tranexamic acid appeared to reduce the risk of surgery in a fixed-effect meta-analysis (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.95), but this result was no longer statistically significant in a random-effects meta-analysis (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.04; P value 0.07). No difference was apparent between tranexamic acid and placebo in the assessment of transfusion (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.11; I = 0%), and meta-analyses that compared tranexamic acid versus antiulcer drugs did not identify beneficial or detrimental effects of tranexamic acid for any of the outcomes assessed.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-11-05 14:51:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review found that tranexamic acid appears to have a beneficial effect on mortality, but a high dropout rate in some trials means that we cannot be sure of this until the findings of additional research are published. At the time of this update in 2014, one large study (8000 participants) is in progress, so this review will be much more informative in a few years. Further examination of tranexamic acid would require inclusion of high-quality randomised controlled trials. Timing of randomisation is essential to avoid attrition bias and to limit the number of withdrawals. Future trials may use a pragmatic design and should include all participants with suspected bleeding or with endoscopically verified bleeding, as well as a tranexamic placebo arm and co-administration of pump inhibitors and endoscopic therapy. Assessment of outcome measures in such studies should be clearly defined. Endoscopic examination with appropriate control of severe bleeding should be performed, as should endoscopic verification of clinically significant rebleeding. In addition, clinical measures of rebleeding should be included. Other important outcome measures include mortality (30-day or in-hospital), need for emergency surgery or blood transfusion and adverse events (major or minor).</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-11-05 14:51:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Upper gastrointestinal bleeding is a common reason for emergency hospital admission and a common complication in hospitalised patients (<LINK REF="REF-Rockall-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rockall 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Blatchford-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blatchford 1997</LINK>). A systematic review of general, population-based epidemiological studies found that the incidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding among patients treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs was 0.8 per 1000 (<LINK REF="REF-Hernandez-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hernandez 2002</LINK>). The risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding has been found to increase significantly with age, co-morbidity and use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Yavorski-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yavorski 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paspatis-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paspatis 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ng-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ng 2006</LINK>). About 80% of patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding will spontaneously stop bleeding, without recurrence (<LINK REF="REF-Laine-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laine 1994</LINK>). The highest mortality and morbidity rates are seen in the remaining 20%, who experience recurrent or continued bleeding. Among patients referred to endoscopy for suspected upper gastrointestinal bleeding, 30-day mortality is 10% to 14% (<LINK REF="REF-van-Leerdam-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Leerdam 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Barkun-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barkun 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Barkun-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barkun 2010</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-11-05 14:51:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Several endoscopic therapies have been found to be effective in clinical trials (<LINK REF="REF-Kahi-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kahi 2005</LINK>). However, some hospital departments may not have access to acute endoscopy. In other cases, patients may refuse to undergo endoscopy. Identification of drugs that may achieve haemostasis, stabilising patients until endoscopy can be performed, is therefore essential.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-11-05 14:51:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Tranexamic acid reduces fibrinolysis by slowing down the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin. The resulting reduction in fibrinolysis prevents the breakdown of blood clots, which may result in haemostasis but increased risk of thromboembolic complications. This drug was introduced for menorrhagia in 1968 (<LINK REF="REF-Vermylen-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vermylen 1968</LINK>) and is used to reduce blood loss during surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Laupacis-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laupacis 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cid-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cid 2005</LINK>). A large multi-centre trial found that tranexamic acid reduces mortality in individuals with bleeding trauma by 9% and results in no apparent increase in thromboembolic events (<LINK REF="REF-CRASH_x002d_2" TYPE="REFERENCE">CRASH-2</LINK>). It is possible that a similar effect can be achieved in cases of upper gastrointestinal bleeding.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-11-05 14:51:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Endoscopic therapy and proton pump inhibitors serve as the cornerstone in the treatment of bleeding from peptic ulcers (<LINK REF="REF-Lau-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lau 2013</LINK>). These treatments are highlighted in recent evidence-based guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Dworzynski-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dworzynski 2012</LINK>), which do not recommend tranexamic acid for the management of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Randomised trials have assessed the effects of tranexamic acid among patients with suspected or verified upper gastrointestinal bleeding (<LINK REF="STD-Cormack-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Cormack 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Biggs-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Biggs 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Engquist-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Engquist 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bergqvist-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Bergqvist 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barer-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Barer 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holstein-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Holstein 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hawkey-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hawkey 2001</LINK>). A meta-analysis of these trials revealed that tranexamic acid reduces the risks of rebleeding and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Henry-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henry 1989</LINK>). However, results of individual trials varied considerably. Furthermore, the overall result has been characterised as disproportionately skewed by inclusion of a trial in which mortality in the control group was surprisingly high (<LINK REF="STD-Barer-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Barer 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Palmer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palmer 2002</LINK>). We have previously published a systematic review on tranexamic acid versus placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2008</LINK>). A randomised trial on tranexamic acid for upper gastrointestinal bleeding was published after our previous meta-analysis had been completed (<LINK REF="STD-Bagnenko-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Bagnenko 2011</LINK>). This trial was included in a recent review, which determined that we still have insufficient evidence for definitive conclusions (<LINK REF="REF-Manno-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manno 2014</LINK>). We performed this updated systematic review on tranexamic acid versus placebo, cimetidine or lansoprazole for upper gastrointestinal bleeding.</P>

Data on all intervention groups were analysed separately for all trials, including those with more than two parallel arms.

<P>For trials with multiple intervention groups, we partitioned participants into individual allocation arms to perform pair-wise comparisons. For example, a three-arm trial with 30 participants (10 in each arm) allocated to tranexamic acid versus placebo versus antiulcer drugs would allow two pair-wise comparisons of tranexamic acid versus placebo (10 vs 10 participants) and tranexamic acid versus antiulcer drugs (10 vs 10 participants).</P>

<P>This review includes eight randomised controlled trials and a total of 1701 participants with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The meta-analyses found that tranexamic acid appears to have a beneficial effect on mortality, but a high dropout rate in some trials means that we cannot be sure of this until additional research is published. Reduced mortality did not clearly reflect reduced bleeding or surgery. The result of the primary meta-analysis was not stable in analyses that adjusted for risk of attrition bias or in trial sequential analyses. When trials with high risk of attrition bias were removed, only one trial was left (<LINK REF="STD-Hawkey-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hawkey 2001</LINK>) in the analysis, so although we may need to be cautious about the potential effects of dropouts, the evidence is still fairly strong in favour of tranexamic acid. Likewise, only two of the included trials used endoscopic therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Hawkey-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hawkey 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bagnenko-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Bagnenko 2011</LINK>). These trials found no clear effects of tranexamic acid on bleeding was noted and that attrition bias may affect the assessment of mortality, therefore the combined evidence does not allow any recommendations to be made. Additional randomised controlled trials are needed to determine the effects of tranexamic acid. A large randomised double-blind trial on tranexamic acid for gastrointestinal bleeding is ongoing (<LINK REF="STD-ISRCTN11225767" TYPE="STUDY">ISRCTN11225767</LINK>). This trial has started to randomly assign the first participants. Results of this trial are expected to finally confirm or refute the effects of tranexamic acid for individuals with upper gastrointestinal bleeding.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-11-05 14:51:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>During recent years, standard care and assessment of outcomes have changed considerably (<LINK REF="REF-Dworzynski-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dworzynski 2012</LINK>). Previously, patients were not offered full diagnostic endoscopy or endoscopic interventions that are used as standard care today. It is noteworthy that the trial that is the most favourable towards tranexamic acid was published in 1983 (<LINK REF="STD-Barer-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Barer 1983</LINK>). The clinical question today is not whether tranexamic acid is better than placebo, but whether tranexamic acid is better than or may be used in combination with current treatments. One of the included trials found no significant difference between tranexamic acid and lansoprazole when used alone, or when the two treatments were combined (<LINK REF="STD-Hawkey-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hawkey 2001</LINK>). This trial was not designed to assess clinical outcomes, and its statistical power may well have been too small to detect clinically relevant effects. On the other hand, this trial does suggest that additional research is necessary.</P>
<P>Several reasons may explain why we found that tranexamic acid reduces mortality but not bleeding. One possible explanation is that tranexamic acid may be effective in subgroups of patients with a serious prognosis. One of the included trials assessed the influence of the severity of bleeding on the intervention effect (<LINK REF="STD-Hawkey-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hawkey 2001</LINK>). This trial included 414 participants with suspected upper gastrointestinal bleeding and asked admitting investigators to classify participant risk as high or low on the basis of their presentation. No specific criteria were used. Overall, high-risk participants were more likely to die or need surgery. The effect of tranexamic acid was not related to risk stratification.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-11-13 11:46:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In clinical guidelines on the management of upper gastrointestinal non-variceal bleeding, tranexamic acid may be considered, but it is not recommended as routine therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Palmer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palmer 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Barkun-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barkun 2003</LINK>). This treatment generally is not recommended for variceal bleeding, and in several trials, participants with varices were excluded after randomisation. However, meta-analyses in the present review include participants with upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to oesophageal varices. No significant association was found between treatment effect and the proportion of participants with varices. These analyses are only hypothesis generating but suggest that the effects of tranexamic acid on mortality may also be seen in this patient group. Likewise, we found no significant differences between trials in which participants received tranexamic acid in a daily dose of 12 g for two days and those in which the dose was 4 g for seven days. It may be interesting to determine whether dose or treatment duration is related to the risk of thromboembolic events, but we did not have sufficient data to analyse this question.</P>
<P>Vested interests were reported in some of the included trials. We were unable to identify specific design features that introduced bias due to vested interests and the fact that we included only eight trials limited the possibility of further analyses. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude that this factor can lead to bias. On the other hand, the trial that received full funding (<LINK REF="STD-Hawkey-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hawkey 2001</LINK>) found no effect of tranexamic acid on any of the outcomes assessed.The largest trials received tranexamic acid and placebo from pharmaceutical companies (<LINK REF="STD-Barer-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Barer 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hawkey-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hawkey 2001</LINK>). The trial with the most positive assessment of tranexamic acid received only medications (<LINK REF="STD-Barer-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Barer 1983</LINK>).</P>
<P>Mortality is an outcome measure that is relatively stable in relation to performance and ascertainment bias, but not to attrition bias. We found that attrition was the main source of bias. Included trials randomly assigned participants early, and many excluded participants after the source of bleeding had been identified by endoscopy. Exclusion of participants appeared to be done before blinding was broken, although this is not specifically stated. As the result of risk of bias and clinical heterogeneity between trials, which is inevitable given that trials were conducted over several decades, the overall quality of the evidence was deemed moderate or low (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>).</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2014-11-13 11:46:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Potential biases in the review process are limited. In particular, we attempted to avoid bias in identification and selection of trials, but one possible limitation is that despite exhaustive searching, it is possible that other trials have been conducted, and although we searched extensively, we did not identify unpublished trials or trials published in abstract form. We included only one paper that was published in Russian (<LINK REF="STD-Bagnenko-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Bagnenko 2011</LINK>). Remaining trials were published in English. Because the number of identified trials was limited, we were not able to analyse the risk of publication bias. In theory, meta-analyses are observational, which may lead to biases. A written protocol is necessary to determine biases in the review process and in general, the original protocol must be followed. However, we made methodological changes to our protocol that were based on recent evidence and guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). These changes were mainly related to assessment of risk of bias. We also performed post hoc sequential analyses to improve assessment of biases.</P>

<P>Although our review methods did include assessment of all reported adverse events, we did not carry out a separate search for adverse effects; therefore one of the most important limitations of the present review is the fact that information about adverse events was limited. The recent debate on the use of antifibrinolytic drugs highlights the need for valid safety data. In 2006, an observational study of patients undergoing revascularisation was reported (<LINK REF="REF-Mangano-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mangano 2006</LINK>). This study included 1295 participants who received aprotinin and 822 who received tranexamic acid. Multi-variable analyses found that aprotinin, but not tranexamic acid, significantly increased the risk of renal failure and cardiovascular or cerebral adverse events. Although results support the safety of tranexamic acid, the participant cohort was considerably different from that included in the present review. In particular, the trials included in the present review excluded participants with previous thromboembolic or renal disease. Therefore, it may be argued that one of the most important limitations of the present review is that limited information about adverse events was available. Although we found no significant association between tranexamic acid and risk of thromboembolic events, our analyses did not have sufficient statistical power to allow clear inferences. Theoretically, tranexamic acid increases the risk of thrombosis due to unopposed fibrin generation. Case reports have associated tranexamic acid with thromboembolic events, which may be fatal (<LINK REF="REF-Rydin-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rydin 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Agnelli-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agnelli 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Endo-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Endo 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Woo-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woo 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taparia-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taparia 2002</LINK>). The trials in the present review excluded participants with previous thromboembolic events, although this is not generally accepted as a contraindication in clinical practice. Likewise these trials excluded participants with renal disease. One observational study has assessed the effects of tranexamic acid on patients undergoing dialysis. Tranexamic acid seems relatively safe to use in this patient group. However, the study included only 20 participants, so additional evidence is needed (<LINK REF="STD-Sabovic-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sabovic 2003</LINK>).</P>

<P>This review found no evidence to support or refute the use of tranexamic acid for upper gastrointestinal bleeding, in terms of mortality, bleeding, surgery or transfusion requirements. We found limited information about adverse events. At present, tranexamic acid cannot be recommended for routine clinical practice.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-11-13 11:48:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review found no evidence that tranexamic acid offers benefit to patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding in terms of mortality, bleeding, surgery or requirement for blood transfusion. At the time of this update in 2014, additional large pragmatic randomised trials seem warranted. We are aware of one large study (8000 participants) that is in progress, so this review will be much more informative in a few years. However, proton pump inhibitors and endoscopic interventions for severe gastrointestinal bleeding, including injection and thermal and mechanical methods such as haemoclips, may serve as alternative effective interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Dworzynski-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dworzynski 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Further examination of the efficacy and safety of tranexamic acid would involve high-quality randomised controlled trials. The timing of randomisation is essential in avoiding attrition bias and limiting the number of withdrawals. The trial may use a pragmatic design and include all participants with suspected bleeding based on haemoglobin levels, gastric lavage, hematemesis or melena. Alternatively, only participants with endoscopically verified bleeding may be randomly assigned. The pragmatic approach could mean inclusion of participants with concomitant disease who may have higher risk of bleeding. When such participants are excluded from trials, we may overestimate benefits and underestimate adverse events. Therefore the advantage of a pragmatic approach would be that investigators could assess whether the intervention works in these patients, that is, such trials would have high external validity.</P>
<P>Future trials should assess tranexamic acid delivered orally or intravenously over an appropriate length of time. The trials included in this review assessed a daily dose of up to 16 to 42 g. A placebo arm (for comparison with tranexamic acid) should be included, and interventions should be administered in accordance with current treatment recommendations. Accordingly, co-interventions such as proton pump inhibitors and endoscopic therapy must be offered. Assessment of outcome measures should be clearly defined, and reports of adverse events should be included. Endoscopic examination with appropriate control of severe bleeding should be included, and endoscopic verification of clinically significant rebleeding should be performed. In addition, clinical measures of rebleeding should be included. Other important outcome measures include mortality (30-day or in-hospital), along with need for emergency surgery, blood transfusion and adverse events (major or minor).</P>

<P>We updated the review in 2014 to comply with MECIR standards for the conduct and reporting of systematic reviews. We updated the format of the review for clarity and provided the following information about our methods.</P>
<UL>
<LI>We included adverse effects as a primary outcome (formerly a secondary outcome) to comply with recent guidance on conduct and presentation of the systematic review.</LI>
<LI>We clarified that because of the risk of selection bias in the allocation of participants to intervention or control groups and bias in the administration of collateral interventions, we did not include cluster-randomised trials.</LI>
<LI>For trials with multiple intervention groups, we partitioned the numbers of participants in individual allocation arms into pair-wise comparisons.</LI>
<LI>We used simple imputation to evaluate the potential influence of missing data: imputing failures, imputing successes, worst- and best-case.</LI>
<LI>We provided additional explanations of our assessment and reporting of heterogeneity for clarity; our methods remain unchanged.</LI>
<LI>We performed all meta-analyses using both random-effects and fixed-effect models. Fixed-effect meta-analyses are reported only when results of the two models differ (e.g. one model shows no difference between interventions and the other shows an intervention effect).</LI>
<LI>We performed separate analyses of trials on tranexamic acid versus placebo or no intervention and trials on tranexamic acid versus antiulcer drugs. We performed subgroup analyses of trials with low risk of bias based on assessment of the separate domains. We also analysed subgroups of trials that used endoscopic therapy and trials published in English or Russian.</LI>
<LI>We performed an analysis when all participants with missing outcome data were included as treatment failures, and we used a per-protocol analysis to evaluate the influence of missing data when we excluded participants with missing outcome data.</LI>
<LI>For analyses with at least 10 trials, we planned to assess reporting biases and other dissemination biases on the basis of funnel plots (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) and regression analyses by using Harbord's modified test (<LINK REF="REF-Harbord-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harbord 2006</LINK>). Our analyses included only eight trials; therefore we did not carry out statistical analysis of reporting bias.</LI>
<LI>We performed a post hoc trial sequential analysis to evaluate the risk of bias associated with cumulative testing and to evaluate futility in assessment of mortality and bleeding (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wetterslev-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wetterslev 2008</LINK>). We performed the analysis with power set to 80%, alpha to 5%, model-based diversity and relative risk reduction (RRR) to 25%. We set the control group incidence to 8% in our analysis of mortality and to 18% in our analysis of bleeding.</LI>
<LI>We prepared a 'Summary of findings' table (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>) using GRADEpro software (<LINK REF="REF-Gradepro-3.6" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gradepro 3.6</LINK>) and included information on results of our primary outcomes in relation to risk of heterogeneity, duration of follow-up and quality of the evidence.</LI>

<REFERENCE NOTES="&lt;p&gt;BACKGROUND AND AIM: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is known to affect&lt;br&gt;the gastric microcirculation, and cetraxate is reported to accelerate gastric&lt;br&gt;ulcer healing, possibly by augmenting gastric mucosal blood flow (MBF). The aim&lt;br&gt;of this study is to clarify the effect of H. pylori infection and cetraxate on&lt;br&gt;MBF during gastric ulcer healing. METHODS: Forty-two patients who had undergone endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) were studied. Mucosal blood flow was measured by the use of a laser Doppler flowmeter in the surrounding mucosa and at the ulcer margin, before, 1 day, 1 week and 4 weeks after EMR. Helicobacter pylori infection was confirmed by the use of bacterial culture and histology. After EMR, patients were randomly assigned to receive 30 mg lansoprazole (u.i.d; L-regimen) or 30 mg lansoprazole (u.i.d.) with 200 mg cetraxate (q.i.d; LC-regimen) for 4 weeks. RESULTS: The MBF ratio (MBF at ulcer margin/MBF in surrounding mucosa) 1 week after EMR was significantly lower than that before or 4 weeks after EMR only in H. pylori-positive patients treated with the L-regimen. No such decrease in MBF was observed after 1 week in H.&lt;br&gt;pylori-positive patients treated with the LC-regimen or in H. pylori-negative&lt;br&gt;patients. CONCLUSION: A transient decrease in MBF was detected at the ulcer&lt;br&gt;margin during healing of EMR-induced ulcers in H. pylori-infected patients.&lt;br&gt;Cetraxate seemed to prevent this decrease in MBF.&lt;/p&gt;" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">

METHODS: Twenty consecutive patients (12 male, eight female; 63+/-8&lt;br&gt;years) with 36 episodes of major upper gastrointestinal bleeding were included&lt;br&gt;in the study. In 16 episodes of bleeding TXA was used (in a dosage of 20 mg&lt;br&gt;intravenously, followed for the next 4 weeks by 10 mg/kg/48 h orally), whereas&lt;br&gt;in 20 other cases of bleeding, TXA was not used. The decision to use TXA was&lt;br&gt;left to the attending physician's clinical judgement, resulting in all the more&lt;br&gt;severe cases of bleeding being treated with TXA. RESULTS: Treatment including&lt;br&gt;TXA was shown to be beneficial (relative to cases not treated with TXA) in terms&lt;br&gt;of decreasing the rate of early re-bleeding (in the first week, 0 vs 6, P&amp;lt;0.05),&lt;br&gt;the rate of early and late re-bleeding (in the first month, 1 vs 8, P&amp;lt;0.05), the&lt;br&gt;rate of repeated endoscopic procedures (in the first month, 1 vs 8, P&amp;lt;0.05) and&lt;br&gt;the number of blood transfusions needed (in the first month, 1.4+/-1.3 vs&lt;br&gt;2.6+/-1.5 units, P&amp;lt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this pilot study suggest&lt;br&gt;that TXA can be beneficial in the treatment of major upper gastrointestinal&lt;br&gt;bleeding in dialysis patients. This remains to be definitely confirmed in a&lt;br&gt;randomized study.&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2011-11-30 02:48:29 +0000" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">

<REFERENCE NOTES="&lt;p&gt;Forty-nine Chinese patients, ages 65 years or over, with endoscopically and&lt;br&gt;pathologically diagnosed benign gastric ulcer, completed a randomized&lt;br&gt;double-blind double dummy trial in treatment with either cetraxate 200 mg four&lt;br&gt;times daily or ranitidine 150 mg two times daily for 12 weeks or less if the&lt;br&gt;gastric ulcer had completely healed. All patients tolerated the procedure well.&lt;br&gt;At the end of the 4th, 8th, and 12th weeks ulcer healing was complete in 2 (8%),&lt;br&gt;11 (42%), and 17 (65%), respectively, of the cetraxate group (26 patients); and&lt;br&gt;in 8 (35%), 18 (78%), and 22 (96%), respectively, of the ranitidine group (23&lt;br&gt;patients). All the differences in the healing rates were statistically&lt;br&gt;significant. Pain relief was significantly earlier with ranitidine. Incidences&lt;br&gt;of side effects were similar and not serious in the two groups. The results&lt;br&gt;suggest that at the doses prescribed to the elderly, ranitidine is significantly&lt;br&gt;more effective than cetraxate in gastric ulcer healing and pain relief.&lt;/p&gt;" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">

<P>Trial sequential analysis of eight trials on tranexamic acid versus placebo or no intervention. Outcome measure is mortality. Analysis was performed with alpha 5% and power 80%. Model-based heterogeneity correction was 0%, relative risk reduction 30% and control group incidence 10%. Graph shows the Z-curve, which is the cumulative result of analysis with trials added according to year of publication. Horizontal line represents 'traditional' 5% level of significance, and inward sloping red line shows trial sequential monitoring boundary. Vertical line represents required information size. Analysis shows that the Z-curve crosses the trial sequential monitoring boundary, suggesting that the result of the meta-analysis is confirmed when analysis is adjusted for cumulative testing. Total number of included participants (N = 1701) is only 62% of required information size (N=2714). The meta-analysis therefore remains inconclusive.</P>

<P>Trial sequential analysis of seven trials on tranexamic acid versus placebo or no intervention. Outcome measure is bleeding. Analysis was performed with alpha 5% and power 80%. Model-based heterogeneity correction was 53%, relative risk reduction 30% and control group incidence 10%. Graph shows the Z-curve, which is the cumulative result of analysis with trials added according to year of publication. Horizontal line represents 'traditional' 5% level of significance, and inward sloping red line shows trial sequential monitoring boundary. Vertical line represents required information size. Analysis shows that the Z-curve does not cross the trial sequential monitoring boundary, and the total number of participants (N = 1651) is 95% of required information size (N = 1734). The meta-analysis therefore remains inconclusive.</P>
