<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-10-17 15:04:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Donghao Lv">
<P>Dementia is characterized by chronic, global, irreversible impairment in cognitive functions, including memory, executive function and personality. It has a serious impact on patients' quality of life. Naftidrofuryl has been suggested as a treatment for dementia which may work by increasing the oxygen supply to brain tissue. The low-quality evidence shows that naftidrofuryl may have benefits on performance, behaviour, cognition, and mood for patients with dementia. However, these benefits fail to translate into reliable clinically detectable changes. Naftidrofuryl orally administrated is well-tolerated.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-10-18 08:50:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Donghao Lv">
<P>Dementia is characterized by chronic, global, non-reversible impairment in cerebral function. It usually results in loss of memory (initially of recent events), loss of executive function (such as the ability to make decisions or sequence complex tasks), and changes in personality. Currently, 24.3 million people around the world are estimated to have dementia, with 4.6 million new cases of dementia every year (<LINK REF="REF-Ferri-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferri 2005</LINK>). Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia (including mixed dementia), two major subtypes, are each estimated to account for 35% to 50% of dementia, and Lewy body dementia is estimated to the account for up to 20% of dementia in the elderly, varying with geographical, cultural, and racial factors (<LINK REF="REF-Farrer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrer 2001,</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Ikeda-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ikeda 2001,</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Lobo-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lobo 2000,</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-McKeith-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKeith 2000,</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Skoog-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skoog 1993,</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Van-Duijn-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Duijn 1996</LINK>). There are numerous other causes of dementia, all of which are relatively rare. The most commonly used criterion set for diagnosis of dementia is the DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, American Psychiatric Association). The effects of dementia are multidimensional with widespread implications for physical, mental and social functioning. Dementia greatly adds to the burden on carers, medical practitioners, health resources, and pressure on research to find effective treatments, not only in Europe or the industrialized countries (<LINK REF="REF-Grimley-Evans-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grimley Evans 1997</LINK>), but around the world: by 2040 it is projected that 71% of the 81.1 million people with dementia will be from developing countries (<LINK REF="REF-Ferri-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferri 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Senile dementia of Alzheimer's type (SDAT), or Alzheimer's disease, is the most common subtype of dementia and its pathogenesis is being increasingly elucidated. The second most common type of dementia is vascular dementia, which is defined as a subtle, progressive decline in memory and cognitive functioning caused by chronic, reduced blood flow to the brain&#8212;usually as the result of a stroke or series of strokes (<LINK REF="REF-Roman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roman 2003</LINK>). However, a significant proportion of dementia is of mixed Alzheimer's and vascular type. Therefore, increasing or improving cerebral blood flow is one possible approach to treatment (at least of the symptoms).</P>
<P>A number of vasodilatory drug treatments are prescribed for dementia, and one of these is naftidrofuryl, or nafronyl (marketed by Lipha as Praxilene, also called Gevatran in some clinical trials, also currently marketed as Dusodril Retard by Merck ) which has been used in Europe since 1968. It is administered orally, with the usual dose being 100 to 200 mg three times a day for peripheral vascular disease and 100 mg three times a day for cerebral vascular disease. In 1999, of the total amount of Praxilene dispensed for all indications, 54.7% was used in France, 36.5% in other European countries, 1.3% in South America, 2.7% in Asia (outside Japan) and 4.8% in Africa, against a total of about 3.5 million prescriptions.</P>
<P>Naftidrofuryl is the acid oxalate of N-diethylaminoethyl-beta-(naphthyl-1)-beta'-tetra-hydrofuryl-isobutyrate. It acts on energetic metabolism in muscle and brain, mainly in conditions of hypoxia or total or partial ischaemias. The pharmacological effects of naftidrofuryl include increasing the availability of oxygen and energetic mediators in the tissues; reducing the rate of glycolysis and uptake of glucose from the blood; altering mitochondrial enzymatic activities; and decreasing acetylcholinesterase activity in hypoxia (<LINK REF="STD-Agnoli-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Agnoli 1985</LINK>). Side effects that have been observed include nausea, epigastric pain, rash, hepatitis, hepatic failure and following injection, hypotension, arrhythmias and convulsions.</P>
<P>A Cochrane systematic review of intravenous naftidrofuryl found no clear evidence that short-term intravenous naftidrofuryl was of benefit for people with critical limb ischaemia, and the authors also point out that the treatment was withdrawn for peripheral arterial disease in 1995 because of reported side effects (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2008</LINK>). Moreover, <LINK REF="REF-Leonardi_x002d_Bee-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leonardi-Bee 2007</LINK> found that there was not enough evidence to support the use of naftidrofuryl for patients with acute stroke. However, <LINK REF="REF-De-Backer-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Backer 2005</LINK> found naftidrofuryl did significantly improve walking distance for people with intermittent claudication. While the vasodilating action of the drug makes it a relatively uncontroversial treatment in peripheral vascular disease (notwithstanding side effects), it is felt that clinicians, policy makers and end-users could make use of this third review of naftidrofuryl which seeks evidence of effect for its use in cognitive impairment (though not restricted to vascular dementia alone), and also intends to evaluate the side effects.</P>

<P>We expressed the results as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean differences (MD) or standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% CI for continuous outcomes. We used the MD when the pooled trials used the same rating scale or test, and the standardized mean difference (SMD), which was the absolute MD divided by the SD, when they used different rating scales or tests.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dealing with missing data</HEADING>
<P>We contacted the authors of all trials with missing data by post or e-mail. If there was no response, or the data were still unavailable, then we calculated missing SDs where possible from either the SE (<LINK REF="STD-Cucinotta-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Cucinotta 1987,</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Grossmann-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Grossmann 1990,</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Saldmann-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Saldmann 1991</LINK>), or P values (<LINK REF="STD-Cohn-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Cohn 1984,</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Emeriau-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Emeriau 2000</LINK>). If no statistics allowing calculation of the SD were given, we described the original results in the text.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>We carried out tests for heterogeneity using a Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test with significance level set at P &lt; 0.1. We used the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic to estimate how much of the variability in effect sizes across studies was due to heterogeneity, as a percentage; where &lt; 25% was considered as low level heterogeneity, 25% to 50% as moderate, and &gt; 50% as high level heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). If substantial heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>greater than 50%) existed between studies for the primary outcome, we explored reasons for the heterogeneity, such as disease severity, dosage and duration of treatment, type of dementia using subgroup analyses. If it was not possible to perform a meta-analysis, either due to too much heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> &gt; 80%) or where there was a lack of evidence, we summarized the data for each trial.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data analysis</HEADING>
<P>For studies with a similar type of participants, we performed a meta-analysis to calculate a weighted treatment effect across trials using a fixed-effect model, provided that there was no heterogeneity amongst studies. If heterogeneity was present, we used a random-effects model.</P>
<P>When intervention effects were small (ORs close to one), or events were not particularly common and the studies had similar numbers in experimental and control groups, we used the Peto OR method.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>Participants were treated for two to four months in six trials, for six months in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-M_x00f6_ller-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Möller 2001</LINK>), and for 12 months in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Cucinotta-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Cucinotta 1987</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Emeriau-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Emeriau 2000</LINK>).

<UL>
<LI>The Sandoz Clinical Assessment Geriatric Scale (SCAG) (<LINK REF="REF-Shader-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shader 1974</LINK>) is a physician rating. It consists of 18 items and an overall impression (item 19), all rated on a seven-point scale. There are five subscores: cognitive disturbances, disturbances in social behaviour, lack of drive, affective disturbances, somatic disturbances. Item 19 was used in <LINK REF="STD-Cohn-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Cohn 1984</LINK>.</LI>
<LI>The Clinical Global Impression (CGI) (<LINK REF="REF-Guy-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guy 1976</LINK>) is a global rating of all domains of a patient's current condition. It is a seven-point scale, from one (very much improved) to seven (very much worse), four indicating no change. The assessment is conducted by the same clinician at both time points with input from relatives or carers.

<P>(5) Cognitive function</P>
<UL>
<LI>The cognitive part of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cog) (<LINK REF="REF-Rosen-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosen 1984</LINK>) comprises 11 individual tests, spoken language ability (zero to five), comprehension of spoken language (zero to five), recall of test instructions (zero to five), word finding difficulty (zero to five), following commands (zero to five), naming object (zero to five), construction drawing (zero to five), ideational praxis (zero to five), orientation (zero to eight), word recall (zero to 10) and word recognition (zero to 12). The total score ranges from zero to 70, the high score indicating greater impairment. This rating scale was used in <LINK REF="STD-Emeriau-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Emeriau 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-M_x00f6_ller-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Möller 2001</LINK>.</LI>
<LI>The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) (<LINK REF="REF-Folstein-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Folstein 1975</LINK>) was developed as a short test suitable for the elderly with dementia. It concentrates on the cognitive aspects of mental function, and the five sections cover orientation, immediate recall, attention and calculation, delayed recall and language. A maximum score of 30 indicates no impairment. This rating scale was used in <LINK REF="STD-Emeriau-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Emeriau 2000</LINK>.</LI>
<LI>Erzigkeit's Short Syndrome test (EST) (<LINK REF="REF-Erzigkeit-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Erzigkeit 1977</LINK>) includes nine subtests that measure psychomotor co-ordination, attentiveness, immediate and delayed repetition, interference, speed and perception.

<P>(6) Combination Scales</P>
<P>Several scales used in earlier studies combine elements that are now more commonly assessed using separate instruments. Such scales have been used as a different method from 'overall clinical impression' for the systematic global assessment of dementia. These combination scales typically have several subscales, the results of which are sometimes presented separately and can be included in meta-analyses.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Gottfries-Brane-Steen Scale (GBS) (<LINK REF="REF-Gottfries-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gottfries 1982</LINK>) is a 26-item, physician-assessed observer scale based on caregiver's information and an interview with the patient. It comprises three subscales: motor performance, intellectual and emotional capacity, and a group of six symptoms commonly observed in dementia. This rating scale was used in <LINK REF="STD-Cucinotta-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Cucinotta 1987</LINK>.</LI>
<LI>Nurse's Observational Scale for Geriatric Patients (NOSGER) (<LINK REF="REF-Spiegel-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spiegel 1991</LINK>) contains 30 items of behaviour, each rated in a five-point scale according to frequency of occurrence. Item scores are summarized into six dimension scores (memory, instrumental activities of daily life, self-care activities of daily living, mood, social behaviour, and disturbance behaviour). This rating scale was used in <LINK REF="STD-M_x00f6_ller-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Möller 2001</LINK>.</LI>
<LI>Blessed Dementia Rating Scale (BDRS) (<LINK REF="REF-Blessed-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blessed 1968</LINK>) has six sections: the first three measure changes in performance of everyday activities, habits, and personality, interests and drive as answered by the carer. Each section is scored zero (normal) to 28 (severe). The second three sections form the cognitive test, and information, memory and concentration are each assessed on a score of zero (complete failure) to 37 (normal).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Incomplete outcome data</HEADING>
<P>Intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses were performed in four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Cucinotta-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Cucinotta 1987</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Emeriau-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Emeriau 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Grossmann-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Grossmann 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-M_x00f6_ller-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Möller 2001</LINK>). The other trials had withdrawals post randomisation and did not use ITT analysis. One study did not report the missing participants or withdrawals (<LINK REF="STD-Branconnier-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Branconnier 1977</LINK>). The reasons for withdrawal were not reported in three studies: <LINK REF="STD-Cohn-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Cohn 1984</LINK> (28 withdrawals, 37.3%), <LINK REF="STD-Cox-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Cox 1981</LINK> (two withdrawals, 6.3%) and <LINK REF="STD-Cucinotta-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Cucinotta 1987</LINK> (one withdrawal, 3.3%).

In <LINK REF="STD-M_x00f6_ller-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Möller 2001</LINK>, the continuous data of rating scales was transformed into a response rate to treatment, defined as a success if the final score was less than baseline. Only the remaining study (<LINK REF="STD-Cox-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Cox 1981</LINK>) reported all expected outcomes clearly, although the study protocol was not available. Moreover, for five studies it was possible to calculate the missing SDs from either SEs (<LINK REF="STD-Cucinotta-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Cucinotta 1987</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Grossmann-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Grossmann 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Saldmann-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Saldmann 1991</LINK>), or P values (<LINK REF="STD-Cohn-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Cohn 1984</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Emeriau-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Emeriau 2000</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Section 1. Effect of naftidrofuryl on patients with dementia</HEADING>
<P>We pooled all available data from nine trials into the analysis.</P>
<P>(1) Global Impression: There was a significant difference in the clinical impression of change, as measured by item 19 of SCAG, in favour of naftidrofuryl (MD 2.70 points, 95% CI 0.07 to 5.33, P =0.04) assessed by <LINK REF="STD-Cohn-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Cohn 1984</LINK>. Moreover, there was a significant difference in the response rate of clinical impression, as measured by the CGI, in favour of naftidrofuryl (OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.91, P = 0.01) assessed by <LINK REF="STD-M_x00f6_ller-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Möller 2001</LINK>. However, the larger dose group (600 mg/day) in this trial produced a non-significant finding in favour of naftidrofuryl (OR 1.62, 95% CI 0.85 to 3.10), while the lower dose group (400 mg/day) led to a positive result (OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.08 to 4.03). Since no available data were reported in <LINK REF="STD-Branconnier-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Branconnier 1977</LINK>, we have to present the conclusion of this study as "no significant differences were observed on the severity of illness, global improvement, or effectiveness index scores on the CGI".</P>
<P>(2) Adverse events (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>): A pooled analysis of these results indicated no significant difference in the odds of adverse events in the naftidrofuryl group as compared with the placebo group (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.60). No heterogeneity was detected between the studies (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%).</P>
<P>(3) Functional performance and behaviour (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>): Standardized mean differences were used here due to the different rating scales used. There was a significant difference in change of activities of daily living and behavioural disturbances, as assessed using CBRS (<LINK REF="STD-Cox-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Cox 1981</LINK>) and SGRS (<LINK REF="STD-Saldmann-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Saldmann 1991</LINK>), in favour of naftidrofuryl (-1.04 standardized points, 95% CI -1.73 to -0.35, P = 0.003), with a high-level of heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 54%). The reason remained unclear. Both <LINK REF="STD-Cox-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Cox 1981</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Saldmann-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Saldmann 1991</LINK> studied mild to moderate senile dementia for two months 300 mg daily use, or three months 400 mg daily use, respectively. Interestingly, the larger the dose used, the smaller the effect was observed. Another clue was that daily multi-vitamin preparation and potassium 600mg were given three times daily additionally to both groups in <LINK REF="STD-Cox-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Cox 1981</LINK>.</P>
<P>(4) Mood (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>): Standardized mean differences were used here due to the different rating scales used. The patients' mood benefited from the use of naftidrofuryl (-0.80 standardized points, 95% CI -1.26 to -0.34, P = 0.0006) with no discernible heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%), as assessed on Depressive Scale (<LINK REF="STD-Grossmann-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Grossmann 1990</LINK>) and HRSD (<LINK REF="STD-Cucinotta-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Cucinotta 1987</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Saldmann-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Saldmann 1991</LINK> also found a similar result which assessed change from baseline of mood by EACG subscore (MD -0.90 points, 95% CI -1.73 to -0.07, P = 0.03).</P>
<P>(5) Cognition: Standardized mean differences were used here due to the different rating scales used. The pooled analysis showed a significant improvement in favour of naftidrofuryl (-0.36 standardized points, 95% CI -0.71 to -0.02, P = 0.04). No heterogeneity was detected between the studies (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%).

Furthermore, the response rate of cognition measured by ADAS-Cog also found a significant difference in favour of naftidrofuryl (OR 2.46, 95% CI 1.46 to 4.14, P = 0.0007) in <LINK REF="STD-M_x00f6_ller-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Möller 2001</LINK>. However, <LINK REF="STD-Gottschalk-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Gottschalk 1980</LINK> concluded that "No significant change occurred on the Gottschalk Cognitive Impairment Scale scores after 1 to 3 months on either Praxilene or placebo" without usable data.</P>
<P>(6) Combination scales: There was a significant difference in the change of behaviour, mood and cognition, as measured by SCAG, in favour of naftidrofuryl (MD 1.00 points, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.97, P = 0.04) assessed by <LINK REF="STD-Cohn-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Cohn 1984</LINK>. Moreover, <LINK REF="STD-M_x00f6_ller-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Möller 2001</LINK> found a significant difference between naftidrofuryl and placebo in functional performance, behaviour, mood and cognition covered by SCAG (OR 2.83, 95% CI 1.68 to 4.78, P &lt; 0.0001). However, the analysis of <LINK REF="STD-Cucinotta-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Cucinotta 1987</LINK> found no difference between naftidrofuryl and placebo in functional performance and behaviour, mood and cognition as measured by both GBS (MD 1.40 points, 95% CI -9.29 to 12.09, P = 0.80) and BDRS (MD 0.90 points, 95% CI -1.47 to 3.27, P = 0.46).

<P>(7) Death (Figure 6): The analysis found no relationship between death and naftidrofuryl use (OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.34 to 3.72), with no discernible heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-10-18 08:52:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Donghao Lv">
<P>The results indicate a beneficial effect of naftidrofuryl on functional performance, behaviour, cognitive function, and mood disturbance in patients with dementia. However, there is little supporting evidence on clinical global impression. <LINK REF="STD-Cohn-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Cohn 1984</LINK> reported a positive result on this outcome,  <A HREF="http://www.archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/viewDiff?documentPK=014300080411093031&amp;versionPK1=38757291133604699657110319143015&amp;versionPK2=28586872553820642621110613150315#STD-Branconnier-1977_x002f_1978">Branconnier 1977/1978</A> failed to report it and  <A HREF="http://www.archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/viewDiff?documentPK=014300080411093031&amp;versionPK1=38757291133604699657110319143015&amp;versionPK2=28586872553820642621110613150315#STD-M_x00f6_ller-2000_x002f_2001">Möller 2000/2001</A> found a positive result confined to the lower dose group. Thus, it is hard to say whether or not the beneficial effects of naftidrofuryl on various symptom scales are reliably translated into clinically detectable changes.</P>
<P>Möller's study (<LINK REF="STD-M_x00f6_ller-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Möller 2001</LINK>) reporting a significant benefit of naftidrofuryl on global impression was conducted in patients with mild to severe vascular and mixed dementia. Because the positive result was confined to the lower dosage group, the results should be viewed  with some caution. However, results on all other outcomes reported for patients with vascular and mixed dementia were also positive. For patients with unspecified senile dementia, the results also showed that functional performance, mood and behaviour of patients benefited from the use of naftidrofuryl, but no evidence of a benefit on cognitive function. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Cohn-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Cohn 1984</LINK>) reported benefit on clinical global impression, but another study (<LINK REF="STD-Branconnier-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Branconnier 1977</LINK>) failed to report on this outcome. For Alzheimer's disease, a beneficial effect was found on mood on one scale in one trial; results on more global symptom scales were negative.</P>
<P>Dividing the studies by duration, the shorter studies suggest an early benefit on functional performance, cognition, behaviour and mood decline, while the pooled analysis of longer studies found a similar benefit on cognition and mood.</P>
<P>In respect of safety, there is some evidence that naftidrofuryl is well-tolerated by patients with dementia. All pooled subgroup analysis showed that there did not seem to be a disproportionate number of serious adverse events or deaths in the naftidrofuryl group compared with the placebo group. Moreover, no included trials reported severe adverse effects due to treatment with naftidrofuryl, and two trials (<A HREF="http://www.archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=28586872553820642621110613150315&amp;format=REVMAN#STD-Emeriau-2000">Emeriau 2000</A>, <A HREF="http://www.archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=28586872553820642621110613150315&amp;format=REVMAN#STD-M_x00f6_ller-2000_x002f_2001">Möller 2000/2001</A>) reported that no clinically significant abnormalities in laboratory test results were observed with a greater frequency in the naftidrofuryl group. However, <A HREF="http://www.archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=28586872553820642621110613150315&amp;format=REVMAN#STD-Cohn-1984">Cohn 1984</A> reported that the naftidrofuryl group had a somewhat higher occurrence of gastrointestinal disorders, but without further details. All  studies included in this review gave naftidrofuryl orally. Earlier systematic reviews reported that intravenous naftidrofuryl given to patients with critical limb ischaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2008</LINK>) and acute stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Leonardi_x002d_Bee-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leonardi-Bee 2007</LINK>) might be associated with more adverse events, including severe adverse events, and <A HREF="http://www.archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=28586872553820642621110613150315&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-De-Backer-2005">De Backer 2005</A> found an increased risk of minor adverse events in patients with intermittent claudication taking naftidrofuryl orally (OR 1.99, 95% CI 0.96 to 4.11, P = 0.06).</P>
<P>The identified studies partially addressed the objectives of the review. First, the participants of most trials were restricted to unspecified or senile dementia. Severe Alzheimer's disease did not feature in the identified studies, and severe vascular and mixed dementia figured in a single trial (<LINK REF="STD-M_x00f6_ller-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Möller 2001</LINK>). Secondly, the design of included studies overlooks some important outcomes, for example quality of life, dependency and effect on carer. These outcomes should be explored in further studies in order to assess naftidrofuryl for dementia comprehensively.</P>
<P>Although 847 randomised participants were pooled into analysis, the overall body of evidence is impaired by the potentially large risk of bias of identified studies. The studies are diverse in terms of the diagnostic criteria, types of participants and the selection of outcomes. The studies used a variety of rating scales to assess the outcome of treatment, some of which are not in use today. Because most studies were conducted between 1980 and 1990, the methods of randomisation, allocation and blinding were not described in detail. Few studies performed an ITT analysis, and some had a large number lost to follow-up (<A HREF="http://www.archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=28586872553820642621110613150315&amp;format=REVMAN#STD-Cohn-1984">Cohn 1984</A>, <A HREF="http://www.archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=28586872553820642621110613150315&amp;format=REVMAN#STD-Gottschalk-1980">Gottschalk 1980</A>). Moreover, only one trial (<A HREF="http://www.archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=28586872553820642621110613150315&amp;format=REVMAN#STD-Cox-1981">Cox 1981</A>) provided the complete data as mean ± SD, while other studies either only reported the mean, or only presented P values from their own analysis.</P>
<P>In summary, the currently low-quality evidence shows that naftidrofuryl may have benefits on performance, behaviour, cognition, and mood for patients with dementia. However, the evidence of benefit on global impression is very weak. Naftidrofuryl appears to be safe with no excess side effects compared with placebo.</P>

<P>On the basis of the published studies, the low-quality evidence shows that, using naftidrofuryl, people with dementia may benefit on performance, behaviour, cognition, and mood. However, the benefit on global impression is inconsistent and unconvincing. Oral administration of naftidrofuryl is well-tolerated by patients with dementia.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-10-17 15:04:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Donghao Lv">
<P>Although the data are not robust enough to make a clinical recommendation, they are sufficiently positive to justify a further definitive trial to examine the potential for naftidrofuryl. The judgements required for the selection of the appropriate diagnostic group, study duration, dose and outcome measures for such a study are not simple given the variation in these parameters in the existing literature. However, since licensed treatments for Alzheimer's but not vascular dementia are now available, and since the benefit is arguably more consistent across all outcomes in the 'vascular and mixed' group, the case is stronger for focusing a monotherapy trial on those with vascular or mixed dementia. Results should be stratified on the basis of any prior cholinesterase inhibitor treatment. Based on response rates in the clinical global impression of 55% and 69% on placebo and drug respectively (see <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>) and alpha and beta errors of 0.05 and 0.01 respectively this would require a sample of 265 in each group. Duration should be of at least six months. Outcome measures should cover the conventional range of domains including quality of life and the effect on the carer.</P>
