<P>Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice for most patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Strategies to increase donor organ availability and to prolong the transplanted kidney's survival have become priorities in kidney transplantation. Standard immunosuppressive therapy consists of initial treatment and maintenance regimes to prevent rejection and short courses of more intensive immunosuppressive therapy to treat episodes of acute rejection. This review compared tacrolimus and cyclosporin used as primary immunosuppression for kidney transplant recipients. Thirty studies (4102 patients) were included. Tacrolimus was shown to be superior to cyclosporin in improving graft survival and preventing acute rejection after kidney transplantation, but increases post-transplant diabetes, neurological and gastrointestinal side effects. There was insufficient information to assess the cost of tacrolimus versus cyclosporin, and there was a general failure to consider global quality of life (QOL) for transplant recipients which may inform our understanding of patient preference and compliance.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice for most patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Standard protocols in use typically involve three drug groups each directed to a site in the T-cell activation or proliferation cascade which are central to the rejection process: calcineurin inhibitors (e.g. cyclosporin, tacrolimus), anti-proliferative agents (e.g. azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil) and steroids (prednisolone). It remains unclear whether new regimens are more specific or simply more potent immunosuppressants.<BR/> </P>

<P>MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane Renal Group's specialist register and conference proceedings were searched to identify relevant reports of randomised controlled trials (RCTs).

<P>Data were synthesised (random effects model) and results expressed as risk ratio (RR), values &lt;1 favouring tacrolimus, with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-08-26 14:18:32 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>123 reports from 30 studies (4102 patients) were included. At six months graft loss was significantly reduced in tacrolimus-treated recipients (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.86), and this effect was persistent up to three years. Meta-regression showed that this benefit diminished as higher trough levels of tacrolimus were targeted (P = 0.04), after allowing for differences in cyclosporin formulation (P = 0.97) and cyclosporin target trough level (P = 0.38). At one year, tacrolimus patients suffered less acute rejection (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.79), and less steroid-resistant rejection (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.64), but more insulin-requiring diabetes mellitus (RR 1.86, 1.11 to 3.09), tremor, headache, diarrhoea, dyspepsia and vomiting. Cyclosporin-treated recipients experienced significantly more constipation and cosmetic side-effects. We demonstrated no differences in infection or malignancy.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Tacrolimus is superior to cyclosporin in improving graft survival and preventing acute rejection after kidney transplantation, but increases post-transplant diabetes, neurological and gastrointestinal side effects. Treating 100 recipients with tacrolimus instead of cyclosporin would avoid 12 suffering acute rejection, two losing their graft but cause an extra five to become insulin-requiring diabetics. </P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-08-26 14:25:30 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice for most patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In the developed world there are approximately 280 patients/million population (pmp) with a functioning kidney transplant, a figure which has increased throughout the 1990s. The transplant rate is around 30 pmp and between 30% to 40% of transplanted organs come from living donors. Graft survival beyond five years has remained unchanged since the 1970s, with an average annual decline of 5% (<LINK REF="REF-Mathew-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mathew 2001</LINK>). Waiting lists for transplantation continue to grow because demand exceeds organ availability. Strategies to increase donor organ availability and to prolong kidney allograft survival have become priorities in kidney transplantation (<LINK REF="REF-ANZDATA-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">ANZDATA 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-UNOS-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNOS 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Transplant outcome is influenced by many factors. In the absence of effective immunosuppression, transplanted organs undergo progressive immune mediated injury (rejection). Standard immunosuppressive therapy consists of initial induction and maintenance regimes to prevent rejection and short courses of more intensive immunosuppressive therapy to treat episodes of acute rejection. Standard protocols in use typically involve three drug groups each directed to a site in the T-cell activation or proliferation cascade which are central to the rejection process: calcineurin inhibitors (e.g. cyclosporin, tacrolimus), anti-proliferative agents (e.g. azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil) and steroids (prednisolone) (<LINK REF="REF-Hong-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hong 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Short-term graft survival is related to control of the acute rejection process. The risk of graft rejection is greatest in the immediate post-transplant period, and immunosuppression is therefore initiated at high levels. This is achieved either by using higher doses of the agents used in maintenance therapy, or by adding either a polyclonal anti-lymphocyte antibody (e.g. anti-thymocyte globulin), or a monoclonal antibody (e.g. anti-CD3-muromonab), or by adding an interleukin 2 receptor antagonist (basiliximab, daclizumab). </P>
<P>The major cause of long-term graft loss is chronic allograft nephropathy, an ill-defined process characterised clinically by progressive deterioration in graft function, proteinuria and hypertension and pathologically by changes on biopsy. Chronic allograft nephropathy is a consequence of immunological and non-immunological injury. Immunological factors include HLA matching, episodes of acute rejection and suboptimal immunosuppression. Important non-immunological factors implicated are donor organ characteristics, delayed graft function, recipient related factors, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia. Recently the acute and chronic toxicity of calcineurin inhibitors has also been implicated (<LINK REF="REF-Pascual-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pascual 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Maintenance therapy aims to minimise the side effects of any single drug whilst maintaining adequate overall immunosuppression. The overall level of maintenance immunosuppression is mainly determined by the perceived risk of rejection. High-risk groups include young adults and children and 'sensitised' patients. Sensitised patients are those with high titres of pre-formed circulating anti-HLA antibodies, which may come about as a result of underlying illness, previous transplantation, previous pregnancy or multiple blood transfusions. </P>
<P>Both tacrolimus and cyclosporin inhibit the action of calcineurin, a pivotal enzyme, thus preventing the dephosphorylation reactions essential for lymphokine gene transcription. Tacrolimus is a macrolide derived from the fungus <I>Streptomyces tsukubaensis,</I> and was developed as an alternative to cyclosporin. Like cyclosporin, tacrolimus inhibits the first phase of T-cell activation. Tacrolimus binds to a cytoplasmic immunophilin to form a complex, which then binds to and inhibits the phosphatase activity of calcineurin, so preventing the critical dephosphorylation reactions necessary for early lymphokine (e.g. interleukin-2) gene transcription. Cyclosporin is structurally distinct and binds a different cytoplasmic receptor (cyclophilin A), but ultimately also inhibits the action of calcineurin in the same way (<LINK REF="REF-Denton-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Denton 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Suthanthiran-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suthanthiran 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Tacrolimus was first used in transplantation in 1989. It has been increasingly used world-wide since the mid-1990s, though its exact role in kidney transplantation remains incompletely defined. Tacrolimus is used for graft rejection prophylaxis, and for 'rescue' therapy (treatment of refractory or chronic graft rejection or for those not tolerating cyclosporin). Most immunosuppressants have been tested in combination with either tacrolimus or cyclosporin. Recently immunosuppressive regimens using tacrolimus have been favoured. It is widely perceived that tacrolimus offers an advantage with respect to the acute rejection rate (<LINK REF="REF-Denton-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Denton 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vanrenterghem-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vanrenterghem 1999</LINK>) Currently, there are pronounced global differences in the use of tacrolimus, with 59% of new renal transplant recipients in the USA but only 22% in Australia receiving tacrolimus as primary immunosuppression. At one year post-transplantation, 59% patients in the USA and 29% in Australia are on tacrolimus (<LINK REF="REF-ANZDATA-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">ANZDATA 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-UNOS-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNOS 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Known adverse reactions are similar for both calcineurin inhibitors (although the exact balance differs between the two). Tacrolimus has been associated with more diabetes and neurotoxic reactions, but with less hypertension, dyslipidaemia, hirsutism and gingival hyperplasia than cyclosporin. There is uncertainty about the equivalence of their nephrotoxic effects and how these adverse effects of therapy are related to patient and graft survival (<LINK REF="REF-Denton-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Denton 1999</LINK>). These distinct adverse side-effect profiles may impact on individual patient compliance and quality of life differently (<LINK REF="REF-Henry-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henry 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kasiske-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kasiske 2000a</LINK>).</P>
<P>There has been considerable variability in the use of immunosuppressive agents by clinicians, in combination and dosage regimen, both geographically and within patient groups. Currently in some countries, opinion favours minimising early graft injury by using induction therapy to prevent acute rejection, particularly in high-risk patients. However there is no direct proof that a decrease in early rejection rates translates into a uniform increase in long term graft survival for all. It remains unclear whether new regimens are more specific or simply more potent immunosuppressants. There is concern that newer drugs or combinations, whilst apparently improving early graft outcome, may in fact increase the risk of malignant or cardiovascular disease in the longer term, thereby curtailing patient survival (death with functioning allograft). In the absence of clear evidence, optimal maintenance therapy continues to be debated (<LINK REF="REF-Vanrenterghem-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vanrenterghem 2001</LINK>).</P>

<P>Data was extracted first from individual studies and then pooled for summary estimates using a random effects model. Dichotomous outcome results were expressed as risk ratiostudy (RR), where values of &lt;1 favoured tacrolimus treatment. Continuous outcomes were expressed as mean difference (MD), both with 95% confidence intervals (CI).</P>
<P>Heterogeneity amongst study results was analysed using a Cochran Q test (n -1 degrees of freedom), with P &lt; 0·05 used to denote statistical significance, and with I² calculated to measure the proportion of total variation in the estimates of treatment effect that was due to heterogeneity beyond chance (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). Subgroup analyses based on publication type, study methodological quality and baseline immunological risk of study population were undertaken, aiming to establish whether the estimated treatment effects were robust to reasonable assumptions of the influence of these potential biases. Analysis was undertaken using both random and fixed effects models, and no important differences were observed. Results reported here used the random effects model, as this is more conservative in the presence of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2001</LINK>). Publication bias was assessed for the primary outcomes, using funnel plots of the log odds ratio (OR) (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Stratified meta-analysis and meta-regression were used to explore important clinical differences among the studies that might potentially be expected to alter the magnitude of treatment effect, using restricted maximum-likelihood to estimate the between study variance. Subgroups were defined <I>a priori </I>and included the cyclosporin formulation (solution or microemulsion), exposure levels to both tacrolimus and cyclosporin, the specific combination of additional baseline immunosuppressive agents and the dose of steroids used. Exposure to cyclosporin and tacrolimus was calculated using the midpoint of the declared intention-to-treat target range at the 12-hour post-dose nadir (trough), for all time points available, averaged over the first year post-transplantation.</P>
<P>Meta-regression was performed for the primary outcomes of acute rejection and graft loss (death censored), and for the most commonly reported complication, diabetes mellitus requiring insulin treatment for &gt;30 days in previously non-diabetic patients, using data up to the first year post-transplantation, with a priori subgroups as explanatory variables. Meta-regression was undertaken on the log RR scale using STATA software (Stata8, StataCorp LP, Texas, USA), each study weighting equal to the inverse of the variance of the estimate for that study, with between study variance estimated using the restricted maximum-likelihood method. Results were expressed as the ratio of the RR within each subgroup explanatory variable.</P>

A further study was conducted exclusively in children (<LINK REF="STD-Trompeter-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Trompeter 2002</LINK>) and another in African-Americans (<LINK REF="STD-Raofi-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Raofi 1999</LINK>), both populations widely perceived to be at greater risk of rejection and complications following renal transplantation (<LINK REF="REF-Cecka-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cecka 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ojo-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ojo 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Additional baseline immunosuppression varied both within studies (where three arms were investigated) and amongst studies. Three studies varied an antiproliferative agent across three study arms, investigating combinations of tacrolimus (<LINK REF="STD-Busque-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Busque 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 2000</LINK>), and cyclosporin (<LINK REF="STD-Weimer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Weimer 2002</LINK>) with mycophenolate (MMF) or azathioprine. Azathioprine was used in both tacrolimus and cyclosporin arms in 16 studies and MMF in eight studies. One study used sirolimus (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2002</LINK>), one used mirzoribine (<LINK REF="STD-Ichimaru-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ichimaru 2001</LINK>), one used no antiproliferative (<LINK REF="STD-White-2000" TYPE="STUDY">White 2000</LINK>) and one study did not state which antiproliferative was used (<LINK REF="STD-Shapiro-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Shapiro 1991</LINK>). Twelve studies used antibody induction agents. Seventeen studies reported their corticosteroid reducing regimen in detail, whereas the remaining 14 studies gave noted only that "local protocol" was followed, or that "a standard reducing schedule" was used (<LINK REF="STD-Agha-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Agha 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Baskin-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Baskin 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Campos-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Campos 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Egfjord-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Egfjord 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-El-Haggan-2002" TYPE="STUDY">El Haggan 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heering-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Heering 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ichimaru-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ichimaru 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laskow-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Laskow 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shapiro-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Shapiro 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Toz-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Toz 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tsinalis-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Tsinalis 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weimer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Weimer 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The reporting of outcomes was variable (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>) with transplant-focused outcomes reported far more frequently (e.g. acute rejection, 24 studies) than complications of immunosuppression or drug-specific adverse reactions (e.g. CMV infection, nine studies). For many adverse events there was wide variation in the measures reported, and the time post-transplantation at which the data was collected. Although 12 studies (41%) reported dyslipidaemia, there was no consistent definition or measure used. Eleven studies reported hypercholesterolaemia, three reported the number of participants with elevated (level not consistently defined) cholesterol, and the remaining eight studies reported the summary average of the total cholesterol. Of these eight, two did not report the precision of these estimates (i.e. standard error or deviation) and so the information could not be combined, and the remaining six studies reported at five different time intervals post-transplantation, ranging from one month to three years, making meaningful meta-analysis difficult. Similar inconsistencies applied to reporting of measures of graft function and hypertension.</P>

<P>All primary outcomes favoured the use of tacrolimus over cyclosporin. Graft loss censored for death was reduced in tacrolimus treated recipients at all time points, and reached conventional thresholds of statistical significance at six months and three years post-transplantation, where graft loss was reduced by 44% and 29% respectively (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>

<P>Whether diagnosed clinically or confirmed by biopsy, significantly fewer tacrolimus treated patients experienced acute rejection at any time point. The effect of tacrolimus in reducing the number of participants experiencing steroid-resistant rejection was even more marked, with a 55% reduction at six months (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>
<U>.2</U>: RR 0.45, 95%CI 0.33 to 0.60).

<P>The only consistently reported measure of graft function across studies was SCr. At six months, tacrolimus treated patients had a significantly lower SCr of 15.88 µmol/L less than cyclosporin treated patients (<LINK REF="CMP-001.22" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.22</LINK>
<U>.3</U>, seven studies: 95% CI -30.30 to -1.47), although there was significant heterogeneity of study results (P=0.04, I² = 54.8<B>%</B>). This heterogeneity was not explained by variations in study design, or methodology, but was partially explained by examining the clarity of reporting of the outcome. Three studies clearly reported the number of participants who contributed SCr measurements to the mean values (<LINK REF="CMP-007.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.2</LINK>

<P>A limited number of studies sufficiently reported data on incidence of recipients with infection or malignancy, and no differences in treatment effects were demonstrated for these outcomes.</P>
<P>Studies reporting disturbance of glucose metabolism used variable definitions. The most consistent definition used was the development of new diabetes mellitus, defined as a requirement for insulin therapy for more than 30 days duration. The risk of new diabetes in previously non-diabetic recipients at six months, one and three years was significantly increased in tacrolimus treated recipients (<LINK REF="CMP-001.34" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.34</LINK>
<U>.2</U>: RR 2.56, 95% CI 1.37 to 4.78; <LINK REF="CMP-001.34" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.34</LINK>

<U>.5</U>: RR 3.86, 95%CI 2.01 to 7.41 respectively). The results at one year showed significant heterogeneity (P = 0.01, I² = 54.3%) which was largely due to <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2002</LINK> which reported very different rates of new diabetes; 9.0% in the tacrolimus arms compared to an average of 12.9% in the other studies, and 20% in the cyclosporin arm, compared to an average of 5.5% in the other studies. This was not explicable by differences in methodology or study population, but this was the only study to use sirolimus as a co-intervention. Sensitivity analysis (<LINK REF="CMP-007.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.4</LINK>
<U>.2</U>) showed a RR of 2.19 (95% CI 1.42 to 3.38), and much reduced heterogeneity (P = 0.18, I² = 27.5%) when this study was removed from the analysis. The proportion of new diabetics whose insulin requirement was sustained and on-going without recovery was similarly increased for tacrolimus patients at six months (<LINK REF="CMP-001.33" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.33</LINK>
<U>.2</U>: RR 2.61, 95% CI 1.16 to 5.85), one year (<LINK REF="CMP-001.22" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.22</LINK>

<U>.5</U>: RR 3.26, 95% CI 1.62 to 6.57).</P>
<P>Total cholesterol was significantly lower in tacrolimus treated patients at six months (<LINK REF="CMP-001.30" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.30</LINK>
<U>.3</U>, 3 studies: MD -0.58 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.77 to -0.39). Triglyceride levels were lower for tacrolimus treated patients, but the two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Margreiter-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Margreiter 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2002</LINK>) contributing data expressed their data differently (arithmetic versus geometric mean values) and so results could not be reliably combined.</P>
<P>Patients treated with tacrolimus were significantly more likely than those receiving cyclosporin to experience tremor and headache and to suffer dyspepsia, vomiting, diarrhoea and hypomagnesaemia. Patients treated with cyclosporin were significantly more likely to experience constipation, hirsutism and gingival hyperplasia.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analysis and meta-regression</HEADING>
<P>Subgroup analysis was undertaken based on three study attributes; publication type, study methodological quality and baseline immunological risk of the study population. There was no evidence of any difference in the summary estimates of effect for graft loss. However, there was a significant difference (P = 0·01) between the estimate of effect for acute rejection dependent on publication status of studies. Studies published only in non peer-reviewed journals or abstract form showed no difference between tacrolimus and cyclosporin treated patients (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>
<U>.1</U>, three studies: RR 1·02, 95% CI 0·57 to 1·82), whereas those published in peer reviewed journals demonstrated a significant reduction in patients experiencing acute rejection (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>
<U>.2</U>, 11 studies: RR 0·64, 95% CI 0·57 to 0·72). We were unable to further determine whether this difference reflected publication bias, other reporting bias or true heterogeneity, as the funnel plot (not shown) for this outcome was uninformative, and study methodology details absent for some studies.</P>
<P>When studies conducted exclusively in adult recipients of primary cadaveric transplants (low immunological risk) were compared to studies containing a proportion of recipients of subsequent transplants, children or African-Americans (mixed and high immunological risk), there was no evidence of any difference demonstrated for new diabetes mellitus, acute rejection or graft loss between risk groups (Analysis 4; <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> - <I>Subgroup analyses).</I>
</P>
<P>Univariate meta-regression (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK> - <I>Meta-regression and confounding</I>) showed no difference in graft loss (censored for death) for microemulsion (Neoral) over solution (Sandimmun) formulations of cyclosporin (P = 0·48), or for the target trough range of cyclosporin (P = 0·76), or for the use of MMF over azathioprine (P = 0·59). Most notably, higher tacrolimus doses were associated with an increased risk of graft loss compared with lower tacrolimus doses. This difference remained significant (P = 0·04), after allowing for differences in cyclosporin formulation and cyclosporin dosage. This relationship is demonstrated in <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK> (risk ratiostudy<I> of graft loss (censored for death) versus weighted average of target rough levels)</I> and suggests that when tacrolimus targets are &#8804; 10 ng/mL, the benefit in graft survival is maximal.</P>
<P>The benefit of tacrolimus over cyclosporin in reducing the number of patients experiencing acute rejection did not vary after allowing for tacrolimus dose (P = 0·77), cyclosporin formulation (P = 0·99), cyclosporin dosage (P = 0·14), or different antiproliferative agents (P = 0·98) <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK> - <I>Meta-regression and confounding</I>. For patients with new diabetes mellitus requiring &gt;30 days of insulin therapy, in univariate analysis there was no difference demonstrated for antiproliferative agent (P = 0·29) or steroid dose (&gt; 10 mg/d versus &lt; 10 mg/d at three months post-transplantation; adjusted RR 1·36, 95% CI 0·32 to 5·71; P = 0·27). However, univariate analysis did demonstrate reduced risk with microemulsion cyclosporin (P = 0·006) and an increased risk with higher tacrolimus trough levels (P = 0·007). Multivariate meta-regression demonstrated that the increased risk of diabetes conferred by tacrolimus therapy did not vary after allowing for cyclosporin dose (P = 0·61), but although the effect of microemulsion cyclosporin remained significant (P = 0·003), tacrolimus trough level no longer demonstrated a statistically significant effect (P=0·10). Such a change in the significance of tacrolimus levels suggests an interaction and residual confounding between the targeted levels of tacrolimus and the choice of cyclosporin formulation and levels across studies, and this relationship is demonstrated in <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK> (risk ratiostudy<I> of diabetes mellitus requiring insulin treatment for &gt; 30 days)</I>. When the analysis was repeated, restricted to studies using microemulsion cyclosporin, tacrolimus level remained significant (P = 0.003) after allowing for differences in antiproliferative agent (P = 0.73), further suggesting that risk of diabetes rises with tacrolimus exposure level. Unfortunately there was not consistent reporting of all clinical details across all studies (e.g. only 10 studies reporting new diabetes also reported steroid dosage), so this prevented the intended more complex analyses examining clinical differences allowing for methodological differences.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-08-26 14:23:10 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Summary of key findings</HEADING>
<P>Compared with cyclosporin, treating recipients of kidney transplants with tacrolimus resulted in a substantial improvement in graft survival, with a 44% reduction in graft loss (censored for death) within the first six months after transplantation; an effect revealed only by meta-analysis, and not evident when considering each study in isolation. Treating with tacrolimus led to 31% fewer patients experiencing acute rejection, and 51% fewer experiencing severe rejection episodes that required therapy more intensive than steroids, within the first year post-transplantation.</P>
<P>Evidence from meta-regression suggested that the benefit in graft survival diminished when higher levels of tacrolimus were targeted, but was unaltered by differences in cyclosporin formulation, cyclosporin target trough level, or antiproliferative co-interventions across studies. However, none of these factors significantly altered the risk of acute rejection.</P>
<P>Tacrolimus-treated patients were between two and three times more likely than cyclosporin-treated recipients to develop new insulin-requiring diabetes mellitus post-transplantation, and also to experience neurological side-effects, whereas those taking cyclosporin experienced more cosmetic side-effects.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Strengths and limitations</HEADING>
<P>This systematic review was undertaken with widely inclusive criteria, in order to allow exploration of differences in effect that might arise as a result of obvious clinical and design differences among the studies, and also to highlight and summarise the totality of RCT evidence available. This approach led to identification of a large number of studies (30) involving 4102 participants, including unpublished and non-English language data sources, which were included. Confining a meta-analysis to published data or English language alone has been previously demonstrated to over-estimate positive treatment effects (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>The quality of data reporting the adverse effects of therapy was less informative than that for the benefits, and adverse effects were inconsistently expressed and grouped. The majority of studies did not report disturbances of glucose metabolism, or elicit new cases of diabetes that could be controlled by diet or oral hypoglycaemic agents, but used high diagnostic thresholds, recording only those cases requiring sustained insulin therapy. In addition, often the prevalent rather than incident cases were reported, with no indication of the numbers of patients with diabetes prior to transplantation. Both these aspects introduced bias, and are likely to contribute to the underestimation of the true burden of disturbed glucose metabolism within the post-transplant population. The value of increasing available evidence of potential harms associated with interventions (compared with potential benefits alone) has been widely recognised recently (<LINK REF="REF-Cuervo-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cuervo 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tunis-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tunis 2003</LINK>) and is not a problem peculiar to this review, but is common to many RCTs.</P>
<P>Progressive improvements in short-term outcomes post-transplantation have restricted clinician's ability to assess new therapy, as the event-rate of clinically important outcomes and the margin of expected differences has decreased. Therefore the numbers of participants required to adequately power studies has become so large that many new therapies can only be assessed in the context of large international multi-centre studies. Whilst acute rejection has a strong impact on early graft survival, recent cohort data suggests that decreasing acute rejection rates have not been matched by an increase in long term graft survival (<LINK REF="REF-Mathew-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mathew 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meier_x002d_Kriesche-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meier-Kriesche 2004</LINK>). Reliance on long-term 'hard' outcomes measured over many years is often cost-prohibitive, hence the reliance on composite and surrogate endpoints as study outcomes. Extended discussion on the validity of study endpoints is beyond the scope of this paper, though currently much debated by the transplantation community (<LINK REF="REF-Kasiske-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kasiske 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kasiske-2000b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kasiske 2000b</LINK>). What this review does demonstrate is that clearly defined, standardised, consistently used and reported clinical endpoints would greatly enhance clinician and consumer interpretation of study evidence (<LINK REF="REF-Hariharan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hariharan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lachenbruch-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lachenbruch 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The use of meta-regression to explore sources of heterogeneity in the meta-analysis was justified as the Cochran-Q and I<SUP>2</SUP> tests have low power (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 2002</LINK>). We investigated clinical differences that we had specified <I>a priori</I> likely to lead to differences in effect. The relationship described by meta-regression is an observational association across studies, and does not have the benefit of randomisation to under-pin interpretation of the results. Hence an association identified with one study characteristic may in reality reflect a true association with other correlated characteristics, which maybe unknown. The finding that studies undertaken with cyclosporin microemulsion showed a significantly lower risk of post-transplantation diabetes mellitus over those treated with cyclosporin solution (although no difference in graft loss or acute rejection) may be one such example of misclassification. Hence our interpretation is guarded. The finding that higher target levels of tacrolimus altered the risk of graft loss towards that experienced by patients on cyclosporin, so decreasing the advantage of tacrolimus over cyclosporin, we feel is more biologically plausible. This is based on what is known of the complex interplay between calcineurin nephrotoxicity, CAN and infection (<LINK REF="REF-de-Mattos-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Mattos 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gourishankar-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gourishankar 2002</LINK>), and the evidence that higher doses of calcineurin inhibitors increase progression of histological markers of graft damage (<LINK REF="REF-Nankivell-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nankivell 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nankivell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nankivell 2004</LINK>). Our meta-regression was not exhaustive, and it is possible that we may have failed to identify clinically important differences between subgroups that do exist (<LINK REF="REF-Berlin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berlin 2002</LINK>).</P>

<LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK> - <I>Applicability in clinical practice - absolute risk per 100 treated recipients </I>shows the applicability of our results to kidney transplant recipients. Based on this analysis, treating a 100 low risk patients (such as adult recipients of well matched, first transplants) with tacrolimus instead of cyclosporin would avoid six experiencing acute rejection; this number rises to 17 if considering high risk populations (such as sensitised recipients of subsequent grafts, or children). Tacrolimus therapy would avoid one low risk, but three high risk patients losing their grafts. In contrast, treating with tacrolimus would cause an extra five recipients excess harm by rendering them insulin-dependent diabetics. Evidence from meta-regression suggests that when tacrolimus is used, targeting lower trough levels will minimize graft loss and temper the increased risk of diabetes mellitus without increasing the risk of acute rejection.</P>
<P>One other systematic meta-analysis of four RCTs comparing tacrolimus to cyclosporin solution was published in 1999 (<LINK REF="REF-Knoll-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knoll 1999</LINK>). A more recent review of RCT and observational data examined post-transplant diabetes mellitus in solid organ transplant recipients, and included a seven-study meta-analysis of RCT data for kidney recipients, where we were able to identify 15 studies (<LINK REF="REF-Heisel-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heisel 2004</LINK>). Our results largely concur with this previous work, and with recent clinical guidelines published in the United Kingdom (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2004</LINK>), although with a larger number of studies to analyse, our estimates have greater precision, and we have extended the range of outcomes assessed.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-08-26 14:20:09 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Tacrolimus is superior to cyclosporin in preventing acute rejection after kidney transplantation, and tacrolimus treated patients have improved graft survival, although this is at the expense of increased post-transplant diabetes, neurological and gastrointestinal side effects. In applying this evidence to patients, the choice of calcineurin inhibitor for an individual patient is neither automatic nor straightforward, as risks of benefit and of drawbacks of each therapy must be balanced. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-08-26 14:20:09 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Our goal was to distil the body of evidence amassed over more than a decade of large multinational comparative randomised studies of the two calcineurin inhibitors, and particularly to generate estimates of each drugs negative effects, to highlight the deficits in knowledge and so set the research priorities for the coming decade. Despite the large number of comparative RCTs that have been performed, uncertainties remain, but we have been able to highlight the deficits in current knowledge. There was insufficient information in RCT reports to undertake a formal economic analysis, and there was a general failure to consider global quality of life (QOL) for transplant recipients, despite evidence that using validated disease-specific QOL instruments in transplant recipients may inform our understanding of patient preference and compliance (<LINK REF="REF-Reimer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reimer 2002</LINK>). The next step must be to construct a decision analysis, using this comprehensive summary of best available evidence, attaching utilities to the positive and adverse outcomes associated with each drug. This would provide clinicians with an algorithm trading off graft survival against the impact of diabetes and other complications of immunosuppression, so tailoring the choice of calcineurin inhibitor to an individual patient's circumstances. This would represent a translation of results of the best evidence currently available to inform individual patient care.</P>

<P>(*) Censored for death.<BR/>(#) New insulin-treated diabetes mellitus.<BR/>(+) Cyclosporin and tacrolimus levels are calculated by taking the weighted average of the 'intention-to-treat' target trough range values over the first year post transplantation, in ng/mL, using the stated initial target trough range and the target from three months post-transplantation.<BR/>(++) Adjusted ratio for each outcome is for multivariate model containing all explanatory variables that have an adjusted ratio quoted.<BR/>(ª) Not available. Insufficient data reported across studies, so limiting the number of possible confounders that could be controlled for in the multivariate model. Multivariate model limited to those factors felt, a priori, to be of most clinical interest and have most potential to confound the analysis.</P>

<P>(+) Calculated as absolute risk reduction/increase.<BR/>(*) Cyclosporin rates for acute rejection were calculated using summary rate in cyclosporin (control) arms of studies. Studies were grouped by immunological risk of participating population, based on known associations; age, race, PRA level, prior transplantation. These estimates were corroborated with current cohort data (ANZDATA). Rates of graft loss and diabetes were derived from the summary rates of these outcomes in the cyclosporine (control) arms of studies reported at one year. Tacrolimus rate calculated on basis of overall RR 0.69 for acute rejection, RR 0.77 for death-censored graft loss, and RR 1.86 for new onset diabetes mellitus requiring insulin for &gt;30 days, all at one year post-transplantation.</P>

<P>Figure 2. Risk ratio of graft loss (censored for death) versus the weighted average of the target tacrolimus trough levels over the first year after transplantation *.<BR/>* Each circle represents a study, with the area proportional to the inverse of the variance of the estimated treatment effect (larger circles show studies given more weight in the meta-analysis). The colour of the circles represents the formulation of cyclosporin used in each study; dark circles are cyclosporin solution, light grey circles are cyclosporin microemulsion.</P>

<P>Figure 3. Risk ratio of diabetes mellitus requiring insulin treatment for &gt;30 days, in previously non-diabetic patients, versus the weighted average of the target tacrolimus trough levels over the first year after transplantation *.<BR/>* Each circle represents a study, with the area proportional to the inverse of the variance of the estimated treatment effect (larger circles show studies given more weight in the meta-analysis). The colour of the circles represents the formulation of cyclosporin used in each study; dark circles are cyclosporin solution, light grey circles are cyclosporin microemulsion.</P>
