<TITLE MODIFIED="2008-10-20 13:20:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">Drugs to control the movement of salt in the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Usually salt is absorbed from liquid on the surface of the lungs to stop fluid building up there. In cystic fibrosis too much salt is absorbed and there is little liquid left on the airway surfaces. As a result people with cystic fibrosis have problems clearing their lungs of sticky secretions. Thus the lungs are left open to infection. Drugs applied directly to the lungs may prevent too much salt being absorbed. This may lead to better clearance of mucus and less lung infection and damage. The review includes five studies with a total of 226 participants. All studies looked at short-acting drugs applied directly to the lungs compared to placebo. When the results from three studies over six months were combined, the placebo group showed a slower rate of decline in forced vital capacity than the treatment group. However, each of these differed in their results. A further study showed that people receiving a sodium channel blocker before receiving hypertonic saline did not achieve better lung function or mucus clearance than those receiving placebo before hypertonic saline. We found no evidence that short-acting sodium channel blockers administered directly to the lungs improve respiratory status in people with cystic fibrosis. There was even some limited evidence of a decline in lung function. Trials of long-acting sodium channel blockers are ongoing.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-04-07 09:09:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>People with cystic fibrosis (CF) have increased transport of the salt, sodium across their airway lining. Over-absorption of sodium results in the dehydration of the liquid that lines the airway surface and (along with defective chloride secretion) is a primary defect in people with CF.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine whether the topical administration of drugs that block sodium transport improves the respiratory condition of people with CF.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-12-19 16:23:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearching relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We contacted principal investigators known to work in the field, previous authors and pharmaceutical companies who manufacture ion transport agents for unpublished or follow-up data.</P>
<P>Most recent search of the Group's register: 19 December 2013.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-randomised controlled trials of sodium channel blockers compared to placebo or another sodium channel blocker or the same sodium channel blocker at a different dosing regimen. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors independently extracted data. Meta-analysis was limited due to differing study designs. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Five RCTs, with a total of 226 participants, examining the topical administration of the short-acting sodium channel blocker, amiloride, compared to placebo were identified as eligible for inclusion in the review. In three studies over six months, there was a significant difference found in the difference in relative change in FVC in favour of placebo (weighted mean difference 1.51% (95% confidence interval -2.77 to -0.25), although heterogeneity was evident. A two-week study demonstrated that hypertonic saline with amiloride pre-treatment did not result in a significant improvement in respiratory function or mucus clearance, in contrast to pre-treatment with placebo. There were no significant differences identified in other clinically relevant outcomes.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>We found no evidence that the topical administration of a short-acting sodium channel blocker improves respiratory condition in people with cystic fibrosis and some limited evidence of deterioration in lung function.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-03-12 08:25:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P> </P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-07-15 15:54:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most common autosomal recessive genetic disorders of the Caucasian population. The affected gene codes for a protein called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) (<LINK REF="REF-Ratjen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ratjen 2003</LINK>). In the USA and the UK, approximately 1 in 25 Caucasian people are carriers of an abnormality of this gene (<LINK REF="REF-CF-Foundation-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">CF Foundation 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hodson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodson 2000</LINK>). Abnormality of the CFTR gene can cause dysfunction in the respiratory, digestive and reproductive systems of affected individuals; however, it is the impact on the respiratory system that is the main cause of ill health and death in people with CF.</P>
<P>The CFTR protein is responsible for the movement of salt across cell membranes. Specifically CFTR is a chloride channel (<LINK REF="REF-Bear-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bear 1992</LINK>), but it also has a role in reducing the activity of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) (<LINK REF="REF-Stutts-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stutts 1995</LINK>). In the normal airway, the main movement of salt is sodium absorption from the liquid lining the lungs, which prevents the lungs becoming flooded (<LINK REF="REF-Boucher-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boucher 2004</LINK>). In CF, the absence of CFTR results in increased activity of ENaC which leads to too much absorption of sodium and water in turn leading to dehydration of the airway surface liquid (<LINK REF="REF-Boucher-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boucher 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Matsui-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matsui 1998</LINK>). The subsequent incompetent clearance of sticky secretions produces an environment in the lung that is susceptible to infection with bacteria. Chronic and repeated infection results in severe inflammation and permanent lung damage, which leads to respiratory failure and death (<LINK REF="REF-Hodson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodson 2000</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-07-15 15:58:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Standard therapy has improved the outlook for people with CF considerably. Treatments for the chest include daily physiotherapy and the active treatment of respiratory infection with antibiotics. Despite this, death in early adulthood is still a common event (<LINK REF="REF-Hodson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodson 2000</LINK>). A fundamental therapy for CF is needed to improve the outlook. Gene therapy offers potential, but is some way off clinical availability (<LINK REF="REF-Griesenbach-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griesenbach 2003</LINK>). An alternative approach is to target the sodium transport abnormality described above. Support for this view comes from a recently reported animal model in which the ENaC gene is over-expressed in the lungs of mice (<LINK REF="REF-Mall-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mall 2004</LINK>). These mice have sodium hyperabsorption and develop lung disease that is identical to human CF lung disease. One sodium channel blocker, amiloride, has been used systemically as a diuretic because of its effect on sodium transport in the kidney. The topical application of amiloride to the lining of the lungs has been explored as a therapy for CF in clinical trials and has been used as a standard treatment in some CF centres around the world.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2008-07-15 15:58:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Strategies that block sodium transport through ENaC may improve the hydration of airway surface liquid and prevent the development of CF lung disease. Correction of sodium hyperabsorption in the lungs of people with CF may result in improved airway clearance with subsequent reduction in lung infection and damage.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-03-12 08:25:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>This is an updated version of the previous review (<LINK REF="REF-Burrows-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burrows 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Burrows-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burrows 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Burrows-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burrows 2012</LINK>). There are no standard guidelines currently available for the use of this intervention in the CF population. This systematic review should examine the evidence available to draw conclusions for current practice and to inform future research. Clinical decisions should be informed by evidence given that the burden of treatment for people with CF is already considerable.</P>
</IMPORTANCE>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>This review will test the hypothesis that an inhaled sodium channel blocker can improve airway clearance, reduce lung infection and improve respiratory function in people with CF.</P>

<P>The Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register is compiled from electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Clinical Trials) (updated each new issue of <I>The Cochrane Library</I>), quarterly study searches of MEDLINE, a search of EMBASE to 1995 and the prospective handsearching of two journals - <I>Pediatric Pulmonology </I>and the <I>Journal of Cystic Fibrosis</I>. Unpublished work was identified by searching the abstract books of relevant conferences, including three major cystic fibrosis conferences: the International Cystic Fibrosis Conference; the European Cystic Fibrosis Conference and the North American Cystic Fibrosis Conference.

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2014-04-07 09:10:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>We used a standardised form to extract data from the five trials deemed eligible for inclusion in the review. If standard errors were reported, we converted these to standard deviations (SDs).</P>
<P>Where SDs were not provided in the papers and individual patient data were not available, we estimated the SD using the formula suggested in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Individual patient data (IPD) were available for one study, which provided respiratory function data (FVC) at baseline and the end of the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Knowles-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Knowles 1991</LINK>). From these data we were able to calculate the correlation between individual values at the beginning and end of the study. We were then able to utilise this value (0.97) when estimating the SD for relative change in FVC in the studies in which summary data only were available, on the assumption that these would be similar (<LINK REF="STD-Graham-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Graham 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pons-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Pons 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Having calculated relative change in FVC, we were able to calculate the mean difference in this value between amiloride and placebo groups using the analysis (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>).

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2008-10-20 13:37:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>We, (EFB and KWS) independently assessed the trials to be included in the review. In order to assess the risk of bias for each included trial, we assessed the methodological quality of each trial based on criteria described by Jüni and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-J_x00fc_ni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jüni 2001</LINK>). These criteria are:</P>
<OL>
<LI>the degree of blinding;</LI>

<LI>the generation of allocation sequence, for example with a random numbers table;</LI>
<LI>the concealment of allocation sequence, for example if neither investigators nor participants can foresee assignment to either treatment or control group.</LI>
</OL>
<P>We judged adequate methodological quality to indicate a low risk of bias, inadequate quality to indicate a high risk of bias and an unclear degree of quality to have an unclear risk of bias.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2008-11-11 15:13:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">

<P>We included data from two studies with a cross-over design; however, we have concerns about carryover effect in these types of studies (<LINK REF="REF-Southern-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Southern 2003</LINK>). We excluded one study with no washout period and no available data from the first arm (<LINK REF="STD-Riedler-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Riedler 1992</LINK>).

When IPD were available, we used these to calculate the mean difference in relative change between the two groups (<LINK REF="STD-Knowles-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Knowles 1991</LINK>). We were also able to calculate the correlation between individual values of relative change in FVC (0.66). We then used this value to estimate the SD of the mean difference in relative change in FVC in cross-over studies in which summary data only were available (<LINK REF="STD-Graham-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Graham 1993</LINK>). We transformed SD to SEM and again analysed these data using GIV, <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>.</P>
<P>We did not feel it was appropriate to include the data from the Donaldson study in the GIV analysis examining the impact of amiloride versus placebo on the change in lung function since in this study two interventions which are likely to interact were assigned to participants (<LINK REF="STD-Donaldson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Donaldson 2006</LINK>).

<P>Five RCTs, with 229 participants, were included in the review (<LINK REF="STD-Bowler-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bowler 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Donaldson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Donaldson 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Graham-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Graham 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Knowles-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Knowles 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pons-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Pons 2000</LINK>); four examined amiloride (a short-acting sodium channel blocker) versus placebo and the fifth examined amiloride and hypertonic saline versus placebo and hypertonic saline (<LINK REF="STD-Donaldson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Donaldson 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two randomised, double-blind cross-over studies examined an intervention of nebulised amiloride solution versus placebo four times a day (<LINK REF="STD-Graham-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Graham 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Knowles-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Knowles 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>Participants in the Knowles study received 10 to 14 days of intravenous antibiotic treatment (ceftazidime and tobramycin) before starting the study to optimise their respiratory condition (<LINK REF="STD-Knowles-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Knowles 1991</LINK>). Respiratory treatments (aside from the intervention) were then discontinued for the 25-week treatment arm. Further intravenous antibiotics were given in a two to four week washout period prior to the second 25-week arm of the study. Knowles recruited 18 participants, of whom 14 completed the study (median age 25 years, range 18 to 37 years) and available case analysis was undertaken. Amiloride concentration in the Knowles study was 5 mmol l<SUP>-1</SUP> in 0.3% sodium chloride solution; placebo was 0.3% solution alone (<LINK REF="STD-Knowles-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Knowles 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>Graham employed a more pragmatic study design, requiring a "stable" run in period of one month (<LINK REF="STD-Graham-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Graham 1993</LINK>). Participants received their routine treatment and there was a one-month washout period between the two six-month treatment arms. Twenty-three participants were recruited and 14 completed the study (mean age 24 years, range 9 to 47 years) and available case analysis was undertaken. Amiloride concentration was 1 mg ml<SUP>-1</SUP> (3.8 mM) in 0.13% sodium chloride solution; placebo was 0.13% solution alone (<LINK REF="STD-Graham-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Graham 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>The other included studies were of parallel design and employed a three times a day intervention protocol (<LINK REF="STD-Bowler-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bowler 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pons-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Pons 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Bowler recruited participants who were admitted to hospital for a course of intravenous antibiotics, and their length of stay determined the study period (<LINK REF="STD-Bowler-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bowler 1995</LINK>). In all, 27 participants (mean age 12.8 years, range 6 to 27 years) were recruited and stratified into four distinct groups, based on age (less than 12 years or 12 years and above) and forced vital capacity (up to and including 75% of predicted and above 75%), for randomisation to receive amiloride (HCl solution, 5x 10<SUP>-3</SUP>M (0.15% weight for volume) in 0.3% saline) or placebo. All participants received the same dose of amiloride and used the same compressor and nebuliser delivery system. FEV<SUB>1</SUB> was measured daily and presented as the mean of three time periods (described as "first four days", ''the second five days" and "the final six days"). The results are presented as a comparison between those receiving the intervention and those receiving the placebo. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics of the amiloride and placebo groups. Twenty-two participants completed the study, with five participants unable to complete (two in the amiloride group (bronchospasm), and three from the placebo group (one with chickenpox, one because of non-compliance and no reason was reported for the final participant)) (<LINK REF="STD-Bowler-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bowler 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>The Pons study recruited from 27 different centres, with 137 participants in total being recruited (mean age 11.5 years, range 5 to 24 years) (<LINK REF="STD-Pons-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Pons 2000</LINK>). Participants were randomised to receive amiloride (1.5 mg in 5 ml saline solution giving a 10<SUP>-3</SUP>M concentration) or placebo (5 ml saline solution) via an ultrasonic nebuliser three times a day for six months. Pons divided participants into those colonised and those non-colonised with <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </I>but it is not clear if randomisation was stratified to take this into account. In the colonised participants, there were significantly more girls in the amiloride group than in the placebo group (69% versus 40%) and the Shwachman clinical score was significantly higher (78.9% versus 73.8%). The baseline characteristics of the amiloride and placebo groups were similar (<LINK REF="STD-Pons-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Pons 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>A different study design was employed for the Donaldson study (<LINK REF="STD-Donaldson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Donaldson 2006</LINK>). After screening, 27 participants entered a 14-day baseline observation period; 24 participants were subsequently randomised to receive hypertonic saline (7%) with amiloride pre-treatment or hypertonic saline with placebo pre-treatment for 14 days (21 participants completed the study). The primary outcome was the change in respiratory function tests for the 14 days of the study. Mucociliary clearance was also measured.</P>

<P>Allocation of intervention and concealment of that allocation were both described and assessed as adequate in Bowler (<LINK REF="STD-Bowler-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bowler 1995</LINK>). Bowler used a consecutive trial code number provided by pharmacy from a randomisation schedule generated by a statistician to provide stratification with respect to age and respiratory function (<LINK REF="STD-Bowler-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bowler 1995</LINK>).

<P>Pons used computer-generated lists for randomisation; hence we judged this trial to have a low risk of bias from generation of sequence (<LINK REF="STD-Pons-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Pons 2000</LINK>).

In two further studies, participants and investigators were blinded to the intervention; it was not stated that the attending physicians were blinded but this was implied in both studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bowler-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bowler 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pons-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Pons 2000</LINK>). Attempts at concealment of placebo are reported by Bowler and Pons, in that they state the packaging of the placebo was identical to that of amiloride (<LINK REF="STD-Bowler-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bowler 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pons-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Pons 2000</LINK>).

<BR/>Meta-analysis of change in FVC after six months intervention is possible for three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Graham-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Graham 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Knowles-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Knowles 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pons-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Pons 2000</LINK>). Knowles presents IPD for FVC and it is possible to calculate relative change in FVC for each participant (<LINK REF="STD-Knowles-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Knowles 1991</LINK>). These calculated data demonstrate a greater reduction in FVC during the placebo arm of the study (mean relative change (SD), -7.30% (6.20) versus -3.80% (5.50), P &lt; 0.02, paired t test). Although IPD data are not available for the Graham and Pons studies (<LINK REF="STD-Graham-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Graham 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pons-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Pons 2000</LINK>), it is possible to calculate the SD of the mean relative change in FVC for these two studies from a correlation value of 0.97 generated from Knowles IPD (Higgins 2005) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>).</P>
<P>Pons divides participants into those colonised and non-colonised with <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> (<LINK REF="STD-Pons-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Pons 2000</LINK>). We have undertaken the analysis on the summary data for these two cohorts as differences in outcome were apparent. When combined, these data generate a MD between relative change in FVC between amiloride and placebo of -1.63 (95%CI, -3.16 to -0.09) (graph of Pons data not included) . We calculated mean difference and SEM for the Pons study (<LINK REF="STD-Pons-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Pons 2000</LINK>) and entered the data into a GIV analysis (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>). The mean difference of relative change in FVC between the two treatment arms of the Graham cross-over study were estimated using a correlation generated from the Knowles IPD (0.66) to estimate SD, which was then transformed to SEM to enter into GIV analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Graham-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Graham 1993</LINK>). The meta-analysis demonstrates a mean difference in the relative change in FVC that is significantly in favour of placebo at six months (mean difference -1.51% (95% CI, -2.77 to -0.25) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>). The analysis by the GIV method gives a better appreciation of the cross-over data, but it is reassuring that analysis of relative change in FVC (which imputes a correlation of 0 between the two arms of the cross-over studies (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>) generates a similar result as the GIV analysis of WMD (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>). The Forrest plot for mean difference in relative change in FVC at six months (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>) demonstrates a significant degree of heterogeneity between the studies (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 92%); however, the small number of studies in this meta-analysis does not merit a further analysis to examine this heterogeneity.</P>
<P>In participants receiving hypertonic saline in the Donaldson study, there was a difference in the absolute percentage change in FVC between the placebo and amiloride pre-treatment interventions in favour of placebo, but this was not statistically significant (P = 0.23) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>) (<LINK REF="STD-Donaldson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Donaldson 2006</LINK>). When considering the change in FVC from baseline Donaldson reports a significant improvement in the group that received the hypertonic saline with placebo (P = 0.05) but not in the amiloride group (P = 0.83) (<LINK REF="STD-Donaldson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Donaldson 2006</LINK>).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-11-23 13:37:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Increased absorption of sodium ions across the airway lining is a primary defect in people with CF. This salt transport abnormality results in dehydration of the liquid lining the surface of the airway and may have a key role in the early pathogenesis of CF lung disease. Agents that block sodium transport (sodium channel blockers) have the potential to correct the underlying defect in CF; thereby preventing or reducing the progression of lung disease. </P>
<P>This review examines whether sodium channel blockers applied topically to the airway improve the respiratory condition of people with CF. A number of clinical trials have examined the short-acting sodium channel blocker, amiloride. Five RCTs were included in the review. Four studies examined amiloride solution delivered to the airway via an aerosol versus a placebo. Two studies were of a cross-over design, which is not ideal when considering a therapy with potential for long-term impact on disease progression. Issues regarding methodology were apparent with all the studies (in particular, concealment of intervention allocation); however, given the small number of studies available, data were extracted from all five studies. Despite differing study design we were able to calculate relative change in FVC over six months for three studies. This meta-analysis did not demonstrate any significant advantage in respiratory function tests with amiloride, in fact the results were in favour of placebo. A concern is the heterogeneity between studies and this needs to be examined in future reviews. There was no improvement in any other clinically relevant outcome. </P>
<P>The most recent RCT examined the impact of amiloride pre-treatment on the response to hypertonic saline with the stated hypothesis that sodium channel blockade (with amiloride) might potentiate the effect of the hypertonic saline (<LINK REF="STD-Donaldson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Donaldson 2006</LINK>). This study confirmed the positive impact of hypertonic saline on respiratory function and mucus clearance when administered with placebo pre-treatment, but demonstrated a significantly smaller effect with amiloride pre-treatment. This unexpected result is to some degree consistent with the meta-analysis of the four RCTs above. </P>
<P>A phase II single-dose CF study of a longer-acting sodium channel blocker is nearing completion and will be assessed for inclusion in this review when published (Boucher 2007). </P>
<P>This review does not provide evidence of significant improvement in respiratory function with topical administration of amiloride and we do not advocate the routine use of amiloride in the management of people with CF. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is no clear evidence to support the use of short-acting sodium channel blockers in the management of people with cystic fibrosis and some limited evidence that they may cause a decline in lung function, particularly when delivered before hypertonic saline. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Sodium channel blockers may have potential as a fundamental therapy for CF. Long-acting sodium channel blockers are being examined in clinical studies. It is important that future clinical studies are designed in a robust manner, with particular attention to the reporting of generation and concealment of allocation. With the increasing burden of routine treatment, it is essential that future studies reflect outcomes that are important to people with CF. </P>
