<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Blood clots can be formed by clotting proteins (coagulation factors) and sticky blood cells (platelets). Oral anticoagulants such as warfarin are drugs that can prevent clot formation by blocking the clotting proteins. Other drugs, like aspirin, can also reduce clotting by blocking the platelets. Warfarin is better than aspirin in patients with heart failure who have abnormal heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation). Aspirin is known to be helpful in patients with heart failure with normal (sinus) rhythm, whose heart arteries are narrowed. This condition is a common cause of heart failure, so doctors often advise patients with a normal rhythm to take aspirin. Arguably, people with heart failure with a normal rhythm are at increased risk of clotting due to slower blood flow in the heart, similarly to people with an abnormal rhythm. Also, blood clots (thromboembolism) in the lungs, legs and brain (ischaemic stroke) lead to disability and death of patients with heart failure. Several studies have tried to find out whether all heart failure patients should receive oral anticoagulants, but the debate is still open.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>This is an update of an earlier review. The evidence is current to September 2015. We only identified one new study with 2305 participants. In total, we analysed four randomised controlled studies with 4187 participants.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>The comparison of warfarin with aspirin was based on a large number of patients from four high-quality studies. The analysis showed an almost identical risk of death with both drugs. There was not enough evidence to prove benefits of warfarin over aspirin to reduce the possibility of clotting complications, such as a heart attack or stroke. However, patients receiving warfarin experienced serious bleeding twice as often as those taking aspirin. A comparison of warfarin with another antiplatelet drug, clopidogrel, was based on a single medium size study, and it showed similar results: no difference in occurrence of death or clotting complications, but a higher chance of developing of a serious bleed.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusions</B>
</P>
<P>There is currently no evidence to suggest advantages of warfarin over antiplatelet drugs in heart failure with a normal rhythm. Moreover, treatment with warfarin leads to more bleeding events than aspirin or clopidogrel. It is unlikely that further studies will change these conclusions unless new, more effective and safe drugs become available.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-09-09 16:15:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Morbidity in patients with chronic heart failure is high, and this predisposes them to thrombotic complications, including stroke and thromboembolism, which in turn contribute to high mortality. Oral anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin) and antiplatelet agents (e.g. aspirin) are the principle oral antithrombotic agents. Many heart failure patients with sinus rhythm take aspirin because coronary artery disease is the leading cause of heart failure. Oral anticoagulants have become a standard in the management of heart failure with atrial fibrillation. However, a question remains regarding the appropriateness of oral anticoagulants in heart failure with sinus rhythm. This update of a review previously published in 2012 aims to address this question.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-09-14 08:30:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess the effects of oral anticoagulant therapy versus antiplatelet agents for all-cause mortality, non-fatal cardiovascular events and risk of major bleeding in adults with heart failure (either with reduced or preserved ejection fraction) who are in sinus rhythm.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-09-09 16:16:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We updated the searches in September 2015 on CENTRAL (<I>The Cochrane Library</I>), MEDLINE and Embase. We searched reference lists of papers and abstracts from cardiology meetings and contacted study authors for further information. We did not apply any language restrictions. Additionally, we searched two clinical trials registers: ClinicalTrials.gov (<A HREF="http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov">www.ClinicalTrials.gov</A>) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal <A HREF="http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/">apps.who.int/trialsearch/</A>) (searched in July 2016).</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-09-09 16:16:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomised controlled trials comparing antiplatelet therapy versus oral anticoagulation in adults with chronic heart failure in sinus rhythm. Treatment had to last at least one month. We compared orally administered antiplatelet agents (aspirin, ticlopidine, clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor, dipyridamole) versus anticoagulant agents (coumarins, warfarin, non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants).</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-09-09 16:17:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and assessed the risks and benefits of antithrombotic versus antiplatelet therapy using relative measures of effects, such as risk ratios (RR), accompanied with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The data extracted included data relating to the study design, patient characteristics, study eligibility, quality, and outcomes. We used GRADE criteria to assess the quality of the evidence.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-09-14 08:42:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This update identified one additional study for inclusion, adding data for 2305 participants. This addition more than doubled the overall number of patients eligible for the review. In total, we included four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 4187 eligible participants. All studies compared warfarin with aspirin. One RCT additionally compared warfarin with clopidogrel. All included RCTs studied patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.</P>
<P>Analysis of all outcomes for warfarin versus aspirin was based on 3663 patients from four RCTs. All-cause mortality was similar for warfarin and aspirin (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.13; 4 studies; 3663 participants; moderate quality evidence). Oral anticoagulation was associated with a reduction in non-fatal cardiovascular events, which included non-fatal stroke, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, peripheral arterial embolism (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.00; 4 studies; 3663 participants; moderate quality evidence). The rate of major bleeding events was twice as high in the warfarin groups (RR 2.00, 95% CI 1.44 to 2.78; 4 studies; 3663 participants; moderate quality evidence). We generally considered the risk of bias of the included studies to be low.</P>
<P>Analysis of warfarin versus clopidogrel was based on a single RCT (N = 1064). All-cause mortality was similar for warfarin and clopidogrel (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.21; 1 study; 1064 participants; low quality evidence). There were similar rates of non-fatal cardiovascular events (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.45; 1 study; 1064 participants; low quality evidence). The rate of major bleeding events was 2.5 times higher in the warfarin group (RR 2.47, 95% CI 1.24 to 4.91; 1 study; 1064 participants; low quality evidence). Risk of bias for this study can be summarised as low. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-09-14 08:42:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is evidence from RCTs to suggest that neither oral anticoagulation with warfarin or platelet inhibition with aspirin is better for mortality in systolic heart failure with sinus rhythm (high quality of the evidence for all-cause mortality and moderate quality of the evidence for non-fatal cardiovascular events and major bleeding events). Treatment with warfarin was associated with a 20% reduction in non-fatal cardiovascular events but a twofold higher risk of major bleeding complications (high quality of the evidence). We saw a similar pattern of results for the warfarin versus clopidogrel comparison (low quality of the evidence). At present, there are no data on the role of oral anticoagulation versus antiplatelet agents in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction with sinus rhythm. Also, there were no data from RCTs on the utility of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants compared to antiplatelet agents in heart failure with sinus rhythm.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-09-09 16:18:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Chronic heart failure is a major clinical and social problem and a significant cause of morbidity, with almost 60% five-year mortality despite modern treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Stewart-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 2010</LINK>). Heart failure poses an increased risk of thrombotic complications, which occur in a third of patients with the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Lip-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lip 2012</LINK>). Mild to moderate heart failure is associated with an annual stroke risk of approximately 1.5% (<LINK REF="REF-Witt-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Witt 2007</LINK>), compared to less than 0.5% in the general population, while the annual risk of stroke increases to almost 4% in severe heart failure (<LINK REF="REF-Packer-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Packer 1991</LINK>). Indeed, the SAVE study reported an inverse relationship between stroke risk and the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), with an 18% increase in stroke risk for every 5% reduction in LVEF in severe heart failure (<LINK REF="STD-SAVE-1997" TYPE="STUDY">SAVE 1997</LINK>). People with heart failure are also prone to developing venous thromboembolism (<LINK REF="REF-Khoury-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khoury 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Piazza-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Piazza 2011</LINK>). Pulmonary embolism and peripheral arterial embolism clearly contribute to the high morbidity in heart failure (<LINK REF="REF-Alberts-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alberts 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Witt-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Witt 2007</LINK>). Multiple factors predispose patients with heart failure to prothrombotic risk, including diastolic dysfunction, blood flow congestion and a hypercoagulable shift in pro- versus haemostatic factor balance (<LINK REF="REF-Shantsila-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shantsila 2016</LINK>). For these reasons, patients with heart failure are expected to benefit from antithrombotic therapy, and it is essential to have evidence to support the best treatment options for prevention of thrombotic complications.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-09-09 16:19:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All heart failure patients who have atrial fibrillation have a CHA<SUB>2</SUB>DS<SUB>2</SUB>-VASc score (a measure of stroke risk for patients with atrial fibrillation) of 1 or more and benefit from oral anticoagulation according to the current guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Camm-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Camm 2012</LINK>). Choice of an antithrombotic agent in heart failure patients with sinus rhythm is more controversial, but antiplatelet therapy is common. Its use is based on its general efficacy as an antithrombotic agent, as it has been shown to reduce the incidence of myocardial infarction and death in men and women over the age of 50, in patients with unstable angina and myocardial infarction, and in patients with atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease (<LINK REF="REF-APT-Collab-I-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APT Collab I 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ATT-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATT 2009</LINK>), whilst the administration of aspirin improves the patency rates of saphenous-vein aorto-coronary bypass grafts (<LINK REF="REF-APT-Collab-I-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APT Collab I 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ATT-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATT 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stein-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stein 1998</LINK>). Aspirin also reduces the incidence of stroke and death in patients with recurrent episodes of cerebral ischaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Sze-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sze 1988</LINK>). Given that ischaemic cardiomyopathy is a major aetiological factor of heart failure, clinicians routinely use aspirin. Furthermore, research has shown aspirin to be moderately effective in reducing venous thrombosis and thromboembolism in patients undergoing hip surgery and possibly in preventing these occurrences in general surgical patients (<LINK REF="REF-APT-Collab-I-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APT Collab I 1994</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Investigators have also studied antiplatelet agents such as dipyridamole and clopidogrel in cardiovascular disease. Studies have shown that dipyridamole reduces the incidence of thromboembolism when added to warfarin in high-risk patients with prosthetic heart valves (<LINK REF="REF-APT-Collab-I-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APT Collab I 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stein-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stein 1998</LINK>), and others have reported that it reduces the risk of stroke when added to aspirin in patients with a history of cerebrovascular disease (<LINK REF="REF-APT-Collab-I-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APT Collab I 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-APT-Collab-II-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APT Collab II 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klimt-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klimt 1986</LINK>). However, dipyridamole appears to have little antithrombotic effect, and studies have indicated that the addition of dipyridamole adds little to aspirin therapy alone in most cardiovascular diseases. In contrast, the newer platelet-active agent clopidogrel has been studied in the large Clopidogrel versus Aspirin in Patients at Risk of Ischaemic Events (CAPRIE) trial, with evidence of a reduction in the composite outcome of vascular death, ischaemic stroke and myocardial infarction in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease (<LINK REF="REF-CAPRIE-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">CAPRIE 1996</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>There have been few prospective studies of oral anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents in patients with heart failure in sinus rhythm. Given the evident prothrombotic state in such patients, it is plausible that use of oral anticoagulants can be beneficial. The previous version of this Cochrane review was not able to conclude that oral anticoagulation was better than antiplatelet therapy, but the analysis was limited by the paucity of high-quality studies. A joint consensus document from the ESC Heart Failure Association and the ESC Working Group on Thrombosis in 2012, 'Thromboembolism and antithrombotic therapy for heart failure in sinus rhythm', concluded that "[w]hilst there is the potential for a reduction in ischaemic stroke, there is currently no compelling reason to routinely use warfarin for these patients" (<LINK REF="REF-Lip-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lip 2012</LINK>). We performed a new literature search for this Cochrane review update to reflect recent advances in the field.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-09-09 16:19:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The efficacy of antithrombotic therapy in arterial fibrillation (including in people with heart failure) and of oral anticoagulation versus placebo for heart failure in sinus rhythm are the subjects of related Cochrane reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Aguilar-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aguilar 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lip-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lip 2014</LINK>), and we will not address these topics in the present review, which focuses on heart failure with sinus rhythm.<BR/>
<BR/>There is compelling evidence that aspirin reduces the short term risk of death after myocardial infarction, although the mortality benefits are less impressive during long-term treatment or following the late initiation of aspirin (<LINK REF="REF-APT-Collab-I-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APT Collab I 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ATT-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATT 2009</LINK>). This evidence supports the use of aspirin in heart failure patients with ischaemic heart disease, although many of these patients have only a distant history of myocardial infarction, and the magnitude of any potential long-term benefits is not conclusively established.</P>
<P>Antithrombotic agents (i.e. oral anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents) might reduce thrombotic complications, such as myocardial infarction and stroke, and improve survival in heart failure with sinus rhythm. Bleeding complications are not uncommon with these agents, an important consideration during assessment of their overall benefits.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-09-09 16:19:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review addresses an important problem, and it calls for the best evidence-based antithrombotic therapy in heart failure without arterial fibrillation. The studies available at the time of the previous version of the review produced conflicting results. The new study included in this update contributes more participants for the analysis than the three older studies combined, thus significantly improving the power and validity of the analysis.</P>

<P>We included four RCTs that met the review criteria for assessing the effectiveness of antiplatelet therapy (<LINK REF="STD-HELAS-2006" TYPE="STUDY">HELAS 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WARCEF-2012" TYPE="STUDY">WARCEF 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WASH-2004" TYPE="STUDY">WASH 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WATCH-2009" TYPE="STUDY">WATCH 2009</LINK>; see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>).</P>
<P>All studies recruited patients with heart failure with reduced LVEF only. Arterial fibrillation was not an absolute exclusion criterion in <LINK REF="STD-WASH-2004" TYPE="STUDY">WASH 2004</LINK>, but 92% of the study participants had no history of it at the time of recruitment. Other studies only included patients with sinus rhythm. The range of ages for the trials was 18 years and older with a mean age of 61 years across the trials. Most participants were men (61% to 93% across trials). We analysed all outcomes based on the intention-to-treat principle.</P>
<P>The studies were international (involving the USA, the UK, countries in Western and Eastern Europe, Canada and Argentina). The pharmaceutical industry provided some funding and support to the studies. The WASH trial was partly supported by the Bristol-Myers Squibb, which manufactures warfarin in the USA. The Bristol-Myers Squibb, Sanofi-Synthelabo, and Dupont pharmaceutical companies partly supported the WATCH trial through unrestricted grants and provision of the study drugs. <LINK REF="STD-HELAS-2006" TYPE="STUDY">HELAS 2006</LINK> did not specify sources of funding, but Greece-based centres led and coordinated the study, and Greece-based companies manufactured all study agents.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-WASH-2004" TYPE="STUDY">WASH 2004</LINK> was a pilot study in 279 participants recruited from 17 centres in the UK and 3 centres in the USA. This review analysed only the 180 patients randomised to warfarin (target international normalised ratio (INR) 2.0 to 3.0) versus aspirin (300 mg once daily). The remaining patients were randomised to no antithrombotic therapy and thus were outside the scope of the analysis. Investigators recorded baseline data on all participants by telephone at the data centre before randomisation using prospectively constructed blocks of random numbers.</P>
<P>Participants had to have a clinical diagnosis of heart failure requiring treatment with diuretics and evidence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction on echocardiography within six months before entry (<LINK REF="STD-WASH-2004" TYPE="STUDY">WASH 2004</LINK>). Echocardiographic criteria of left ventricular dysfunction included an increased left ventricular end-diastolic internal dimension (&#8805; 56 mm or &#8805; 30 mm/m<SUP>2</SUP> body surface area) combined with a fractional shortening of at least 28% or LVEF of at least 35%. Investigators were encouraged to use warfarin in participants who developed arterial fibrillation and to reduce the dose of aspirin or use any appropriate antidyspeptic medication if dyspepsia occurred. This trial was limited by open-label treatment with warfarin, small numbers and relatively short follow-up (27 ± 1 months). Also, from the study manuscript is not clear whether any patients had incomplete outcome data.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-HELAS-2006" TYPE="STUDY">HELAS 2006</LINK> recruited 197 participants in centres in Greece, Cyprus, Yugoslavia, Romania, Bulgaria, Poland and Georgia. We excluded the participants with dilated cardiomyopathy who were randomised to warfarin versus placebo, but we included participants with underlying ischaemic heart disease (n = 115) who were randomised to warfarin versus aspirin. The trial was double-blinded and included participants with the New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II to IV and LVEF of more than 35% assessed by echocardiography, or by radionuclide or angiocardiographic ventriculography. The University coordination centre conducted computerised randomisation by fax or telephone.Investigators were blinded to therapy, and warfarin doses were recommended according to sham results where appropriate. However, the study manuscript does not provide details on the sham procedures, and it is unclear how robust they were. The participants were regularly followed up with a recording of any clinical outcomes. As with <LINK REF="STD-WASH-2004" TYPE="STUDY">WASH 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-HELAS-2006" TYPE="STUDY">HELAS 2006</LINK> is limited by the small number of participants and short follow-up period (mean follow-up time of 18.5 months for those taking aspirin and 18.7 months for those taking warfarin). It is not clear whether there was an independent assessment of study outcomes.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-WATCH-2009" TYPE="STUDY">WATCH 2009</LINK> included 1587 participants from 142 centres in the USA, Canada and the UK. Patients were eligible if they had NYHA class II to IV heart failure for more than three months, LVEF of less than 35%, were in sinus rhythm and on a diuretic and ACE inhibitor (unless not tolerated). Patients were randomised into three arms: aspirin 162 mg once daily, clopidogrel 75 mg once daily in a double-blind, double-dummy manner, or open label warfarin (target INR 2.5 to 3.0). The Cooperative Studies Program Coordinating Center (CSPCC) generated randomisation sequences for each site and allocated treatment. The main outcome measures were adjudicated by a blinded committee. The mean duration of follow-up was 1.9 years, for a total of 3073 patient-years of follow-up. Due to slow enrolment, the study failed to recruit the pre-specified target of 4500 participants. The study was limited by open-label management of warfarin. Also, similar to <LINK REF="STD-WASH-2004" TYPE="STUDY">WASH 2004</LINK>, , it is not clear whether any participants in <LINK REF="STD-WATCH-2009" TYPE="STUDY">WATCH 2009</LINK> had incomplete outcome data.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-WARCEF-2012" TYPE="STUDY">WARCEF 2012</LINK> was a large RCT conducted at 168 centres in 11 countries. The trial recruited 2305 participants with LVEF of 35% or less and sinus rhythm who were randomised to warfarin (target INR of 2.0 to 3.5) or aspirin (325 mg once daily). Investigators reported the primary outcomes of the first event in a composite endpoint of ischaemic stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage or death from any cause during a mean follow-up period of of 3.5 ± 1.8 years. Two independent core echocardiography laboratories, which were unaware of the study treatment, assessed the accuracy of LVEF measurement. An independent endpoint adjudication committee blinded to the treatment assignments adjudicated all primary and secondary outcomes and cases of major haemorrhage. The WARCEF trial was a well-designed, adequately powered study with low risk of the assessed bias types.<BR/>

<P>We excluded 40 references and present our reasons for excluding 9 studies that most closely missed the inclusion criteria in <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>.</P>
<P>Four RCTs of ACE inhibitors assessed the use of antithrombotic therapy in participants with heart failure and/or left ventricular systolic dysfunction (<LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Khadra-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Khadra 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SAVE-1997" TYPE="STUDY">SAVE 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SOLVD-1997" TYPE="STUDY">SOLVD 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-V_x002d_HeFT-II-1992" TYPE="STUDY">V-HeFT II 1992</LINK>). These analyses were done outside the randomisation scheme. <LINK REF="STD-V_x002d_HeFT-II-1992" TYPE="STUDY">V-HeFT II 1992</LINK> included participants with symptomatic heart failure and radiological, echocardiographic or radionuclide evidence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction. The SOLVD trials included participants with left ventricular systolic dysfunction, defined as a LVEF of 35% or less, who were either symptomatic and enrolled into the treatment trial (<LINK REF="REF-SOLVD_x002d_treatment-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">SOLVD-treatment 1991</LINK>), or asymptomatic and enrolled into the prevention trial (<LINK REF="REF-SOLVD_x002d_prevent-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">SOLVD-prevent 1992</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-SAVE-1997" TYPE="STUDY">SAVE 1997</LINK> included participants post-myocardial infarction with an LVEF of 40% or more and no overt heart failure (i.e. asymptomatic participants). <LINK REF="STD-PROMISE-1993" TYPE="STUDY">PROMISE 1993</LINK> presented limited information from a retrospective analysis of one trial in abstract form only.</P>
<P>In one recent retrospective, observational, non-randomised study, investigators used aspirin in 32% of 417 participants (warfarin in 28%) with an average follow-up of five years (<LINK REF="STD-EPICAL-2002" TYPE="STUDY">EPICAL 2002</LINK>). Treatment with antithrombotic agents (either aspirin, warfarin or both) was associated with better survival at five years (40.4% versus 31% with no antithrombotic treatment, P = 0.01). However, we excluded this study because 24% of the participants had concomitant arterial fibrillation, investigators reported only survival rates, and they did not report event rates separately for the sinus rhythm group or those treated was aspirin, warfarin or no therapy.</P>
<P>Two almost identical abstracts presented results of the randomised open-label clopidogrel versus aspirin in chronic heart failure (CACHE) study that compared 75 mg daily doses of the two drugs in 87 participants with heart failure in sinus rhythm and an N-terminal-pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) of 400 ng/L (mostly NYHA II) (<LINK REF="STD-CACHE_x002d_EHF-2014" TYPE="STUDY">CACHE-EHF 2014</LINK>; CACHE-EJHF 2014). By six months, treatment with aspirin was associated with worse renal function and higher diastolic blood pressure compared with clopidogrel, but investigators did not report any major adverse outcomes. The study did not have a comparator other than another antiplatelet agent (i.e. placebo or oral anticoagulant), so we excluded it from the analysis.</P>
<P>No adequately powered prospective studies have specifically examined the role of the antiplatelet agent dipyridamole in heart failure participants. There was a small randomised pilot study of dipyridamole plus aspirin (aggrenox) versus placebo in 18 participants with congestive heart failure (NYHA class II to IV) and LVEF of less than 40%, presented as a conference abstract in 2013 (<LINK REF="STD-ASAP_x002d_HF-2013" TYPE="STUDY">ASAP-HF 2013</LINK>). After six months of therapy, there were no reported changes in haemodynamic characteristics in either group. BNP levels were reduced in the treatment group, but not in the placebo group (the report did not include a between-group comparison). More participants in the treatment group showed improvement in six-minute walking distance than in the placebo group. We excluded the study because no clinical events were recorded (although investigators mentioned the absence of bleeding events in both groups). There were two active treatments in the intervention arms, and investigators provided no information on whether the participants were in arterial fibrillation or sinus rhythm.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-09-09 16:20:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The analysis of warfarin versus aspirin is based on four RCTs with a large overall number of participants. More than half of the participants were from the well-designed, double-blind WARCEF trial. Despite some limitations of other studies (e.g. open-label treatment with warfarin in two trials), the analysis shows low heterogeneity of the outcomes, and we judged the quality of the evidence to be high for all-cause mortality and moderate for non-fatal cardiovascular events and major bleeding events. Despite the availability of different oral anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents, the main analysis is limited to the long-established agents warfarin and aspirin. The analysis did not provide evidence that either was better for all-cause mortality, and further studies are unlikely to change these conclusions.</P>
<P>The risk of non-fatal cardiovascular events tended to be lower in the warfarin group, but this was offset by the twofold rise in risk of major haemorrhage. The reduction in non-fatal cardiovascular events is likely due to undiagnosed/silent arterial fibrillation and deep vein thrombosis in some patients. Again, further research of these two agents is unlikely to prove the clinical superiority of either.</P>
<P>Comparison of warfarin with clopidogrel was limited to a single trial with open-label warfarin management (<LINK REF="STD-WATCH-2009" TYPE="STUDY">WATCH 2009</LINK>). Slow recruitment restricted the statistical power, and as a result the trial was stopped early. The quality of the evidence for these analyses was low. However, the outcomes of these analyses were broadly similar to those of warfarin versus aspirin, with results that did not favour either drug for the primary outcome, but with 2.5 times higher major bleeding rates in the warfarin arm of the study. Further trials are unlikely to add more to the conclusions in relation to role of warfarin versus clopidogrel in heart failure in sinus rhythm.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-09-09 16:20:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (e.g. direct thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran, and factor Xa inhibitors, apixaban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban) have now been approved for clinical use in patients with arterial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism. These agents show good efficacy and a favourable safety profile and may become a suitable alternative to warfarin to be tested in future trials in heart failure with sinus rhythm. No such data are available at present. The ongoing <LINK REF="STD-COMMANDER-HF-trial" TYPE="STUDY">COMMANDER HF trial</LINK> compares rivaroxaban versus placebo in participants with heart failure of ischaemic aetiology with sinus rhythm. The non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants are used as fixed-dose agents as opposed to warfarin, and this would facilitate easier concealment of the study treatments.</P>
<P>Given the fact that all four included RCTs focused on heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, it is not possible to extrapolate their conclusions to patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Admittedly, the specific prothrombotic risk in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and sinus rhythm has not been firmly established, and further research would be essential in this field.</P>

<P>There is moderate quality evidence demonstrating no difference in all-cause mortality between warfarin and aspirin in patients with heart failure in sinus rhythm. Warfarin was associated with a slightly lower risk of non-fatal cardiovascular events but a higher risk of major bleeding complications (moderate quality of the evidence). We saw a similar pattern of results for the warfarin versus clopidogrel comparison (low quality evidence). At the time of writing, there were no data on the role of oral anticoagulants versus antiplatelet agents in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction with sinus rhythm. Likewise, there were no data from RCTs on the utility of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants compared to antiplatelet agents in heart failure with sinus rhythm.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-09-14 08:39:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Current evidence is based on four randomised controlled trials (<LINK REF="STD-HELAS-2006" TYPE="STUDY">HELAS 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WASH-2004" TYPE="STUDY">WASH 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WATCH-2009" TYPE="STUDY">WATCH 2009</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-WARCEF-2012" TYPE="STUDY">WARCEF 2012</LINK>), and further similar studies are unlikely to change the conclusions regarding comparisons of warfarin with aspirin. Although comparison of warfarin with clopidogrel is only based on a single, medium-size study, it generally agrees with the conclusions of the aspirin studies, and new studies are unlikely to lead to new clinically relevant conclusions.</P>
<P>Several non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants have now been approved for clinical practice. They show good efficacy and a favourable safety profile in other clinical settings, including heart failure with arterial fibrillation. Future trials should establish the potential utility of these agents in patients with heart failure with sinus rhythm.</P>
<P>The role of antithrombotic agents in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction remains unclear. It would be important to obtain contemporary data on thrombotic risk specific to this condition, and if the risk is confirmed, high-quality RCTs would be necessary to establish optimal management of such patients.<BR/>

<P>"The investigator&#8211;supervisor was blinded to the study in the same manner as in the CAFA study and regulated the study medication dose according to the prothrombin time results to maintain an INR of 2&#8211;3. The dose was then administered to the patient by a second physician. In the placebo arm, the supervisor recommended the dose according to sham results." and further, "Warfarin (Panwarfin, Abbot, Greece) was supplied as 5-mg tablets. The daily dose was 2.5&#8211;10mg, with a target INR of 2&#8211;3. ASA (Salospir A, Uni-Pharma, Greece) was supplied as 325-mg tablets and was given once daily or according to sham adjustment."<BR/>
<BR/>Comment: The study used sham medications to conceal the study drug, but it is not clear how robust the system was. The provided reference refers to a study not related to warfarin.</P>
