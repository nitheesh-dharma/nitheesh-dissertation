<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-05-28 10:04:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Caffeine is a stimulant found in tea, coffee, cola, chocolate and some over-the-counter medicines. Conflicting results found in the literature make it difficult for health professionals to advise pregnant women about avoiding caffeine during pregnancy. Clearance of caffeine from the mother's blood slows down during pregnancy. Some authors of observational studies have concluded that caffeine intake is harmful to the fetus, causing growth restriction, reduced birthweight, preterm birth or stillbirth. The newborn could also have withdrawal symptoms if the mother has a high intake of caffeine (more than eight cups of coffee per day).</P>
<P>Two studies met the inclusion criteria but only one contributed data to the outcomes of interest. The study was based in Denmark. Women less than 20 weeks pregnant were randomly assigned to drinking caffeinated instant coffee (568 women after exclusions) or decaffeinated instant coffee (629 women). Drinking three cups of coffee a day in early pregnancy had no effect on birthweight, preterm births or growth restriction.</P>
<P>Both included studies were randomised controlled trials. One randomly allocated pregnant women to either caffeinated or decaffeinated groups. It was unclear from the other whether allocation concealment was undertaken. Blinding of personnel and study participants was satisfactory in both studies while blinding of outcome assessor was not clearly stated. Attrition bias was also not clearly explained in one study. The results from the one trial that provided data for analysis showed that there was no evidence of an effect of caffeine avoidance on the outcomes birthweight, preterm birth or small-for-gestational age.</P>
<P>Two outcomes were assessed and assigned a quality rating using the GRADE methods. Evidence for these two outcomes, namely birthweight and frequency of preterm birth, was assessed as of low quality, with downgrading decisions due in part to the relatively small sample sizes and the wide confidence interval of the one included trial that contributed data.</P>
<P>There is insufficient evidence to confirm or refute the effectiveness of caffeine avoidance on birthweight or other pregnancy outcomes.</P>

<P>Two studies met the inclusion criteria but only one contributed data for the prespecified outcomes. Caffeinated instant coffee (568 women) was compared with decaffeinated instant coffee (629 women) and it was found that reducing the caffeine intake of regular coffee drinkers (3+ cups/day) during the second and third trimester by an average of 182 mg/day did not affect birthweight (g) (mean difference (MD) 20.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) -48.68 to 88.68; one study, 1197 participants; <I>low quality evidence</I>), preterm birth (risk ratio (RR) 0.81, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.37; one study, 1153 participants; <I>low quality evidence</I>) or small-for-gestational age (RR 0.97, 95% 0.57 to 1.64; one study, 1150 participants). Risk of bias was moderate in both studies.</P>
<P>Two outcomes were assessed and assigned a quality rating using the GRADE methods. Evidence for these two outcomes (birthweight and preterm birth) was assessed as of low quality, with downgrading decisions due to the relatively small sample sizes and the wide confidence interval of the one included trial that contributed data.

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-05-28 10:04:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-02-24 17:14:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Caffeine is the most commonly used psychoactive substance in the world. It is found in a range of beverages and food, mainly in tea, coffee, cola, chocolate bars and some medications. There has been a concern that maternal consumption of caffeine in pregnancy may be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, studies investigating antenatal caffeine intake and pregnancy outcomes have had mixed results. Some authors have concluded that caffeine intake is harmful, causing stillbirth and fetal death (<LINK REF="REF-Bech-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bech 2005</LINK>), some that it has no effect (<LINK REF="REF-Browne-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Browne 2007</LINK>), and others claim that it is beneficial in reducing the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) (<LINK REF="REF-Adeney-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adeney 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Caffeine, a trimethylxanthine alkaloid, is readily available in coffee (containing from 85 to 110 mg/cup), tea (about 50 mg/cup), cola beverages (30 to 45 mg/serving), cocoa (about 5 mg/cup), chocolate (25 mg/small bar), as well as preservatives, analgesics and other pharmaceutical preparations (<LINK REF="REF-Knutti-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knutti 1982</LINK>). Caffeine's primary metabolite, paraxanthine, can pass the placental barrier, exposing the fetus to maternally ingested caffeine. Adenosine is an endogenous modulator of neuronal excitability in mammals' central nervous systems. Paraxanthine antagonises adenosine receptors (A1) in materno-fetal brain and heart inhibit glutamate release in peripheral tissues, which may have a dose-dependent and cumulative adverse effect on the metabolic activity of both mother and fetus (<LINK REF="REF-Gaytan-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gaytan 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grosso-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grosso 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Iglesias-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iglesias 2006</LINK>).Exposure to caffeine can also lead to vasoconstriction in the uterus and placenta circulation, which may in turn affect fetal growth and development (<LINK REF="REF-Bech-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bech 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Animal studies have shown that chronic caffeine exposure during pregnancy promotes a decrease in adenosine A1 receptors in both maternal and fetal whole brain, which in turn increases stimulatory activities, making the brain and other tissues vulnerable to the harmful effect of caffeine because there is no blood-brain barrier or placental barrier to caffeine (<LINK REF="REF-Leon-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leon 2002</LINK>). Moreover, clearance of caffeine from the mother's blood slows down during pregnancy and its half life is tripled during the second and third trimester (<LINK REF="REF-Knutti-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knutti 1981</LINK>), while the fetus is lacking a sufficient amount of the enzyme needed to metabolise it (<LINK REF="REF-Aldridge-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aldridge 1979</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-05-28 10:04:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Pregnant women received caffeinated instant coffee or decaffeinated instant coffee in the randomised controlled studies under investigation in this review. Women were asked to replace their usual coffee with the coffee provided, but were not advised on how much to drink or avoid regular coffee offered by others or intake of other caffeinated beverages such as tea, cocoa, or cola.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-05-28 10:04:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Maternal consumption of caffeine may possibly affect the pregnancy at any time throughout intrauterine life. Animal studies suggest that caffeine is teratogenic when administered in large amounts (more than eight cups per day), resulting in congenital anomalies, namely oral cleft and cardiovascular malformation (<LINK REF="REF-Berger-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berger 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bruyere-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bruyere 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Elmazar-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elmazar 1982</LINK>). However, so far, current epidemiological evidence is unable to detect appreciable teratogenic effect of caffeine exposure in the human fetus (<LINK REF="REF-Browne-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Browne 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Excessive maternal caffeine consumption (more than eight cups per day) may result in increased levels of catecholamines in both the mother and fetus, which may lead to utero-placental vasoconstriction (<LINK REF="REF-Kirkinen-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirkinen 1983</LINK>), increased fetal heart rate and arrhythmias (irregularity of heart rate) (<LINK REF="REF-Resch-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Resch 1983</LINK>) and, as a consequence, lack of fetal oxygenation. A recent study suggests caffeine impaired insulin sensitivity in women with GDM (<LINK REF="STD-Robinson-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 2009</LINK>). Thus, it is theoretically plausible that these effects could adversely affect the pregnancy and increase the risk of miscarriage (<LINK REF="REF-Tolstrup-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tolstrup 1983</LINK>), low birthweight (<LINK REF="REF-Bracken-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bracken 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klebanoff-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klebanoff 2002</LINK>), stillbirth (<LINK REF="REF-Wisborg-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wisborg 2002</LINK>), and sudden infant death syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Ford-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ford 1988</LINK>). The Rondo study suggested that the proportion of mothers who delivered growth-restricted babies increased as the average consumption of coffee increased (<LINK REF="REF-Rondo-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rondo 1996</LINK>). Moreover, neonatal withdrawal symptoms have been observed as a result of high levels of maternal caffeine intake (<LINK REF="REF-McGowan-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGowan 1988</LINK>).</P>
<P>However, other investigators have failed to find any association between caffeine intake and poor pregnancy outcomes. <LINK REF="REF-Wen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wen 2001</LINK> showed that pregnant women who were taking coffee before pregnancy had fewer incidents of spontaneous miscarriage. His population-based prospective study was carried out on a group of 575 women who delivered singleton live births and 75 women who had spontaneous miscarriages. <LINK REF="REF-Clausson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clausson 2002</LINK> in his prospective population-based cohort study of 953 women showed that there was no association between caffeine consumption and birthweight, gestational age and birthweight ratio. Another large prospective study of 2291 mothers also showed that caffeine consumption in the first and third trimesters was not associated with intrauterine growth restriction, low birthweight or preterm delivery (<LINK REF="REF-Bracken-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bracken 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Beneficial effects of caffeine intake during pregnancy are reported in some other studies. Moderate prepregnancy coffee consumption may have a protective association with GDM (<LINK REF="REF-Adeney-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adeney 2007</LINK>). It has been found that the consumption of coffee increases ventilatory frequency in the general population (<LINK REF="REF-Martinet-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martinet 2002</LINK>). A study on rats suggests that caffeine present in drinking fluid of lactating dams (mothers) may prevent ponto-medullary respiratory disturbances (<LINK REF="REF-Bodineau-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bodineau 2006</LINK>). Moreover, the beneficial effect of caffeine has been shown in neonatal rodents. Caffeine as an adenosine antagonist may prevent brain injures due to lack of oxygen. Therefore, it is postulated that caffeine administration during early postnatal development may prevent brain injury, which is the most common cause of cerebral palsy and cognitive impairment in premature infants (<LINK REF="REF-Back-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Back 2006</LINK>).</P>

<P>For this update, no new reports were identified for assessment but we assessed the quality of evidence of the existing studies using the GRADE approach (<LINK REF="REF-Schunemann-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schunemann 2009</LINK>) in order to assess the quality of the body of evidence relating to the following outcomes for the main comparison of caffeinated versus decaffeinated group.</P>

<P>GRADEprofiler (<LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro 2014</LINK>) was used to import data from Review Manager 5.3 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>) in order to create a &#8217;Summary of findings&#8217; table. A summary of the intervention effect and a measure of quality for each of the above outcomes was produced using the GRADE approach. The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome. The evidence can be downgraded from 'high quality' by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious) limitations, depending on assessments for risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates or potential publication bias.</P>

<P>The study by (<LINK REF="STD-Bech-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bech 2007</LINK>) compared drinking caffeinated instant coffee versus decaffeinated instant coffee during pregnancy. Overall, 1207 pregnant women were randomised. After exclusion of 10 participants (due to erroneous serial number, participating twice and second pregnancy), 568 women were randomised to caffeinated instant coffee and 629 to decaffeinated instant coffee. Comparison between these two groups showed only minor differences in baseline characteristics. A total of 1153 women with a live born singleton were included in the analysis of birthweight and length of gestation. Of these, 8.6% (54/629) randomised to the decaffeinated group and 4.9% (28/568) randomised to the caffeinated group dropped out of the study before giving birth. We have included the outcomes of these women in the main analysis.</P>
<P>Main outcomes measured were birthweight and length of gestation. Secondary outcomes included head and abdominal circumference, ponderal index, Apgar score and placenta weight.</P>
<P>We selected those outcomes that matched those specified for our review (mean birthweight, frequency of preterm birth and small-for-gestational age) for analysis.</P>

<P>The mean birthweight for babies born to women in the caffeinated group was 3539 g (standard deviation (SD) 604 g), compared with 3519 g (SD 607 g) for babies born to women in the decaffeinated group (P = 0.48). There was no significant difference between the two groups (mean difference (MD) 20.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) -48.68 to 88.68; participants = 1197) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). In the caffeinated and decaffeinated groups, respectively, 4.5% (25/552) and 4.7% (28/598) of infants were born small-for-gestational age (risk ratio (RR) 0.97, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.64; participants = 1150) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). This difference was not statistically significant.</P>
<P>In the caffeinated and decaffeinated groups, respectively, 4.2% (23/552) and 5.2% (3.1/601) of infants were born preterm (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.37; participants = 1153) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-05-28 10:07:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Two studies met the inclusion criteria but only one contributed data for the prespecified outcomes. Caffeinated instant coffee (568 women) was compared with decaffeinated instant coffee (629 women) and it was found that reducing the caffeine intake of regular coffee drinkers (3+ cups/day) during the second and third trimester by an average of 182 mg/day did not affect birthweight (g), preterm birth or small-for-gestational age. Neither of the studies reported on any of the other primary outcomes (low birthweight; first trimester fetal loss; perinatal mortality; fetal hypoxia; fetal tachycardia) or on any of the reviews neonatal or maternal outcomes. In summary, there is insufficient evidence to evaluate the effect of caffeine on fetal, neonatal and maternal outcomes.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-03-13 16:27:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L Henderson">
<P>Evidence is quite scarce. There is not enough evidence to advise pregnant mothers to restrict coffee intake during pregnancy. </P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-04-30 12:19:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Leanne V Jones">
<P>Risk of bias was found to be moderate in both studies. Two outcomes were assessed and assigned a quality rating using the GRADE methods. Evidence for these two outcomes (birthweight and preterm birth) was assessed as of low quality, with downgrading decisions due to the relatively small sample sizes and the wide confidence interval of the one included trial that contributed data.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-04-30 09:46:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Leanne V Jones">
<P>The review has been updated and no additional reports were identified for assessment. We did not apply any language or date restrictions. We acknowledge that there is the potential for bias at all stages in the reviewing process. We attempted to minimise bias in a number of ways; for example, two review authors independently carried out data extraction and assessed risk of bias. However, we acknowledge that such assessments involve subjective judgments, and another review team may not have agreed with all of our decisions. </P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-05-28 09:52:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Comparative observational studies suggest that caffeine can have a debilitating effect on the natural growth of the fetus, leading to low birthweight (<LINK REF="REF-Bracken-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bracken 2003</LINK>), growth restriction (<LINK REF="REF-Rondo-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rondo 1996</LINK>) and even stillbirth (<LINK REF="REF-Wisborg-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wisborg 2002</LINK>). In contrast, other observational studies with cohort study designs and large sample sizes failed to show any association between caffeine intake and poor pregnancy outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Bracken-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bracken 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clausson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clausson 2002</LINK>). Randomised controlled trials are lacking in this field.</P>
<P>These conflicting results call for properly designed double-blind randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to establish the possibility of confidently advising women about avoiding caffeine during pregnancy. When assessing the available studies in this review, we were unable to find any study investigating some of the predefined outcomes of this review, such as maternal outcomes or secondary fetal outcomes.</P>
<P>Future studies, incorporating long-term outcome measures in evaluating caffeine intake during pregnancy, may prove to be difficult or even unethical. It should be noted that in order to evaluate all primary outcomes (including spontaneous abortion, birth defects) an intervention would need to be applied before pregnancy or in very early pregnancy. If enrolment in the trial encourages women who might discontinue coffee consumption, to continue consuming coffee during pregnancy, the intervention would be unethical if a harmful outcome could be anticipated. Furthermore, it is not clear how much caffeine, in which shape or form, with what quality, can cause fetal or maternal debilitating effect, if any.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-05-28 10:07:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Little evidence is available from the one included randomised controlled trial (RCT) that contributed data for our prespecified outcomes to evaluate the effect of caffeine on fetal, neonatal and maternal outcomes. However, the included trial did not evaluate all of the prespecified outcomes from our review protocol.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-12-12 17:28:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a need for high-quality, properly designed RCTs in this field. Proper randomisation, adequate allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessors, participants and data analysts and clear attrition policies are crucial to ensure appropriate comparisons between caffeinated and decaffeinated groups. Various outcome measurements including fetal and maternal outcomes should be considered in future studies. We recommend a comprehensive RCT to investigate all of the primary and secondary outcomes suggested in our review protocol.</P>

<P>The following methods section of this review is based on a standard template used by the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection of studies</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors will independently assess for inclusion all the potential studies identified as a result of the search strategy. We will resolve any disagreement through discussion or, if required, we will consult a third person.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction and management</HEADING>
<P>We will design a form to extract data. For eligible studies, two review authors will extract the data using the agreed form. We will resolve discrepancies through discussion or, if required, we will consult a third person. Data will be entered into Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>) and checked for accuracy.</P>
<P>When information regarding any of the above is unclear, we plan to contact authors of the original reports to provide further details.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">
<I>Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</I>
</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors will independently assess risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Any disagreement will be resolved by discussion or by involving a third assessor.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(1) Random sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study the method used to generate the allocation sequence in sufficient detail to allow an assessment of whether it should produce comparable groups.</P>
<P>We will assess the method as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study the method used to conceal allocation to interventions prior to assignment and assessed whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, or changed after assignment.</P>
<P>We will assess the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(3.1) Blinding of participants and personnel (checking for possible performance bias)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study the methods used, if any, to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We will consider that studies were at low risk of bias if they were blinded, or if we judged that the lack of blinding unlikely to affect results. We will assess blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes.</P>
<P>We will assess the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low, high or unclear risk of bias for participants;</LI>
<LI>low, high or unclear risk of bias for personnel.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(3.2) Blinding of outcome assessment (checking for possible detection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study the methods used, if any, to blind outcome assessors from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We will assess blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes.</P>
<P>We will assess methods used to blind outcome assessment as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low, high or unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias due to the amount, nature and handling of incomplete outcome data)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study, and for each outcome or class of outcomes, the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We will state whether attrition and exclusions were reported and the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information is reported, or could have been supplied by the trial authors, we plan to re-include missing data in the analyses which we undertake.</P>
<P>We will assess methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (e.g. no missing outcome data; missing outcome data balanced across groups);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (e.g. numbers or reasons for missing data imbalanced across groups; &#8216;as treated&#8217; analysis done with substantial departure of intervention received from that assigned at randomisation);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(5) Selective reporting (checking for reporting bias)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found.</P>
<P>We will assess the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (where it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (where not all the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(6) Other bias (checking for bias due to problems not covered by (1) to (5) above)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(7) Overall risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>We will make explicit judgements about whether studies were at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the <I>Handbook</I> (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/viewDiff?documentPK=D16F33E382E26AA201A8F100856A492A&amp;versionPK1=z1210121446508473626519687752542&amp;versionPK2=z1503050845319134234513171330912#REF-Higgins-2011">Higgins 2011</A>). With reference to (1) to (6) above, we plan to assess the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we considered it is likely to impact on the findings. We will explore the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses - see Sensitivity analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of the quality of evidence in included studies</HEADING>
<P>For future updates the quality of the evidence will be assessed using the GRADE approach (<LINK REF="REF-Schunemann-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schunemann 2009</LINK>) in order to assess the quality of the body of evidence relating to the following outcomes for the main comparison of caffeinated versus decaffeinated group:</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Fetal outcomes</HEADING>
<P>1. Birthweight<BR/>2. Low birthweight<BR/>3. Preterm birth<BR/>4. Perinatal mortality rate</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Neonatal outcomes</HEADING>
<P>5. Sudden infant death syndrome</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Maternal outcomes</HEADING>
<P>6. Gestational diabetes</P>
<P>GRADE profiler (<LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro 2014</LINK>) will be used to import data from Review Manager 5.3 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>) in order to create &#8217;Summary of findings&#8217; tables. A summary of the intervention effect and a measure of quality for each of the above outcomes will be produced using the GRADE approach. The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome. The evidence can be downgraded from 'high quality' by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious) limitations, depending on assessments for risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates or potential publication bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">
<I>Measures of treatment effect</I>
</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Dichotomous data</HEADING>
<P>For dichotomous data, we will present results as summary risk ratio with 95% confidence intervals.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Continuous data</HEADING>
<P>We will use the mean difference if outcomes were measured in the same way between trials. We will use the standardised mean difference to combine trials that measured the same outcome, but used different methods.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">
<I>Unit of analysis issues</I>
</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cluster-randomised trials</HEADING>
<P>We will include cluster-randomised trials in the analyses along with individually-randomised trials. We will adjust their sample sizes or standard errors using the methods described in the <I>Handbook</I> <I>[Section 16.3.4 or 16.3.6]</I> using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), from a similar trial or from a study of a similar population. If we use ICCs from other sources, we will report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identify both cluster-randomised trials and individually-randomised trials, we plan to synthesise the relevant information. We will consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit is considered to be unlikely.</P>
<P>We will also acknowledge heterogeneity in the randomisation unit and perform a sensitivity or subgroup analysis to investigate the effects of the randomisation unit.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cross-over trials</HEADING>
<P>We will not include cross-over designs.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">
<I>Dealing with missing data</I>
</HEADING>
<P>For included studies, we will note levels of attrition. If more eligible studies are included, we will explore the impact of including studies with high levels of missing data in the overall assessment of treatment effect by using sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>For all outcomes, we will carry out analyses, as far as possible, on an intention-to-treat basis, that is, we will attempt to include all participants randomised to each group in the analyses. The denominator for each outcome in each trial will be the number randomised minus any participants whose outcomes are known to be missing.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">
<I>Assessment of heterogeneity</I>
</HEADING>
<P>We will assess statistical heterogeneity in each meta-analysis using the Tau, I and Chi statistics. We will regard heterogeneity as substantial if an I is greater than 30% and either a Tau is greater than zero, or there is a low P value (less than 0.10) in the Chi test for heterogeneity. If we identify substantial heterogeneity (above 30%), we plan to explore it by pre-specified subgroup analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">
<I>Assessment of reporting biases</I>
</HEADING>
<P>If there are 10 or more studies in the meta-analysis, we will investigate reporting biases (such as publication bias) using funnel plots. We will assess funnel plot asymmetry visually. If asymmetry is suggested by a visual assessment, we will perform exploratory analyses to investigate it.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">
<I>Data synthesis</I>
</HEADING>
<P>We will carry out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/viewDiff?documentPK=D16F33E382E26AA201A8F100856A492A&amp;versionPK1=z1210121446508473626519687752542&amp;versionPK2=z1503050845319134234513171330912#REF-RevMan-2014">RevMan 2014</A>). We will use fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it is reasonable to assume that studies are estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials are examining the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods are judged to be sufficiently similar.</P>
<P>If there is clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differ between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity is detected, we will use random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary, if an average treatment effect across trials is considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary will be treated as the average range of possible treatment effects and we will discuss the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect is not clinically meaningful, we will not combine trials. If we use random-effects analyses, the results will be presented as the average treatment effect with 95% confidence intervals, and the estimates of Tau and I.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">
<I>Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</I>
</HEADING>
<P>If we identify substantial heterogeneity, we will investigate it using subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses. We will consider whether an overall summary is meaningful, and if it is, we will use random-effects analysis to produce it.</P>
<P>We will carry out subgroup analyses based on babies' gender, and singleton or twin pregnancy. We will then further conduct subgroup analysis for twin pregnancies based on chorionicity (mono-chorion or di-chorion). These outcomes are considered as confounders on birthweight and adverse fetal outcomes such as fetal loss (e.g. miscarriage, stillbirth) and preterm birth.</P>
<P>We will assess subgroup differences by interaction tests available within RevMan (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/viewDiff?documentPK=D16F33E382E26AA201A8F100856A492A&amp;versionPK1=z1210121446508473626519687752542&amp;versionPK2=z1503050845319134234513171330912#REF-RevMan-2014">RevMan 2014</A>). We will report the results of subgroup analyses quoting the Chi statistic and P value, and the interaction test I value.</P>
