<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>Are antibiotics effective and safe for preventing postoperative infection in women undergoing elective (non-urgent) hysterectomy?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Surgical operation carried out to remove the uterus (hysterectomy) is commonly performed. Most cases are performed as non-urgent (elective) procedures for non-cancerous (benign) conditions affecting the uterus, such as menstrual pain or abnormal bleeding patterns. Antibiotics are usually given before the operation is performed (prophylactic antibiotics, or antibiotic prophylaxis) to prevent or reduce the occurrence of infection after the procedure. Researchers in the Cochrane Collaboration reviewed the evidence on effectiveness and safety of antibiotics used to prevent infection after non-urgent surgical operation to remove the uterus. Evidence is current to November 2016.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We identified 37 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which included a total of 6079 women and compared 20 different types of antibiotics versus placebo (an inactive pill) or versus one another.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>This review found moderate-quality evidence showing that antibiotics appear to be effective in preventing infection in women undergoing non-urgent surgical removal of the uterus through the vagina or abdomen. This suggests that antibiotic prophylaxis reduces the average risk of postoperative infection after vaginal hysterectomy from about 34% to 7% to 14%, and after abdominal hysterectomy from about 16% to 1% to 6%.</P>
<P>However, evidence is insufficient to show whether use of prophylactic antibiotics influences rates of adverse effects (side effects), or whether any one antibiotic is more effective or safer than the others.</P>
<P>When antibiotics are compared head-to-head or in combination versus single antibiotics, it is unclear which individual antibiotic was more effective and safer, or whether combined antibiotics were more effective and safer than single antibiotics. The quality of the evidence for these comparisons is very low.</P>
<P>It is also unclear which dose regimen or route of administration of antibiotics is safest or most effective in women undergoing elective hysterectomy.</P>
<P>The most recent of the studies included in this review was published 14 years ago, at the time of our search. Thus findings from the included studies may not reflect current practice in perioperative and postoperative care and may not show locoregional antimicrobial resistance patterns.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of evidence for our main comparisons ranged from very low to moderate. The main limitations of this evidence are risk of bias due to poor reporting of randomisation methods, imprecision due to small sample sizes and low event rates, and inadequate reporting of adverse effects.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-06-12 14:38:57 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>Elective hysterectomy is commonly performed for benign gynaecological conditions. Hysterectomy can be performed abdominally, laparoscopically, or vaginally, with or without laparoscopic assistance. Antibiotic prophylaxis consists of administration of antibiotics to reduce the rate of postoperative infection, which otherwise affects 40%-50% of women after vaginal hysterectomy, and more than 20% after abdominal hysterectomy. No Cochrane review has systematically assessed evidence on this topic.</P>

<P>We included in this review 37 RCTs, which performed 20 comparisons of various antibiotics versus placebo and versus one another (6079 women).

</P>
<P>
<I>Vaginal hysterectomy</I>
</P>
<P>Moderate-quality evidence shows that women who received antibiotic prophylaxis had fewer total postoperative infections (risk ratio (RR) 0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19 to 0.40; five RCTs, N = 610; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 85%), less urinary tract infection (UTI) (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.77; eight RCTs, N = 1790; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 44%), fewer pelvic infections (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.39; 11 RCTs, N = 2010; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 57%), and fewer postoperative fevers (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.54; nine RCTs, N = 1879; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 48%) than women who did not receive such prophylaxis. This suggests that antibiotic prophylaxis reduces the average risk of postoperative infection from about 34% to 7% to 14%. Whether this treatment has led to differences in rates of other serious infection remains unclear (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.10; one RCT, N = 146; very low-quality evidence).</P>

<P>Women who received antibiotic prophylaxis of any class had fewer total postoperative infections (RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.38; one RCT, N = 345; low-quality evidence), abdominal wound infections (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.92; 11 RCTs, N = 2434; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%; moderate-quality evidence), UTIs (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.51; 11 RCTs, N = 2547; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 26%; moderate-quality evidence), pelvic infections (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.71; 11 RCTs, N = 1883; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 11%; moderate-quality evidence), and postoperative fevers (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.70; 11 RCTs, N = 2581; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 51%; moderate-quality evidence) than women who did not receive prophylaxis, suggesting that antibiotic prophylaxis reduces the average risk of postoperative infection from about 16% to 1% to 6%. Whether this treatment has led to differences in rates of other serious infection remains unclear (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.69; two RCTs, N = 476; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 29%; very low-quality evidence).</P>
<P>It is unclear whether rates of adverse effects differed between groups (RR 1.80, 95% CI 0.62 to 5.18; two RCTs, N = 430; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%; very low-quality evidence).</P>

<B>Head-to-head comparisons between antibiotics </B>

<P>We identified four comparisons: cephalosporin versus penicillin (two RCTs, N = 470), cephalosporin versus tetracycline (one RCT, N = 51), antiprotozoal versus lincosamide (one RCT, N = 80), and cephalosporin versus antiprotozoal (one RCT, N = 78). Data show no evidence of differences between groups for any of the primary outcomes, except that fewer cases of total postoperative infection and postoperative fever were reported in women who received cephalosporin than in those who received antiprotozoal.</P>

<B>Combined antibiotics versus single antibiotics</B>
</P>
<P>
<I>Vaginal hysterectomy</I>
</P>
<P>We identified three comparisons: cephalosporin plus antiprotozoal versus cephalosporin (one RCT, N = 78), cephalosporin plus antiprotozoal versus antiprotozoal (one RCT, N = 78), and penicillin plus antiprotozoal versus penicillin (one RCT, N = 230). Data were unavailable for most outcomes, including adverse effects. We found no evidence of differences between groups, except that fewer women receiving cephalosporin with antiprotozoal received a diagnosis of total postoperative infection, UTI, or postoperative fever compared with women receiving antiprotozoal.</P>
<P>
<I>Abdominal hysterectomy</I>
</P>
<P>We identified one comparison (penicillin plus antiprotozoal vs penicillin only; one RCT, N = 230). Whether differences between groups occurred was unclear. Adverse effects were not reported.</P>

<P>Antibiotic prophylaxis appears to be effective in preventing postoperative infection in women undergoing elective vaginal or abdominal hysterectomy, regardless of the dose regimen.

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-06-12 05:51:44 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Hysterectomy is one of the most commonly performed operations, particularly in the United States, where the lifetime risk of a hysterectomy is 45% (<LINK REF="REF-Merrill-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merrill 2013</LINK>). Most hysterectomies are elective (non-urgent) procedures for benign gynaecological conditions; the most common of these in the United States is leiomyoma (fibroids). Other common indications include endometriosis, heavy menstrual bleeding, and uterovaginal prolapse. This surgery can be performed abdominally, laparoscopically, or vaginally, with or without laparoscopic assistance (<LINK REF="REF-Farquhar-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farquhar 2002</LINK>). The incidence of postoperative infection after hysterectomy was found to be 2% in a recent large cohort from the United States, in which women had surgery between 2012 and 2015 (<LINK REF="REF-Upall--2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Upall 2016</LINK>). In older cohorts, this percentage is likely to be higher owing to factors such as longer hospital stay and prolonged postoperative urinary catheterisation. Some types of hysterectomy may be more susceptible to infectious complications than others, depending on the extent of the breach in body tissues and in the genital tract.</P>
<P>Even with the best surgical and postoperative care, hysterectomy is unavoidably associated with high risk of infection because the procedure breaches the genital tract - an area commonly colonised by a wide variety and large numbers of micro-organisms. In addition, most women undergoing hysterectomy require an indwelling urinary catheter for the first 24 hours, which increases the risk of urinary tract infection. Common sites of infection after hysterectomy include bladder, pelvic floor, the cuff of tissue at the top of the vagina (vaginal vault), and the abdominal wound; related complications include pelvic abscess, infected haematoma (accumulation of blood from the wound), septicaemia (infection of the blood), and pneumonia (<LINK REF="REF-Duff-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duff 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Faro-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faro 2001</LINK>). Such infections are usually caused by a mixture of bacteria from the woman's own vaginal or urethral tissues - both Gram-positive and Gram-negative, and both aerobic and anaerobic (these terms refer to the staining techniques used in identification, and whether the bacteria are oxygen dependent). The individual woman's susceptibility to infection depends upon the effectiveness of her immune system, the virulence of the bacteria present, and the extent of tissue trauma and fluid collection resulting from surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Duff-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duff 1980</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-06-12 11:50:12 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>"Antibiotic prophylaxis" refers to administration of antibiotics to prevent infection: It has been used in surgery since antibiotics were introduced in the 1950s, in an attempt to reduce the rate of postoperative infection. Such infection not only causes patient morbidity but may result in additional costs, extended hospital stay, and increased antibiotic use, which promotes the emergence of antimicrobial resistant organisms (<LINK REF="REF-Dellinger-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dellinger 1994</LINK>). Antibiotic prophylaxis for hysterectomy has been extensively studied, and it has been estimated that such prophylaxis has reduced the rate of postoperative infection by more than half; otherwise, about 40% to 50% of women would develop infection after vaginal hysterectomy, and more than 20% after abdominal hysterectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Duff-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duff 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mittendorf-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mittendorf 1993</LINK>). National guidelines now recommend this practice for all types of hysterectomy (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bratzler-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bratzler 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dellinger-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dellinger 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nelson-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-RCOG-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCOG 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Eyk-N_x002c_-van-Schalkwyk-J-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Eyk N, van Schalkwyk J 2012</LINK>), although in reality, application of such guidelines is variable (<LINK REF="REF-Gorecki-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gorecki 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although various antibiotic regimens and routes of delivery have been used, the most frequent current practice consists of a single dose of antibiotic given intravenously within two hours of the surgical incision, to facilitate optimum serum antibiotic levels during the operation (<LINK REF="REF-Classen-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Classen 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-DiPiro-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">DiPiro 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nelson-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 2016</LINK>). A single dose has been reported to be as effective as multiple doses, although some researchers have suggested repeat dosing if surgery is long or blood loss is high (<LINK REF="REF-DiPiro-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DiPiro 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tanos-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tanos 1994</LINK>). If prophylaxis is continued postoperatively, it is recommended that the duration of therapy should not exceed 24 hours (<LINK REF="REF-Dellinger-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dellinger 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>The type of antibiotic most commonly used is active against a wide range of bacteria (broad spectrum); this type includes amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (Augmentin) or a cephalosporin. Cephalosporins are grouped into generations according to their antimicrobial properties, with the oldest type referred to as "first generation". Subsequent generations of these drugs have progressively widened their antibacterial coverage against Gram-negative organisms while showing a concurrent reduction in effectiveness against Gram-positive organisms; moreover, wide use of very broad-spectrum antibiotics greatly increases the risk of emergence of drug-resistant bacteria (<LINK REF="REF-BNF-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF 2002</LINK>). It is generally recommended that first- or second-generation cephalosporins should be used for prophylaxis, as they appear to be equally effective for this purpose, less expensive than other treatments, and less likely to favour drug resistance (<LINK REF="REF-Fukatsu-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fukatsu 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tanos-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tanos 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weed-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weed 2003</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-06-12 10:20:27 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A very large body of evidence on prophylactic antibiotics for hysterectomy involves hundreds of clinical trials. However, review authors have not systematically assessed this evidence in recent times. Existing meta-analyses conducted some years back focused mainly on abdominal hysterectomy. No meta-analysis has focused on trials involving other routes of hysterectomy.</P>
<P>Several Cochrane reviews of prophylactic antibiotics for elective surgery have reported mixed findings. Two of these examined the topic of caesarean section (<LINK REF="REF-Gyte-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gyte 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nabhan-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nabhan 2016</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Gyte-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gyte 2014</LINK> evaluated different classes of prophylactic antibiotics for women undergoing caesarean section and found that cephalosporins and penicillins had similar efficacy for preventing immediate postoperative infection. Investigators provided no data on late infection, nor on outcomes for the baby. <LINK REF="REF-Nabhan-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nabhan 2016</LINK> compared routes of administration of prophylactic antibiotics and concluded that data show no clear difference between irrigation and intravenous routes in rates of post-caesarean endometritis. A review on elective endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (<LINK REF="REF-Brand-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brand 2010</LINK>) reported that antibiotic prophylaxis appeared to reduce rates of bacteraemia, cholangitis, and septicaemia. A review of different regimens of antibiotic prophylaxis for people undergoing orthognathic surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Brignardello_x002d_Petersen-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brignardello-Petersen 2015</LINK>) found that long-term antibiotic prophylaxis decreased the risk of skin and skin structure infection compared with short-term prophylaxis, but comparisons between short-term prophylaxis and a single preoperative dose were inconclusive. Reviews of antibiotic prophylaxis for elective open inguinal hernia repair (<LINK REF="REF-Sanchez_x002d_Manuel-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanchez-Manuel 2012</LINK>) or for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Sanabria-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanabria 2010</LINK>) provided no clear evidence of benefit for the intervention group.</P>

<P>Randomised, controlled trials (RCTs) of women having an elective total or subtotal hysterectomy by any route and comparing prophylactic antibiotics versus placebo or versus a different type, route, or timing of antibiotic. Trials were at least double-blinded (i.e. with participants and clinicians blinded). We did not include quasi-randomised trials (e.g. trials that allocated treatment by date of birth, day of the week, medical record number, month of the year, or the order in which participants were enrolled in the study).</P>
<P>We excluded from the review studies that did not analyse at least 80% of women randomised for at least one outcome. When trials analysed at least 80% of participants for some outcomes but analysed less than 80% of participants for other outcomes, we included only those outcomes analysed for at least 80% of participants. The rationale for excluding trials with high numbers of withdrawals is that attrition was unlikely to be equally distributed between trial arms: Women who did not develop infection were more likely to be lost to follow-up than those who did develop infection.</P>

<P>After an initial screen of titles and abstracts retrieved by the search, we retrieved the full texts of all potentially eligible studies. At least two review authors (of VJ, JM, and RA) independently examined these full-text articles for compliance with the inclusion criteria and selected studies that were eligible for inclusion in the review. We contacted study investigators as required to clarify study eligibility. We resolved disagreements regarding study eligibility by discussion or by consultation with a third review author.

<P>Two review authors independently extracted data from eligible studies using a data extraction form that they had designed and pilot-tested. We resolved disagreements by discussion or by consultation with a third review author. Data extracted included study characteristics and outcome data.

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2017-06-12 10:50:26 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently examined included studies for risk of bias using the Cochrane "Risk of bias" assessment tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) to assess selection (random sequence generation and allocation concealment); performance (blinding of participants and personnel); detection (blinding of outcome assessors); attrition (incomplete outcome data); reporting (selective reporting); and other bias such as differences in demographic characteristics of participants. We took care to search for within-trial selective reporting, as seen in trials failing to report obvious outcomes, or reporting them in insufficient detail to allow inclusion. We sought published protocols and compared outcomes between the protocol and the final published study.</P>
<P>We resolved disagreements by discussion or by consultation with a third review author. We described all judgements fully and presented conclusions in the "Risk of bias" table; we incorporated these into the interpretation of review findings by performing sensitivity analyses (see below).</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2017-06-09 13:50:38 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For dichotomous data (e.g. infection rates), we used numbers of events in control and intervention groups of each study to calculate risk ratios (RRs). For continuous data (e.g. length of hospital stay), when studies reported exactly the same outcomes, we calculated mean differences (MDs) between treatment groups. We reversed the direction of effect of individual studies, if required, to ensure consistency across trials. We intended to treat ordinal data (e.g. quality of life scores) as continuous data if any included studies reported ordinal data. We presented 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for all outcomes. We compared the magnitude and direction of effects reported by studies versus how they were presented in the review, while taking account of legitimate differences<I>.</I>

<BIAS_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2017-06-09 13:54:23 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In view of the difficulty of detecting and correcting for publication bias and other reporting biases, review authors aimed to minimise their potential impact by ensuring a comprehensive search for eligible studies and by staying alert for duplication of data.

<P>We prepared two separate "Summary of findings" tables for vaginal hysterectomy and abdominal hysterectomy based on the review's main comparison, that is, any antibiotics versus placebo. We used GRADEPRO (<LINK REF="REF-GRADEPro-GDT-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEPro GDT 2014</LINK>) and Cochrane methods (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) and used these tables to evaluate the overall quality of the body of evidence for main review outcomes (total postoperative infections, abdominal wound infection, urinary tract infection, pelvic infection, other serious infection, postoperative fever, and total adverse effects) by applying GRADE criteria (study limitations (i.e. risk of bias), consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness, and publication bias). Two review authors working independently made judgements about evidence quality (high, moderate, low, or very low) and resolved disagreements by discussion. We justified, documented, and incorporated our judgements into reporting of results for each outcome.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-06-12 11:36:19 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is the first Cochrane review to assess the effectiveness and safety of antibiotic prophylaxis for elective hysterectomy for benign disease, and to determine which, if any, prophylactic regimen is most suitable. Thirty-seven studies met the eligibility criteria for inclusion; they compared various antibiotics with placebo and with one another in 20 comparisons involving a total of 6079 participants. Primary outcomes reported were infection (total postoperative infections - early and late, abdominal wound infection, urinary tract infection, pelvic infection, other serious infection, and postoperative fever) and total adverse effects. Secondary outcomes reported were need for therapeutic antibiotics and length of hospital stay.</P>
<P>We subsumed the various comparisons under four broad groups as follows.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Any antibiotics versus placebo</HEADING>
<P>Antibiotics in this case included cephalosporin, penicillin, antiprotozoal, sulphonamide, and lincosamide. Researchers compared these individually or in combination with placebo in two subgroups.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Vaginal hysterectomy</HEADING>
<P>We found evidence of a difference in the incidence of postoperative infection between women who received prophylactic antibiotics and those given placebo. Researchers reported fewer cases of total postoperative infection, urinary tract infection (UTI), pelvic infection, and postoperative fever in women who were given prophylactic antibiotics of any class compared with those who received placebo. However, we found no evidence of a difference between groups in the proportions of women who developed other serious infection.</P>
<P>On safety, we found no available data that would allow us to properly evaluate the adverse effects associated with each group.</P>
<P>With regard to need for therapeutic antibiotics, fewer women in the antibiotic groups required therapeutic antibiotics postoperatively compared with those in the placebo group. Similarly, women who received prophylactic antibiotics spent fewer days in hospital than those given placebo.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Abdominal hysterectomy</HEADING>
<P>As in the vaginal hysterectomy subgroup, we found evidence of a difference between groups in the proportions of women given a diagnosis of postoperative infection. Lower proportions of women who received prophylactic antibiotics received a diagnosis of total postoperative infection, abdominal wound infection, UTI, pelvic infection, and postoperative fever compared with those given placebo. However, we found no evidence of a difference between groups in reported cases of other serious infection.</P>
<P>With regard to safety, we found evidence of a difference between groups in the incidence of total adverse effects, with fewer cases of adverse effects reported in women who received antibiotics compared with those given placebo.</P>
<P>On the need for therapeutic antibiotics, fewer women in the antibiotic group required therapeutic antibiotics compared with those in the placebo group. Similarly, women who received prophylactic antibiotics spent shorter days in hospital than those given placebo.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Head-to-head comparisons between antibiotics </HEADING>
<P>We identified four different head-to-head comparisons: cephalosporin versus penicillin, cephalosporin versus tetracycline, cephalosporin versus antiprotozoal, and antiprotozoal versus lincosamide. Investigators compared participants in two subgroups as follows.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Vaginal hysterectomy</HEADING>
<P>Investigators performed all four comparisons in this subgroup. We found no evidence of a difference between groups in reported cases of total postoperative infection, abdominal wound infection, UTI, pelvic infection, other serious infection, and postoperative fever with cephalosporin versus penicillin, cephalosporin versus tetracycline, and antiprotozoal versus lincosamide, when data were available. However, researchers reported fewer cases of total postoperative infection and postoperative fever in women who received cephalosporin compared with those given antiprotozoal.</P>
<P>Only one comparison (cephalosporin vs penicillin) yielded data on adverse effects, and no evidence showed differences in total adverse effects between the two groups.</P>
<P>With regard to the need for therapeutic antibiotics and length of hospital stay, we found no evidence of a difference between groups in the proportions of women requiring therapeutic antibiotics or in the numbers of days spent in hospital with cephalosporin versus penicillin, cephalosporin versus tetracycline, and antiprotozoal versus lincosamide. However, we found evidence of a difference in the two outcomes between cephalosporin and antiprotozoal groups: Fewer women in the cephalosporin group required therapeutic antibiotics, and women in this group spent fewer days in hospital, compared with those in the antiprotozoal group.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Abdominal hysterectomy</HEADING>
<P>Researchers performed only one of the comparisons (cephalosporin vs penicillin) in this subgroup. We found no evidence of a difference in reported cases of infection (total postoperative infection, abdominal wound infection, UTI, pelvic infection, other serious infection, and postoperative fever) between the two groups. Investigators provided no data on adverse effects, need for therapeutic antibiotics, and length of hospital stay.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">3. Combined antibiotics versus single antibiotic</HEADING>
<P>We identified three different comparisons: cephalosporin plus antiprotozoal versus cephalosporin, cephalosporin plus antiprotozoal versus antiprotozoal, and penicillin plus antiprotozoal versus penicillin. Researchers performed these comparisons in two subgroups as follows.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Vaginal hysterectomy</HEADING>
<P>Investigators performed all three comparisons in this subgroup but did not provide data for most outcomes, including adverse effects. When data were available, we found no evidence of a difference in outcomes between the two groups for two of the comparisons (cephalosporin plus antiprotozoal vs cephalosporin only and penicillin plus antiprotozoal vs penicillin only). However, fewer women who received cephalosporin combined with antiprotozoal received a diagnosis of total postoperative infection, UTI, or postoperative fever compared with those who received antiprotozoal only.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Abdominal hysterectomy</HEADING>
<P>Researchers performed only one comparison (penicillin plus antiprotozoal vs penicillin only) in this subgroup. They provided no data on some outcomes, including adverse effects. When data were available, we found no evidence of a difference in outcomes between the two groups.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">4. Cephalosporins in different dose regimens</HEADING>
<P>Investigators addressed comparisons subsumed under this broad heading most often in single small trials and did not provide data on most of the outcome measures, including total adverse effects. When outcome data were reported, we found no evidence of a difference between groups in the incidence of postoperative infection, the need for therapeutic antibiotics, and length of hospital stay for each of these comparisons.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-06-12 11:38:11 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Overall, the data demonstrate that prophylactic antibiotics are more effective than placebo in preventing postoperative infection, reducing the requirement for therapeutic antibiotics, and shortening length of hospital stay in women undergoing elective vaginal or abdominal hysterectomy. However, few studies reported data on adverse effects associated with the use of antibiotic prophylaxis; therefore, we were unable to determine whether prophylactic antibiotics are associated with significant adverse effects. However, as prophylaxis is usually given as a single shot, the adverse effect rate might truly be low.</P>
<P>Similarly, few studies compared antibiotics head-to-head; thus we were unable to determine which specific antibiotic is most effective, or whether individual antibiotics are similar with respect to effectiveness and safety.</P>
<P>We identified few studies evaluating antibiotics in different combinations, dose regimens, and routes of administration. Thus we could not determine whether it is possible to sustain the effectiveness of antibiotics while reducing adverse effects by combining lower doses of two different antibiotics, or by using certain dose regimens or routes of administration.</P>
<P>None of the included studies investigated laparoscopic hysterectomy (total or subtotal laparoscopic hysterectomy or laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy). Thus the findings of this review are not applicable to this type of hysterectomy, which has been performed increasingly over the past decade.</P>
<P>One should interpret the results on "length of hospital stay" and "urinary tract infections" with caution, as some studies reporting these outcomes were conducted decades ago. Meanwhile, hospital stay has decreased tremendously over the past few decades owing to improved knowledge of postoperative care and doctors' adaptation of the principles of "early recovery after surgery" (ERAS®). These include striving postoperatively for early mobilisation, normalisation of oral intake, and early removal of urinary catheters, thus decreasing length of hospital stay, risk of nosocomial infection, and risk of UTI. For example, it is very rare nowadays for healthy patients who undergo uncomplicated vaginal hysterectomy to be admitted to a hospital for longer than three days, whereas the studies in <LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK> show mean hospitalisation duration of 8.3 to 11.9 days.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-06-12 11:39:38 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Most studies considered for this review were of poor quality in relation to risk of bias. We excluded many studies owing to unclear design, lack of double-blinding, or non-blinding. Among the included studies, very few clearly described their methods of sequence generation and allocation concealment. For most comparisons, effect estimates were associated with imprecision due to small sample sizes and wide confidence intervals.</P>
<P>We assessed the quality of evidence for the review's main comparison (any antibiotics vs placebo for vaginal and abdominal hysterectomy). The quality of evidence for our primary outcome ranged from very low to moderate. The main limitations in the body of evidence were risk of bias (due to poor reporting of sequence generation and allocation concealment), serious imprecision (associated with small sample size and low event rates, leading to wide confidence intervals), and inadequate reporting of adverse effects.</P>
<P>We rated the quality of evidence for head-to head comparisons of antibiotics and for dose comparisons as very low owing to imprecision related to wide confidence intervals and low event rates, and to risk of bias associated with poor reporting of study methods.</P>
<P>We examined the presence of publication or reporting bias in a funnel plot for five subgroups in one of the comparisons (any antibiotics vs placebo) and found evidence suggesting a tendency towards publication or reporting bias, with smaller studies likely to report beneficial effects with antibiotic prophylaxis. However, we did not consider that evidence of publication bias was strong enough to necessitate downgrading the quality of evidence.</P>

</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-06-12 13:39:31 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Clinical guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Deffieux-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deffieux 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2008</LINK>) and narrative reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Clifford-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clifford 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hodges-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodges 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steiner-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steiner 2017</LINK>) recommend antibiotic prophylaxis for women undergoing hysterectomy, and pragmatically opt to advise cephalosporins as a first choice. However, the evidence base for first-line cephalosporins is limited by the lack of recent trials. Moreover, no randomised controlled trials (RCTs) at all examined the topic of antibiotic prophylaxis for laparoscopic hysterectomy.</P>
<P>Much of the evidence is very old: For example, <LINK REF="REF-Clifford-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clifford 2012</LINK> is a narrative review that refers to old studies such as <LINK REF="STD-Duff-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Duff 1982</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Tanos-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tanos 1994</LINK> to recommend prophylactic antibiotics for hysterectomy, and <LINK REF="STD-Larsson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Larsson 2002</LINK> to recommend preoperative treatment of bacterial vaginosis. We excluded both <LINK REF="STD-Larsson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Larsson 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Tanos-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tanos 1994</LINK> from the current review because investigators utilised extended seven-day prophylaxis as well as an historical comparison group (respectively).</P>
<P>A more recent review (<LINK REF="REF-Morrill-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrill 2013</LINK>) investigated antibiotic prophylaxis in selected gynaecological surgeries, including hysteroscopic and cervical surgery, while <I>excluding</I> hysterectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Morrill-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrill 2013</LINK>). Review authors concluded that evidence provides a strong case for prophylactic antibiotics for abdominal gynaecological surgery but acknowledged lack of evidence for their use in vaginal surgery. For laparoscopic surgery, we found no advantage of prophylactic antibiotics, but high-quality evidence was lacking and results were hampered by heterogeneity of the population; women underwent widely varying surgeries, from diagnostic laparoscopy to ovarian cystectomy or extended endometriosis surgery.</P>
<P>A large retrospective cohort of 21,358 hysterectomies performed in the United States (<LINK REF="REF-Upall--2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Upall 2016</LINK>) investigated associations between a composite outcome of "any surgical site infection" and classes of antibiotics administered preoperatively. Investigators found that women receiving beta-lactam antibiotic regimens (i.e. first- or second-generation cephalosporins, ampicillin plus sulbactam, or ertapenem) had lower risk of surgical site infection than women given a beta-lactam alternative (i.e. clindamycin combination, gentamycin combination, metronidazole combination) or a non-standard regimen (i.e. clindamycin, gentamycin, or aztreonam, or another antibiotic alone). We found comparable benefit for cephalosporins but only for vaginal hysterectomy when compared with antiprotozoal alone.</P>
<P>Several published systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the use of antibiotics in hysterectomy have reported mainly on the same set of included RCTs.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Wttewaall_x002d_Evelaar-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wttewaall-Evelaar 1990</LINK> meta-analysed 17 randomised blinded placebo-controlled trials of prophylaxis for elective abdominal hysterectomy, all published between 1986 and 1988. In most cases, the antibiotics used were cephalosporins. Review authors concluded that prophylaxis significantly reduced levels of infection (p &lt; 0.001; no odds ratio reported), and that additional placebo-controlled trials were not warranted. <LINK REF="REF-Mittendorf-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mittendorf 1993</LINK> meta-analysed 31 English-language RCTs published from 1972 to 1986, and concluded that antibiotic prophylaxis reduced the rate of serious infection after abdominal hysterectomy from 21.1% to 9% (P = 0.00001; no odds ratio reported in text). Trials that used different routes of administration and differing prophylaxis regimens, varying from a single dose to five days' duration, were pooled. <LINK REF="REF-Tanos-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tanos 1994</LINK> meta-analysed 17 "controlled or comparative" trials conducted between 1978 and 1990 to investigate single or one-day prophylactic regimens of intravenous or intramuscular cephalosporins for abdominal hysterectomy. It is unclear whether all of the included trials were randomised, and some trials included oncology patients among their participants. Again, results clearly favoured the use of prophylaxis (odds ratio (OR) 0.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.3 to 0.4).</P>
<P>Two of these meta-analyses combined results from studies that included very different participants or interventions. The other (<LINK REF="REF-Wttewaall_x002d_Evelaar-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wttewaall-Evelaar 1990</LINK>) was more rigorous but did not include any of the numerous studies carried out since 1986.</P>
<P>More recently, a systematic review by Costa and Krauss-Silva meta-analysed double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials on the use of antibiotic prophylaxis for elective, non-radical abdominal hysterectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Costa-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Costa 2004</LINK>). Review authors meta-analysed a total of 16 studies published between 1977 and 2003, but it is important to note that the most recent study was published in 1998, and the 15 remaining RCTs were published in 1988 or earlier. Review authors concluded that use of antibiotic prophylaxis is effective for prevention of postoperative infection (risk ratio (RR) 0.49, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.59). They concluded that no evidence showed benefit for multiple- versus single-dose prophylaxis.</P>
<P>We identified no RCTs on the use of antibiotics in laparoscopic hysterectomy for inclusion in this review. A recent review by Lachiewicz on laparoscopic hysterectomy recommends use of antibiotics, with dose adjusted to body weight (increased dosage when patients weigh more than 120 kilograms), and use of antiprotozoals. The latter recommendation consists of using antiprotozoals routinely or after screening for bacterial vaginosis before surgery in which the vaginal-abdominal barrier was breached (<LINK REF="REF-Lachiewicz-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lachiewicz 2015</LINK>). However, arguments for these recommendations in laparoscopy derive from authority-based guidelines or non-randomised trials (<LINK REF="REF-Bratzler-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bratzler 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soper-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soper 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Findings from the studies above are consistent with the findings of this review, which found evidence that antibiotic prophylaxis is effective in preventing postoperative infection in women undergoing elective vaginal or abdominal hysterectomy.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-06-12 12:04:09 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Antibiotic prophylaxis appears to be effective in preventing postoperative infection in women undergoing elective vaginal or abdominal hysterectomy, regardless of the dose regimen. However, evidence was insufficient to show whether their use influences rates of adverse effects. Similarly, evidence was insufficient to show which (if any) individual antibiotic, dose regimen, or route of administration is safest and most effective. In interpreting results, it is important to realise that the most recent of the included studies was published 14 years ago, at the time of our search. Thus findings from included studies might not reflect current practice in perioperative and postoperative care or might not show locoregional antimicrobial resistance patterns.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-06-12 11:46:40 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>More studies including large numbers of women and based on sound methods are needed to detect meaningful differences in efficacy between various antibiotics and to properly evaluate adverse effects associated with their use as prophylaxis for women undergoing elective hysterectomy. Also needed are more studies investigating various antibiotics in different combinations, dose regimens, and routes of administration to determine which combinations, dose regimens, and routes of administration are associated with better efficacy and fewer adverse effects. Laparoscopic hysterectomy is now commonly performed; thus future research should focus on the use of prophylaxis in laparoscopic hysterectomy (total or subtotal laparoscopic hysterectomy or laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy).</P>
<P>In addition, trial publications should adequately report trial methods in accordance with the CONSORT statement.</P>

<LI>We have extensively updated the Methods of the review to reflect the latest methods, as recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration, including use of the Cochrane "Risk of bias" tool and GRADE methods to assess the quality of evidence. We have added more detail about our statistical methods (in keeping with current Cochrane recommendations and the RevMan format).</LI>
<LI>We planned to undertake subgroup analyses by surgical route, antibiotic type, and antibiotic regimen. We subgrouped our main analysis by surgical route. We decided we would not conduct the other two planned subgroup analyses but focused instead on head-to-head comparisons between different antibiotics and antibiotic regimens, as these are more informative than subgroup analyses, which consist of indirect comparisons.</LI>
<LI>We planned to report numbers needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTBs) as an absolute measure but instead reported percentages, as these can be easily interpreted and are consistent with absolute measures (rates per thousand) displayed in the "Summary of findings" tables.</LI>
<LI>In our protocol, we planned to explore statistical heterogeneity when we included more than 10 trials in an analysis, by exploring methodological and clinical differences between them. In the review, we decided to explore substantial statistical heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> &gt; 50%) by conducting sensitivity analyses by choice of statistical model and effect estimate, regardless of the number of trials included in an analysis. We planned to explore other clinical or methodological differences between studies only if we noted variation in the direction of effect.</LI>
<LI>We excluded from the review the following outcomes, which we had included in the protocol - asymptomatic infection, re-admission to hospital, and costs - because we decided that these three outcomes can be considered as proxies for our primary outcomes and would not be likely to assist clinical decision making.</LI>
