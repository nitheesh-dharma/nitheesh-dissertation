<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-11-29 13:31:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Is droperidol effective for managing people who are aggressive or agitated due to psychosis?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>People with psychosis can experience symptoms such as hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that are not there) or delusions (belief in things that are bizarre or obviously not true). These symptoms are often disturbing and frightening, and can lead to people with psychosis becoming very disturbed, violent or agitated. Droperidol is one of the medicines normally used to help calm (tranquillise) people in this situation. Previously, the use of this drug was based on results from small clinical trials with no firm conclusion regarding its effects. Larger trials were needed.</P>
<P>
<B>Searching</B>
</P>
<P>In 2015, the Information Specialist of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group updated previous searches of their specialised register of studies. The review authors identified and screened 21 records.</P>
<P>
<B>Description of studies</B>
</P>
<P>Six randomised controlled studies are now included in the review. All the studies randomised people who were aggressive or agitated due to psychosis to receive either droperidol or placebo (a pretend medicine), haloperidol, olanzapine or midazolam. The size of the studies ranged from 40 to 221 participants. All took place in within a hospital. Four of the six studies were under two hours of duration.</P>
<P>
<B>Main results</B>
</P>
<P>Compared to placebo, droperidol was more effective at tranquillising agitated participants 30 minutes after taking it. Similar results were found for tranquillisation when droperidol was compared with haloperidol but this effect was less clear, and not evident when droperidol was compared to midazolam or olanzapine. Droperidol did not cause more side effects than the other drugs in the studies. The studies did not look at costs.</P>
<P>
<B>Review authors' conclusions</B>
</P>
<P>Although we could only include six studies, they provided high-quality evidence suggesting that droperidol is effective and can be used to control people with very disturbed and aggressive behaviours caused by psychosis.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-11-29 13:58:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>People experiencing acute psychotic illnesses, especially those associated with agitated or violent behaviour, may require urgent pharmacological tranquillisation or sedation. Droperidol, a butyrophenone antipsychotic, has been used for this purpose in several countries.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-11-29 13:58:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To estimate the effects of droperidol, including its cost-effectiveness, when compared to placebo, other 'standard' or 'non-standard' treatments, or other forms of management of psychotic illness, in controlling acutely disturbed behaviour and reducing psychotic symptoms in people with schizophrenia-like illnesses.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-11-29 13:58:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We updated previous searches by searching the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Register (18 December 2015). We searched references of all identified studies for further trial citations and contacted authors of trials. We supplemented these electronic searches by handsearching reference lists and contacting both the pharmaceutical industry and relevant authors.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-11-29 13:58:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with useable data that compared droperidol to any other treatment for people acutely ill with suspected acute psychotic illnesses, including schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, mixed affective disorders, the manic phase of bipolar disorder or a brief psychotic episode.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-11-29 13:58:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For included studies, we assessed quality, risk of bias and extracted data. We excluded data when more than 50% of participants were lost to follow-up. For binary outcomes, we calculated standard estimates of risk ratio (RR) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). We created a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-12-14 11:48:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified four relevant trials from the update search (previous version of this review included only two trials). When droperidol was compared with placebo, for the outcome of tranquillisation or asleep by 30 minutes we found evidence of a clear difference (1 RCT, N = 227, RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.31, <I>high-quality evidence</I>). There was a clear demonstration of reduced risk of needing additional medication after 60 minutes for the droperidol group (1 RCT, N = 227, RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.85, <I>high-quality evidence</I>). There was no evidence that droperidol caused more cardiovascular arrhythmia (1 RCT, N = 227, RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.31, <I>moderate-quality evidence</I>) and respiratory airway obstruction (1 RCT, N = 227, RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.52, <I>low-quality evidence</I>) than placebo. For 'being ready for discharge', there was no clear difference between groups (1 RCT, N = 227, RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.48, <I>high-quality evidence</I>). There were no data for mental state and costs.</P>
<P>Similarly, when droperidol was compared to haloperidol, for the outcome of tranquillisation or asleep by 30 minutes we found evidence of a clear difference (1 RCT, N = 228, RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.09, <I>high-quality evidence</I>). There was a clear demonstration of reduced risk of needing additional medication after 60 minutes for participants in the droperidol group (2 RCTs, N = 255, RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.90, <I>high-quality evidence</I>). There was no evidence that droperidol caused more cardiovascular hypotension (1 RCT, N = 228, RR 2.80, 95% CI 0.30 to 26.49,<I> moderate-quality evidence</I>) and cardiovascular hypotension/desaturation (1 RCT, N = 228, RR 2.80, 95% CI 0.12 to 67.98, <I>low-quality evidence</I>) than haloperidol. There was no suggestion that use of droperidol was unsafe. For mental state, there was no evidence of clear difference between the efficacy of droperidol compared to haloperidol (Scale for Quantification of Psychotic Symptom Severity, 1 RCT, N = 40, mean difference (MD) 0.11, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.29, <I>low-quality evidence</I>). There were no data for service use and costs.</P>
<P>Whereas, when droperidol was compared with midazolam, for the outcome of tranquillisation or asleep by 30 minutes we found droperidol to be less acutely tranquillising than midazolam (1 RCT, N = 153, RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.28, <I>high-quality evidence</I>). As regards the 'need for additional medication by 60 minutes after initial adequate sedation, we found an effect (1 RCT, N = 153, RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.20, <I>moderate-quality evidence</I>). In terms of adverse effects, we found no statistically significant differences between the two drugs for either airway obstruction (1 RCT, N = 153, RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.55, <I>low-quality evidence</I>) or respiratory hypoxia (1 RCT, N = 153, RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.16 to 3.03, <I>moderate-quality evidence</I>) - but use of midazolam did result in three people (out of around 70) needing some sort of 'airway management' with no such events in the droperidol group. There were no data for mental state, service use and costs.</P>
<P>Furthermore, when droperidol was compared to olanzapine, for the outcome of tranquillisation or asleep by any time point, we found no clear differences between the older drug (droperidol) and olanzapine (e.g. at 30 minutes: 1 RCT, N = 221, RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.11, <I>high-quality evidence</I>). There was a suggestion that participants allocated droperidol needed less additional medication after 60 minutes than people given the olanzapine (1 RCT, N = 221, RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.87, <I>high-quality evidence</I>). There was no evidence that droperidol caused more cardiovascular arrhythmia (1 RCT, N = 221, RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.88, <I>moderate-quality evidence</I>) and respiratory airway obstruction (1 RCT, N = 221, RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.20 to 4.72, <I>low-quality evidence</I>) than olanzapine. For 'being ready for discharge', there was no difference between groups (1 RCT, N = 221, RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.34, <I>high-quality evidence</I>). There were no data for mental state and costs.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-11-29 13:58:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Previously, the use of droperidol was justified based on experience rather than evidence from well-conducted and reported randomised trials. However, this update found high-quality evidence with minimal risk of bias to support the use of droperidol for acute psychosis. Also, we found no evidence to suggest that droperidol should not be a treatment option for people acutely ill and disturbed because of serious mental illnesses.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-11-29 13:58:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Violent or acutely disturbed people pose a risk to themselves and to others, as well as a diagnostic dilemma (<LINK REF="STD-Thomas-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 1992</LINK>). The actual prevalence of violent behaviour is high although percentages differ according to setting, definition, client group and measure (<LINK REF="REF-Latalova-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Latalova 2014</LINK>). For people presenting with first episode of illness, serious violence has been reported in anything between 2% and nearly 30% (<LINK REF="REF-Latalova-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Latalova 2014</LINK>). Violent behaviour may be more prevalent at this point in a person's illness, when their symptoms may have gone unnoticed for some time, and they are more vigorous than later on in life (<LINK REF="REF-Winsper-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winsper 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Ideally, to ensure a safe and therapeutic environment, attempts should be made to calm the person either through verbal de-escalation or intensive nursing techniques. Behaviour may frequently be too disturbed or agitated for 'verbal tranquillisation' to be effective, and further action, in the form of rapid tranquillisation, may be necessary.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-11-29 13:58:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Various drug regimens are used in such emergency situations, and clinical practice differs. One survey from the USA found that the medical directors of 20 emergency rooms preferred drug management for aggressive people to be a haloperidol-lorazepam mixture (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>) (<LINK REF="REF-Binder-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Binder 1999</LINK>). In 1993, a similar survey of clinicians' preferences in the UK found that chlorpromazine was the most common choice (<LINK REF="REF-Cunnane-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cunnane 1994</LINK>). Another survey of emergency rooms in Rio de Janeiro found that a haloperidol-promethazine mixture was commonly used for emergency intramuscular (IM) sedation of severely agitated/aggressive people (70 to 100 people with suspected psychotic illness per week per 3.5 million; <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>) (<LINK REF="REF-Huf-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huf 2002</LINK>). A survey of frequency of emergency prescribing in a general psychiatric hospital in South London (UK) showed that rapid medical tranquillisation was required 102 times in 160 days (<LINK REF="REF-Pilowsky-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pilowsky 1992</LINK>). Eight different drugs were used, amongst which diazepam, haloperidol and droperidol were used most often (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>).</P>
<P>Droperidol (marketed as Dehydrobenzperidol, Dridol, Droleptan, Droperidols, Inapsin, Inapsine, Leptanal comp, Leptofen, Paxical or Sintodian) has been widely used in Europe by psychiatrists since the 1960s for treating acute or chronic psychoses (<LINK REF="STD-Cocito-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Cocito 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Resnick-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Resnick 1984</LINK>). It inhibits the effects of dopamine. In the USA, it is used primarily in conjunction with anaesthetics because of its sedative and antiemetic properties (<LINK REF="STD-Resnick-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Resnick 1984</LINK>). Reported advantages of droperidol over haloperidol (another inhibitor of the effects of dopamine) include: a faster onset of action when given IM, swifter elimination from the body and fewer adverse effects (<LINK REF="STD-Richards-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Richards 1998</LINK>). The most commonly reported adverse effects for droperidol include hypotension (abnormally low blood pressure) and tachycardia (above normal heart rate). Other adverse effects include restlessness, hyperactivity, anxiety and dysphoria (feeling ill at ease). The frequency of adverse effects involving movement disorders is reported to be 20% to 40% (<LINK REF="STD-Cocito-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Cocito 1970</LINK>). Droperidol has been associated only rarely with serious adverse effects such as neuroleptic malignant syndrome (altered consciousness, muscle rigidity and autonomic instability) and sudden death. Sudden death has been reported to be associated with high doses of droperidol (25 mg or more) in people at risk for cardiac dysrhythmia, such as people with severe electrolyte disturbances or alcohol withdrawal (<LINK REF="REF-RxList-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">RxList 2000</LINK>). Droperidol should not be given to people with severe depression as it may aggravate their symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Martindale-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martindale 1982</LINK>).</P>
<P>Following an extensive risk-benefit assessment requested by the Medicines Control Agency, Janssen-Cilag, the pharmaceutical company who market droperidol, concluded that the oral form of droperidol should be discontinued and that the injectable form would no longer be commercially viable. The Medical Director of Janssen-Cilag told PharmaTimes (<A HREF="http://www.pharmatimes.co.uk/">www.pharmatimes.co.uk/</A>) that the decision had been taken because many people who receive droperidol also receive other medications that extend QT prolongation, and are more likely to have background illnesses that may exacerbate the problem. He added that the company intended to implement a world-wide withdrawal of droperidol, and supplies would stop entering the distribution chain at the end of March 2001. This seems not to have happened and droperidol has been used for this and other purposes (<LINK REF="REF-Furyk-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furyk 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Storrar-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Storrar 2014</LINK>), and research has continued. Some authoritative findings are not supportive of the original decision regarding QT prolongation (<LINK REF="STD-Calver-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Calver 2015</LINK>), and call into question the original Food and Drugs Authority decision and their decision-making process (<LINK REF="REF-Newman-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newman 2015</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-11-29 13:58:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Droperidol, 1-(1-3-(p-fluorobenzoyl)propyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-4-pyridyl)-2-benzimidazolinone, is a butyrophenone neuroleptic drug (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). Butyrophenones inhibit the effects of dopamine and resemble phenothiazines such as trifluoperazine. They have fewer sedative and antimuscarinic effects than other phenothiazine derived antipsychotic drugs, but exhibit more pronounced adverse effects upon the extrapyramidal nerve system. Back in March 2000, the cost of medication with droperidol (Droleptan) in Great Britain was GBP0.90 for a 2 mL amp injection, or GBP0.25 for a 10 mg tablet (<LINK REF="REF-BNF-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF 2000</LINK>). Droperidol may be taken orally (5 mg to 20 mg repeated every four to six hours, as necessary) or as an IM or intravenous (IV) injection (dosages: up to 10 mg repeated every four to six hours for IM; and 5 mg to 15 mg repeated every four to six hours for IV). The onset of action from injection is 3 to 10 minutes, although the peak effect may not be apparent for 30 minutes. The duration of sedation and tranquillisation may last for two to four hours, although alteration of alertness may persist for up to 12 hours (<LINK REF="REF-RxList-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">RxList 2000</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-11-29 13:58:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Droperidol is still in use. We think it is still being used in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Greece, India, Italy, Netherlands, New Zealand, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, and the USA. It is of interest to researchers and clinicians in the area of management of acute aggression. Previous versions of this review are out of date (<LINK REF="REF-Cure-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cure 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cure-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cure 2004</LINK>), and this review forms one of a family of related work (<LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>).</P>

<P>We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs). If a trial had been described as 'double-blind' but implied randomisation, we would have included such trials in a sensitivity analysis (see <LINK TAG="SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS" TYPE="SECTION">Sensitivity analysis</LINK>).

<P>Any people with acutely disturbed/aggressive/agitated behaviour secondary to psychotic illnesses such as schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, mixed affective disorders, the manic phase of bipolar disorder or a brief psychotic episode, irrespective of age and sex. The definition of 'acute' adopted for the purposes of this review was determined by the statements and implications made by the authors of the trials that the behavioural disturbances of the participants were of sudden onset or extreme in nature, or both. If trial participants were included who were not clearly acutely disturbed, we analysed data together and separately to see what effect the results had on the summated outcome. If there were differences, we presented data separately. We only included trials of people with organic illnesses or people abusing substances if participants were exhibiting disturbed behaviour resulting from a psychotic episode, and we analysed these data separately. For the 2015 update, we decided to slightly widen our inclusion criteria by including studies where the <I>majority</I> of people in the study had some form of mental illness that was thought to be fuelling their aggression/agitation - even if their data were 'contaminated' by data relating to people who were aggressive for reasons thought to not be because of mental illness.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.2 Scale-derived data</HEADING>
<P>We included continuous data from rating scales only if:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the psychometric properties of the measuring instrument were described in a peer-reviewed journal (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>); and</LI>
<LI>the measuring instrument had not been written or modified by one of the trialists for that trial.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Ideally, the measuring instrument should have been either a self-report or completed by an independent rater or relative (not the therapist). We realise that this is not often reported clearly; in <LINK TAG="STUDY_DESCRIPTION" TYPE="SECTION">Description of studies</LINK> we noted if this was the case.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.3 Endpoint versus change data</HEADING>
<P>Both endpoint and change data have advantages. Change data can remove a component of between-person variability from the analysis. However, calculation of change needs two assessments (baseline and endpoint), which can be difficult in unstable and difficult-to-measure conditions such as schizophrenia. We decided to use primarily endpoint data, and only use change data if the former were not available. We combined endpoint and change data in the analysis, as we preferred to use mean differences (MD) rather than standardised mean differences throughout (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.4 Skewed data</HEADING>
<P>Continuous data on clinical and social outcomes are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data, we applied the following standards to all data before inclusion.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">For change data</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>We entered change data, as when continuous data are presented on a scale that includes a possibility of negative values (such as change data), it is difficult to tell whether data are skewed or not. We presented and entered change data into statistical analyses.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">For endpoint data</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>When a scale started from the finite number 0, we subtracted the lowest possible value from the mean and divided this by the standard deviation (SD). If this value was lower than 1, it strongly suggested a skew, and we would have excluded the study. If this ratio was higher than 1 but below 2, there was suggestion of skew. We would have entered the study and tested whether its inclusion or exclusion would have changed the results substantially. Finally, if the ratio was larger than 2, we would have included the study, because skew was less likely (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>If a scale started from a positive value (such as the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, which can have values from 30 to 210) (<LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>), we would have modified the calculation described above to take into account the scale starting point. In such cases, skew is present if 2 SD &gt; (S - S<SUB>min</SUB>), where S is the mean score and S<SUB>min</SUB> is the minimum score.</LI>
</UL>
<P>(Please note, irrespective of the above rules, we would enter endpoint data from studies of at least 200 participants in the analysis because skewed data pose less of a problem in large studies.)</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.5 Common measure</HEADING>
<P>To facilitate comparison between trials, we intended to convert variables that could be reported in different metrics, such as days in hospital (e.g. mean days per year, per week or per month) to a common metric (e.g. mean days per month).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.6 Conversion of continuous to binary data</HEADING>
<P>Where possible, we attempted to convert outcome measures to dichotomous data. We did this by identifying cutoff points on rating scales and dividing participants accordingly into 'clinically improved' or 'not clinically improved'. It is generally assumed that if there is a 50% reduction in a scale-derived score such as the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), in <LINK REF="REF-Overall-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1962</LINK>, or the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, in <LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>, this could be considered to be a clinically significant response (<LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005b</LINK>). If data based on these thresholds were not available, we used the primary cutoff presented by the original authors.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.7 Direction of graphs</HEADING>
<P>Where possible, we entered data in such a way that the area to the left of the line of no effect indicated a favourable outcome for droperidol intervention. Where keeping to this made it impossible to avoid outcome titles with clumsy double-negatives (e.g. 'not un-improved'), we reported data where the left of the line indicated an unfavourable outcome. We noted this in the relevant graphs.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1 Binary data</HEADING>
<P>For binary outcomes, we calculated a standard estimation of the risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). It has been shown that RR is more intuitive than odds ratios, and that odds ratios tend to be interpreted as RR by clinicians (<LINK REF="REF-Boissel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boissel 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2000</LINK>). The number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome/number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome statistic with its CIs is intuitively attractive to clinicians but is problematic both in its accurate calculation in meta-analyses and its interpretation (<LINK REF="REF-Hutton-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hutton 2009</LINK>). For binary data presented in the <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>, where possible, we calculated illustrative comparative risks.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2 Continuous data</HEADING>
<P>For continuous outcomes, we estimated MD between groups with 95% CI. We preferred not to calculate effect size measures (standardised mean difference). However, if scales of very considerable similarity had been used, we presumed there was a small difference in measurement, and we calculated effect size and transformed the effect back to the units of one or more of the specific instruments.</P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2016-11-29 13:58:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1 Cluster trials</HEADING>
<P>Studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice), but analysis and pooling of clustered data pose problems. Authors often fail to account for intraclass correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>), whereby P values are spuriously low, CIs unduly narrow, and statistical significance overestimated. This causes type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>If clustering had not been accounted for in primary studies, we would have presented data in a table, with an asterisk symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review, we will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for their clustered data and to adjust for this by using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). If clustering was incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we would have presented these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjusted for the clustering effect.</P>
<P>We sought statistical advice and were advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a 'design effect'. We calculated this using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the ICC (design effect = 1 + (m - 1) × ICC) (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC was not reported, we would have assumed it to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>If cluster studies had been appropriately analysed taking into account ICCs and relevant data documented in the report, we would have synthesised these with other studies using the generic inverse-variance technique.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2 Cross-over trials</HEADING>
<P>A major concern of cross-over trials is the carry-over effect. It occurs if an effect (e.g. pharmacological, physiological or psychological) of the treatment in the first phase is carried over to the second phase. As a consequence, on entry to the second phase, the participants can differ systematically from their initial state despite a washout phase. For the same reason, cross-over trials are not appropriate if the condition of interest is unstable (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). As both effects are very likely in severe mental illness, we had planned to use only the data of the first phase of cross-over studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3 Studies with multiple treatment groups</HEADING>
<P>Where a study involved more than two treatment arms, if relevant, we presented the additional treatment arms in comparisons. If data were binary, we simply added these and combined them within the two-by-two table. If data were continuous, we combined data following the formula in Section 7.7.3.8 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Where the additional treatment arms were not relevant, we did not use these data.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">1 Overall loss of credibility</HEADING>
<P>At some degree of loss of follow-up data must lose credibility (<LINK REF="REF-Xia-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xia 2009</LINK>). We chose that, for any outcome, should more than 50% of the data be unaccounted for, we would not reproduce these data or use them within analyses (except for the outcome 'leaving the study early'). However, if more than 50% of those in one arm of a study were lost, but the total loss was less than 50%, we would have marked such data with an asterisk to indicate that such a result may well be prone to bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2 Binary</HEADING>
<P>In the case where attrition for a binary outcome was between 0% and 50% and where these data were not clearly described, we presented data on a 'once-randomised-always-analyse' basis (an intention-to-treat analysis). We assumed all participants leaving the study early to have the same rates of negative outcome as participants who completed, except for the outcomes of death and adverse effects. For these outcomes, we used the rate of participants who stayed in the study - in that arm of the trial - for participants who did not. We undertook a sensitivity analysis to test how prone the primary outcomes were to change when data only from people who completed the study to that point were compared to the intention-to-treat analysis using the above assumptions.</P>

<P>In the case where attrition for a continuous outcome was between 0% and 50%, and data only from people who completed the study to that point were reported, we used these data.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">3.2 Standard deviations</HEADING>
<P>If in future updates SDs are not reported, we will first try to obtain the missing values from the authors. If these are not available, where measures of variance for continuous data are missing, but an exact standard error (SE) and CIs are available for group means, and either P value or t value is available for differences in mean, we can calculate them according to the rules described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). When only the SE is reported, SDs can be calculated by the formula SD = SE × square root (n). Sections 7.7.3 and 16.1.3 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> present detailed formulae for estimating SDs from P values, t or F values, CIs, ranges or other statistics (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). If these formulae do not apply, we will calculate the SDs according to a validated imputation method that is based on the SDs of the other included studies (<LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2006</LINK>). Although some of these imputation strategies can introduce error, the alternative would be to exclude a given study's outcome and thus to lose information. We nevertheless will examine the validity of the imputations in a sensitivity analysis excluding imputed values.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">3.3 Last observation carried forward</HEADING>
<P>We anticipated that in some studies the method of last observation carried forward (LOCF) would be employed within the study report. As with all methods of imputation to deal with missing data, LOCF introduces uncertainty about the reliability of the results (<LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2007</LINK>). Therefore, where LOCF data were used in the trial, if less than 50% of the data were assumed, we presented and used these data and indicated that they were the product of LOCF assumptions.</P>

We interpreted an I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic estimate of 50% or greater accompanied by a statistically significant Chi<SUP>2</SUP> statistic as evidence of substantial levels of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).

<P>We understand that there is no closed argument for preference for use of fixed-effect or random-effects models. The random-effects method incorporates an assumption that the different studies are estimating different, yet related, intervention effects. This often seemed to be true to us, and the random-effects model takes into account differences between studies even if there is no statistically significant heterogeneity. However, there is a disadvantage to the random-effects model, in that it puts added weight on to small studies, which often are the most biased ones. Depending on the direction of effect, these studies can either inflate or deflate the effect size. We chose the fixed-effect model for all analyses.</P>

If not, we would not pool the data and we would discuss these issues. We know of no supporting research for this 10% cutoff, but we used prediction intervals as an alternative to this unsatisfactory state.</P>

Only three studies specified inclusion of both male and female participants (<LINK REF="STD-Calver-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Calver 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cocchi-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Cocchi 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Leeuwen-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Van Leeuwen 1977</LINK>).</P>
<P>All trials included people with psychoses. <LINK REF="STD-Resnick-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Resnick 1984</LINK> did not specify beyond stating that participants were admitted involuntarily to the emergency department of a psychiatric unit. <LINK REF="STD-Van-Leeuwen-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Van Leeuwen 1977</LINK> included people with schizophrenia, manic depression or in a 'confusional state'; however, 10 participants had no specific diagnosis. <LINK REF="STD-Cocchi-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Cocchi 1971</LINK> stated that all participants had schizophrenia.</P>
<P>All studies included people with acutely disturbed/aggressive/agitated behaviour secondary to psychotic illnesses such as schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, mixed affective disorders, the manic phase of bipolar disorder or a brief psychotic episode, irrespective of age and sex. For the 2015 update, we widened the criteria to include studies where the <I>majority</I> of people in the study had some form of mental illness that was thought to be fuelling their aggression/agitation. We included these studies even if their data were 'contaminated' by data relating to people who were aggressive for reasons other than mental illness. Therefore, we included <LINK REF="STD-Knott-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Knott 2006</LINK> (60% of participants had mental illness) in the review. However, none of the studies employed diagnostic criteria; it is unknown whether this influenced the validity of findings.</P>
<P>Five out of six trials referred to the current clinical state of participants: agitation or aggression (<LINK REF="STD-Calver-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Calver 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chan-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2013</LINK>); schizophrenic - acutely exacerbated (<LINK REF="STD-Cocchi-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Cocchi 1971</LINK>); marked agitation requiring chemical restraint (<LINK REF="STD-Knott-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Knott 2006</LINK>); unspecified psychosis (<LINK REF="STD-Resnick-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Resnick 1984</LINK>); and a combination of schizophrenia, mania, confusional state and miscellaneous disorders (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Leeuwen-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Van Leeuwen 1977</LINK>).</P>

<P>i. Scale for Quantification of Psychotic Symptom Severity, high = poor) (<LINK REF="REF-Goodrich-1953" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodrich 1953</LINK>)</P>
<P>A research rating scale for use by hospital psychiatrists to express quantitatively the severity of 'incapacitation' due to psychotic symptoms. A rating of from 1.0 to 2.0, extreme behaviour disorganisation requiring vigilance by hospital staff; from 2.0 to 3.0, severity requiring "security ward" care; from 3.0 to 3.7, severity requiring open convalescent ward care; and from 3.8 to 4.0, not requiring hospitalisation, or person ready for discharge.</P>
<P>ii. Glasgow Coma Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Teasdale-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Teasdale 1974</LINK>)</P>
<P>The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is a scoring system used to describe the level of consciousness in a person following a traumatic brain injury. The test is simple, reliable, correlates well with outcome and is an objective way of recording the initial and subsequent level of consciousness in a person after a brain injury. It is used by trained staff at the site of an injury (e.g. at a car crash or sports injury), and in the emergency department and intensive care units. Clinicians use this scale to rate the best eye opening response, the best verbal response and the best motor response aperson makes. Generally, brain injury is classified as 'severe' (GCS 3 to 8, cannot score lower than 3), 'moderate' (GCS 9 to 12) and mild (GCS 13 to 15).</P>
<P>iii. Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Overall-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1962</LINK>)</P>
<P>The BPRS is used to assess the severity of a range of psychiatric symptoms, including psychotic symptoms. The original scale has 16 items, although a revised 18-item scale is commonly used. Each item is defined on a 7-point scale varying from 'not present' to 'extremely severe', scoring from 0 to 6 or 1 to 7. Total scores can range from 0 to 126, with high scores indicating more severe symptoms.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">1 Comparison 1: droperidol versus placebo</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.1 Tranquillisation or asleep: tranquillised/sleep/global state/service use</HEADING>
<P>By 30 minutes, data that we categorise as being of 'high quality' derived from a single trial of over 200 people suggested that droperidol was more acutely tranquillising than placebo (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). This would fit with clinical experience. This finding also fits with the clear demonstration within the same study of reduced risk of needing additional medication (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). For the outcome of being ready for discharge, there was no clear difference between groups (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.9 to 1.48).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.2 Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>The one relevant trial (N = 227) found no evidence that droperidol caused more cardiovascular arrhythmia and respiratory airway obstruction than placebo. Droperidol has become less accessible because it has been reported that people who receive droperidol are at higher risk of QT prolongation (<LINK REF="REF-Wooltorton-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wooltorton 2002</LINK>). We found no evidence for concern in these short trials for people with acute aggressive behaviour.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.3 Missing outcomes</HEADING>
<P>It seems worth noting that the one study we found did not report any key outcomes for mental state and none for costs. The global state reported were very useful and, perhaps, trialists considered them to be adequate for the purposes of this question. However, some type of economic consideration of the outcomes is always important and omission of this from a trial conducted in 2012 to 2013 leaves managers and policy makers less informed than they could have been.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">2 Comparison 2: droperidol versus haloperidol</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.1 Tranquillisation or asleep: tranquillised/sleep/global state/mental state</HEADING>
<P>By 30 minutes, data that we categorised as being of 'high quality' from a single trial of over 200 people suggested that droperidol was more acutely tranquillising than haloperidol (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). This finding also fits with the clear demonstration within the same and one other study of reduced risk of needing additional medication (<LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>). For mental state, there was no evidence of clear difference between the efficacy of droperidol and haloperidol (Scale for Quantification of Psychotic Symptom Severity: MD 0.11, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.29) in terms of a reduced mean score by 13 days (<LINK REF="CMP-002.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.6</LINK>). This is probably no surprise as key effects of importance in this acutely aggressive situation are measured in hours and by nearly two weeks it would seem unlikely that there should be a discernible difference.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.2 Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>The one relevant trial (N = 228) found no evidence that droperidol caused more cardiovascular hypotension and cardiovascular hypotension/desaturation than haloperidol (<LINK REF="CMP-002.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.5</LINK>). There was no suggestion that use of droperidol was unsafe.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.3 Missing outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The one included trial did not report outcomes of service use and costs. Acknowledging their importance, global and mental state were adequately reported. However, economic consideration and service use were omitted from the study which leaves managers and policy makers less informed regarding the cost effectiveness of droperidol over haloperidol.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">3 Comparison 3: droperidol versus midazolam</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3.1 Tranquillisation or asleep: tranquillised/asleep/global state</HEADING>
<P>By 30 minutes, data that we categorised as being of 'high quality' derived from a single trial of more than 200 people suggested that droperidol was less acutely tranquillising than midazolam in the first few minutes (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>). This would fit with what is known about midazolam from other studies. This finding does not fit with the suggestion within the same study of reduced risk of needing additional medication (<LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3.2 Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>The one relevant trial (N = 153) reported no statistically significant differences between droperidol and midazolam - but use of midazolam did result in three people (out of around 70) needing some type of 'airway management' with no such events in the droperidol group. Respiratory depression remains a known concern with midazolam (<LINK REF="REF-TREC-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">TREC 2003</LINK>). It is entirely reversible with the use of flumazenil but even these small trials involving midazolam suggested that use of this effective compound should continue to be in units skilled in recognition of respiratory problems and their management (<LINK REF="CMP-003.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.4</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3.3 Missing outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The one relevant study did not report service use, mental state and economic costs. Omitting mental state from a study leaves the clinicians less informed of the relative efficacy of droperidol compared to midazolam. Likewise, not reporting important outcome of costs leaves managers and policy makers less informed regarding the cost effectiveness of droperidol over haloperidol.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">4 Comparison 4: droperidol versus olanzapine</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">4.1 Tranquillisation or asleep: tranquillised/asleep/global state/service use</HEADING>
<P>By any time point, we found no clear differences between the older drug (droperidol) and olanzapine (<LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>). There also was a suggestion that participants allocated to droperidol needed less additional medication than people given the olanzapine (<LINK REF="CMP-004.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.4</LINK>). This would fit with clinical experience and other studies of a similar nature (<LINK REF="REF-Raveendran-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raveendran 2007</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">4.2 Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>The one relevant trial (N = 221) found no evidence that droperidol caused more cardiovascular arrhythmia and respiratory airway obstruction than olanzapine. The concern regarding droperidol and QT prolongation is not obviously supported by the data we found. We found no evidence for concern in this short trial for people with acute aggressive behaviour.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">4.3 Missing outcomes</HEADING>
<P>We found no economic data. However, droperidol should be cheaper than the olanzapine preparation which may in itself increase the risk of further administration of medications. It would seem that droperidol could be both as or more effective and more cost effective.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1 Completeness</HEADING>
<P>Evidence was certainly relevant, but overall data were too sparse to extensively address the objectives of this review. The search strategy identified six trials involving 733 participants comparing droperidol to placebo, non-standard medication and standard medication. The included studies addressed most of the outcomes being investigated for this review. However, there still were a few outcomes which were not catered for by the trials. These missing outcomes, such as costs, are of prime importance when estimating the <I>cost </I>effectiveness of droperidol when compared with placebo, other 'standard' treatments or 'non-standard' treatments.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2 Applicability</HEADING>
<P>The included trials were set in psychiatric hospitals, emergency departments and psychiatric crisis units. All trials included people with psychoses. <LINK REF="STD-Resnick-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Resnick 1984</LINK> did not specify beyond stating that participants were admitted involuntarily to the emergency department of a psychiatric unit. <LINK REF="STD-Van-Leeuwen-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Van Leeuwen 1977</LINK> included people with schizophrenia, manic depression or in a 'confusional state'; however, 10 participants had no specific diagnosis. <LINK REF="STD-Cocchi-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Cocchi 1971</LINK> stated that all participants had schizophrenia. These inclusion criteria should make any findings applicable to the acute management of disturbed people thought to experience serious mental illnesses. It is noteworthy that along with inclusion of need for repeat injection in the included studies, outcomes such as further aggressive episodes, tranquillisation, sedation and mental state were also included. However, it is desirable to include outcomes such as quality of life, carer satisfaction, economic costs and loss to follow-up.</P>

<P>Overall the quality of the six include trials was moderate to high based on GRADE. One of the fundamental prerequisites of a randomised trial methodology is random sequence allocation which all trials employed. <LINK REF="STD-Calver-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Calver 2015</LINK> used block randomisation. <LINK REF="STD-Van-Leeuwen-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Van Leeuwen 1977</LINK> specified that treatment was "randomly assigned" with participants listed in chronological order and assigned individually numbered vials. Therefore, it is unclear whether the people randomising participants could have ascertained the order of prescribing. <LINK REF="STD-Resnick-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Resnick 1984</LINK> did not specify the explicit means of allocation, although they stated that participants received treatment on a "randomised basis", and that the codes identifying the packages of medication were "kept in the pharmacy until the conclusion of the study". <LINK REF="STD-Cocchi-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Cocchi 1971</LINK> specified only that the study was randomised, with no details regarding the means of allocation. In effort to minimise bias, most of the included trials were double-blind. All studies reported data for all outcomes listed and were therefore rated at low risk of bias with the exception of one study (<LINK REF="STD-Knott-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Knott 2006</LINK>), which we rated as having unclear risk of reporting bias. Therefore, we considered the quality of evidence high.</P>

<P>The search criteria on the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (December 2015) are sufficiently robust to detect relevant studies. However, it is possible that we have failed to identify small studies but we think it unlikely that we would have missed large trials. Studies published in languages other than English, and those with equivocal results, are often difficult to find (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>). Our search was biased by use of English phrases. However, given that the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register covers many languages but is indexed in English we feel that this would not have missed many studies within the register. For example, the search uncovered two studies for which the title was only available in Chinese characters. A Chinese-speaking colleague (Jun Xia) checked these for relevance and neither were relevant to this review.</P>
<P>Furthermore, we were not blinded to the names of the authors, institutions or journal of publication which may have introduced some type of bias in the review process.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">1 For people with psychotic illness</HEADING>
<P>Acute psychotic illness, especially with agitated, aggressive or violent behaviours, may require rapid tranquillisation or sedation. Droperidol, a butyrophenone neuroleptic that is no longer commercially promoted or manufactured, remains a viable option for this purpose based on more evidence from randomised controlled trials in this 2016 update.<BR/>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2 For clinicians</HEADING>
<P>Intramuscular droperidol was once a popular choice for the acute management of very psychotic aggressive and agitated people. The first version of this review thought that evidence relating to use of droperidol was of historical interest only (<LINK REF="REF-Cure-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cure 2004</LINK>). This seems to be untrue. Droperidol is still used. There remains compelling evidence that droperidol has a place in short-term management of psychotic aggressive people. The evidence presented in this review allows conclusions to be drawn about its comparative efficacy to haloperidol, midazolam and olanzapine that concur with the impressions of the effectiveness of these other compounds from other sources. Clinicians could help evaluate these different approaches by supporting clinically relevant randomised controlled trials. We found no evidence of reasons for any more concern over cardiac problems than with other approaches, and less for respiratory difficulties than midazolam.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">3 For managers/policy makers</HEADING>
<P>Currently it seems that people in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Greece, India, Italy, Netherlands, New Zealand, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, and the USA have droperidol as one option for treatment of aggression thought due to psychosis. Much evidence for other compounds or approaches is no stronger than for this old drug.</P>

<P>As with all similar studies, public registration of a study before randomisation commences would ensure that participants could be confident that people would know that the study had at least taken place. Better reporting of data would have allowed us to determine the effects of this compound in emergency situations. Newer trials tended to comply with <A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org/">CONSORT</A> making it much easier to understand the methods of the studies.

<P>We would like to thank Sharon Cure and Simone Carpenter for their contributions to earlier versions of this review. The review authors would like to acknowledge the help of Jo Wood of Janssen-Cilag Pharmaceuticals, England (in 2000), for her help identifying trials relevant to droperidol; Brian Devine and Mike Musker of the Ashworth Hospital, for their initial support; and Nicola Howson and Nancy Owens from the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group (Oxford) for their help and support for the 2004 version of this review. Thanks now to Clive E Adams (CEA) and the editorial team at the Nottingham University Cochrane Schizophrenia Group for their unwavering support in the writing of this review. The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Editorial Base in Nottingham produces and maintains standard text for use in the <LINK TAG="METHODS" TYPE="SECTION">Methods</LINK> sections of their reviews. We have used this text as the basis of what appears here and adapted it as required. Thanks also to Jun Xia who examined the Chinese language titles returned by our search. We would also like to thank Ji Xu and Vivek Agarwal for peer reviewing this version of the review.</P>
<P>We would also like to acknowledge Linda Gowing who submitted a comment just before publication of this update. Her comment was correct, the review was out of date and refers to injectable forms of droperidol being withdrawn by the manufacturer and worldwide stocks of intramuscular droperidol running low - which is no longer true. We have addressed this issue in our current background by updating this statement, indicating the withdrawal of droperidol has not happened.</P>

<P>We added further details in the background information slightly to reflect more recent literature.</P>
<P>We amended some of the outcomes between the protocol and this update to reflect Cochrane Schizophrenia Group presentation and wording of outcomes, the type of outcomes remains the same.We have grouped primary outcomes under three main outcomes: tranquil or asleep by up to 30 minutes, another episode of aggression by 24 hours, and specific and serious adverse effects by 24 hours. The secondary outcomes are under 11 main headings: tranquillisation or asleep, specific behaviours, global state, service outcomes, mental state, adverse effects, leaving the study early, satisfaction with treatment, acceptance of treatment, quality of life and economic outcomes. We felt in retrospect that these outcomes were important given the persistent and all-encompassing nature of schizophrenia. As no relapse data were available, we did not present 'relapse' data in the 'Summary of findings' tables, presenting 'leaving the study early' data instead.</P>
<P>We have also slightly widened our inclusion criteria by including studies where the <I>majority</I> of people in the study had some form of mental illness that was thought to be fuelling their aggression/agitation - even if their data were 'contaminated' by data relating to people who were aggressive for reasons thought to not be because of mental illness.</P>

<P>We (MM and AL) searched The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's register. Working independently we examined the papers identified from the search strategy. We discarded obviously irrelevant publications and retained only those in which some form of early intervention had been compared against a control treatment, and obtained copies of papers relating to relevant trials. Once we had obtained these papers, we decided whether the trials were eligible. We resolved any disagreements by discussion. For the 2006 update we (MM and JR) independently inspected citations. Where disagreement occurred, we sought to resolve this by discussion, or where doubt remained, we acquired the full article for further inspection. Once we had obtained the full articles, we independently decided whether they met the review criteria. We resolved any disagreements that occurred by discussion, and when this was not possible we added trials to the list of those awaiting assessment until we acquired further information. For the 2009 update we (MM and JR) inspected all study citations identified by the searches, and obtained full reports of the studies of agreed relevance.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction and management</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Extraction</HEADING>
<P>We (MM, AL) independently extracted and entered trial data into Review Manager (RevMan) twice, cross-checking for consistency (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=23422024428026501918110311114914&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-RevMan-2008">RevMan 2008</A>). An initial analysis included all trials meeting inclusion criteria, whilst a second sensitivity analysis excluded all but the highest quality trials (Category A and B). For the 2006 and 2010 update, we (MM and JR) independently extracted and entered data into RevMan, cross-checking again for consistency. Where disputes arose, we attempted to resolve these by discussion. When this was not possible and further information was needed to resolve the dilemma, we did not enter the data, and added this outcome of the trial to the list of those awaiting assessment.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.1 Forms</HEADING>
<P>We extracted the data onto standard, simple forms.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.2 Direction of graphs</HEADING>
<P>Where possible, we entered data into RevMan in such a way that the area to the left of the 'line of no effect' indicates a 'favourable' outcome for early intervention. Where this was not possible, (for example, scales that calculate higher scores=improvement) we inserted a minus sign into the data tables to reverse the graphical display in RevMan analyses so that the direction of effect was clear.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.3 Scale-derived data</HEADING>
<P>Unpublished scales are known to be subject to bias in trials of treatments for schizophrenia (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=23422024428026501918110311114914&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Marshall-2000">Marshall 2000</A>). Therefore we only included continuous data from rating scales were if the measuring instrument had been described in a peer-reviewed journal.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.4 Skewed data</HEADING>
<P>Continuous data on outcomes in trials relevant to mental health issues are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data we applied the following standards to continuous final value endpoint data before inclusion: (a) standard deviations and means were reported in the paper or were obtainable from the authors; (b) when a scale started from zero, the standard deviation, when multiplied by two, should be less than the mean (otherwise the mean is unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution - <A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=23422024428026501918110311114914&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Altman-1996">Altman 1996</A>); in cases with data that are greater than the mean we entered them into the 'Other data' table as skewed data. Where the skewed data are derived from a trial with &#8807; 200 participants, the skewed data pose less of a problem when looking at means if the sample size is large and were entered into syntheses.</P>
<P>If a scale starts from a positive value (such as PANSS, which can have values from 30 to 210) the calculation described above in (b) should be modified to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skewness is present if 2SD&gt;(S-Smin), where S is the mean score and Smin is the minimum score. We reported non-normally distributed data (skewed) in the 'other data types' tables.</P>
<P>For change data (mean change from baseline on a rating scale) it is impossible to tell whether data are non-normally distributed (skewed) or not, unless individual patient data are available. After consulting the ALLSTAT electronic statistics mailing list, we entered change data in RevMan analyses and reported the finding in the text to summarise available information. In doing this, we assumed either that data were not skewed or that the analysis could cope with the unknown degree of skew.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.5 Final endpoint value versus change data</HEADING>
<P>Where both final endpoint data and change data were available for the same outcome category, only final endpoint data were presented. We acknowledge that by doing this much of the published change data may be excluded, but argue that endpoint data is more clinically relevant and that if change data were to be presented along with endpoint data, it would be given undeserved equal prominence. Where studies reported only change data we contacted authors for endpoint figures.<BR/>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.6 Common measure</HEADING>
<P>To facilitate comparison between trials, we converted variables (such as days in hospital) that could be reported in different metrics (mean days per year, per week or per month) to a common metric (for example, mean days per month).<BR/>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.7 Conversion of continuous to binary</HEADING>
<P>Where possible, efforts were made to convert outcome measures to dichotomous data. This could be done by identifying cut-off points on rating scales and dividing participants accordingly into 'clinically improved' or 'not clinically improved'. It was generally assumed that if there had been a 50% reduction in a scale-derived score such as the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS, <A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=23422024428026501918110311114914&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Overall-1962">Overall 1962</A>) or the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS, <A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=23422024428026501918110311114914&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Kay-1986">Kay 1986</A>), this could be considered as a clinically significant response (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=23422024428026501918110311114914&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Leucht-2005a">Leucht 2005a</A>; <A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=23422024428026501918110311114914&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Leucht-2005b">Leucht 2005b</A>).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</HEADING>
<P>Again working independently, we assessed risk of bias using the tool described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=23422024428026501918110311114914&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Higgins-2008">Higgins 2008</A>). This tool encourages consideration of how the sequence was generated, how allocation was concealed, the integrity of blinding at outcome, the completeness of outcome data, selective reporting and other biases. We would not have included studies where sequence generation was at high risk of bias or where allocation was clearly not concealed.</P>
<P>The categories are defined below.</P>
<P>- YES - low risk of bias<BR/>- NO - high risk of bias<BR/>- UNCLEAR - uncertain risk of bias</P>
<P>If disputes arose as to which category we should allocate a trial, again, we achieved resolution by discussion, after working with a third reviewer.</P>
<P>Earlier versions of this review used a different, less well-developed, means of categorising risk of bias (see <A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=23422024428026501918110311114914&amp;format=REVMAN#APP-02">Appendix 2</A>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Measures of treatment effect</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Binary data</HEADING>
<P>For binary outcomes we calculated an estimate of the risk ratio (RR) and its 95% (fixed-effect) confidence intervals (CI). RR is more intuitive (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=23422024428026501918110311114914&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Boissel-1999">Boissel 1999</A>) than odds ratios and odds ratios tend to be interpreted as RR by clinicians (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=23422024428026501918110311114914&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Deeks-2000">Deeks 2000</A>). This misinterpretation then leads to an overestimate of the impression of the effect. When the overall results were significant we calculated the number needed to treat/harm (NNT/NNH) using <A HREF="http://www.nntonline.net/">Visual Rx</A>.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Continuous data</HEADING>
<P>For continuous outcomes we estimated mean difference (MD) between groups. We preferred not to calculate effect size measures (standardised mean difference SMD). However, had scales of very considerable similarity been used, we would have presumed there was a small difference in measurement, and we would have calculated effect size and transformed the effect back to the units of one or more of the specific instruments.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Unit of analysis issues</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Cluster trials</HEADING>
<P>Studies increasingly employ cluster randomisation (such as randomisation by clinician or practice), but analysis and pooling of clustered data pose problems. Firstly, authors often fail to account for intra-class correlation in clustered studies, leading to a unit-of-analysis error (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=23422024428026501918110311114914&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Divine-1992">Divine 1992</A>) whereby P values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This causes Type I errors (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=23422024428026501918110311114914&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Bland-1997">Bland 1997</A>; <A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=23422024428026501918110311114914&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Gulliford-1999">Gulliford 1999</A>).</P>
<P>Where clustering had not been accounted for in primary studies, we presented the data in a table, with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review we will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intra-class correlation co-efficients (ICCs) of their clustered data and to adjust for this using accepted methods (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=23422024428026501918110311114914&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Gulliford-1999">Gulliford 1999</A>). Where clustering has been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we will also present these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjusted for the clustering effect.</P>
<P>We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a design effect. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (M) and the ICC (Design effect=1+ (M -1)*ICC) (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=23422024428026501918110311114914&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Donner-2002">Donner 2002</A>). If the ICC is not reported we assumed it to be 0.1 (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=23422024428026501918110311114914&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Ukoumunne-1999">Ukoumunne 1999</A>). If cluster studies had been appropriately analysed taking into account ICCs and relevant data documented in the report, we synthesised these¬with other studies using the generic inverse variance technique.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Cross-over design</HEADING>
<P>A major concern of cross-over trials is the carry-over effect. It occurs if an effect (for example, pharmacological, physiological or psychological) of the treatment in the first phase is carried over to the second phase. As a consequence, on entry to the second phase the participants can differ systematically from their initial state, despite a wash-out phase. For the same reason cross-over trials are not appropriate if the condition of interest is unstable (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=23422024428026501918110311114914&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Elbourne-2002">Elbourne 2002</A>).

<P>At some degree of loss to follow-up data must lose credibility (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=23422024428026501918110311114914&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Xia-2007">Xia 2007</A>).

<P>We excluded data from studies where more than 50% of participants in any group were lost to follow-up (this did not include the outcome of 'leaving the study early'). In studies with less than 50% dropout rate, people leaving early were considered to have had the negative outcome, For example, those lost to follow-up for the outcome of relapse were treated in the analysis as having relapsed.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">2.2.2 Standard deviations</HEADING>
<P>We first tried to obtain the missing values from the authors. If not available, where there were missing measures of variance for continuous data but an exact standard error and confidence interval were available for group means, and either P value or T value were available for differences in mean, we noted these, and in future versions will calculate them according to the rules described in the <I>Handbook</I> (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=23422024428026501918110311114914&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Higgins-2008">Higgins 2008</A>): When only the standard error (SE) is reported, standard deviations (SDs) can be calculated by the formula SD=SE * square root (n). Chapters 7.7.3 and 16.1.3 of the <I>Handbook</I> (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=23422024428026501918110311114914&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Higgins-2008">Higgins 2008</A>) present detailed formula for estimating SDs from P values, T or F values, confidence intervals, ranges or other statistics. If these formula do not apply, we, in the future will calculate SDs according to a validated imputation method which is based on the SDs of the other included studies (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=23422024428026501918110311114914&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Furukawa-2006">Furukawa 2006</A>). Some of these imputation strategies can introduce error. The alternative would be to exclude a given study&#8217;s outcome and thus to lose information. We will examine the validity of the imputations in a sensitivity analysis excluding imputed values.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">2.2.3 Last observation carried forward</HEADING>
<P>We anticipated that in some studies the method of last observation carried forward (LOCF) would be employed within the study report. As with all methods of imputation to deal with missing data, LOCF introduces uncertainty about the reliability of the results. Therefore, where LOCF data have been used in the trial, if less than 50% of the data had been assumed, we reproduced these data and indicated that they are the product of LOCF assumptions.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">3.2 Employing the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic</HEADING>
<P>We investigated heterogeneity between studies by considering the I<SUP>2 </SUP>method alongside the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> P value. The I<SUP>2 </SUP>provides an estimate of the percentage of inconsistency thought to be due to chance (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=23422024428026501918110311114914&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Higgins-2003">Higgins 2003</A>). The importance of the observed value of I<SUP>2 </SUP>depends on i. magnitude and direction of effects and ii. strength of evidence for heterogeneity (e.g. P value from Chi<SUP>2</SUP>¬test, or a confidence interval for I<SUP>2</SUP>). We interpreted I<SUP>2 </SUP>estimate greater than or equal to 50% accompanied by a statistically significant Chi<SUP>2</SUP> statistic as evidence of substantial levels of heterogeneity (Section 9.5.2 - <A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=23422024428026501918110311114914&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Higgins-2008">Higgins 2008</A>). When substantial levels of heterogeneity were found in the primary outcome, we explored reasons for heterogeneity (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=23422024428026501918110311114914&amp;format=REVMAN#SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS">Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</A>).</P>

We are aware that funnel plots may be useful in investigating reporting biases but are of limited power to detect small-study effects (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=23422024428026501918110311114914&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Egger-1997">Egger 1997</A>). We did not use funnel plots for outcomes where there were 10 or fewer studies, or where all studies were of similar sizes. In other cases, where funnel plots were possible, we sought statistical advice in their interpretation.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data synthesis</HEADING>
<P>Where possible we employed a fixed-effect model for analyses. We understand that there is no closed argument for preference for use of fixed-effect or random-effects models. The random-effects method incorporates an assumption that the different studies are estimating different, yet related, intervention effects. This does seem true to us; however, random-effects does put added weight onto the smaller of the studies - those trials that are most vulnerable to bias. For this reason we favour using the fixed-effect model.</P>

<P>1. Comparison 1. droperidol versus placebo</P>
<P>The search identified only one small (N = 41) randomised trial comparing droperidol (10 mg IV) with placebo (IV) <LINK REF="STD-Van-Leeuwen-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Van Leeuwen 1977</LINK>a.</P>
<P>1.1 Global impression: needing additional injections within the first 90 minutes.<BR/>Those allocated to droperidol were significantly less likely to need additional haloperidol injections within the first few minutes (N = 41, RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.2 to 0.7, NNTB 2, 95% CI 1 to 10) than those given an injection of placebo. By 90 minutes, this difference was still evident but not statistically significant (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.2 to 1.2).</P>
<P>1.2 Adverse effects<BR/>The <LINK REF="STD-Van-Leeuwen-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Van Leeuwen 1977</LINK>a trial reported that no adverse effects were apparent for the 41 people randomised to droperidol or placebo. However, this observation referred only to the first three minutes after the initial injection had been given. After three minutes haloperidol was administered to 25/41 trial participants and some adverse effects may have been caused by that drug. However, any that occurred after the first three minutes were not reported.</P>
<P>2. Comparison 2. droperidol versus haloperidol</P>
<P>The search identified only two small trials. <LINK REF="STD-Resnick-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Resnick 1984</LINK> (N = 27) was clearly relevant to the acute management of disturbed people. In this study, participants were randomised to 5 mg of IM droperidol or 5 mg of IM haloperidol. <LINK REF="STD-Cocchi-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Cocchi 1971</LINK>, however, was also identified by the search and is less clearly relevant. Although this study does deal with acutely disturbed or relapsing people, it allocated them to oral droperidol or haloperidol, suggesting that these trial participants were not as disturbed as in the other studies. Outcomes were also measured after 30 days rather than after a few hours, which makes this trial less relevant to the emergency situation investigated by this review.</P>
<P>2.1 Global impression: needing additional injections within the first 90 minutes<BR/>Those allocated to droperidol were less likely to need additional injections by 30 minutes than those given haloperidol, but this result did not quite reach conventional levels of statistical significance (N = 27, 1 RCT, RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.2 to 1.0). <LINK REF="STD-Resnick-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Resnick 1984</LINK> reported the need for additional repeat injections up to 90 minutes. Not one of those allocated to droperidol required repeat injections, but three in the haloperidol group were given another injection at 60 minutes (N = 27, RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.6), and one unfortunate person had to be medicated yet again at 90 minutes (N = 27, 1 RCT, RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.02 to 10.6).</P>
<P>2.2 Global impression: no clear improvement by 30 days<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Cocchi-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Cocchi 1971</LINK> reported that oral droperidol was no more likely to afford improvement in acutely ill people than oral haloperidol at 30 days (N = 40, RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.3 to 1.5).</P>
<P>2.3 Mental state: mean score on the Rating Scale for Quantification of Psychotic Symptoms<BR/>The study on less acutely disturbed people in the non-emergency situation found no difference between oral droperidol and oral haloperidol on ratings of this scale (N = 40, mean difference 0.11, 95% CI -0.1 to 0.3) (<LINK REF="STD-Cocchi-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Cocchi 1971</LINK>).</P>
<P>2.4 Adverse effects: mild dystonia<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Resnick-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Resnick 1984</LINK> reported that one person experienced a mild dystonic reaction when given haloperidol IM (N = 27, RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.02 to 10.6).</P>

<P>1. Droperidol discontinued<BR/>Janssen-Cilag Limited produced droperidol (www. janssen-cilag.co.uk) until March 2001, when production of all formulations of its branded form (Droleptan) were discontinued. The Medicines Control Agency in the UK (www.mca.gov.uk/) had raised concerns about the potential effects of long-term droperidol on the electrical conduction of the heart (cardiac Q-T interval prolongation) and requested a risk-benefit assessment. The company concluded that the oral formulations should be discontinued to prevent use. The authors have asked Janssen-Cilag UK whether or not the injectable form for rapid tranquillisation was withdrawn because of concerns about safety. The company have informed us that the injectable form of droperidol also carries significant risks (<LINK REF="REF-Lawrence-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawrence 1997</LINK>) and has been associated with prolonged Q-T intervals (<LINK REF="REF-Guy-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guy 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lischke-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lischke 1994</LINK>) as well as the rare, but potentially fatal, cardiac arrhythmia, 'Torsade de pointes' (<LINK REF="REF-Guy-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guy 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Michalets-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michalets 1998</LINK>). Although the benefits of its continued use in the acute situation may have outweighed these risks, careful monitoring - including ECGs and electrolyte assays - would have been necessary. This would have compromised the cost effective production of injectable droperidol, and so it was discontinued along with the oral preparations.</P>
<P>2. Small number of studies<BR/>Acute psychosis is difficult to study and co-operation from the study population is rare. This may be one of the reasons for the scarcity of controlled clinical trials using droperidol solely for this indication. Droperidol appears to have been widely used in emergency room situations for people who are agitated or acutely disturbed but who have not, at point of medication, been diagnosed (<LINK REF="REF-Binder-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Binder 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pilowsky-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pilowsky 1992</LINK>). Several papers identified by our searches concerned the use of droperidol for people who were later diagnosed as having either trauma, an underlying organic condition, or who were intoxicated. As these diagnoses fell outside our remit for types of participants, the trials were excluded from this review. Nevertheless, acute disturbance due to suspected mental illness is so common (<LINK REF="REF-Huf-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huf 2002</LINK>), and management of such situations so important, that there is little excuse not to have good evidence for the use of droperidol. However, a total of only 69 people seem to have been randomised into trials of droperidol versus placebo or haloperidol that are relevant to the emergency control of disturbance thought to be due to mental illnesses.</P>
<P>3. Quality<BR/>No trial reported adequate methods of random sequence generation, and only <LINK REF="STD-Van-Leeuwen-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Van Leeuwen 1977</LINK>a included any description of the method of randomisation. No trial included in this review would have rated highly with respect to the CONSORT statement (<LINK REF="REF-Begg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begg 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>) and the inclusion of bias is likely.</P>
<P>4. Publication bias<BR/>With such small studies publication bias is also likely, and for both truly relevant trials (<LINK REF="STD-Resnick-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Resnick 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Leeuwen-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Van Leeuwen 1977</LINK>) droperidol was the experimental intervention, so any publication bias would favour droperidol.</P>
<P>5. Applicability of findings<BR/>The included trials were set in a psychiatric hospital, an emergency department, and a psychiatric crisis unit. The truly relevant studies (<LINK REF="STD-Resnick-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Resnick 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Leeuwen-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Van Leeuwen 1977</LINK>) reported outcomes for the very short term, i. e. those of value in the crisis situation. <LINK REF="STD-Van-Leeuwen-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Van Leeuwen 1977</LINK>a included people with schizophrenia, manic-depression and confusional states, with seven of the 41 participants having no diagnosis recorded. <LINK REF="STD-Resnick-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Resnick 1984</LINK> included participants who were involuntarily hospitalised and had 'underlying psychoses'. This trial specifically excluded patients who were intoxicated (the only trial to specifically mention exclusion criteria). These inclusion criteria should make any findings applicable to the acute management of disturbed people thought to suffer from serious mental illnesses. However, although need for repeat injection is of importance, it would also have been desirable to have had outcomes such as further aggressive episodes, tranquillisation, sedation and carer satisfaction.</P>
<P>5. Comparison 1. droperidol versus placebo</P>
<P>The small amount of data available (N = 41) suggests that droperidol is superior to placebo three minutes after injection (fewer repeat injections needed). However, the design of this study precluded good information about adverse effects, and, while such limited data could generate hypotheses, it does not provide conclusive evidence.</P>
<P>6. Comparison 2. droperidol versus haloperidol</P>
<P>Although the search identified two trials, only <LINK REF="STD-Resnick-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Resnick 1984</LINK> (N = 27) was clearly relevant to the acute management of disturbed people. <LINK REF="STD-Cocchi-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Cocchi 1971</LINK> did not assess the immediate effects of droperidol given as emergency medication, but compared it to haloperidol in a study of 30 days' duration. Droperidol was not statistically different to haloperidol for the proportion of participants needing additional injections at 30 minutes, but this difference would be clinically relevant if sustained in larger studies (~40% droperidol versus ~60% haloperidol). Haloperidol did cause a mild dystonic reaction in one person. The results of <LINK REF="STD-Resnick-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Resnick 1984</LINK> indicate that droperidol is a valuable drug in the acute situation, but, were it still being used, all findings would need to be replicated.</P>
<P>7. Heterogeneity</P>
<P>This review is a re-presentation of the findings of trials rather than a meta-analysis in which heterogeneity could operate.</P>
<P>8. Sensitivity analysis</P>
<P>It had been hoped to conduct sensitivity analyses comparing results when trials with high attrition with those with only competer data. All three trials reported on loss to follow up and this was not undertaken.</P>
