<P>In most countries, a blood sample from newborn babies is needed for screening tests. A heel lance is the standard way of taking blood, but it is a painful procedure with no optimal method of pain relief known. This review of trials found evidence that venepuncture, when done by a trained practitioner, caused less pain than heel lance. The use of a sweet tasting solution given to the baby prior to the event reduced pain further. The evidence included outcome measures using pain scales, how long the baby cried and how the mother rated their baby's pain.</P>

<P>Outcomes included pain response to venepuncture versus heel lance with or without the use of a sweet tasting solution using validated pain measures, the need of repeat sampling and cry characteristics. Analyses included typical relative risk (RR), risk difference (RD), number needed to treat (NNT), weighted mean difference (WMD) and standardized mean difference (SMD) with their 95% confidence intervals (CI). Between study heterogeneity was reported including the I squared (I<SUP>2</SUP>) test.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-08-30 11:51:16 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Six studies (n = 478) of variable quality were included. A composite outcome of Infant Pain Scale (NIPS), Neonatal Facial Action Coding System (NFCS) and/or Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) score was reported in 288 infants, who did not receive a sweet tasting solution. Meta-analysis showed a significant reduction in the venepuncture versus the heel lance group (SMD -0.76, 95% CI -1.00 to -0.52; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%). When a sweet tasting solution was provided the SMD remained significant favouring the venepuncture group (SMD - 0.38, 95% CI -0.69 to -0.07). The typical RD for requiring more than one skin puncture for venepuncture versus heel lance (reported in 4 studies; n = 254) was -0.34 (95% CI -0.43 to -0.25; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 97%). The NNT to avoid one repeat skin puncture was 3 (95% CI 2 to 4). Cry characteristics favoured the venepuncture group but the differences were reduced by the provision of sweet tasting solutions prior to either procedure.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-07-07 14:59:21 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Every year millions of neonates require diagnostic blood sampling. Neonates undergoing these procedures cry (<LINK REF="REF-Owens-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Owens 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brown--1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1987</LINK>) and exhibit facial expression and body movements (<LINK REF="REF-Izard-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Izard 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grunau-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grunau 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnston-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnston 1986</LINK>) that are indicative of pain. Until recently, it was believed that infants and young children could not appreciate pain due to the immaturity of the central nervous system. However, it is now well established that the anatomical, physiological and neurochemical structures which convey pain are well developed in neonates (<LINK REF="REF-Fitzgerald-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fitzgerald 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-CPS-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">CPS 2000</LINK>). Recent research suggests that babies' early pain experience may alter their pain response in later infancy (<LINK REF="REF-Taddio-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taddio 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taddio-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taddio 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Heel lance (HL) has been the conventional method of blood sampling in neonates for screening tests (phenylketonuria and hypothyroidism) or measurements of serum bilirubin or glucose. Sick neonates (preterm and term infants) admitted to neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) undergo this procedure repeatedly as part of routine care. <LINK REF="REF-Barker-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barker 1995</LINK> reviewed the nature and frequency of invasive procedures in a NICU and showed that HL was the most common procedure being performed in a NICU. Apart from discomfort to the infant associated with HL, there are concerns regarding the possibility of puncturing the calcaneus and causing osteochondritis, ecchymosis or haemolyzed samples and the possibility of accidental injuries to personnel (<LINK REF="REF-Moxley-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moxley 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Meehan-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meehan 1998</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-06-24 12:36:54 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Various pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions have been investigated for management of pain associated with HL. Automated piercing devices (<LINK REF="REF-Harpin-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harpin 1983</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Paes-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paes 1993</LINK>), behavioural interventions such as pacifiers (<LINK REF="REF-Field-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Field 1984</LINK>) and rocking (<LINK REF="REF-Campos-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campos 1994</LINK>), sucrose (<LINK REF="REF-Stevens-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevens 2010</LINK>), glucose (<LINK REF="REF-Skogdal-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skogdal 1997</LINK>), non-sucrose sweet tasting solution (<LINK REF="REF-Ramenghi-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramenghi 1996</LINK>), anaesthetic cream such as lignocaine (<LINK REF="REF-Rushforth-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rushforth 1995</LINK>) and EMLA (<LINK REF="REF-Larsson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Larsson 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-McIntosh-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">McIntosh 1994</LINK>), and paracetamol (<LINK REF="REF-Shah-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 1998</LINK>) have been studied. The use of a mechanical lancet (Autolet) caused less physiological instability than manual HL (<LINK REF="REF-Harpin-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harpin 1983</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Paes-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paes 1993</LINK>). The total volume of blood collected with automated device was significantly larger than with lancet device. The time required for blood sampling was significantly reduced and there was reduced haemolysis in the automated device group. Comforting measures were associated with less crying (<LINK REF="REF-Field-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Field 1984</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Campos-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campos 1994</LINK>) and use of sucrose (2 ml of 12% solution) two minutes prior to the procedure reduced composite pain measures (<LINK REF="REF-Stevens-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevens 2010</LINK>). Anaesthetic cream (<LINK REF="REF-Rushforth-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rushforth 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Larsson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Larsson 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-McIntosh-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">McIntosh 1994</LINK>) and paracetamol (<LINK REF="REF-Shah-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 1998</LINK>) have been ineffective in decreasing pain scores with HL. Topical amethocaine gel does not have a clinically important effect on pain from HL blood sampling (<LINK REF="REF-Jain-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jain 2001</LINK>). Despite various studies to date, there are no effective and practical methods to alleviate pain from HL (<LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 2000</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-06-24 12:30:21 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Venepuncture (VP) is a common procedure performed in older infants and children (<LINK REF="REF-McKay-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKay 1966</LINK>). The advantages of VP include a reduced risk of a haemolyzed or clotted sample, increased sample volume and possibly less pain (<LINK REF="REF-McKay-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKay 1966</LINK>). The disadvantage of VP is the need for a skilled phlebotomist to perform the procedure (the phlebotomist will have to spend time training and the amount of time required depends on the skill of the individual). In contrast, the benefit of HL is the perceived ease to perform the task even by paramedical personnel.</P>

<P>For the update in 2011, the following issues were evaluated and entered into the Risk of Bias table:</P>
<P>
<B>Selection bias (random sequence generation and allocation concealment):</B> For each included study, we categorized the risk of selection bias as:</P>
<P>- Random sequence generation:</P>
<P>Low risk - adequate (any truly random process e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</P>
<P>High risk - inadequate (any non random process e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);</P>
<P>Unclear risk - no or unclear information provided.</P>
<P>- Allocation concealment: For each included study, we categorized the risk of bias regarding allocation concealment as:</P>
<P>Low risk - adequate (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes);</P>
<P>High risk - inadequate (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);</P>
<P>Unclear risk - no or unclear information provided.</P>
<P>
<B>Performance bias:</B> For each included study, we categorized the methods used to blind study personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. As our study population consisted of neonates they would all be blinded to the study intervention:</P>
<P>Low risk - adequate for personnel (a placebo that could not be distinguished from the active drug was used in the control group);</P>
<P>High risk - inadequate personnel aware of group assignment;</P>
<P>Unclear risk - no or unclear information provided.</P>
<P>
<B>Detection bias:</B> For each included study, we categorized the methods used to blind outcome assessors from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. (As our study population consisted of neonates they would all be blinded to the study intervention). Blinding was assessed separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes. We categorized the methods used with regards to detection bias as:</P>
<P>Low risk - adequate follow-up was performed with assessors blinded to group assignment;</P>
<P>High risk - inadequate assessors at follow-up were aware of group assignment;</P>
<P>Unclear risk - no or unclear information provided.</P>
<P>
<B>Attrition bias:</B> For each included study and for each outcome, we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We noted whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported or supplied by the trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses. We categorized the methods with respect to the risk attrition bias as:</P>
<P>Low risk - adequate (&lt; 10% missing data);</P>
<P>High risk - inadequate (&gt; 10% missing data);</P>
<P>Unclear risk - no or unclear information provided.</P>
<P>
<B>Reporting bias:</B> For each included study, we described how we investigated the risk of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We assessed the methods as:</P>
<P>Low risk - adequate (where it is clear that all of the study's pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</P>
<P>High risk - inadequate (where not all the study's pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</P>
<P>Unclear risk - no or unclear information provided (the study protocol was not available).</P>
<P>
<B>Other bias: </B>For each included study, we described any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias (for example, whether there was a potential source of bias related to the specific study design or whether the trial was stopped early due to some data-dependent process). We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as:</P>
<P>Low risk - no concerns of other bias raised;</P>
<P>High risk - concerns raised about multiple looks at the data with the results made known to the investigators, difference in number of patients enrolled in abstract and final publications of the paper;</P>
<P>Unclear - concerns raised about potential sources of bias that could not be verified by contacting the authors.</P>
<P>If needed, we planned to explore the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses.</P>

<P>For each trial, information was sought from the published report regarding method of randomisation, blinding, and reporting of all outcomes for all infants enrolled in the trial. As noted in the Risk of Bias tables the quality varied with many studies not providing enough information to judge the level of bias and for some item there was clearly a high risk of bias. Unpublished data were included from the studies by Shah (<LINK REF="STD-Shah-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Shah 1997</LINK>), Eriksson (<LINK REF="STD-Eriksson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Eriksson 1999</LINK>), Kvist (<LINK REF="STD-Kvist-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kvist 2002</LINK>) and by Saththasivam (<LINK REF="STD-Saththasivam-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Saththasivam 2009</LINK>). Unpublished data on the six patients that were excluded (because more than two skin punctures were required) from the analyses by Kvist et al (<LINK REF="STD-Kvist-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kvist 2002</LINK>) could not be obtained. Data regarding infants enrolled in the VP and HL groups with or without the administration of glucose were available from Eriksson (<LINK REF="STD-Eriksson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Eriksson 1999</LINK>). From the study by Saththasiwam (<LINK REF="STD-Saththasivam-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Saththasivam 2009</LINK>) the authors provided us with data analysed as means and standard deviations as the published study reported the outcomes as medians and ranges.</P>
<P>One additional trial was identified for this review (<LINK REF="STD-Saththasivam-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Saththasivam 2009</LINK>). With the addition of this study, six trials enrolling 523 neonates were included. These studies were performed in four countries [UK, Japan, Sweden (n = 3) and Malaysia]. Of the 523 neonates enrolled, information on 478 neonates relevant to this systematic review were included.</P>
<P>All studies except the one by <LINK REF="STD-Larsson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Larsson 1998</LINK> strictly fulfilled our inclusion criteria of PMA <U>&gt;</U> 37 weeks. In the <LINK REF="STD-Larsson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Larsson 1998</LINK> study, the PMAs ranged from 36 weeks to 43 weeks; the median PMA was 40 weeks. The decision was made to include this study in the review as most infants were term. Two studies compared the effects of sweet tasting solution (<LINK REF="STD-Eriksson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Eriksson 1999</LINK>; and <LINK REF="STD-Ogawa-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ogawa 2005</LINK>) on VP and HL in sub-samples of the study populations. <LINK REF="STD-Saththasivam-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Saththasivam 2009</LINK> gave all infants sucrose prior to HL or VP. We included the results for these three studies that used a sweet tasting solution prior to the intervention in separate analyses.</P>
<P>Pain assessments were made in these trials using various validated tools. <LINK REF="STD-Shah-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Shah 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kvist-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kvist 2002</LINK> used the NIPS. The NIPS includes five behavioral groupings (facial expression, crying, movement of arms and legs, and state of arousal) and one physiological indicator (breathing pattern) along with the descriptors for the scores within each grouping (<LINK REF="REF-Lawrence-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawrence 1993</LINK>). The total score ranges from 0 (relaxed and calm) to seven (crying dissatisfied infant). The scale has been tested for validity and reliability in preterm and term infants subjected to capillary, venous or arterial punctures (<LINK REF="REF-Lawrence-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawrence 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Larsson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Larsson 1998</LINK> used the Neonatal Facial Coding System (NFCS) (<LINK REF="REF-Grunau-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grunau 1987</LINK>). The presence or absence of six facial actions [brow bulge, eyes squeezed shut, deepening of the naso-labial furrow, open lips, a taut cupped tongue, and stretching of the mouth (vertically and horizontally)] were recorded and presented as percent positive scores with a total range of 0 to 600%. The scale has been validated (<LINK REF="REF-Craig-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Craig 1994</LINK>). The results of the NFCS scores for the study by <LINK REF="STD-Larsson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Larsson 1998</LINK> are not included in the meta-analysis of pain response as they were presented as median scores in a table and the centiles in graphic form. <LINK REF="STD-Ogawa-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ogawa 2005</LINK> used the NFCS to assess pain. These authors assessed the 10 facial actions (brow bulge, eye squeeze, nasolabial furrow, open lips, lip purse, vertical and horizontal mouth stretch, taut tongue, tongue protrusion and chin quiver). The data from Ogawa et al (<LINK REF="STD-Ogawa-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ogawa 2005</LINK>) could not be incorporated in the meta-analysis as results of the NFCS score were reported as median and interquartile ranges. The data from the study by <LINK REF="STD-Saththasivam-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Saththasivam 2009</LINK> used NFCS score and we obtained data converting medians and range to means and standard deviations.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Eriksson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Eriksson 1999</LINK> used the PIPP score to assess pain. The PIPP score assigns points for changes in three facial expressions (brow bulge, eye squeeze and naso-labial fold), heart rate, oxygen saturation, PMA and behavioral state with a higher score indicating more pain. A score of 0 to 6 points indicates minimal or no pain, while a score of 12 or more indicates moderate to severe pain.</P>
<P>The blood sampling techniques (VP or HL) were performed by one investigator in the trials of <LINK REF="STD-Shah-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Shah 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Larsson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Larsson 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Eriksson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Eriksson 1999</LINK>. For the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Kvist-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kvist 2002</LINK> two investigators performed the procedure while for the trial of <LINK REF="STD-Ogawa-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ogawa 2005</LINK> seven experienced nurses were trained to perform VP or HL. In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Saththasivam-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Saththasivam 2009</LINK> HL was performed by a single experienced staff nurse while VP was performed by two senior paediatric registrars.</P>
<P>Unpublished data on the six patients that were excluded (because more than two skin punctures were required) in the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Kvist-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kvist 2002</LINK> could not be obtained. The analyses presented from this trial do not represent an "intention to treat analysis". The results were presented as median test and odds ratios with 95% CIs. The authors provided us with unpublished data for means and standard deviations for NIPS scores for the small calibre VP needle group and the HL group.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-08-07 16:57:27 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this update of the review we included one additional study (<LINK REF="STD-Saththasivam-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Saththasivam 2009</LINK>) and subgroups from two previously included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ogawa-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ogawa 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eriksson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Eriksson 1999</LINK>) that used a sweet solution prior to the skin puncture. The results of the study by Saththasivam and co-workers (<LINK REF="STD-Saththasivam-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Saththasivam 2009</LINK>) differed with the results of previous studies. The only significant results reported in that study was an increase in the total duration of the procedure (sampling time) for the VP group. There were serious concerns about bias for that study (<LINK REF="STD-Saththasivam-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Saththasivam 2009</LINK>). However, the review of all studies indicates that VP is preferable to HL to obtain a blood sample from term neonates. The combined meta-analyses of studies that used NIPS, NFCS or PIPP scores showed a significant reduction in the SMD in favour of VP versus HL (SMD-0.76, 95% CI -1.00 to -0.52). The increase in power by combining three different validated pain scores confirms that VP is less painful than HL. When sweet tasting solutions were given prior to skin puncture the SMD was significantly reduced (SMD -0.38, 95% CI -0.69, 0.07) in favour of VP but the effect size was smaller, indicating that sweet tasting solutions do reduce the pain for both VP and HL. This supports the findings of the Cochrane review of sucrose to reduce pain in neonates (<LINK REF="REF-Stevens-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevens 2010</LINK>). Cry characteristics such as duration of first cry, total duration of cry, number of neonates who cried during the procedure, duration of cry in the first three minutes after skin puncture and sampling time were all significantly reduced in favour of VP in infants who did not receive a sweet tasting solution. For infants who received a sweet tasting solution (in both VP and HL groups) only the outcome of "Number of neonates who cried during the procedure" was statistically significant in favour of VP. The number of infants included in the various cry outcomes was small ranging from 29 to110 neonates.</P>
<P>The results of this review need to be interpreted with some caution. In three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kvist-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kvist 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Larsson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Larsson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saththasivam-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Saththasivam 2009</LINK>) the outcomes were not reported on all infants enrolled and therefore intention to treat analyses were not performed. In three (<LINK REF="STD-Larsson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Larsson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shah-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Shah 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eriksson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Eriksson 1999</LINK>) of the five studies included in this review, the procedures were performed by a single investigator, respectively a paediatrician or a nurse. In one study, the procedures were performed by two midwives who were relatively inexperienced in performing VPs (according to the authors) (<LINK REF="STD-Kvist-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kvist 2002</LINK>), while in the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Ogawa-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ogawa 2005</LINK>, seven experienced nurses were trained to perform the procedures. In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Saththasivam-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Saththasivam 2009</LINK> two senior paediatric registrars were assigned to do the VPs and a single experienced staff nurse was assigned to do the HPs. There was statistically significant between study heterogeneity for several outcomes. The between study heterogeneity may in part be explained by the variable skills among the phlebotomists. The reproducibility of the results from these studies needs to be tested in a large study with multiple health care workers obtaining the blood samples. Before embarking on such a study, adequate training of the personnel undertaking heel lances and venipunctures would be required.</P>
<P>All studies used validated pain measures and showed that infants in the VP group had lower scores as compared to the HL group. Even though the changes in pain scores are statistically significant, the question remains as to whether these changes represent a clinically significant difference. The conventional method to determine this would be to ask patients how painful the procedure was as perceived by them. This is impossible in neonates and, therefore, clinicians have to rely on surrogate measures of pain. One study measured parents' judgement regarding their own anxiety and their infant's pain using a categorical rating scale. Parents favoured VP. This observation requires confirmation.</P>
<P>In the study by Larsson (<LINK REF="STD-Larsson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Larsson 1998</LINK>), the success rate with either the SL or the LL was poor as compared to the study by Shah (<LINK REF="STD-Shah-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Shah 1997</LINK>). This finding is hard to explain by poor technique, as neonatal nurses are well trained to perform HL. Larsson (<LINK REF="STD-Larsson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Larsson 1998</LINK>) evaluated the role of EMLA to reduce pain from VP in term neonates. In comparison to placebo, neonates in the EMLA group were noted to have significantly lower pain scores. However, when this study was compared to a previous study by the same investigators (<LINK REF="REF-Larsson-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Larsson 1998a</LINK>), pain scores were higher in the VP-EMLA group as compared to VP group without EMLA (<LINK REF="REF-Shah-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 1999a</LINK>).</P>
<P>In conclusion, VP is less painful as assessed by validated pain measures and parental rating and is associated with less maternal anxiety. In view of the limitations of the studies performed to date, these promising results need confirmation in a study of appropriate sample size using multiple operators on the postnatal floor. Sweet tasting solutions appear to reduce pain responses both to VP and HL.</P>
