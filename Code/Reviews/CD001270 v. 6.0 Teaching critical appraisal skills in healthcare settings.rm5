<P>Critical appraisal involves interpreting information, in particular information within research papers, in a systematic and objective manner. This review looked at whether teaching critical appraisal skills to health professionals led to changes in processes of care, patient outcomes, health professionals' knowledge of how to critically appraise research papers, or all three. The review found that teaching critical appraisal skills to health professionals may improve their knowledge. However, there was a lack of good quality evidence as to whether teaching critical appraisal skills led to changes in the process of care or to changes in patient outcomes.</P>

<P>Critical appraisal is the process of assessing and interpreting evidence by systematically considering its validity, results and relevance to an individual's work. Within the last decade critical appraisal has been added as a topic to many medical school and UK Royal College curricula, and several continuing professional development ventures have been funded to provide further training. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2001.</P>

<P>We updated the search (see <A HREF="01">Appendix 1</A> for search strategies by database) and used those search strategies to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (1997 to June 2011) and MEDLINE (from 1997 to June 2011). We also searched EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycINFO (up to January 2010). We searched LISA (up to January 2010), ERIC (up to January 2010), SIGLE (up to January 2010) and Web of Knowledge (up to January 2010). We also searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) and the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group Specialised Register up to January 2010.</P>

<P>Randomised trials, controlled clinical trials, controlled before and after studies and interrupted time series analyses that examined the effectiveness of educational interventions teaching critical appraisal to health professionals.

<P>In total, we reviewed a total of 11,057 titles and abstracts, of which 148 appeared potentially relevant to the review. We included three studies involving 272 people in this review. None of the included studies evaluated process of care or patient outcomes. Statistically significant improvements in participants' knowledge were reported in domains of critical appraisal (variable approaches across studies) in two of the three studies. We determined risk of bias to be 'unclear' and as such considered this to be 'plausible bias that raises some doubt about the results'.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2011-09-29 14:07:37 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-09-29 14:07:36 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is evidence that findings from research are often either translated slowly into practice or not at all. Such new developments in health care are often communicated through reports of scientific studies being presented at conferences and in academic journals. When healthcare professionals face a dilemma concerning the effectiveness of an intervention for a particular patient, one option is to locate relevant scientific studies. However, reliable interpretation of these retrieved articles requires a basic understanding of scientific and statistical methods, together with the adoption of an inquisitive and sceptical approach. Formal training in these critical appraisal skills may assist healthcare workers in interpreting studies, informing them of potential biases, increasing comprehension of numerical results, and helping them to decide whether articles are relevant, valid and how they should influence the care of their patients. By giving greater understanding of research designs with greater degrees of internal validity, critical appraisal may also assist healthcare workers deal with the recognised and increasing problems of information overload. This not only applies to healthcare professionals but to anyone who is making a decision regarding health care, for example health service managers, users of health care and the media who disseminate information about healthcare issues.</P>
<P>Over the past few decades, there has been a revolution in the teaching of critical appraisal as a tool in medical education across the continuum, in determining the purchase of health care, and in the assessment of higher professional training. There is a need to determine how effective this teaching is, what influences the efficacy of teaching and whether acquisition of critical appraisal skills has any effect on healthcare worker behaviour or patient-related outcomes, bridging the gap between research and practice.</P>
<P>It is clear from general surveillance of the literature that critical appraisal has been subject to development, starting from the point where Sir William Osler and others used journal clubs, "for the purpose and distribution of periodicals to which he could ill afford to subscribe as an individual" in the 19th century (<LINK REF="REF-Linzer-1987b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Linzer 1987b</LINK>). Key stages, the earliest of which would not constitute critical appraisal as we have defined it, include the following.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Identification of the need to facilitate access to and consideration of research.</LI>
<LI>Recognition of the variable quality of research and the need to be able to identify shortcomings, leading in turn to critical appraisal being regarded as the science of trashing research (<LINK REF="REF-Fisher-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fisher 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seltzer-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seltzer 1972</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Development of checklists to make the process of appraisal more structured, explicit and straightforward (<LINK REF="REF-DCEB-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">DCEB 1981</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Emphasis on application of research findings. In particular, changing the main aim from identifying as many things as possible wrong with a piece of research to making a balanced assessment of the strengths as well as the weaknesses of the research and applying it within these limits, in the context of a particular patient or group (<LINK REF="REF-EBMWG-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">EBMWG 1992</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Firmly embedding critical appraisal in a wider package of skills, e.g. question identification and literature retrieval, that together help the use of research, rather than the expectation that critical appraisal alone will achieve this (<LINK REF="REF-Sackett-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sackett 1997</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Recognition that the approach is of value to, and can be adapted for use by, all those potentially involved in making healthcare decisions including: nurses; professions allied to medicine; social workers; healthcare managers; and patients (<LINK REF="REF-Milne-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Milne 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Milne-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Milne 1996</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>The important role played in these developments by McMaster University in Canada should be highlighted.</P>
<P>This account of the development of critical appraisal is not complete by any means, but should be sufficient to re-emphasise that critical appraisal is not a static entity. Indeed development continues in many areas, such as extending the approach to a broad range of evidence, e.g. qualitative research and exploring means to improve the structured integration of different disciplines of information into a final decision. A consequence of the continuing evolution of critical appraisal is that precision is required in defining the term 'critical appraisal' in particular. At any point in time it is clear that the term may be being used in different ways by different authors and commentators. Although precise wording varies, there is broad agreement on the definition of critical appraisal being: "The process of assessing and interpreting evidence (usually published research) by systematically considering its validity (closeness to the truth), results and relevance to the individual's work" (<LINK REF="REF-Last-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Last 1988</LINK>). This is the definition that we have used in this systematic review.</P>

<STUDY_SELECTION MODIFIED="2011-09-29 14:07:37 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>One of two review authors (TH, NS) screened the results of all searches and excluded articles clearly of no relevance to the study. Another author (not the original review author) independently reviewed excluded studies to ensure studies were not excluded inadvertently or inaccurately; this process ensured a conservative approach and that any excluded study was determined in duplicate. Two of the four independent assessors (TH, NS, CH, RS) retrieved and reviewed copies of all other articles, and the assessors judged whether the articles were eligible for inclusion in the review according to the criteria stated above. Negotiation settled any disagreement. We only included abstracts if a full article (published or unpublished) could not be obtained and if the abstract contained enough information to discern the intervention of interest and relevant outcome data.</P>

Studies were published between 1988 (<LINK REF="STD-Linzer-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Linzer 1988</LINK>) and 2004 (<LINK REF="STD-MacRae-2004" TYPE="STUDY">MacRae 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 2004</LINK>). Countries of publication included the United States of America (<LINK REF="STD-Linzer-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Linzer 1988</LINK>), United Kingdom (<LINK REF="STD-Taylor-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 2004</LINK>) and Canada (<LINK REF="STD-MacRae-2004" TYPE="STUDY">MacRae 2004</LINK>). All three included studies were randomised trial designs. Interventions included a journal club supported by a half-day workshop (<LINK REF="STD-Linzer-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Linzer 1988</LINK>), critical appraisal materials (package) including papers with methodological reviews, listserve discussions and articles (<LINK REF="STD-MacRae-2004" TYPE="STUDY">MacRae 2004</LINK>) and a half-day workshop based on a Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) (<LINK REF="STD-Taylor-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 2004</LINK>). Sample size (analysed) ranged between 44 (<LINK REF="STD-Linzer-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Linzer 1988</LINK>) and 145 (<LINK REF="STD-Taylor-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 2004</LINK>) subjects. One study reported that the educational intervention was developed and executed using an adult learning theory (<LINK REF="STD-MacRae-2004" TYPE="STUDY">MacRae 2004</LINK>)</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Linzer-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Linzer 1988</LINK> examined whether a journal club improved internal medicine interns reading habits, knowledge of epidemiology and biostatistics, and critical appraisal skills. The study randomised medical interns (N = 44) to receive either journal club or a control seminar series focused on ambulatory medicine; participants in the control group were also assigned to a waiting list to attend the workshop. The general medicine faculty delivered the intervention which included a half-day workshop based on the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) (not fully described within the report). Outcomes measured included change in reading habits, knowledge and critical appraisal scores (evaluation instrument assessed baseline characteristics, reading habits, knowledge of epidemiology and biostatistics, and critical appraisal skills). Follow-up evaluation occurred immediately following the intervention (with a mean time between pre-test and post-test scores of 9.5 weeks). The study did not report that the educational intervention was based on any theory-based principles.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-MacRae-2004" TYPE="STUDY">MacRae 2004</LINK> evaluated the effectiveness of an Internet-based, critical appraisal skills intervention to determine its impact on physician critical appraisal skills. A total of 83 practicing surgeons with no postgraduate training in clinical epidemiology were randomised to a curriculum in critical appraisal skills that included a clinical and methodological article, a listserve discussion, and clinical and methodological critiques or those receiving only the articles. Intervention group participants received eight packages (once monthly containing articles) and questions designed to guide critical appraisal and other supportive resources (listed previously) with the control receiving the eight packages and with online access only to major medical and surgical journals, some of which included articles on critical appraisal. Critical appraisal outcomes were measured using a (locally developed) critical appraisal test. Follow-up evaluation occurred immediately following the intervention. The authors reported that the intervention was based on adult learning theory and findings from continuing education literature.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Taylor-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 2004</LINK> evaluated the effectiveness and costs of a critical appraisal skills educational intervention that was specifically aimed at healthcare professionals. A total of 145 self selected general practitioners, hospital physicians, professions allied to medicine, and healthcare managers and administrators were randomised to either receive a half-day critical appraisal skills training workshop or a waiting list control. The intervention group received a half-day workshop based on the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP). Outcomes measured included knowledge of principles for appraising evidence, attitudes towards the use of evidence about health care, evidence-seeking behaviours, and perceived confidence in appraising evidence; critical appraisal skills were assessed through the appraisal of a systematic review. Follow-up evaluation occurred at six months post-intervention. The study did not report that the educational intervention was based on any theory-based principles but did note that approach was based on the model of problem-based small group learning.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Knowledge scores</HEADING>
<P>Two studies reported knowledge-related outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Linzer-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Linzer 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 2004</LINK>). Linzer assessed knowledge using an evaluation instrument (given before and immediately following the intervention; interval to follow-up averaged 9.5 weeks) that evaluated baseline research experience, previous education with critical appraisal, reading habits, direct knowledge of epidemiology and biostatistics, and specifically critical appraisal skills (<LINK REF="STD-Linzer-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Linzer 1988</LINK>). The investigators reported that the percentage improvements in knowledge in the two groups are 10% in intervention compared with 2% in control (no P value or confidence interval reported). Additional percentage improvement scores were calculated to adjust for the differences in pre-test scores between the groups, where the numerator is the pre-test/post-test difference and the denominator is the maximum obtainable value minus the pre-test score. Using these adjustments, the intervention group percentage improvement is 26% whilst the control group improvement is 6% (P = 0.02). A trend was found that suggested that the more journal club sessions a participant attended, the more knowledge was acquired, resulting in a 'dose-response' relationship in the intervention group that was absent from the control group (intervention r = 0.40, P = &lt; 0.07: control group r = 0.01, P = 0.96). <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 2004</LINK> used an 18-question multiple-choice outcome questionnaire focused on attitude and confidence statements. Critical appraisal skills were assessed by the appraisal of a systematic review article independently assessed by two authors. They reported overall knowledge scores as intention-to-treat analysis mean difference (adjusted for sex, age, attendance at previous educational activity, access to medical library, prior experience of searching literature, formal education in research methods and/or epidemiology and/or statistics, and prior involvement in research) as 2.6 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.6 to 4.6). This was statistically significant at P&#8804; 0.05. An explanatory analysis mean difference was 3.1 (95% CI 1.1 to 5.2), which corresponded to a moderate effect size.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Critical appraisal</HEADING>
<P>All included studies reported critical appraisal-related outcomes. There were significant improvements in domains of critical appraisal (variable approaches across studies) in all but one study (<LINK REF="STD-Taylor-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 2004</LINK>). The studies reported outcomes heterogeneously as either mean total scores (<LINK REF="STD-Linzer-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Linzer 1988</LINK>), % improvement (mean) (<LINK REF="STD-Linzer-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Linzer 1988</LINK>), mean total score (as a %) (<LINK REF="STD-MacRae-2004" TYPE="STUDY">MacRae 2004</LINK>), or an estimate of the mean difference (<LINK REF="STD-Taylor-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 2004</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Linzer-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Linzer 1988</LINK> demonstrated an improvement of 1.5 correct test questions in the intervention group compared to a 0.3 improvement in the control group (mean scores). This translated into a 1.2 correct question difference between intervention and control group which was calculated to be statistically significant between groups (P = 0.04). The differences in post-test scores between control and intervention groups was 0.5 correct test questions (3% difference). <LINK REF="STD-MacRae-2004" TYPE="STUDY">MacRae 2004</LINK> reported the overall mean score from an exam (a locally developed test of critical appraisal) that demonstrated statistically significant differences (mean% (SD)) between the intervention group (58.8% (8)) and the control participants (50% (8)) (P &lt; 0.01). Findings from <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 2004</LINK> resulted in no statistically significant differences observed between the intervention and comparator groups (intention-to-treat mean difference 1.2 (95% CI .01 to 2.4). There were also no differences observed in the ability to appraise methodology or relevance/generalisability of evidence. The authors note that the cost associated with one-off workshops (estimated to be GBP 250) is challenged by their findings.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-09-29 14:07:37 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The trials included in this updated review indicate that critical appraisal teaching continues to demonstrate that there is a general improvement in critical appraisal knowledge.The extent and impact of that improvement remains dependent on several factors including whether or not the participants in the intervention groups had some background in research. Most had some prior teaching in critical appraisal therefore resulting in quite high baseline scores (62% of test questions answered correctly, leading to statistical access to 50% of the medical literature). This increased to 60% after the intervention. It may be that the impact of the intervention may have been greater if the baseline performance of the participants had not been as strong. The size of the effect on knowledge attributable to critical appraisal teaching remains difficult to discern. A further challenge beyond estimating the true size of the effect on knowledge is a definition of whether a particular level represents a change, which is likely to be significant in practice.</P>
<P>As has been noted, there is a lack of evidence on the impact of teaching critical appraisal on patient health. However, using patient health measures may be not be feasible unless the scale of the critical appraisal programme is very large and sustained with follow-up over many years. It may be more appropriate to concentrate on immediate measures and simultaneously to seek to establish the relationship between such proxy measures and health outcomes through observational data (<LINK REF="REF-Mant-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mant 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Our review does not examine the impact of teaching critical appraisal skills in undergraduate populations. As stated by <LINK REF="REF-Norman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norman 1998</LINK>, there is empirical evidence to suggest that outcomes of teaching evidence-based medicine (EBM) markedly differ between the undergraduate and postgraduate populations. <LINK REF="REF-Norman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norman 1998</LINK> suggests that the differences were not explained by methodological shortcomings (e.g. small samples), rather it may be that the integration of EBM as an essential and continuing component of a residency programme will demonstrate much larger and sustained effects that affect patient care. Moreover, from an educationalist perspective, approaches to learning vary greatly and as such should be considered separately.</P>
<P>Other messages from previous reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Audet-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Audet 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Burls-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Burls 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hyde-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hyde 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Norman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norman 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2000</LINK>) include the need for assessment of whether the benefits achievable through investment in time, effort and money required to deliver critical appraisal teaching on a large scale are of broadly similar size to what may be achieved through an equivalent amount spent directly on patient care. More recently, a review by Coomarasamy and colleagues evaluated the effects of standalone versus clinically integrated teaching in evidence-based medicine and found that standalone teaching improved knowledge but not skills, attitudes or behaviours (<LINK REF="REF-Coomarasamy-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coomarasamy 2004</LINK>). The traditional view of professional learning (that which sees healthcare professionals attending learning workshops/courses/conferences) undervalues the importance of what we learn from our daily practice routines and perpetuates the recommendations that 'teaching' of EBM should be done within a classroom and not in clinical practice.</P>
<P>Although most reviews on EBM have an overall positive effect of teaching critical appraisal on knowledge gains and skills, it should be mentioned that most have been broader in scope and have included all healthcare workers, and examined knowledge, skills, behaviour and attitudes outcomes. Previous reviews have suggested that randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are the research design of choice for assessing the effects and effectiveness of teaching critical appraisal to avoid the threats to validity of past research. This is generally supported by this review although restriction solely to RCTs may be too dogmatic. There are circumstances where valid outcome measures may be collected from before and after studies. These may be where the outcome is objective, the intervention short and outcome assessed immediately after the intervention (with exact timing of measurement being clearly reported); any change may be reasonably attributed to the intervention. Loss to follow-up may not be more difficult in before and after designs, and again this would minimise bias.</P>
<P>To estimate the effectiveness of interventions for improving health professionals' critical appraisal skills, at a minimum it will be important to conduct well-designed, methodologically rigorous, clearly described studies. If interventions are to be supported and taken up by academic health centres, hospitals, medical schools etc. it will be imperative to demonstrate the costs (both monetary and time) of the interventions; none of the studies included in our review examined costs. To improve our understanding of the interventions and to build on previous research it will be important for investigators and study authors to consider adult learning theories and models when developing educational interventions; no included studies reported that educational interventions were designed or supported by a particular theory. To ensure reliability and validity, future investigators should use valid and reliable outcome measures. Independent, duplicate, direct observation is recommended by individuals trained to assess the given outcomes.</P>
<P>The objectives of this review were limited to the evaluation of the impact of critical appraisal teaching on process of care variables, patient outcomes and critical appraisal knowledge of qualified healthcare workers. Therefore, it is not an evaluation of critical appraisal skills programmes, centres for evidence-based health care, clinical effectiveness, clinical governance or any of the more 'macro' uses to which this 'micro' intervention might be harnessed (<LINK REF="REF-Wilkes-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilkes 1999</LINK>). This is a fast-moving field (<LINK REF="REF-Sackett-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sackett 1998</LINK>), therefore evaluations of teaching programmes may be turning to the issue of how, rather than whether, to teach critical appraisal skills.</P>
<P>Educational research has not yet acquired the prestige of pure or applied medical science and may attract inadequate funding, with little effect on career advancement, thus inspiring temporary enthusiasms (<LINK REF="REF-Hutchinson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hutchinson 1999</LINK>). All of these may help to explain the paucity of the literature. This picture will have to change if any of the outstanding questions are to be answered by high-quality research.</P>
<P>Finally, absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. This systematic review has highlighted the poor evidence in the area but it is not evidence for discontinuing critical appraisal teaching.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-09-29 14:07:37 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-09-29 14:07:37 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Results from two included trials suggest that critical appraisal teaching may have positive effects on participants' knowledge. None of the studies evaluated the effect of critical appraisal on the process of health care or on patient health. It is unclear whether the size of benefit in knowledge is large enough to be of practical significance. This review provides some reassurance to those who have invested in critical appraisal teaching activities in that they are likely to have a positive impact. Due to limitations on validity and significance in practice and the absence of results for important outcomes, the evidence is not sufficient to encourage further expansion of critical appraisal activities without inclusion of rigorous evaluations of effectiveness that include, but are not limited to, randomisation.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-09-29 14:07:37 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>On the basis of this review the top priority should be a high-quality, multicentre randomised controlled trial of teaching critical appraisal to postgraduates as part of continuing professional development. It should define in advance changes in outcomes that are 'significant in practice'. It should include a consideration of costs and attempt to answer the value for money question. There are many centres around the world teaching critical appraisal to their healthcare students and postgraduate workers. It must be possible to plan and even co-ordinate the work done in this field to increase study numbers and obtain valid results of measurable outcomes, using consistent, valid instruments. This could facilitate the production of more homogeneous results, which could be combined to give an overall effect direction and size of effect. One way of achieving this might be multicentre, methodologically rigorous, controlled before and after studies in comparable groups with the same valid instruments, measuring the same outcomes, which may be able to give answers of reasonable validity when randomisation is not feasible. It would also be important to note that only one study acknowledged the application of adult learning theory principles when designing its curriculum. It is imperative that, moving forward, interventions are designed and developed considering these principles (e.g. motivations, barriers) that are particular to the learner.</P>

<P>Intervention group: participants in the intervention group received 8 packages (of 2 articles from 1 October 2001 to 1 May 2002) and questions designed to guide critical appraisal. 1-week listserve discussions centred on methodology of articles, a comprehensive methodologic review of the article prepared by a surgeon with training in clinical epidemiology and a clinical review were also provided. Articles chosen to be of clinical interest to the general surgeons and the methodological article that directly related to the clinical article. This was an internet-based intervention.</P>
<P>Theory-based intervention: Y (based on adult learning theory and findings from continuing education literature)</P>
<P>Control group: received the 8 packages (of 2 articles), clinical articles and had online access to major medical and surgical journals, some of which included articles on critical appraisal</P>
<P>Intervention deliverer: sessions moderated by a general surgeon with training in clinical epidemiology at the level of a master of science degree</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2011-09-29 14:07:37 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Outcomes measured: (locally developed) critical appraisal used previously on a group of general surgery residents (internal consistency Chronbach alpha 0.77) with evidence of face, content and construct validity. Inter-rater reliability of 2 physicians marking the examination was 0.93. Participants completed rating scales on aspects of study quality and gave free-text responses to questions about methodology, the validity and applicability of results. Two general surgeons developed an answer key and all answers were marked by a single clinical epidemiologist.</P>
<P>Distal follow-up interval: immediately following intervention. Examinations were mailed to participants in both groups with an e-reminder 3 weeks later. Asked to submit within 6 weeks.</P>
<P>
<U>Losses to follow-up: 26</U>
</P>
<P>N randomised: 44 IG, 37 CG</P>
<P>N completing follow-up: 26 IG, 29 CG</P>
<P>Reasons for loss to follow-up: 3 were excluded prior to randomisation, and another 2 were excluded after randomisation (1 in each group) because they had previous clinical epidemiology training<BR/>Fewer of the experimental group participants (26 surgeons, 58%) than the control group (29 surgeons, 76%) completed the examination. This difference may have been due to trial fatigue, in that we asked the experimental group to complete much more material on a monthly basis.

<P>Intervention group: half-day workshop based on Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP). The 3-hour workshop is focused on facilitating a process whereby research evidence is systematically examined to assess study validity, the results and relevance to a clinical scenario. The workshop begins with an introductory talk (~60 minutes) about the importance of evidence-based healthcare practice, theoretical basis for systematic reviews and the JAMA appraisal guideline. Small group work (~30 minutes) and then a plenary session run by 3 to 4 individuals each with formal training in health services research methods.</P>
