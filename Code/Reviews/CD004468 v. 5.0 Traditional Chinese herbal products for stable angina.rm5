<P>Traditional Chinese herbal products (TCHP) are often used to treat patients with stable angina but there is not sufficient evidence to show that TCHP are effective. The authors of this review undertook a systematic review of the potential benefits and safety of TCHP in patients with stable angina. Three randomised controlled studies with a total of 216 patients were identified. Only one small trial was able to detect benefits of using TCHP compared with nitrates in improving angina symptoms. The remaining two trials were inconclusive. Due to the very small number of included studies and participants in the studies, TCHP should be used with caution. We recommend that larger-scale high quality randomised controlled trials of TCHP are required to strengthen the evidence for the efficacy and safety of certain TCHP in treating angina.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2010-04-09 16:05:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nicole Ackermann">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-04-09 16:05:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nicole Ackermann">
<P>Angina pectoris is the most common clinical manifestation of myocardial ischaemia, caused by an imbalance between myocardial blood supply and oxygen demand. Angina is a common presenting symptom, typically chest pain, among patients with coronary artery disease (<LINK REF="REF-Bernard-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernard 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kau-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kau 1996</LINK>). Myocardial ischaemia develops when the coronary blood flow becomes inadequate to meet myocardial oxygen demand. This causes myocardial cells to switch from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism with progressive impairment of metabolic as well as mechanical and electrical function (<LINK REF="REF-Bernard-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernard 1979</LINK>). Angina is a sign of increased risk of heart attack, cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death (<LINK REF="REF-Bernard-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernard 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kau-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kau 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Stable angina is chest pain or discomfort that typically occurs with activity or stress. It persists for more than four months and occurs more than five times a week. The pain usually begins slowly and gets worse over the next few minutes. It disappears rapidly with rest or with sublingual nitroglycerin (<LINK REF="REF-Bernard-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernard 1979</LINK>). The stable angina attack (or chronic stable angina) is usually predictable, if the patient feels chest discomfort, pressure, or a squeezing sensation. Less commonly sensations of burning, sticking, or sharp pain may occur (<LINK REF="REF-Pope-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pope 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>As a symptom of cardiac ischaemia stable angina occurs because the flow of blood is being restricted, by any of (1) clogged arteries, which are often a sign of coronary artery disease; (2) problems in the aortic valve (one of the four heart valves), such as regurgitation (leaking) or stenosis (narrowing); (3) problems in the heart muscle (e.g. hypertrophic subaortic stenosis) (<LINK REF="REF-Hamby-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamby 2001</LINK>). Ischaemic heart disease is the most common cause of death in Western countries, where it amounts to almost 33% of overall mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Braunwald-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Braunwald 1992</LINK>). The 'first clinical sign' in over half of patients is angina pectoris. In recent years, there has been an increasing tendency for ischaemic heart disease incidence to rise in developing countries, in conjunction with their economic development. For example in Beijing, China, mortality from this disease has increased from 21.7/100,000 in 1970 to 62.0/100,000 in 1980 (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although angina attacks usually pass with little long-term damage to the heart the episodes of cardiac ischaemia that trigger the angina attacks can lead to dangerous problems if left untreated. They can cause abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias), which can lead to either syncope (fainting) or sudden cardiac death; heart disease patients whose episodes are triggered by stress (for example frustration) are more likely to die from their heart condition; severe or lengthy episodes can trigger a heart attack; and the small effects of minor episodes can eventually add up and lead to permanent weakening of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy). So people with new, worsening, or persistent chest discomfort should be monitored carefully (<LINK REF="REF-Hamby-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamby 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Antiplatelet agents consist of aspirin, ticlopidine, clopidogrel, and dipyridamole (<LINK REF="REF-ACC_x002f_AHA-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACC/AHA 1999</LINK>). These medications prevent thrombus formation by inhibition of platelet aggregation (<LINK REF="REF-Alaeddini-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alaeddini 2002</LINK>). The Swedish Angina Pectoris Trial (<LINK REF="REF-SAPAT-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">SAPAT 1992</LINK>) randomised 2935 patients with a history of at least one month of exertional angina to receive 75 mg aspirin daily in addition to beta-blockers. The intervention resulted in a 34% reduction in primary outcomes (non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), fatal MI, or sudden death) and a 32% decrease in secondary vascular events after 72 months. Absolute risk reduction was 4% (95% confidence interval 1% to 7%) (<LINK REF="REF-SAPAT-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">SAPAT 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Beta blockers inhibit the activation of beta-receptors, which is associated with a reduction in cardiac inotropic state and sinus rate and slowing of atrioventricular (AV) conduction. The decreases in resting and exercise heart rate, cardiac contractility and arterial blood pressure with beta blockers are associated with decreased myocardial oxygen demand. A reduction in heart rate also increases diastolic perfusion time, which may enhance left ventricular (LV) perfusion (<LINK REF="REF-Frishman-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frishman 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Narahara-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Narahara 1990</LINK>). Patients who require regular, symptomatic treatment should be treated initially with a beta blocker (unless specifically contraindicated) (<LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2001</LINK>). The Beta-Blocker Pooling Project reported a highly significant reduction in mortality in this subgroup and it seems reasonable to assume that beta blockers have the potential to prevent death, especially sudden death, and also the development of myocardial infarction (MI) even when there has been no prior infarction (<LINK REF="REF-ESC-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESC 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Calcium antagonists reduce the transmembrane flux of calcium via the calcium channels. They can reduce smooth muscle tension in the peripheral vascular bed. This is associated with vasodilation, and can decrease coronary vascular resistance and increase coronary blood flow. All of these agents cause dilation of the epicardial conduit vessels and the arteriolar resistance vessels. Calcium antagonists improve exercise time to onset of angina or ischaemia (<LINK REF="REF-ACC_x002f_AHA-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACC/AHA 1999</LINK>). Long-acting and slow-release calcium antagonists are effective in relieving symptoms in patients with chronic stable angina (<LINK REF="REF-ACC_x002f_AHA-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACC/AHA 1999</LINK>) and are specifically indicated for vasospastic angina (<LINK REF="REF-ESC-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESC 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>For nitroglycerin and nitrates, nitrates can reduce the myocardial oxygen requirement by reducing LV volume and preload, and also by improved nitroglycerin-induced central arterial compliance. Nitrates can improve myocardial perfusion by dilating large epicardial coronary arteries and collateral vessels. Nitroglycerin also exerts antithrombotic and antiplatelet effects in patients with stable angina (<LINK REF="REF-ACC_x002f_AHA-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACC/AHA 1999</LINK>). Sublingual (under the tongue) nitroglycerin tablets or nitroglycerin spray are used for the immediate relief of angina. However, these have not been shown to decrease death or the incidence of heart attacks (<LINK REF="REF-Caremark-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caremark 2003</LINK>). Both isosorbide dinitrate and mononitrate have been shown in controlled trials to be superior to placebo in controlling symptomatic angina (<LINK REF="REF-Chrysant-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chrysant 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thadani-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thadani 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which lower blood pressure and have other effects on blood vessels, could save lives and prevent heart attacks and strokes among certain patients with chronic stable angina (<LINK REF="REF-ACC-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACC 2002</LINK>). The Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) trial, which compared the ACE inhibitor ramipril against placebo in more than 9000 patients with vascular disease including more than 3500 patients with diabetes, suggests that the use of an ACE inhibitor reduces the rates of death, MI or heart attack, stroke and revascularization procedures (<LINK REF="REF-ACC-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACC 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Lipid lowering agents, including statins, help lower lipid levels in blood. Recent clinical trials have documented that low density lipoprotein (LDL) lowering agents can decrease the risk of adverse ischaemic events in patients with established coronary artery disease (CAD) (<LINK REF="REF-ACC_x002f_AHA-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACC/AHA 1999</LINK>). The Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study showed that a statin given to patients with angina pectoris, and a total cholesterol level between 5.5 and 8.0 mmol/L (212 and 308 mg/dL), substantially reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, death, and the need for coronary bypass surgery by 30% to 35% (<LINK REF="REF-_x0034_S-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">4S 1994</LINK>). In patients with established CAD, including chronic stable angina, lipid-lowering therapy should be recommended even in the presence of mild to moderate elevations of LDL cholesterol (<LINK REF="REF-ACC_x002f_AHA-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACC/AHA 1999</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Chinese herbal medicine in the treatment of stable angina</HEADING>
<P>Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is a 3000-year old holistic system combining the use of medicinal herbs, acupuncture, food therapy, massage and therapeutic exercise for both treatment and prevention of disease (<LINK REF="REF-Fulder-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fulder 1996</LINK>). TCM has its unique theories for concepts of etiology, systems of diagnosis and treatment which are vital to its practice. TCM treatment consists typically of complex prescriptions of a combination of different components. The combination is based on the Chinese diagnostic patterns (that is inspection, listening, smelling, inquiry, and palpation) and follows a completely different rationale than many Western drug treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Some researchers have provided evidence on the rationale for use of traditional Chinese herbal medicines for angina. Rationales include (1) relieving myocardial ischaemia as some herbal medicines can dilate coronary arteries and increase coronary blood flow, for example Flos carthami, Radix puerariae, Rhizoma ligustici chuanxiong, Radix astragali seu hedysari, Radix notoginseng and Radix salviae miltiorrhizae (<LINK REF="REF-Ou-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ou 1992</LINK>); (2) reducing myocardial oxygen consumption as some herbal medicines can reduce myocardial oxygen consumption, for example Radix augelicae sinensis and Radix notoginseng (<LINK REF="REF-Ou-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ou 1992</LINK>); (3) antiplatelet and anticoagulant activity as some herbal medicines act on various blood-clotting factors, increase the level of cAMP in thrombocytes, inhibit the rheological state of blood to impede the formation of thrombi, for example Radix salviae miltiorrhizae and Hirudo; some can lower the level of blood lipids and counter the development of atheroma, for example Radix augelicae sinensis (<LINK REF="REF-Ou-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ou 1992</LINK>); (4) relieving pain as some herbal medicines can reduce the symptoms of chest pain and radiation pain, for example Radix augelicae sinensis, Radix notoginseng and Radix astragali seu hedysari (<LINK REF="REF-Ou-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ou 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>In addition, when using TCM two or more herbs are always used in the one prescription. In this way, the herbs used correctly interact. They may support each other to increase their effects or counteract each other to reduce or remove toxicity or side effects (<LINK REF="REF-Ou-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ou 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>The term 'Traditional Chinese herbal product' (TCHP) refers to an industrially manufactured drug which contains effective extracts of some herbal medicines according to the TCM prescription. The TCHP can be in various forms, for example as a capsule, injection, granule or tablet. Thus the TCHP can be used very conveniently for clinical purposes.</P>
<P>The effectiveness and safety of such treatments need to be reviewed systematically and appraised critically to inform current practice and direct the continued search for new treatment regimens.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Study selection</HEADING>
<P>Three authors (ZQ, YZY, CHX) searched the databases. To determine which studies were to be assessed further, the authors independently scanned the titles, abstracts and keywords of every record retrieved. Full articles were retrieved for further assessment. We contacted the original authors of these studies to clarify the methods used in the process of randomisation. If the author could not be reached, the article was added to those 'awaiting assessment'. Differences in opinion were mostly resolved by discussion. There was no disagreement in the selection of studies.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of risk of bias of included studies</HEADING>
<P>Risks of bias were assessed independently by at least two authors using the criteria that are described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions 5.0.0 (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>) and (<LINK REF="REF-Wu-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2007</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Randomisation process: assessment for selection bias</HEADING>
<P>Adequate sequence generation was reported using one of the following approaches: random number tables or computer-generated random numbers, coin tossing, or shuffling for generating the allocation sequence before recruiting the participants; trial was eligible and had a low risk of selection bias.</P>
<P>A study that did not specify one of the adequate methods outlined above but only mentioned 'random' was considered to have a moderate risk of selection bias.</P>
<P>Studies that used other methods of allocation, for example quasi-randomisation, and appeared to have a high risk of bias and were excluded.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Allocation concealment process: assessment of selection bias</HEADING>
<P>Adequate measures to conceal allocation meant that the person who generated the allocation sequence did not attend recruitment of the participants. The allocation sequence was kept secure, for example by using central randomisation, sealed opaque envelopes or a locked computer, or another description that contained convincing elements of concealment. These were considered to have a low risk of selection bias.</P>
<P>Trials in which the report mentioned 'concealed allocation' but did not report on the approach were considered as 'unclear', with moderate risk of selection bias.</P>
<P>Trials in which the report described an inadequate method to conceal allocation or did not conceal allocation were considered as having high risk of selection bias. </P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Level of blinding: assessment for performance bias and detection bias</HEADING>
<P>Double blinding, by masking participants and results assessors, was considered to have a low risk of both performance and detection bias. In particular, the use of a placebo or simulant was considered as being the most effective approach for blinding.</P>
<P>Single blinding of the results assessor was considered to have a moderate risk of both performance and detection bias. If single blinding of the participants was carried out, and not the results assessor, the study was considered to have a high risk of detection bias.</P>

<P>Each trial was assessed independently by two authors (ZQ, YY). Information on trial design, study population, interventions and outcomes were extracted independently by two authors (ZQ, YY) using a data extraction form specifically designed for this review. The data extraction form included the following items.</P>
<OL>
<LI>General information: published or unpublished, title, authors, reference or source, contact address, country, urban or rural etc., language of publication, year of publication, duplicate publications, sponsor and setting.</LI>
<LI>Trial characteristics: design, duration of follow up, method of randomisation, allocation concealment, blinding (patients, people administering treatment, outcome assessors).</LI>
<LI>Intervention(s): intervention(s) (dose, route and timing), comparison intervention(s) (dose, route and timing), and co-medication (dose, route and timing).</LI>
<LI>Patients: exclusion criteria, total number and number in each comparison group, age (adults), baseline characteristics, diagnostic criteria, similarity of groups at baseline (including any co-morbidities), assessment of compliance, withdrawals and losses to follow up (reasons, description) and subgroups.</LI>
<LI>Outcomes: as specified above, any other outcomes assessed, other events, length of follow up, quality of reporting of outcomes.</LI>
<LI>Results: for outcomes and times of assessment (including a measure of variation) if necessary converted to the measures of effect specified below, intention-to-treat analysis.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Differences in data extraction were resolved by referring back to the original article and consensus. When necessary, information was sought from the authors of the primary studies.</P>
<P>All data in the included studies were binary outcomes, so the number of events and total number in each group were extracted or imputed.</P>
<P>We extracted herb names in three languages and the formulation contents for the included studies, given in Additional <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data analysis</HEADING>
<P>Because of obvious clinical heterogeneity between included studies, we decided against doing a meta-analysis to calculate pooled effect size. Data for each study were analysed and expressed as relative risks. The numbers of dropouts and participants that were lost to follow up for each study, if available, were summarized using an intention-to-treat analysis. When different herbal preparations were used (the TCHP) as the intervention, we considered treatment groups as a whole and compared them to certain chemical drugs in the control groups using qualitative analysis. In summary, data were summarized in a narrative format and different comparisons were analysed separately.</P>
<P>If data are available for meta-analysis in the future, we will proceed as follows. The data will be included in a meta-analysis if similar and of sufficient quality. We expect both event (dichotomous) and continuous data. Dichotomous data will be expressed as odd ratios (OR). The relative risk (RR) may be used as an alternative to the OR as interpretation is easier, especially if the outcome is a negative event. Continuous data will be expressed as weighted mean differences (WMD). Overall results will be calculated based on the random-effects model. Heterogeneity will be tested for using the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> statistic with significance set at P &lt; 0.1. The I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic will be used to estimate total variation across studies that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance where: 0% to 40% might not be important, 30% to 60%: may represent moderate heterogeneity, 50% to 75% may represent substantial heterogeneity and 75% to 100% considerable heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). Possible sources of heterogeneity will be assessed by sensitivity and subgroup analysis, as described below. Publication bias will be tested for using the funnel plot or another corrective analytical method, depending on the number of clinical trials included in the systematic review.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-04-06 12:21:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This systematic review examined and compared the effectiveness of TCHP for patients with stable angina alone or in combination, with nitrates or another TCHP whose main active ingredient was Danshen root. Overall, studies of TCHP for stable angina lack sufficient power to provide reliable estimates of the effects. No study provided data for us to compare the effect of TCHP on our primary outcome measures of death or acute myocardial infarction. The reason for this might be that most patients with chronic stable angina have a relatively low risk of death or major adverse cardiovascular events.</P>
<P>One study in particular was able to provide positive results for our secondary outcome measures, the frequency of angina symptoms and use of nitroglycerin. This is believed to consistently predict mortality and cardiovascular events among outpatients with coronary artery disease. No study measured patient quality of life. One study was able to demonstrate limited benefit of TCHP compared with nitrates in terms of improved angina symptoms. We were unable to determine if TCHP was more effective than the nitrate regimen, mainly because the trial was small with wide confidence intervals and insufficient statistical power. The improvement in ECG was of borderline significance, inferring that the observed effects were of limited clinical importance. No other positive results were identified, particularly in the two studies comparing one type of TCHP versus another, with Danshen root as the main ingredient. The effectiveness of TCHP in treating stable angina is yet to be established.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2010-04-08 12:12:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nicole Ackermann">
<P>The evidence from the included studies was of low quality.</P>
<P>(1) Publication bias may exist because only Chinese language publications were found and included.</P>
<P>(2) Among the 127 papers that we retrieved for further details, the great majority were small clinical trials (around 100 people) which for various reasons could not be included in the systematic review. A large number of the trials claimed to be RCTs but most of them failed to give adequate and convincing information about the methodological quality. When we telephoned the trial authors about the method of randomisation they had used, we found that the majority of the authors described the concept of randomisation incorrectly. In addition, some of the studies were conducted several years ago and the trial authors may have forgotten the details of the methodology they employed, which could lead to bias and end up influencing the veracity of the information provided.</P>
<P>By careful clarification with the authors, we identified only three of the retrieved studies as true RCTs. These had funding sources and only two studies used allocation concealment. The same two studies used double blinding and the third study employed single blinding, which may introduce performance bias. None of the studies mentioned blinding of the outcome assessors, promoting suspicion of detection bias. No analysis was reported based on intention to treat.</P>
<P>(3) None of the three studies used a placebo as control, but 'positive-effect drugs' were selected in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Fang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fang 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2004</LINK>). Both studies used Danshen preparations as controls, the reason possibly being that the trialists thought that the effect of Danshen was generally accepted in the treatment of ischaemic heart disease. Large sample multicentre RCTs are required.</P>
<P>This may result in false positive findings as a number of interventions are considered effective for stable angina, particularly if trialists know that a 'positive' drug was used in the trial and the purpose of the study was to demonstrate the same effect as the control (so called 'equal effect test' or comparative effectiveness).</P>
<P>(4) We found that the interventions in two of the three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Fang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fang 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2004</LINK>) were prepared by the trial authors themselves or their colleagues in the trial author's hospital. We included these two study because they were funded either by government or a pharmaceutical company and, therefore, had a guarantee of quality. However, the fact that in these two studies the trialists acted as the main players, including formulation designer, trial designer and trialist, may lead to a high possibility of favouring the intervention and introduce conflict of interest.</P>
<P>Although TCHP as a treatment for stable angina and its method of manufacture are widely accepted in China, most of the constituents of the pharmacologically prepared drugs used in the trials cannot be clearly specified. This is in marked contrast to pharmacological agents used in Western medicine, in which the chemical constituents, their quantities and the percentages of any impurities or contaminants are precisely known; and the variation between different production batches is kept within specified limits. Variations between decoctions and batches of treatments are inevitable consequences of TCHP, though the Chinese Government also specifies the acceptable limits of variation. This variation is a factor that may contribute to heterogeneity between different study results. Furthermore, one must accept that the overall treatment concept for TCHP is different to that used in Western medicine. When a study uses a self-prepared herbal decoction, the quality of herbs and methods of preparation should be stated in detail in order to achieve consistent effects.</P>
<P>(5) One study (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2004</LINK>) used unequal numbers of participants in each arm of the trial. <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2004</LINK> used a proportion of 3:1 and only 20 patients were included in the control group (60:20). Considerations for the sample sizes were not reported and so the trial cannot detect differences between the two groups.</P>
<P>(6) None of the studies abided by the criteria laid down in the CONSORT statement (<LINK REF="REF-CONSORT-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">CONSORT 2001</LINK>). The results for the interventions did not come close to reaching a confirmable conclusion as to the effectiveness of a certain Chinese patent medicine or a herbal preparation compared to another. If more high quality studies on the same interventions had been found, the effectiveness of certain TCMs could have been evaluated more reliably using meta-analysis.</P>
<P>(7) The outcome definitions adopted by this review, and employed by all the studies, were based on a subjective judgement of the extent of improvement of angina symptoms by individual clinicians, making the results somewhat unreliable. Another main outcome measure used was improvement in ECG, which may be a valuable diagnostic tool to evaluate the effects of cardiac drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Surawicz-B-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Surawicz B 2001</LINK>) but it is a surrogate measure. Furthermore, the current <LINK REF="REF-ACC_x002f_AHA-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACC/AHA 2002</LINK> guideline states that the treatment of chronic stable angina has two complementary objectives. These are to reduce the risk of mortality and morbid events and to reduce symptoms. From the patient's perspective, it is often the latter that is of greater concern. The definition of successful treatment of chronic stable angina, for most patients, should be complete or nearly complete elimination of anginal chest pain and return to normal activities and a functional capacity of CCS class I angina. This goal should be accomplished with minimal side effects of therapy. Unfortunately, neither mortality nor a more precise and objective symptom improvement outcome measure were used. Specific adverse effects were not adequately reported by any of the studies. We intend to adopt changes and improve the next updated version of this review.</P>
<P>(8) It is difficult to compare the outcomes of TCM with standard 'Western' clinical outcomes. TCHP outcomes rely on the subjective interpretation of experienced TCHP physicians in their observations. For example, in the examination of the pulse and tongue (mai xiang and she xiang respectively) outcomes are dependent on the expertise of the physicians and are usually classified in the three main domains of mild, medium and severe. TCM researchers and physicians need to establish a gold standard method for evaluating TCHP outcomes. <BR/>

<P>There were 28 studies for which we were unable to contact the authors to authenticate the RCT methodology. Some of these trials may have used adequate RCT methodology and may be included in this review in the future, perhaps leading to different results.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2010-04-06 12:35:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A research team published a meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2006</LINK>) and a subsequent quality assessment (<LINK REF="REF-Fan-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fan 2007</LINK>) on Dan Shen Di Wan (Compound salvia pellet, CSP) versus nitrates for treating stable angina. In that review, 27 articles were included and the quality was assessed using the Jadad scale. They found the following.</P>
<P>1. CSP significantly improved angina, compared with nitrates, in terms of angina symptoms (RR 1.13; 95% CI 1.07 to 1.20), electrocardiogram results (RR 1.39; 95% CI 1.28 to 1.50) and fewer adverse events (2.4% versus 29.7%) (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>2. The methodological quality of clinical trials needs to be improved (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2006</LINK>) as none of the studies conducted an ethics review or obtained informed consent and thus were not considered to be good enough to provide reliable evidence for clinical practice (<LINK REF="REF-Fan-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fan 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>The review used different criteria for inclusion of studies and as such may have found more favourable results than our systematic review.<BR/>

<P>There is currently insufficient evidence on the examined Chinese medicinal herbs for treating stable angina pectoris effectively, due to the small number of randomised controlled trials conducted and the paucity of patients enrolled in these trials. In addition, the safety of TCHP is unknown due to the lack of adequate date on adverse reactions. Therefore, TCM should be used with caution. We recommend that stronger evidence is obtained. <BR/>
</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-04-06 12:39:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is largely believed in China that TCM is beneficial in the treatment of stable angina pectoris, compared with routine western medicine. However, current clinical studies generally focus on the descriptive analysis of well-known and patented medicines and lack an analysis of TCHP compounds. Most TCHP physicians will choose the component medicinal herb from their own perspective, which makes summary analysis difficult. Finding new and effective agents and sufficient corresponding evidence is therefore difficult. It is necessary to have a clearer description of the medicinal herbal preparations being tested, including information on plant species, geographical origin, harvest season, preparation procedures and quality control measures.</P>
<P>It is of note that most trials are of low methodological quality and with small numbers of participants (mostly 60 to 80). There is a requirement for more studies with high methodological quality, large numbers of participants and good reporting to provide stronger evidence. Hopefully well-designed, randomised and multicentre, instead of sporadic, small-sampled and poorly-designed, clinical trials will be carried out in future. For most clinicians in China, allocation concealment should be emphasized and the approaches should be reported clearly. Another problem exists in the specific appearance and smell of TCHP, which may make blinding difficult. Drug types and routes should be consistent in both of the comparison groups and capsules may be a good answer to this problem.</P>
<P>Despite the outcome measures laid down according to TCM theory, clinical trials should include endpoints of death and major cardiovascular events and, from the patients' perspective, quality of life. Both require long-term follow up.</P>
<P>Future trials should use a standard risk-stratified population. Standardized monitoring or an effective reporting system should be adopted to critically estimate adverse events and the safety of specific preparations.<BR/>
