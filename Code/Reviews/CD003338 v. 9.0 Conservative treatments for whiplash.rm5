<P>Whiplash is defined as an acceleration-deceleration mechanism of energy transfer to the neck. It may result from rear-end or side-impact motor vehicle collisions or during diving, among other mishaps. </P>
<P>Whiplash-associated disorders (WAD) can be classified by the severity of signs and symptoms from Grade 0 (no complaints or physical signs) to Grade 4 (fracture or dislocation). Whiplash-associated disorders have been reported in 70 in 100,000 inhabitants in a Canadian province, to 188 to 325 per 100,000 inhabitants in The Netherlands. Conservative treatments (for example, physiotherapy, acupuncture, or a collar) are the most common treatment options for whiplash patients, but the evidence supporting their effectiveness remains conflicting.</P>
<P>We included 23 studies (2344 participants with WAD Grades 1 or 2), nine of which were new for this update. Overall, the methodological quality was poor and the studies included populations and interventions that were too different to pool. Two studies examined treatments for patients with chronic pain (longer than three months), two looked at subacute pain (four to six weeks), two were unclear (but one was probably chronic), and the rest looked at patients with acute symptoms of less than three weeks.</P>
<P>In 11 studies, an active treatment approach (treatment strategy including exercises or advice to 'act as usual') was compared to a passive strategy, no treatment or was an additional treatment. Eight studies compared an active intervention with a passive one (the patient received a treatment such as advice to rest and wear a neck collar, an educational video, electrotherapy, manipulation, hot and cold packs, traction, or acupuncture). Eight studies compared an intervention with a placebo or no treatment. In seven studies, two active treatments were compared against each other and in one, a passive intervention was compared to injections.</P>
<P>Since we were unable to pool any of the studies, we remain unable to either support or refute the effects of conservative treatments for acute, subacute or chronic whiplash-associated disorders with the current evidence.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Many treatments are available for whiplash patients but there is little scientific evidence for their accepted use. Patients with whiplash-associated disorders (WAD) can be classified by the severity of signs and symptoms from Grade 0 (no complaints or physical signs) to Grade 4 (fracture or dislocation). </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effectiveness of conservative treatment for patients with whiplash injuries rated as Grades 1 or 2 (neck and musculoskeletal complaints).</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, 2006, Issue 3), MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and PEDro to November 2006 and screened references of identified randomised trials and relevant systematic reviews. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We selected randomised controlled trials published in English, French, German or Dutch, that included patients with a whiplash-injury, conservative interventions, outcomes of pain, global perceived effect or participation in daily activities.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors independently assessed the methodological quality using the Delphi criteria and extracted the data onto standardised data-extraction forms. We did not pool the results because of the heterogeneity of the population, intervention and outcomes and lack of data. A pre-planned stratified analysis was performed for three different comparisons.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Twenty-three studies (2344 participants) were included in this update, including nine new studies. A broad variety of conservative interventions were evaluated. Two studies included patients with chronic symptoms (longer than three months), two included subacute (four to six weeks) symptoms, two had undefined duration of symptoms, and 17 studied patients with acute (less than three weeks) symptoms. Only eight studies (33.3%) satisfied one of our criteria of high quality, indicating overall, a poor methodological quality. Interventions were divided into passive (such as rest, immobilisation, ultrasound, etc) and active interventions (such as exercises, act as usual approach, etc.) and were compared with no treatment, a placebo or each other. </P>
<P>Clinical and statistical heterogeneity and lack of data precluded pooling. Individual studies demonstrated effectiveness of one treatment over another, but the comparisons were varied and results inconsistent. Therefore, the evidence neither supports nor refutes the effectiveness of either passive or active treatments to relieve the symptoms of WAD, Grades 1 or 2. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The current literature is of poor methodological quality and is insufficiently homogeneous to allow the pooling of results. Therefore, clearly effective treatments are not supported at this time for the treatment of acute, subacute or chronic symptoms of whiplash-associated disorders.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-05-26 12:17:42 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Until recently, there was no consensus on the definition of whiplash. The term whiplash was used to describe a mechanism of injury, the injury itself, the various clinical manifestations that developed as a consequence of the injury, and signs and symptoms designated as 'the whiplash syndrome'. In 1995, the Quebec Task Force (QTF) on Whiplash Associated Disorders (WAD) adopted the following definition of whiplash: "<I>Whiplash is an acceleration- deceleration mechanism of energy transfer to the neck. It may result from rear-end or side-impact motor vehicle collisions, but can also occur during diving or other mishaps. The impact may result in bony or soft-tissue injuries (whiplash-injury), which in turn may lead to a variety of clinical manifestations called Whiplash-Associated Disorders</I>" (<LINK REF="REF-Spitzer-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spitzer 1995</LINK>). Patients with whiplash can be classified by the severity of signs and symptoms: Grade 0 means no complaints or physical signs; Grade 1 indicates neck complaints (such as pain, tenderness and stiffness) but no physical signs; Grade 2 indicates neck complaints and musculoskeletal signs (such as a decreased range of motion or muscle weakness); Grades 3 and Grade 4 indicate neck complaints and neurological signs (such as sensory deficit) or fracture or dislocation, respectively. Research (<LINK REF="REF-Hildingsson-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hildingsson 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Norris-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norris 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Radanov-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Radanov 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stovner-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stovner 1996</LINK>) revealed that the most commonly presented symptoms in the acute phase following a motor vehicle collision were neck pain (88% to 100%) and headache (54% to 66%). Other symptoms were neck stiffness, shoulder pain, arm pain or numbness, or both, paraesthesia, weakness, dysphagia, visual and auditory symptoms, dizziness and concentration difficulties (<LINK REF="REF-Scholten_x002d_Peeters-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scholten-Peeters 2003</LINK>). The causal mechanism of an organic lesion as a result of an injury or the clinical manifestations are not widely accepted (<LINK REF="REF-Barnsley-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnsley 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bogduk-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bogduk 1986</LINK>). It is controversial as to whether chronic pain and disability can be solely related to an organic lesion or musculoskeletal signs, or both. These complaints do not explain prolonged symptoms and disabilities in daily activities (<LINK REF="REF-Stovner-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stovner 1996</LINK>). Other factors, such as expectation of pain (<LINK REF="REF-Kasch-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kasch 2000</LINK>) and type of compensation system (<LINK REF="REF-Cassidy-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cassidy 2000</LINK>) may also play a role in long-term complaints.</P>
<P>The incidence of whiplash injury varies greatly between different parts of the world, with rates as high as 70 per 100,000 inhabitants in Quebec (<LINK REF="REF-Spitzer-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spitzer 1995</LINK>), 106 per 100,000 in Australia (<LINK REF="REF-Miles-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miles 1988</LINK>) and 188 to 325 per 100,000 inhabitants in the Netherlands (<LINK REF="REF-Wismans-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wismans 1994</LINK>). There is no agreement in the literature about the natural course and epidemiology of whiplash injury (<LINK REF="REF-Barnsley-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnsley 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Freeman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freeman 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spitzer-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spitzer 1995</LINK>). The Quebec Task Force's statement that whiplash injuries have 'favourable prognosis' and their conclusion that 87% and 97% of the patients recovered from their injury at six months and 12 months after the vehicle collision, respectively, is questionable. The authors defined 'recovery' as cessation of time-loss compensation. Whether these patients still had pain or discomfort and needed medical care was not reported. A review contradicted the QTF's conclusions that most whiplash injuries were short-lived (<LINK REF="REF-Barnsley-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnsley 1994</LINK>). These authors concluded that between 14% and 42% of the whiplash patients developed chronic complaints (longer than six months), and that 10% of those had constant severe pain. Internationally, the proportion of chronic complaints varies between two per cent and 58% (<LINK REF="REF-Cot_x00e9_-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coté 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scholten_x002d_Peeters-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scholten-Peeters 2003</LINK>), but lies mainly between 20% and 40%.</P>
<P>The effectiveness of conservative interventions for patients with WAD is still under debate (<LINK REF="REF-Aker-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aker 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seferiadis-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seferiadis 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spitzer-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spitzer 1995</LINK>). A lot of research has been done about the effect of treatment options that cover a wide range of conservative care: local heat and ice treatment, neck collar immobilization, ultrasound, traction, massage, (active) mobilization, exercises, pulsed electromagnetic therapy, multimodal rehabilitation, etc. Our previous review showed that there was little evidence for their 'accepted' use. Recently, nine new trials were found and this review was updated to see whether these new trials would enlarge the body of knowledge concerning the effectiveness of widely used interventions.</P>
<P>In this review we focus on WAD Grades 1 and 2 because these concern the major group of whiplash patients and these patients normally receive conservative interventions. The primary research question is: What types of conservative treatments are effective in patients with WAD Grades 1 and 2 regarding pain, global perceived effect or participation in daily activities? A second research question is: What is the difference in the efficacy of these treatments between patients with acute and chronic whiplash symptoms?</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The aim of this systematic review was to analyse the efficacy of conservative treatment options for patients with WAD Grades 1 and 2. </P>

<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>A study was included if the design was a randomised controlled trial (RCT). </P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>A study was included if the study population included patients that suffered from a whiplash injury classified as WAD Grades 1 or 2, meaning patients with neck complaints with or without musculoskeletal signs. </P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>A study was included if the intervention was a conservative one. A conservative intervention was defined as any non-invasive, non-surgical form of treatment. Drug treatments were excluded. </P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>A study was included if pain, global perceived effect or participation in daily activities were one of the outcome measures. These were the main outcome measures of the review and were chosen with reference to the whiplash problem (<LINK REF="REF-Stovner-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stovner 1996</LINK>) and by considering that they could be influenced by conservative treatment strategies. Data on other outcome measures, such as well-being, disability or adverse effects were also considered when mentioned in the studies.</P>

<SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2008-05-26 14:11:59 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, 2006, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1966 to November 2006), CINAHL (1982 to November 2006), PsycINFO (November 2006), PEDro (November 2006) databases, and reference lists of relevant RCTs and reviews.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Study selection</HEADING>
<P>For this update, two authors (AV and SvW) independently reviewed the titles and abstracts of the identified articles to determine potential relevance. The same two authors independently applied all selection criteria to the full text of the articles that had passed the first eligibility screening. Disagreements were solved by consensus (100%) and if necessary, by a third party (GGMSP).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Methodological Quality Assessment</HEADING>
<P>Pairs of two authors (GGMSP, SvW or RAdB) independently assessed the methodological quality of the studies using the Delphi criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Verhagen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verhagen 1998</LINK>). Depending on information available, criteria were marked 'yes', 'no', or 'don't know'. In cases of disagreement, another author (APV) made a final decision. The assessment was not performed under masked conditions since the authors were familiar with many of the trials, and there is no consensus whether assessment should be blinded for authors, institutions, journal, publication year and results (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Verhagen-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verhagen 1998b</LINK>). Equal weights were applied to all Delphi criteria. Items scoring a 'yes' contributed to the quality scores, ranging from zero to 10.</P>
<P>We choose to use the Delphi criteria for quality assessment in this update because we found that these criteria appeared to be as reliable as the Maastricht-Amsterdam criteria but easier to use (<LINK REF="REF-Verhagen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verhagen 2000</LINK>). The Delphi criteria are listed in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction</HEADING>
<P>Pairs of two authors (GGMSP, RAdB or SvW) extracted the data from each study into a pre-formatted table. Information on clinical relevance items such as detailed information on treatments, patient's characteristics and outcome measures were also extracted.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Analysis </HEADING>
<P>A quality score was calculated by adding the Delphi criteria that scored positive, resulting in a score ranging from 0 to 10. In an attempt to address the observation that the use of different criteria to assess quality might effect the conclusions of a systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1996</LINK>), we defined 'high' quality studies in two ways: 1) studies that reported a concealed randomisation procedure and adequate blinding, or 2) a positive score on at least six (more than 50%) Delphi criteria.</P>
<P>We calculated inter-observer reliability of the quality assessment using IntraClass Correlation Coefficients (ICC). ICCs greater than 0.7 are considered to indicate good agreement, between 0.5 and 0.7 moderate, and less than 0.5 poor agreement (<LINK REF="REF-Landis-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Landis 1977</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quantitative analysis</HEADING>
<P>The outcome measures are presented separately for each comparison (see Graphs). For dichotomous data, results are expressed, if possible, as relative risks (RR) with corresponding 95 per cent confidence intervals (95% CI), and as weighted (WMD) or standardised mean differences (SMD) with 95% CI for continuous data. MetaView (RevMan 2000) was used to analyse the data. Pooling was not implemented, as studies were considered clinically heterogeneous for both the study population and intervention.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Qualitative analysis</HEADING>
<P>When data were lacking but the trials were clinically homogeneous, we had planned to analyse the results using levels of evidence (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 2003</LINK>). The five levels of evidence take into account the study design, methodological quality and direction for each outcome for each comparison across studies and are defined as:<BR/>1) <B>Strong evidence</B>: consistent findings among multiple (two or more) high quality RCTs;<BR/>2) <B>Moderate evidence</B>: one high quality RCT or consistent findings among multiple (two or more) low quality RCTs;<BR/>3) <B>Limited evidence</B>: one low quality RCT;<BR/>4) <B>Conflicting evidence</B>: inconsistent findings among multiple RCTs;<BR/>5) <B>No evidence</B>: no RCTs found.</P>
<P>Findings were to be considered consistent when over 75% of the studies come to the same conclusion (<LINK REF="REF-Smidt-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smidt 2002</LINK>). Because of clinical heterogeneity, we also did not pool the results from studies qualitatively.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Clinical relevance</HEADING>
<P>Clinically relevant improvement was defined as a 15% improvement relative to a control. A relative percentage difference (RPD) as defined by the Philadelphia Panel on Rehabilitation Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Philadelphia-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Philadelphia 2001</LINK>) of greater than 15% indicates clinical importance. RPD was calculated as the absolute benefit divided by the average of the baseline means (weighted for the treatment and control groups). Absolute benefit was calculated as the improvement in the experimental group less the improvement in the control group, in the original units.</P>

Two new studies included subacute patients with complaints that had been present for at least four to six weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Bunketorp-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bunketorp 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scholten_x002d_Peeters2006" TYPE="STUDY">Scholten-Peeters2006</LINK>), while <LINK REF="STD-Provinciali-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Provinciali 1996</LINK> included patients with a combination of acute and subacute pain that was less than two months in duration. The rest of the studies included patients with acute whiplash, with pain that was less than three weeks in duration. Studies varied considerably with respect to study population; factors like previous whiplash injury, history of headaches or neck pain prior to the crash, sort of collision, etc, varied. In the literature, these factors are seen as important prognostic factors and are associated with a delayed recovery (<LINK REF="REF-Scholten_x002d_Peeters-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scholten-Peeters 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spitzer-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spitzer 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stovner-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stovner 1996</LINK>).</P>

<P>The outcome measures that were used changed from pain and cervical range of motion (ROM) in studies up to 1995, to pain and days off work or state of health in studies published after 1995.</P>
<P>Most studies presented the data poorly, if at all, which made it impossible to calculate relative risks or weighted mean differences for most outcome measures.</P>
<P>Overall, most new studies included in this update (<LINK REF="STD-Aigne-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Aigne 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Crawford-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Crawford 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Florio-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Florio 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oliveira-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Oliveira 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-S_x00f6_derlund-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Söderlund 2001a</LINK>) did not perform better on methodological quality assessment than the studies in the previous review. However, the second and third publications from Rosenfeld et al as and the most recent publication from Schnabel et al met more of the Delphi criteria than earlier publications by the same study teams (<LINK REF="STD-Rosenfeld-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenfeld 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schnabel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Schnabel 2004</LINK>).</P>

<P>The interobserver reliability of the overall methodological quality assessment (ICC = 0.73) can be described as 'good'. Disagreements occurred mainly because of reading errors and differences in interpretation of the methodological criteria. The quality assessments resulted in a hierarchical list in which higher scores indicated higher methodological quality, that is, more of the Delphi criteria were met.</P>
<P>Five studies were assessed to be high quality based on the first criterion: presented a concealed randomisation procedure and adequate blinding (<LINK REF="STD-Brison-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Brison 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bunketorp-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bunketorp 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosenfeld-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenfeld 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schnabel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Schnabel 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scholten_x002d_Peeters2006" TYPE="STUDY">Scholten-Peeters2006</LINK>). Eight studies met six or more Delphi criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Borchgrevink-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Borchgrevink 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brison-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Brison 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bunketorp-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bunketorp 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ferrari-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ferrari 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Foley_x002d_Nolan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Foley-Nolan 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Provinciali-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Provinciali 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scholten_x002d_Peeters2006" TYPE="STUDY">Scholten-Peeters2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schnabel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Schnabel 2004</LINK>), and therefore were considered high quality because of the second criterion. The mean score was 4.7 points, which still corresponds with an overall poor methodological quality, but is higher compared to the last version of this review (3.6).</P>
<P>The most prevalent shortcomings of the trials concerned: no description of the randomisation procedure; no description of blinding, poor data presentation and no proper analysis (intention-to-treat). Most authors failed to describe which method of randomisation was used. Two studies used the word random but their treatment allocation could not be regarded as appropriate (<LINK REF="STD-Oliveira-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Oliveira 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pennie-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Pennie 1990</LINK>).

<P>One high quality study (<LINK REF="STD-Foley_x002d_Nolan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Foley-Nolan 1992</LINK>, n = 40) reported that PEMT (Pulsed ElectroMagnetic Therapy) was more effective than placebo for reducing pain (Relative Risk (RR) 0.23; 95%confidence interval (CI): 0.08 to 0.69) and improving 'subjective assessment of progress' (or 'perceived effect') in patients with an acute whiplash injury (less than 72 hours) at two and four weeks. By the end of the 12-week intervention period, the effects were no longer significant (RR 0.38; 95%CI: 0.12 to 1.21). However, the groups were not comparable at baseline with respect to previous whiplash injury; 20% of the patients in the experimental group compared to five per cent of the patients in the control group had previous whiplash injury.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-05-26 12:17:20 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The overall quality of the included studies was poor and clinical and statistical heterogeneity did not allow us to pool the results. Therefore, we conclude that there is still conflicting evidence as to whether active or passive treatments are more effective for treating acute, subacute or chronic whiplash-associated disorders. </P>
<P>The value of this review depends on the success of obtaining reports on all RCT's conducted in this area. There are some indications that small clinical trials with negative results are not as easily published as positive trials (<LINK REF="REF-Dickersin-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickersin 1987</LINK>). Some relevant studies, referenced in unknown databases or difficult to locate or retrieve, may not be included. So, publication bias could be a threat to the validity of this review. </P>
<P>Relying on the information in the written report may create bias due to misclassification (<LINK REF="REF-Verhagen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verhagen 2001</LINK>). In an attempt to address the influence of using different criteria to assess quality on the conclusion of the systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1996</LINK>), we used two different approaches to define 'high' quality studies. In this review, we considered a study to be high quality when it presented a concealed randomisation procedure and adequate blinding, or met six or more of the Delphi criteria. Five studies fulfilled the first criteria and eight the second, with an overlap of four studies. <LINK REF="STD-Rosenfeld-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenfeld 2000</LINK> met the first criteria of concealed randomisation and adequate blinding, but only met five of the Delphi criteria. The methodological quality of the majority of the trials was disappointingly low. </P>
<P>Ten studies compared an active treatment with an inactive one and most low quality trials found evidence in favour of the active treatment. Our conclusions that there is still conflicting evidence about whether active treatments are more effective than inactive treatments is independent of the criteria used to determine high quality. A sensitivity analysis of the results that does not consider the quality of the study results in stronger support of individual active treatments, but because of clinical and statistical heterogeneity that prevents pooling, evidence must still be regarded as conflicting. </P>
<P>Most studies failed to describe a concealed treatment allocation procedure, although this is considered to be of the utmost importance (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1999</LINK>). But even when an adequate randomisation procedure has been carried out, there is no guarantee of an equal distribution of prognostic factors and confounding variables among the groups, particularly when the sample size is small (<LINK REF="REF-Windt-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Windt 1995</LINK>). The groups were comparable for relevant prognostic factors in 14 studies. Description of any blinding procedures was absent in 14 studies. Blinding is also considered to be important to obtain unbiased reporting of effects (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>), but in these studies, patients and care providers could not easily be blinded, given the kind of interventions (e.g. exercises). </P>
<P>Another potential source of bias might be the broad inclusion criteria we used; whiplash-patients with WAD Grades 1 and 2 and a described duration of the symptoms. We did not use a strict definition of whiplash, because until recently there has been no agreement on its definition. Most of the articles did not describe what they meant by the whiplash injury. In order to get a more homogeneous population, we excluded patients who had whiplash with neurological signs, fractures, dislocations or some combination of the three (WAD Grades 3 and 4). The time interval between the injury that caused the whiplash and inclusion in the trial ranged from 24 hours (<LINK REF="STD-Brison-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Brison 2005</LINK>) to three months (<LINK REF="STD-Florio-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Florio 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-S_x00f6_derlund-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Söderlund 2001a</LINK>). Some authors did not describe the duration of the disorder (<LINK REF="STD-Mealy-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Mealy 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pennie-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Pennie 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thuile-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Thuile 2002</LINK>). In most studies, the setting of recruitment was the Accident and Emergency Department of a Hospital. <LINK REF="STD-Fitz_x002d_Ritson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Fitz-Ritson 1995</LINK> recruited their patients from chiropractic centres, while <LINK REF="STD-Scholten_x002d_Peeters2006" TYPE="STUDY">Scholten-Peeters2006</LINK> recruited patients of General Practitioners. Moreover, the exclusion criteria varied considerably across the studies. These broad selection criteria increased the risk for heterogeneity and made the interpretation of the results more difficult.</P>
<P>In this review, we focused on three primary outcome measures: pain, global perceived effect and participation in daily activities. Pain or recovery was used as an outcome measure in all studies. In early studies, the main measures of effect were physical outcome measures: pain and cervical range of motion. However, in studies reported after 1995, measurements such as time off work and 'state of health' were also used. Similar to other physical disorders (e.g. non-specific low back pain), outcome measurement should be seen in multidimensional terms. Psychological and social factors have been shown to have consequences for mental state and quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-S_x00f6_derlund-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Söderlund 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Waddell-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waddell 1998</LINK>). This broader perspective introduced the bio-psychosocial model to the medical world. In the bio-psychosocial model, the focus is not only on pain, but also on disabilities in daily activities and pain coping strategies. The goal of treatment is not only pain relief, but also to help patients continue with their normal lives. Individual beliefs and psychological distress might influence pain and disability and the way patients will respond to treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Waddell-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waddell 1998</LINK>). Therefore, we believe that besides physical outcomes, aspects like patients' beliefs, coping strategies, locus of control and ability to perform activities of daily living should also be measured. Given the unknown natural course of the whiplash injury, and the range of chronic complaints and problems with daily activities, future trials should have a follow-up of at least six months, and preferably 12 months. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Given the current evidence, no clear conclusions can be drawn about the most effective therapy for patients with acute, subacute or chronic whiplash-associated disorders, Grades 1 or 2. There is a trend that active interventions are probably more effective than passive interventions, but no clear conclusion can be drawn. <BR/> </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>1. Large, high quality research trials are needed, focusing on appropriate allocation concealment, blinding and adequate data presentation and analysis. The design and reporting of future trials should conform to the CONSORT-statement. <BR/>2. New research should measure outcomes relevant to the patients and responsive to the treatment under study. Follow-up should be of sufficient length to assess long-term effects. <BR/>3. New research reports should provide full data on outcome measures, including the means and standard deviation or 95% confidence interval.<BR/>4. Future research should examine the effect of active treatments not only in pragmatic trials, comparing various interventions with each other, but also in more explanatory trials, comparing the intervention with no treatment. <BR/>5. Future research should focus on chronic whiplash patients because there are a broad variety of treatments available, most treatments are costly, and data on effectiveness are not available.</P>
<P>We conclude that performing randomised studies with high methodological quality concerning the effectiveness of active treatments or other frequently performed treatments is both possible and necessary to provide strong evidence on the effectiveness of treatments for whiplash-associated disorders.</P>
