<P>A new search was performed in February 2011 and brought up to date prior to publication in June 2011. No new studies were found and the conclusions remain unchanged. The previous review identified an ongoing study that has now been completed (<LINK REF="STD-Cook-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cook 2007</LINK>). It is now 'awaiting classification' as efforts to obtain data from author contact have been unsuccessful to date.</P>
<P>The review was converted to new RevMan 5 format and the 'Risk of bias' tables were completed.</P>
<P>The Discussion section has been revised to include the results of a 2009 survey of clinical practice (<LINK REF="REF-Rolley-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rolley 2010</LINK>) and a recently published nursing clinical practice guideline for people undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Rolley-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rolley 2011</LINK>).

<TITLE>Pain relief for removal of femoral sheath after cardiac procedures</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-08-08 16:01:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Procedures for the non-surgical management of coronary heart disease include balloon angioplasty (mechanically widening a narrowed or obstructed blood vessel) and intracoronary stenting (a device to support the blood vessel to keep it open). At the start of each procedure an introducer sheath is inserted through the skin (percutaneously) into an artery, frequently a femoral artery in the groin. This allows the different catheters used for the procedure to be exchanged easily without causing trauma to the skin. At the end of the procedure the sheath is removed and, if the puncture site is not 'sealed' using a device closure, firm pressure is required over the site for 30 minutes or more to control any bleeding and reduce vascular complications. Removing the sheath and the firm pressure required to control bleeding can cause pain, although this is generally mild. Some centres routinely give pain relief before removal, such as intravenous morphine, or an injection of a local anaesthetic in the soft tissue around the sheath (called a subcutaneous injection). Adequate pain control during sheath removal is also associated with a reduced incidence of a vasovagal reaction, a potentially serious complication involving a sudden drop of blood pressure and a slowed heart rate.</P>
<P>In this systematic review of randomised controlled trials four studies were reviewed. Three studies involving 498 participants compared subcutaneous lignocaine, a short-acting local anaesthetic, with a control group (participants received either no pain relief or an inactive substance known as a placebo). Two studies involving 399 people compared intravenous opioids (fentanyl or morphine) and an anxiolytic (midazolam) with a control group. One study involving 60 people compared subcutaneous levobupivacaine, a long-acting local anaesthetic, with a control group. Intravenous pain regimens and subcutaneous levobupivacaine appear to reduce the pain experienced during femoral sheath removal. However, the size of the reduction was small. A significant reduction in pain was not experienced by participants who received subcutaneous lignocaine or who were in the control group. There were insufficient data to determine a correlation between pain relief administration and either adverse events or complications. Some patients may benefit from routine pain relief using levobupivacaine or intravenous pain regimens. Identifying who may potentially benefit from pain relief requires clinical judgement and consideration of patient preference. The mild level of pain generally experienced during this procedure should not influence the decision as some people can experience moderate levels of pain with the conventional wound care.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-08-08 15:44:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Four studies involving 971 participants were included. All results were reported using a zero to 10 pain scale. Three studies (four treatment arms) involving 498 participants compared subcutaneous lignocaine with control with no significant difference between pain scores; MD 0.12 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.46 to 0.69). Two studies (three treatment arms) involving 399 participants compared intravenous pain regimens with control. A significant reduction in pain score was observed with intravenous opioid and anxiolytic; MD -0.90 (95% CI -1.54 to -0.27). One study involving 60 participants compared levobupivacaine with placebo. Longer-acting local anaesthetic significantly lowered the pain score by a MD of -1.10 (95% CI -1.26 to -0.94). The data are insufficient to identify any influence of pain regimens on vascular and procedural complication rates. No studies reported appropriate blinding for all treatment arms. The largest study, comprising 661 participants, was unblinded with a quality score of two out of five.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-08-08 16:00:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>No new studies have been found since the last version of this review and the conclusions therefore remain the same. Intravenous pain regimens and levobupivacaine may have greater efficacy when compared to control for the management of pain related to femoral sheath removal. However, a definitive study is still required because the clinical difference is small. There is no evidence to support the use of subcutaneous lignocaine. There is insufficient evidence to determine if pain relief influences the rate of complications. One new study has been included as a 'study awaiting assessment' as we await further information from the study authors.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2011-08-08 16:38:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-08-08 15:44:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review is an update of a previously published review in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Issue 4, 2008) on 'Pain relief for the removal of femoral sheath in interventional cardiology adult patients' (<LINK REF="REF-Wensley-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wensley 2008</LINK>).</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-08-08 15:44:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) is accepted management for coronary heart disease and includes coronary revascularisation procedures such as balloon angioplasty and intracoronary stenting (<LINK REF="REF-Levine-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levine 2003</LINK>). During PCI, catheters needed to dilate or stent the stenosed artery are inserted into the coronary artery via an introducer sheath. The sheath is inserted percutaneously into the femoral, brachial or radial artery and provides support at the site, reducing potential trauma as catheters are exchanged. Introducer sheaths are frequently located in the femoral artery and are removed after the procedure, at which time haemostasis at the percutaneous access site is achieved. The arterial site can be 'sealed' using a collagen plug, internal suturing device or liquid synthetic thrombin instillations (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 1997</LINK>). Frequently, haemostasis is achieved by firm compression of the femoral artery using manual or assisted manual pressure, such as the C-Clamp or Femo-Stop, to control bleeding.</P>
<P>Pain or discomfort with femoral sheath removal is experienced by virtually all non-medicated and most medicated patients to some degree (<LINK REF="REF-Benson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fulton-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Fulton 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lambert-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lambert 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Puntillo-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Puntillo 2001</LINK>). This is likely to be caused by a combination of the discomfort of the removal of the sheath and the firm pressure required to achieve haemostasis. Pain intensity scores indicate that the amount of procedural distress caused by femoral sheath removal is relatively mild (<LINK REF="REF-Benson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bowden-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bowden 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fulton-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Fulton 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lambert-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lambert 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Puntillo-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Puntillo 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wadas-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wadas 1998</LINK>). For example, using a Numeric Rating Score (zero to 10), with higher numbers meaning greater pain intensity, patients rated femoral sheath removal with mean pain intensity scores of 2.7 ± 3.0 (<LINK REF="REF-Puntillo-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Puntillo 2001</LINK>). Pre-procedure 30% (775 out of 2574) had received lignocaine before sheath removal and 25.2% (651 out of 2574) received opioids pre-procedure. However, in another study, 8% of patients (11/130) required rescue analgesia for breakthrough pain despite some of these patients having received pain relief before the procedure (<LINK REF="STD-Fulton-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Fulton 2000</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-08-08 15:44:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Internationally, analgesic regimens for the relief of pain or discomfort of femoral sheath removal have varied considerably. A 2004 survey of current practice for patients undergoing PCI across Australia and New Zealand reported 17 variations in analgesic regimens administered before sheath removal (<LINK REF="REF-Sanders-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanders 2005</LINK>). Commonly used pain relief includes intravenous morphine, midazolam, diazepam, fentanyl and subcutaneous lignocaine infiltrated at the femoral site with or without intravenous morphine. Some regimens also include small doses of antiemetics or atropine, or both, to prevent vasovagal reactions which may accompany the pain associated with removal and compression (<LINK REF="REF-Botti-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Botti 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bowden-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bowden 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fulton-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Fulton 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lambert-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lambert 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Puntillo-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Puntillo 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wadas-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wadas 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vish-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Vish 2001</LINK>). Some centres do not routinely administer pain relief (<LINK REF="REF-Botti-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Botti 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bowden-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bowden 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sanders-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanders 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wadas-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wadas 1998</LINK>).</P>

<P>Inadequate pain control during sheath removal is associated with increased risk of vascular complications and, in addition to promoting patient comfort, the prevention of vascular complications is frequently cited as rationale for the administration of analgesia. Complications associated with femoral sheath removal include bleeding, haematoma and pseudoaneurysm (<LINK REF="STD-Fulton-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Fulton 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lambert-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lambert 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mager-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mager 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Grady-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Grady 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peet-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peet 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rubin-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubin 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Timlin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Timlin 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vish-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Vish 2001</LINK>). The impact of pain relief on moderating these complications is unclear but pain relief is believed to increase the patient's tolerance to firm groin compression so that risk is reduced. Known risk factors for vascular complications include increased age, female gender, high anticoagulant use, catheter size greater than 8 French and prolonged sheath time in the groin (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Pain and anxiety states are associated with increased vagal tone and consequently common opinion has been that the pain of sheath removal can trigger a vasovagal reaction in some patients (<LINK REF="STD-Lambert-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lambert 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Grady-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Grady 2002</LINK>). This reaction consists of symptomatic bradycardia, hypotension, nausea and vomiting (<LINK REF="REF-Boss-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boss 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mager-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mager 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rama-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rama 1997</LINK>). Although usually self limiting, vasovagal reactions can have severe consequences in patients undergoing PCI including serious arrhythmias, severe hypotension, abrupt closure of the dilated artery, and myocardial ischaemia or infarction (<LINK REF="REF-Ilia-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ilia 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mager-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mager 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rama-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rama 1997</LINK>). The use of vagolytic medication after angioplasty, particularly in patients at risk, has been supported (<LINK REF="REF-Mager-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mager 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rama-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rama 1997</LINK>). The documented incidence of a vasovagal reaction following femoral sheath removal is variable. <LINK REF="STD-Fulton-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Fulton 2000</LINK> established that 6% (8/130) of patients experienced a vasovagal event and 8% (10/130) had nausea or vomiting during the sheath procedure.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-08-08 15:44:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As with all medications, analgesic regimens currently used for femoral sheath removal can have adverse outcomes and currently the risks versus the benefits of pain relief for femoral sheath removal are unclear. Even in therapeutic doses, side effects of morphine include nausea, vomiting, drowsiness and confusion (<LINK REF="REF-MIMS-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">MIMS 2004</LINK>). Adverse allergic reactions to local anaesthetic are frequently reported (<LINK REF="REF-Berkun-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berkun 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gall-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gall 1996</LINK>), although evaluation at allergy clinics indicates that true allergies are rare (<LINK REF="REF-Macy-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macy 2003</LINK>). Accidental intravascular administration of local anaesthetic can be a serious complication, resulting in cardiovascular toxicity if large amounts are absorbed (<LINK REF="REF-Achar-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Achar 2002</LINK>). Unbuffered subcutaneous lignocaine is associated with reports of stinging (<LINK REF="STD-Lambert-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lambert 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vish-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Vish 2001</LINK>). Repeated injections are associated with discomfort as well as the increased risk of infection (<LINK REF="STD-Lambert-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lambert 1996</LINK>). However, a competent technique can minimise the discomfort of infiltration (<LINK REF="REF-Achar-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Achar 2002</LINK>) and we have found no literature to support the association of infection with lignocaine infiltration. As with all medication, analgesic regimens incur costs associated with the expense of the medication as well as preparation and administration time.</P>
<P>The relatively mild pain associated with femoral sheath removal, with or without pain relief, is a consistent finding across a number of studies (<LINK REF="REF-Benson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bowden-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bowden 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fulton-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Fulton 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Puntillo-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Puntillo 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wadas-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wadas 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vish-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Vish 2001</LINK>). Perceptions of and responses to procedural pain, such as with sheath removal, have a psychological and physiological basis (<LINK REF="REF-Puntillo-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Puntillo 2001</LINK>). Thorough patient preparation, including preparation about expected sensations and pre-procedural administration of analgesia, may assist in keeping pain intensity scores low. Certainly the sheath removal procedure is frequently protocol-driven and associated with a high level of operator education and preparation (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Grady-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Grady 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2001</LINK>). Additionally, as a one-off procedure the discomfort of sheath removal has no cumulative effect unlike repetitive painful procedures such as wound care, which have been associated with higher pain scores (<LINK REF="REF-Puntillo-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Puntillo 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>The practice variation observed in analgesia use for femoral sheath removal is likely to continue until the efficacy of analgesia, and its impact on complications associated with this procedure, is better understood. The initial review concluded that there was evidence of efficacy with intravenous pain regimens and levobupivacaine, when compared to control, but the clinical significance was small and definitive studies were required. There was insufficient evidence to determine if pain relief influences the rate of complications. It is important that this review is updated to ensure that its conclusions and practice recommendations reflect all relevant research.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Vish-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Vish 2001</LINK> lacked standard deviations for the data that had been adjusted for co-intervention use.

However, standard deviations for the unadjusted 'no injection' and placebo group data were not available. These two groups had been combined to create one 'control group' in the published study. Attempts to obtain missing data from the author were unsuccessful and meta-analysis using the pooled control group data was unavoidable. There were inconsistencies in the published means for these data as the text reported mean pain scores of 2.9 for the saline group and 3.73 for control (<LINK REF="STD-Vish-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Vish 2001</LINK>, p49).

Femoral sheath removal was performed by medical (<LINK REF="STD-Fulton-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Fulton 2000</LINK>) or nursing staff (<LINK REF="STD-Kiat-Ang-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kiat Ang 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Timlin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Timlin 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vish-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Vish 2001</LINK>). In all participants sheaths were removed within four to six hours after the procedure.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Pain scores were evaluated using a zero to 100 Visual Analogue Score (VAS) (<LINK REF="STD-Fulton-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Fulton 2000</LINK>), a zero to 10 VAS scale (<LINK REF="STD-Kiat-Ang-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kiat Ang 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Timlin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Timlin 2005</LINK>) and zero to 10 hospital chest pain scale which is equivalent to an 11-point Numerical Rating Score (NRS).

<P>Real time assessment of pain during sheath removal occurred in two studies as follows: one minute and 20 minutes postremoval (<LINK REF="STD-Fulton-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Fulton 2000</LINK>); on C-Clamp application and 30 minutes postremoval (<LINK REF="STD-Vish-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Vish 2001</LINK>). The other studies collected data retrospectively. Pain data in the <LINK REF="STD-Kiat-Ang-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kiat Ang 2007</LINK> study were recorded as the worst episode of pain during sheath removal, and were measured after FemoStop removal. In <LINK REF="STD-Timlin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Timlin 2005</LINK>, patients were interviewed the following morning when pain scores were recorded for three time points: sheath insertion; waiting for removal; and sheath removal. Patients were asked how painful the process of sheath removal was therefore pain score data would reflect pain experienced from both the withdrawal of the sheath and any subsequent pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Leslie-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leslie 2006</LINK>).</P>

<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Fulton-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Fulton 2000</LINK>, the subcutaneous lignocaine intervention was prepared and administered by the outcome assessor, and did not have a matched placebo. The <LINK REF="STD-Vish-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Vish 2001</LINK> study had two blinded subcutaneous treatment arms and one matched placebo. However, there was the potential for un-blinding as the syringes were identified by a simple code that, if broken, could identify the active study intervention for future participants. No treatment assignments were blinded in <LINK REF="STD-Kiat-Ang-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kiat Ang 2007</LINK>.

The placebo arms may, therefore, have resulted in an underestimation of the effect of the active interventions used in the included studies. Conversely, no expectation of pain relief administration may result in an increased perception of pain in an unblinded control group. Certainly, higher than expected mean pain scores have been observed when pain relief has not been given before sheath removal in a research setting (<LINK REF="REF-Mlekusch-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mlekusch 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vish-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Vish 2001</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Timing of pain score measurements</HEADING>
<P>Determining the exact time of pain score measurement and whether participants were receiving compression at the time was problematic. This issue was compounded by the use of retrospective pain measurement. The timing of pain measurement is of particular relevance as pain and discomfort associated with femoral sheath removal is time-dependent (<LINK REF="REF-Chlan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chlan 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fulton-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Fulton 2000</LINK>). An increase in pain score is experienced at one minute from baseline with return to baseline levels occurring at 10 minutes and to minimal levels 10 minutes after release of compression. The pain on C-Clamp application (<LINK REF="STD-Vish-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Vish 2001</LINK>) and at one minute (<LINK REF="STD-Fulton-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Fulton 2000</LINK>) would represent the most painful part of the procedure. Pain data in the <LINK REF="STD-Kiat-Ang-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kiat Ang 2007</LINK> study were stated as representing the worst episode of pain during sheath removal. Meta-analysis was considered appropriate for data from these time points as it was judged to reflect the most painful part of the procedure.</P>
<P>Both the <LINK REF="STD-Kiat-Ang-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kiat Ang 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Timlin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Timlin 2005</LINK> studies used retrospective pain data measurements. There is some evidence that indicates that patients remember the worst part of the pain and the final part of the procedure (<LINK REF="REF-Redelmeier-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Redelmeier 1996</LINK>) and that patient recall of acute painful procedures is accurate for at least one week (<LINK REF="REF-Singer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singer 2001</LINK>). However, it is noted that pain measured using patient recall may not accurately describe the pain experienced at the time of the procedure. The possible impact on the treatment effect from retrospective outcome measurements is unclear.</P>
<P>Two studies measured pain scores while the participants were receiving compression (<LINK REF="STD-Fulton-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Fulton 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vish-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Vish 2001</LINK>) but this could not be clearly ascertained in the <LINK REF="STD-Timlin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Timlin 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kiat-Ang-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kiat Ang 2007</LINK> studies.

<P>As no new studies have been found the findings from the last version of this review remain unchanged.</P>
<P>A statistically significant reduction in pain score was observed with the intravenous pain regimen when compared with control; mean difference (MD) -0.90 (95% confidence interval (CI) -1.54 to -0.27). A statistically significant reduction of 1.10 in pain score was also observed in the primary study comparing levobupivacaine with control; MD -1.10 (95% CI -1.26 to -0.94). Data from the meta-analysis were insufficient to assess the hypothesis that administration of pain relief reduces the incidence of vascular or other complications associated with femoral sheath removal because very few complications were recorded. It was not possible to determine whether the type of pain relief influenced the incidence of complications as either complication data were not available per intervention, or measurements were inconsistent between studies. Multivariate logistic regression analysis in one study identified a higher pain score (odds ratio (OR) 1.18, 95% CI 1.12 -1.24, P = 0.001), use of glyceryl trinitrate during sheath removal, a low body mass index, and the left anterior descending artery as the treated vessel as independent predictors of the occurrence of a vasovagal reaction (<LINK REF="STD-Kiat-Ang-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kiat Ang 2007</LINK>). There was no evidence of a relationship between infiltration of local anaesthetic and adverse events but the numbers of adverse events were small.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-08-08 15:47:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The effectiveness of pain regimens is dependent on a number of independent variables that may impact on the experience of pain associated with femoral sheath removal. These may include the expertise of the clinician administering the lignocaine and the length of time waited for it to take effect, the effectiveness of general comfort measures, the level of participant preparation and the participant's expectation of pain, the expertise and confidence of the person pulling the sheath, prior experience of the participant and the environment in which the procedure is performed. Many of these variables were not reported in the primary studies.</P>
<P>The generally mild to moderate pain experienced by the participants make the impact of any intervention more difficult to evaluate (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 1997</LINK>). In addition, interpretation of the clinical significance of the statistically significant reduction in pain score observed is difficult as the size of the reduction is small. Estimates of a clinically relevant pain reduction have been developed for participants experiencing pain of traumatic and non-traumatic aetiology. The Minimum Clinical Significant Difference (MCSD) ranges from a reduction of 0.9 (CI 0.6 to 1.3) on a zero to 10 Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) (<LINK REF="REF-Kelly-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelly 1998</LINK>) to 1.39 (1.0 to 1.7) on a Numerical Rating Score (NRS)-11 (<LINK REF="REF-Kendrick-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kendrick 2005</LINK>). Procedural pain tends to be short-lived and non-cumulative in nature (<LINK REF="REF-Puntillo-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Puntillo 2001</LINK>) and while the MCSD may be appreciably different it has not been calculated for pain of this aetiology. However, the estimation above may be useful in exploring the clinically relevant reduction in pain score for these participants. For example, it is estimated that the mean MCSD ranges from 0.9 (zero to 10 VAS) to 1.39 (NRS-11). As these estimates are of a comparable magnitude to estimates of mean pain reductions achieved with intravenous pain relief and levobupivacaine, it would be expected that some clinically relevant pain reduction can be experienced by at least some patients. The decision to administer pain relief therefore requires consideration of the clinical significance of any reduction in pain achieved. This should be balanced by awareness that pain responses can vary considerably between individuals and consideration of the benefits of pain relief when compared to the likelihood of side effects without it.</P>
<P>The meta-analysis of data for vascular and procedural complications was not possible. Analysis in the included studies indicated no correlation between pain relief administration and adverse events or complications, although a higher pain score was identified as one of several independent predictors of a vasovagal event during femoral sheath removal (<LINK REF="STD-Kiat-Ang-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kiat Ang 2007</LINK>). The association of a vasovagal event with major adverse clinical events (MACE) has traditionally been stated as the rationale for the routine use of pain relief. <LINK REF="REF-Juergens-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juergens 2008</LINK> explored this association by extending the follow-up of the 661 participants undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) in the <LINK REF="STD-Kiat-Ang-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kiat Ang 2007</LINK> study included in this review. No increase in MACE was observed at 30-day follow-up in the 35 (7.7%) participants who had experienced a vasovagal event at sheath removal. No other publications have explored this issue beyond case reports (<LINK REF="REF-Barbiere-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barbiere 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ilia-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ilia 1997</LINK>). Although the <LINK REF="REF-Juergens-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juergens 2008</LINK> study is limited by the small number of events, it indicates that routine use of pain relief for the purpose of preventing MACE is not well supported in the stent era.</P>
<P>Prior to the initial publication of this review a survey of practice from 54 sites in Australia and New Zealand identified considerable variation in analgesic regimens used for femoral sheath removal after PCI (<LINK REF="REF-Sanders-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanders 2005</LINK>). A 2009 survey of Australian and New Zealand cardiovascular nurses indicates that, in those countries at least, practice diversity continues (<LINK REF="REF-Rolley-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rolley 2010</LINK>). However, a preference for mild opioid analgesia (with or without sedation) emerged with 50.9% (56/110) of respondents selecting this option. Non-opioid pain relief was selected by 29.1% (32/110) suggesting a marked reduction from four years earlier when, if pain relief was to be administered, 46% (16/35) administered lignocaine (alone or in combination with opioids) prior to femoral sheath removal (<LINK REF="REF-Sanders-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanders 2005</LINK>). There also appears to be a small shift away from protocol-driven analgesia in preference to an 'as-needed' prescription that enables nurses to administer pain relief based on clinical judgement (<LINK REF="REF-Delphi-Consensus-Discussion-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delphi Consensus Discussion 2009</LINK>). The absence of strong evidence of effectiveness may give nurses more confidence to use clinical judgement, informed by individualised patient assessment, when making the decision to administer pain relief. Such practice decisions are congruent with the recommendations, derived from both the evidence and clinical expert consensus, in a recently published nursing clinical practice guideline for the care of people undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions<I> (</I>
<LINK REF="REF-Rolley-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rolley 2011</LINK>). With the increasing use of radial access the challenge is to maintain the skills that support clinical judgement.</P>

<P>The main limitations of these findings are the small numbers of studies involved and the methodological weaknesses in the studies. In particular, successful blinding is very important in trials with subjective outcomes such as pain scores (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 2002</LINK>) and assessment of risk of bias placed particular emphasis on appropriate blinding. No trials reported appropriate blinding for all treatment arms involved. Unsuccessful blinding can exaggerate treatment effects by 17% (<LINK REF="REF-Juni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juni 2001</LINK>) and this may be sufficient to produce a type one or false-positive error.

Smaller studies do tend to have results that differ from larger studies (<LINK REF="REF-Sterne-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sterne 2000</LINK>) and this is true to some extent for the smaller studies involved in our review. These differences can simply be due to random effects of chance (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1998</LINK>). This may be the reason here as, with the possible exception of <LINK REF="STD-Timlin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Timlin 2005</LINK>, the over-exaggeration of effect from methodological limitations associated with smaller studies (<LINK REF="REF-Nuesch-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nuesch 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sterne-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sterne 2000</LINK>) was not especially apparent. The results of the more precise and larger study (<LINK REF="STD-Kiat-Ang-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kiat Ang 2007</LINK>) currently dominate the conclusions reached for the main outcome, although this too has methodological limitations. While we cannot rule out that the addition of a number of small, methodologically sound studies would not change our conclusions, it seems unlikely that unpublished RCTs would be present in sufficient numbers for this to occur with any degree of accuracy, or with treatment effects large enough to be clinically relevant.</P>
<P>A bias for publishing studies with statistically significant results does not necessarily apply to this review. As the predominant practice has been to administer analgesia for femoral sheath removal, studies that suggest that this intervention is not effective may have been considered to be of more interest, and therefore more likely to be published. Of the two smaller published studies one showed statistical significance for an innovative therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Timlin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Timlin 2005</LINK>) while the other (<LINK REF="STD-Fulton-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Fulton 2000</LINK>) reported non-significant findings. We considered the number of studies involved in this review too few for meaningful analysis of publication bias by funnel plot asymmetry.  </P>

<P>Intravenous pain regimens did not produce a consistent response across the two studies involved in meta-analysis (Comparison 02.01: <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). We performed subgroup analysis to test the effect of combining opioid-only with opioid and anxiolytic data. Visually the forest plot suggests that the addition of midazolam may be an important aspect of the effectiveness of the intravenous pain regimen. However, as there is no significant (P = 0.67) or appreciable (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%) heterogeneity over the trials with and without midazolam there is no quantitative evidence to support this. The finding that morphine, as a co-intervention, had no impact on the estimate of treatment effect could also suggest that opioid alone may not produce a reduction in pain score. However, the small number of participants (13/60) who received morphine in the <LINK REF="STD-Timlin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Timlin 2005</LINK> study meant that no firm conclusion can be drawn.</P>
<P>The non-significant reduction in pain intensity observed with subcutaneous lignocaine was consistent with the results from two non-randomised trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bowden-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bowden 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wadas-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wadas 1998</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Wadas-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wadas 1998</LINK>, in a non-randomised, non-blinded study involving 50 participants undergoing femoral sheath removal, compared the effectiveness of 4 mg intravenous morphine (25 participants with coronary stent) with 4 mg morphine plus 10 ml of 1% lignocaine (25 participants after angioplasty). There was no statistically significant difference between groups indicating that the addition of lignocaine to the pain regimen was not beneficial to participant comfort. The pain intensity score published for the entire sample was 2.0 ± 2.1 (zero to 10 VAS) immediately after the release of manual pressure. <LINK REF="STD-Bowden-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bowden 1995</LINK> evaluated the comfort levels of 111 non-randomised participants undergoing sheath removal after PCI. Comfort levels were acceptable (able to lie still; regular calm respirations with oxygen saturations &gt; 90%; self report of pain at zero to three on a zero to 10 scale) in 95% (105/111) of participants without local infiltration of lignocaine.</P>

<P>The implications are unchanged from the original review.</P>
<P>Intravenous pain regimens and subcutaneous levobupivacaine appear to produce reductions in pain score not seen with subcutaneous lignocaine or control. However, interpretation of the clinical relevance of these findings is difficult as the size of the reduction is small and the size of a clinically important reduction in procedural pain is not known. This review did not demonstrate any correlation between pain relief administration and either adverse events or complications.</P>
<P>In the absence of a definitive finding, clinical judgement and consideration of patient preference is required to identify those who may potentially benefit from pain relief. The mild level of pain generally experienced during this procedure should not influence the decision to consider pain relief as it is evident from the range of pain scores that some people experience moderate levels of pain.</P>
<P>Clinical judgement is informed by an assessment of factors that are thought to impact on the individual's pain experience. During sheath removal these factors may include the patient's past experiences of procedure-related pain, the level of anxiety, the effectiveness of basic comfort measures prior to the procedure, existing vascular complications such as haematoma, the extent of patient preparation, the patient-practitioner therapeutic relationship and the clinical setting. However, information on how these aspects may influence the participant's experience is lacking. Where analgesic requirement is anticipated, administration before the procedure rather than in reaction to breakthrough pain is considered good practice.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-08-08 15:48:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To determine the effectiveness of intravenous pain regimens further evaluation is warranted by means of an adequately powered randomised controlled trial with appropriate blinding. The success of blinding should be tested and reported. A clinically relevant threshold for pain reduction is required to interpret the results. Given the higher pain intensity reported in trials using no intervention (that is no placebo) as a control, inclusion of a 'no intervention' arm may be of value. The extent to which the placebo effect contributes to the true treatment effect requires measurement against a control of no treatment. The accuracy of pain scores obtained by participant recall, compared to real time assessment, should be ascertained before choosing the method of pain score measurement. To enable meta-analysis of secondary outcomes, complication rates of femoral sheath removal should be reported by treatment group using standardised definitions.</P>
