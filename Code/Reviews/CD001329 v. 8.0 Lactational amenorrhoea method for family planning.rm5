<P>The lactational amenorrhoea method (LAM) is a contraceptive method where the mother is <I>informed and supported</I> how to use breastfeeding for contraception. Breastfeeding while <I>not</I> giving supplementary feeds delays the return of fertility and menstrual periods, which is a normal (physiological) protection against pregnancy. In this review we have studied the effectiveness of LAM as a contraceptive method in fully breastfeeding women in comparison to breastfeeding women without any support. We found no clear differences in effectiveness (pregnancy) between women using LAM and being supported in doing so, and fully breastfeeding amenorrheic women not using any method. Apart from this we recommend breastfeeding itself from a public health point of view.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2015-08-24 12:03:01 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Out of 459 potentially relevant studies, 159 investigated the risk of pregnancy during LAM or lactational amenorrhoea. Our inclusion criteria were as follows: prospective study; cases (intervention group) and, if available, controls, had to be sexually active; pregnancy had to be confirmed by physical examination or a pregnancy test. Our endpoints were life table menstruation rates and life table pregnancy rates. We included 15 studies reporting on 11 intervention groups and three control groups. We identified one additional uncontrolled study in the 2007 update and one additional controlled study in this 2015 update.</P>

Life table pregnancy rates for fully breastfeeding women who were amenorrheic but not using any contraceptive method were 0.88% in one study and 0.9% to 1.2% (95% confidence interval 0.0 to 2.4) in a second study, depending on the definition of menstruation used.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Description of the condition</HEADING>
<P>It is estimated that among the annual 150 million pregnancies in the world, about 40% are unintended and unplanned and that the major part of these are unwanted. Most of these pregnancies occur in low income countries (<LINK REF="REF-Alan-Guttmacher-Institute-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alan Guttmacher Institute 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lakha-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lakha 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Trussell-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trussell 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-UNFPA-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNFPA 2014</LINK>). There are several reasons no or ineffective contraception is used to prevent these unplanned pregnancies, including difficulties in obtaining contraceptives.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Description of the intervention</HEADING>
<P>The lactational amenorrhoea method (LAM) is a contraceptive method available and accessible to many women (<LINK REF="REF-Family-Health-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Family Health 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kennedy-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kennedy 1989</LINK>). LAM was defined during the 1988 Bellagio Consensus Conference in Italy (<LINK REF="REF-Bellagio-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bellagio 1988</LINK>) as the informed use of breastfeeding as a contraceptive method by a woman who is still amenorrheic and does not feed her baby with supplements for up to six months after delivery. LAM provides more than 98% protection from pregnancy in the first six months postpartum, according to its advocates (<LINK REF="REF-Family-Health-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Family Health 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kennedy-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kennedy 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kennedy-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kennedy 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Labbok-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Labbok 1994</LINK>). During a second conference in Bellagio in 1995, it was suggested that women choosing and using the LAM had a life table pregnancy rate at six months of less than 2%. This was not based on a systematic review. It was also suggested "in the studies that included the promotion of appropriate breastfeeding practices, the percentages of women still amenorrheic and still fully breastfeeding at six months postpartum were higher than in control groups not receiving such support" (<LINK REF="REF-Kennedy-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kennedy 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Look-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Look 1996</LINK>). </P>
<P>LAM is a 'transitional' form of contraception and is most effective in women planning to breastfeed exclusively during the first six months (<LINK REF="STD-Labbok-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Labbok 1997</LINK>). However, many women choose not to use this method owing to concerns about its efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-Lopez_x002d_Martinez-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lopez-Martinez 2006</LINK>), and uptake is low in many countries (<LINK REF="REF-Khella-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khella 2004</LINK>). Where LAM is implemented, the information provided to women includes: the physiological mechanism of lactation and its control of reproductive function; the efficacy of LAM as a means of contraception; and the benefits and disadvantages of LAM as a contraceptive method (<LINK REF="REF-Lopez_x002d_Martinez-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lopez-Martinez 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Romero_x002d_Gutierrez-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Romero-Gutierrez 2007</LINK>). Several studies that have followed up women claiming to use LAM showed that few of the women actually implemented the method or used it correctly (<LINK REF="REF-Romero_x002d_Gutierrez-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Romero-Gutierrez 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sebastian-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sebastian 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sipsma-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sipsma 2013</LINK>). </P>
<P>In a study in Turkey, 34% of the research sample of women with six-month-old infants were said to use LAM to prevent pregnancy after childbirth. However, only 17.2% of the women using LAM successfully fulfilled the LAM criteria, with 82.8% not fulfilling one or more of the LAM criteria. The pregnancy rate of the women using 'LAM' was 32.8% (<LINK REF="REF-T_x00fc_rk-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Türk 2010</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">How the intervention might work</HEADING>
<P>The suckling stimulus reduces pulsatile secretion of GnRH/LH, thus suppressing ovarian activity (<LINK REF="REF-McNeilly-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">McNeilly 2001</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Why it is important to do this review</HEADING>
<P>Many studies on LAM do not include a control group, thus the quality of these studies varies; it is therefore difficult to support the suggestions of the World Health Organization Task Force on Methods for the Natural Regulation of Fertility, <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1999b" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1999b</LINK>, and those of Labbok (<LINK REF="STD-Labbok-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Labbok 1997</LINK>). If LAM is effective as a contraceptive in the postpartum period, there may be implications in offering this method for use in low income countries, in particular where access to or the acceptability of other forms of contraception may be limited. In countries where there is no such limitation, LAM should be studied only if its advocation does not hamper the introduction of longer-term methods of contraception.</P>

We compared the incidence of menstruation and pregnancy in LAM users to that of recently delivered, fully breastfeeding women who did not use LAM.</P>

<P>
<I>Primary outcome measures</I>
</P>
<P>Pregnancy and 'menstruation' (after being amenorrheic) were primary outcome measures. The studies had to present the number of women per specific month who experienced 'menstruation' or who became pregnant. Pregnancy had to be confirmed by physical examination or by a pregnancy test.</P>
<P>We considered several definitions of being amenorrheic. The original definition used in the Bellagio Consensus Statement ignores any bleeding before the 56th day postpartum (<LINK REF="REF-Family-Health-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Family Health 1988</LINK>). However, in 1995 in Bellagio menstruation was defined as the occurrence, after the 56th day postpartum, of "2 consecutive days of bleeding/spotting, or the women's perception that her menses have returned, whichever of the two comes first" (<LINK REF="REF-Kennedy-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kennedy 1996</LINK>). Labbok used definitions of two continuous days of vaginal bleeding that the woman considered similar to a menstrual period or heavier, or two continuous days of spotting and one day of bleeding, or three continuous days of spotting (<LINK REF="STD-Labbok-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Labbok 1997</LINK>). The World Health Organization used four different definitions to mark the end of amenorrhoea (<LINK REF="STD-WHO-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">WHO 1999a</LINK>).</P>
<P>In this systematic review we used three different definitions:</P>
<OL>
<LI>We used the original definition of lactational amenorrhoea in fully lactating women, i.e. "ignoring any bleeding before the 56th day postpartum", as standard.</LI>
<LI>Any bleeding (including bleeding within 56 days postpartum but separated from the postpartum bleeding by 10 to 14 days or more).</LI>

<P>
<I>Selection of studies</I>
<BR/>We updated this review in 2015.<BR/>Two review authors (CW and Frans Helmerhorst in the original review; CW and Julie Brown in the 2008 update; CW and CM in this update) independently selected the studies according to the pre-set inclusion criteria. Any disagreements were resolved through discussion. When we identified multiple reports of a study, we used only the original results.</P>
<P>
<I>Data extraction and management<BR/>
</I>One review author performed data extraction, and the second review author checked and recorded the data.</P>
<P>
<I>Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</I>
</P>
<P>To assess the risk of bias in individual studies we used a modification of a previously published checklist from the National Health Service Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (<LINK REF="REF-NHS-Centre-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHS Centre 2001</LINK>). Items included were: Did the women enrol at a similar entry point? Were the groups comparable on all important confounding factors? Was follow-up long enough for the outcomes to occur? Was the drop-out rate less than 10%? Were the outcomes used clear? Were the presented data clear? We considered age, parity, and length of previous lactational amenorrhoea or breastfeeding as confounders. The period of lactational amenorrhoea tends to be longer for older multiparous women than for younger primiparous women (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1998b</LINK>). Moreover, older age itself has an influence on fertility, and the consecutive lactational amenorrheic period of these women tends to be longer (<LINK REF="REF-Jain-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jain 1969</LINK>). Regarding loss to follow-up, we used a cut-off point of 10% in scoring this criterion. Loss to follow-up can occur for various reasons, such as the mother stopping breastfeeding because of the child&#8217;s death, being dissatisfied with LAM, choosing another family planning method, wishing to become pregnant, becoming pregnant, or moving to a place outside the study area.</P>
<P>
<I>Unit of analysis issues<BR/>
</I>There are no unit of analysis issues in this review; all reports presented data per woman.</P>
<P>
<I>Dealing with missing data<BR/>
</I>Where there were insufficient or missing data, we contacted the study's lead author. If no response was forthcoming, we included the study but did not describe the data in the text of the review.</P>
<P>
<I>Assessment of heterogeneity<BR/>
</I>After inclusion, two review authors, using their subjective judgement, assessed heterogeneity of the studies, taking into account study design and comparability of populations, interventions and controls, outcomes, and reported effects. For studies that we considered sufficiently homogeneous, we planned to perform statistical pooling using life table methods; this was not possible and we thus presented a narrative synthesis.<BR/>All intervention groups presented in 13 of the studies were different from each other. At least 26 different populations were used: various cultures and nationalities and both urban and rural locations in the same country. Knowing that fertility and the recurrence of menstruation after childbirth are population specific, we found that the populations themselves were not comparable. These differences indicated to us that statistical pooling would not be appropriate and we have instead presented narrative results.</P>
<P>
<I>Assessment of reporting biases</I>
<BR/>We retrieved studies from as many sources as possible. There were not sufficient studies to construct a funnel plot to assess reporting biases.</P>
<P>
<I>Data synthesis<BR/>
</I>Owing to heterogeneity among the included studies, we were unable to perform a meta-analysis and therefore have described the results in narrative form. We used a single, not multiple, decrement life table technique to present the data (<LINK REF="REF-Trussell-1991a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trussell 1991a</LINK>). Multiple decrement life tables measure survival (or failure) of individuals or groups over time. This technique is frequently used in contraceptive research to measure the probability of pregnancy or method continuation. In this context, it measures multiple reasons for discontinuation, including pregnancy, hormonal side effects, etc. Single decrement life tables are calculated in the same way as multiple decrement life tables, but at the time of discontinuation they censor individuals who stop using a method for reasons other than the one being measured. They are therefore recommended as the most appropriate method to measure contraceptive outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Trussell-1991a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trussell 1991a</LINK>). The life tables presented the number of women per specific month who had a 'menstruation' or who became pregnant.</P>

<P>In this updated 2015 review we identified one additional study for inclusion (<LINK REF="STD-Shaaban-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Shaaban 2013</LINK>). Thus, from 459 publications (2003 data) identified in the literature, 159 presented original data; 90 were prospective. There were 12 double publications, leaving 78 (2003 data). In 64 (2003 data), one or more inclusion criteria were not fulfilled (no life table rates, sexual activity unknown, no differentiation between full and partial breastfeeding, loss to follow-up not specified, highly selective studies according to study co-ordinators). Hence, 15 studies were left, which dealt with 11 original intervention groups and three control groups (2015 data). We included these 15 studies in this systematic review (<LINK REF="STD-Cooney-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cooney 1996</LINK>; <A HREF="díaz  1988a">Díaz 1988a</A>; <A HREF="díaz  1988b">Díaz 1988b</A>; <A HREF="díaz  1991">Díaz 1991</A>; <A HREF="díaz  1992">Díaz 1992</A>; <LINK REF="STD-Egbuonu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Egbuonu 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kazi-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kazi 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Labbok-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Labbok 1997</LINK>; <A HREF="peréz  1991">Peréz 1991</A>; <A HREF="peréz  1992">Peréz 1992</A>; <LINK REF="STD-Ramos-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ramos 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ravera-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ravera 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rodr_x00ed_guez-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Rodríguez 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shaaban-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Shaaban 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WHO-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">WHO 1999a</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Other potential sources of bias </HEADING>
<P>One of the main sources of bias within this review is the multiple definitions of 'amenorrhoea' that were used. This means there is also considerable selection bias in the type of women enrolled in the studies. In most studies women were included just after delivery. Díaz (<LINK REF="STD-D_x00ed_az-1988a" TYPE="STUDY">Díaz 1988a</LINK>) and Rodríguez (<LINK REF="STD-Rodr_x00ed_guez-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Rodríguez 1993</LINK>) started to include women between 6 and 12 weeks after delivery, thus creating a selection bias. The confounders of age were given in all included studies and those regarding parity in all but one (<LINK REF="STD-Shaaban-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Shaaban 2013</LINK>). The confounder length of previous lactational amenorrhoea and breastfeeding were not clear in the studies from the WHO (<LINK REF="STD-WHO-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">WHO 1999a</LINK>), Cooney (<LINK REF="STD-Cooney-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cooney 1996</LINK>), Díaz (<LINK REF="STD-D_x00ed_az-1988a" TYPE="STUDY">Díaz 1988a</LINK>), Peréz (<LINK REF="STD-Per_x00e9_z-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Peréz 1991</LINK>), Ravera (<LINK REF="STD-Ravera-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ravera 1995</LINK>) and Rodríguez (<LINK REF="STD-Rodr_x00ed_guez-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Rodríguez 1993</LINK>). In the studies by Cooney, Ravera and the WHO the drop-out rate was more than 10%, but was not specified. For example, Cooney&#8217;s study (<LINK REF="STD-Cooney-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cooney 1996</LINK>) took place during the civil war in Rwanda. The definitions of the endpoints were not clear in the reports by Cooney (<LINK REF="STD-Cooney-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cooney 1996</LINK>), Labbok (<LINK REF="STD-Labbok-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Labbok 1997</LINK>) and <LINK REF="STD-Shaaban-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Shaaban 2013</LINK>.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Pregnancy rate in controlled studies</HEADING>
<P>As already noted, we identified three controlled studies (<A HREF="díaz  1988a">Díaz 1988a</A>; <LINK REF="STD-Per_x00e9_z-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Peréz 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shaaban-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Shaaban 2013</LINK>). Díaz studied breastfeeding women using an intrauterine device (IUD) as a control group. For the purpose of pregnancy rates, we did not consider these controls to be suitable (none of the women became pregnant). In this controlled study, two different definitions were used to mark the end of amenorrhoea. The standard definition, ignoring any bleeding before day 56 postpartum, gave a cumulative life table pregnancy rate of 2.45 after 6 months. Using the second definition, that is any bleeding marking the end of amenorrhoea, a cumulative life table pregnancy rate of 0.45 was calculated.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Per_x00e9_z-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Peréz 1991</LINK> used the standard definition of amenorrhoea. The life table pregnancy rate was 0.45 (one pregnancy in 1671 woman months accumulated (WMAC)) for the women using the LAM, compared with zero (none in 690 WMAC) for the controls, who were fully breastfeeding, amenorrheic women not using any other method of contraception. In the <LINK REF="STD-Shaaban-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Shaaban 2013</LINK>, women counseled on LAM were the cases and women counseled on LAM and emergency contraception (EC) served as controls. The EC was provided with instructions to be used in case one of the prerequisites of LAM expired and sexual relations had occurred. No life tables were given, but 29 pregnancies occurred in the 529 LAM users and 2 in the 529 women using LAM and EC.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Recurrence of 'menstruation' (vaginal blood loss) in controlled studies</HEADING>
<P>We obtained data from the same three controlled studies already noted (<LINK REF="STD-D_x00ed_az-1988a" TYPE="STUDY">Díaz 1988a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Per_x00e9_z-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Peréz 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shaaban-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Shaaban 2013</LINK>). Díaz found no difference in re-establishment of 'menstruation' between the intervention and the control groups. Of all fully breastfeeding women (236 cases and 440 controls), 52% were not amenorrheic at 6 months. Peréz found that 56% of the fully nursing women in the intervention group remained amenorrheic at 6 months (life table menstruation rate 18.78), compared with 22% in the control group. The objective of Peréz's study was to assess the impact of a breastfeeding promotion campaign and the acceptance and use of LAM for natural child spacing, not to test the effectiveness of LAM. The LAM users and their healthcare providers received an exceptional amount of support. In the study of Shaaban, about 20% had resumed menstruation at 6 months and only 20% were (almost) exclusively breastfeeding. Shaaban defines "exclusive" or "nearly exclusive" breastfeeding as follows: "breastfeeding the infant at least every 4 h during the daytime and at least every 6 h during nighttime, and not giving the infant other additional liquid, semi-solid or solid food"; we therefore put the word "almost" between brackets. Life tables were not given <LINK REF="STD-Shaaban-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Shaaban 2013</LINK>.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Pregnancy rate in uncontrolled studies</HEADING>
<P>We identified six uncontrolled studies that used the standard LAM definition (<LINK REF="STD-Cooney-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cooney 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Egbuonu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Egbuonu 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kazi-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kazi 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Labbok-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Labbok 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ramos-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ramos 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ravera-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ravera 1995</LINK>). The number of pregnancies per woman month of LAM use during the first 6 months were according to Kazi 1/131.3 (cumulative pregnancy rate (CPR) 0.58), Ravera 0/432, Cooney 0/1264, Ramos 2/1030.5 (CPR 0.97), and Labbok 5/2718 (CPR 1.5). Egbuonu provided no woman months. It should be noted that the life table pregnancy rates in the multicentre study of Labbok varied from 0 to 7.5 per site.<BR/>In <LINK REF="STD-Ramos-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ramos 1996</LINK>, the cumulative pregnancy risk was given for both correct and incorrect users of LAM as 0.88. This included all breastfeeding, sexually active women using LAM correctly or incorrectly (which means experiencing vaginal blood loss and not using any contraceptive method). The CPR for women using LAM correctly was even higher, being 0.97. In <LINK REF="STD-WHO-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">WHO 1999a</LINK>, 13 pregnancies were reported in 2831 to 2969 WMAC, depending on which definition was used to mark the end of amenorrhoea. The cumulative life table pregnancy rate in fully breastfeeding, amenorrheic women not using any contraceptive method in that study was 0.9 to 1.2 (95% confidence interval 0 to 2.4).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Recurrence of 'menstruation' (vaginal blood loss) in uncontrolled studies</HEADING>
<P>The above-mentioned studies used the standard definition of LAM, that is ignoring any bleeding before the 56th day postpartum. Unfortunately, <LINK REF="STD-Kazi-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kazi 1995</LINK> provided no data about the recurrence of menstruation. The number of menstruation recurrence/woman months of LAM use during the first 6 months were 40/432 (cumulative menstruation rate (CMR) 39.4) according to <LINK REF="STD-Ravera-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ravera 1995</LINK> and 27/1179 (CMR 11.1) according to <LINK REF="STD-Cooney-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cooney 1996</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Ramos-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ramos 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Labbok-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Labbok 1997</LINK> did not provide these monthly data, giving only CMRs of 18.78 and 27.6, respectively. Only <LINK REF="STD-D_x00ed_az-1988a" TYPE="STUDY">Díaz 1988a</LINK> also presented data using the definition of any bleeding marking the end of amenorrhoea, reporting a life table menstruation rate after 6 months of using LAM of 135/937 (CMR 53.2). These data must be seen in the context that amenorrheic women were recruited 6 to 12 weeks after delivery. In the 1999 WHO study (<LINK REF="STD-WHO-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">WHO 1999a</LINK>), the third definition of the end of amenorrhoea was used, that is a woman's perception that menstruation had resumed, but no menstruation life table rates were given.<BR/>In <LINK REF="STD-Rodr_x00ed_guez-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Rodríguez 1993</LINK>, the women using LAM were fully breastfeeding and using an IUD. The CMR at 6 months was 32.<BR/>In the WHO study (<LINK REF="STD-WHO-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">WHO 1999a</LINK>), the women in the intervention group were fully breastfeeding, and their CMR at 6 months varied from 26.5 to 69.5. Of note in this study was that 25.4% of these women experienced bleeding before the 56th day postpartum. In 44.4% (11.3/25.4) of them, this was separated by more than 14 days from the puerperal bleeding, and in 83.4% it was followed by a second bleed within 21 to 70 days. <LINK REF="STD-Egbuonu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Egbuonu 2005</LINK> provided no cumulative rates or monthly life tables, reporting that menstrual flow returned in 33.8% of women by the sixth week of lactation and in 70.2% at six months.<BR/>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2015-08-25 16:15:52 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A systematic review of observational studies has many limitations owing to publication and language biases (<LINK REF="REF-Blettner-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blettner 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Concato-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Concato 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sim-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sim 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stroup-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stroup 2000</LINK>). In this review, we finally included 15 studies, reporting on 11 intervention and three control groups. The ways in which definitions were used, intervention and control groups composed, and data presented were not always clear. Even when they were clear, it did not make sense to pool these data, because we discovered that fertility and the length of amenorrhoea in fully breastfeeding women varied between different populations (<LINK REF="REF-Bonte-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bonte 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ford-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ford 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ford-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ford 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jones-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kramer-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kramer 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lewis-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Radwan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Radwan 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sutton-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sutton 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vald_x00e9_s-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Valdés 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WHO-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">WHO 1999a</LINK>). We observed serious heterogeneity among the women recruited. For example, Cooney studied the efficacy of LAM in Rwanda, where the national mean duration of breastfeeding was 25.9 months and lactational amenorrhoea 16.8 months before the introduction of LAM (<LINK REF="STD-Cooney-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cooney 1996</LINK>). In the study by Kazi, only women who had breastfed their previous child for at least one year were recruited (<LINK REF="STD-Kazi-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kazi 1995</LINK>). Realizing that pregnancy is the most important reason for weaning, it is likely that the women studied did not become pregnant during the first six months of their previous lactational amenorrhoea (<LINK REF="REF-Feinstein-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feinstein 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jakobson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jakobson 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marandi-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marandi 1993</LINK>). The length of a previous amenorrhoea influences that of the next amenorrhoea, which will probably last longer. It may have been that the women studied would not likely become pregnant in the six months of using LAM during the study period (<LINK REF="REF-Delvoye-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delvoye 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Salber-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salber 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WHO-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">WHO 1999a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Another weak point in the design of most of the included studies was the lack of a control group. A control group from the same culture/site is a prerequisite because the length of lactational amenorrhoea in fully breastfeeding women is culture and site specific (<LINK REF="REF-Kramer-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kramer 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Trussell-1991a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trussell 1991a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1998a</LINK>).</P>
<P>The LAM was introduced as a safe contraceptive method and a method to delay menstruation. Much effort and money was put into its promotion. However, in this review we found no differences in pregnancy rates between motivated and supported LAM users and women 'just' fully breastfeeding and staying amenorrheic. The suggestion that LAM delays the recurrence of menstruation more than does exclusive breastfeeding could not be supported.</P>
<P>Even after counseling, the percentage of women self reporting and evaluated as using LAM correctly is about 20% to 26% (<LINK REF="REF-Fabic-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fabic 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shaaban-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Shaaban 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sipsma-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sipsma 2013</LINK>), and certain barriers (for example misconception about return of fertility) to LAM users' timely transition to regular contraceptive practice still exist (<LINK REF="REF-Kouyat_x00e9_-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kouyaté 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Advocates of LAM have also suggested that its use would motivate women who have never used contraception before to use another contraceptive method after using LAM. Data supporting this idea gathered from a health centre may be biased. Owing to a lack of pregnancy tests, only women using LAM as a contraceptive method were allowed to have an IUD fitted without having a pregnancy test before insertion. Breastfeeding, amenorrheic women not using any contraceptive method did not receive an IUD because a pregnancy test could not be carried out before its insertion (<LINK REF="REF-Hardy-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hardy 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kennedy-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kennedy 1998a</LINK>). LAM may even slow the transition to regular contraceptive practice, as suggested in the recent study of Shaaban (<LINK REF="STD-Shaaban-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Shaaban 2013</LINK>). In the LAM group, 45.2% of women started regular contraceptive practice in the six months after delivery compared to 73.4% in the LAM and emergency contraception group.</P>
<P>LAM has been promoted especially in low income countries, where it is difficult to obtain contraceptives. The results of <LINK REF="STD-Egbuonu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Egbuonu 2005</LINK> are in this case alarming. In his study, LAM was not introduced as a contraceptive method; instead, exclusive breastfeeding for 178 women was promoted. No data on parity or on previous breastfeeding experience were given. Only 3.9% of these women were exclusively breastfeeding at 6 months, and 27.8% of the 144 women exclusively breastfeeding resumed sexual activity at 6 weeks after delivery. A return of menstrual flow occurred in 33.3% of the 144 exclusively breastfeeding women at 6 weeks and in 70.2% at 6 months for all breastfeeding women.</P>
<P>In Nigeria, where it is likely more difficult to obtain contraceptives compared with a high income country, it might be asked if the LAM method is applicable. In countries with a limited access to contraceptives, waiting for the end of the amenorrhoea before commencing another 'method' is not acceptable (<LINK REF="REF-Georgetown-University-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Georgetown University 2008</LINK>). A wiser course of action would be to use the first months after childbirth for the promotion of breastfeeding in the interest of the baby's health and to motivate the mother to use another contraceptive method, if required, and then arranging this (<LINK REF="REF-Bracher-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bracher 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hardy-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hardy 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hight_x002d_Laukaran-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hight-Laukaran 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kennedy-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kennedy 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kennedy-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kennedy 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kunwar-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kunwar 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Labbok-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Labbok 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Potter-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Potter 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Trussell-1991b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trussell 1991b</LINK>).</P>

<P>Fully breastfeeding women who remain amenorrheic have a very small risk of becoming pregnant in the first six months after delivery when relying on lactational subfertility (<LINK REF="REF-Bracher-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bracher 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hardy-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hardy 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hight_x002d_Laukaran-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hight-Laukaran 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kennedy-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kennedy 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kennedy-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kennedy 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Labbok-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Labbok 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Potter-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Potter 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Trussell-1991b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trussell 1991b</LINK>). According to the studies in this review, amenorrhoea should be redefined as no vaginal blood loss for at least 10 days after postpartum bleeding (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1999b" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1999b</LINK>).</P>
<P>When amenorrhoea is likely to end is unpredictable, and because LAM has been promoted especially in countries where it is difficult to obtain contraceptives, a dilemma is created. In these countries, waiting for the end of amenorrhoea before starting contraceptive use is not acceptable. A wiser way forward may be to use the first months after childbirth for the promotion of breastfeeding and to motivate the mother to use another contraceptive method, if needed, and also arranging this (<LINK REF="REF-Bracher-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bracher 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hardy-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hardy 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hight_x002d_Laukaran-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hight-Laukaran 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kennedy-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kennedy 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kennedy-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kennedy 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Labbok-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Labbok 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Potter-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Potter 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shaaban-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaaban 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Trussell-1991b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trussell 1991b</LINK>). During breastfeeding an IUD is preferable. Progestin-only pills or barrier methods could also be considered.</P>

<P>If future research is to be undertaken, uniform and transparent definitions should be used, intervention groups and controls should be from the same population, and these should be comparable for culture, age, parity, and previous breastfeeding experience or lactational amenorrhoea. A careful description of populations and settings is essential. Even then, it is doubtful whether such newly achieved results could be generalised. An economic analysis would also be useful, in which postpartum and postamenorrheic strategies for contraception should be compared (<LINK REF="REF-Kennedy-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kennedy 1998b</LINK>).</P>
