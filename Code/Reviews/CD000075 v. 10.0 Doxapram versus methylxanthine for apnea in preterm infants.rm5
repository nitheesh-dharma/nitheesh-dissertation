<P>Doxapram and methylxanthine stimulate breathing in infants with apnea. Infant apnea is a pause in breathing of greater than 20 seconds. This can be harmful to the developing brain and cause dysfunction of the gastrointestinal tract or other organs. Drugs such as doxapram and methylxanthine are thought to stimulate breathing and are given to reduce apnea. The review of four small trials found that there was no large difference between the drugs in the short term. There is not enough evidence to exclude a small difference in benefit, long term effects or a difference in less common adverse effects. More research is needed into the long term and adverse effects of these drugs.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2010-03-12 09:41:52 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Recurrent apnea is common in preterm infants, particularly at very early gestational ages. These episodes of loss of effective breathing can lead to hypoxemia and bradycardia which may be severe enough to require resuscitation including use of positive pressure ventilation. Doxapram and methylxanthine drugs have been used to stimulate breathing and thereby prevent apnea and its consequences. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of doxapram compared with methylxanthine in preterm infants with recurrent apnea. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2010-03-11 19:55:29 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised and quasi-randomised trials of doxapram compared with methylxanthine (e.g. theophylline, aminophylline or caffeine) for the treatment of apnea in preterm infants. </P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2010-02-07 04:44:37 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The methodological quality of each trial was reviewed by the two reviewer trial authors. Additional information was requested from authors. Each reviewer extracted the data separately, then they were compared and differences resolved. Meta-analysis was carried out with use of relative risk and risk difference.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-03-12 09:41:52 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Four trials involving 91 infants were included. No difference was detected between intravenous doxapram or methylxanthine in the incidence of failed treatment within 48 hours [typical relative risk 0.91, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.45, 1.85] . Only one trial reported results at 7 days and there was no difference in results. No infants were reported to have been given mechanical ventilation on either treatment. No adverse effects were reported.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Intravenous doxapram and intravenous methylxanthine appear to be similar in their short term effects for treating apnea in preterm infants, although these trials are too small to exclude an important difference between the two treatments or to exclude the possibility of less common adverse effects. Long term outcome of infants treated in these trials has not been reported. Further studies would require a large number of infants to clarify whether there might be differences in responses or adverse effects with these two drugs at different ages. </P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-03-11 19:57:14 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Infant apnea has been defined as a pause in breathing of greater than 20 seconds, or one of less than 20 seconds associated with bradycardia and/or cyanosis or pallor (<LINK REF="REF-AAP-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 2003</LINK>). Recurrent episodes of apnea are common in preterm infants and the incidence and severity is greater in those born at lower gestational ages. Although apnea can occur spontaneously and be attributed to prematurity alone, apnea can also be provoked or made more severe if there is some additional insult such as infection, hypoxemia or intracranial pathology (<LINK REF="REF-Henderson_x002d_Smart-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson-Smart 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>If prolonged, apnea can lead to hypoxemia and reflex bradycardia that may require active resuscitative efforts to reverse. There are clinical concerns that these episodes might be harmful to the developing brain or cause dysfunction of the gastrointestinal tract or other organs. Frequent episodes may be accompanied by respiratory failure of sufficient severity as to lead to intubation and the use of intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-03-11 19:57:21 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Methylxanthines are thought to stimulate breathing efforts and have been used in clinical practice to reduce apnea since the 1970s. Theophylline, caffeine and aminophylline are three forms that have been used and meta-analysis of the RCTs evaluating the effect against placebo or no treatment indicates a large reduction in apnea and in the use of IPPV ( <LINK REF="REF-Henderson_x002d_Smart-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson-Smart 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Henderson_x002d_Smart-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson-Smart 2004</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-03-11 19:58:00 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Caffeine and theophyline effectiveness for apnea have been assessed in other reviews. Doxapram also appears to stimulate breathing and may be an alternative treatment. It appears to act both on the peripheral chemoreceptors and central nervous system to augment breathing efforts (<LINK REF="REF-Blanchard-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blanchard 1992</LINK>). In one small placebo controlled trial, doxapram has been shown to reduce apnea in the short term (<LINK REF="REF-Henderson_x002d_Smart-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson-Smart 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Short term side effects of doxapram, such as hypertension, excessive central nervous system stimulation, gastrointestinal disturbances (<LINK REF="REF-Tay_x002d_Uyboco-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tay-Uyboco 1991</LINK>) and heart block (<LINK REF="REF-De-Villiers-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Villiers 1998</LINK>) have been reported.

Fifty-two infants with recurrent apnea/bradycardia, birth weights less than 1500 grams and gestational ages less than 35 weeks at birth were randomized to intravenous doxapram or theophylline. Thirty-five per cent of infants were excluded after randomization (usually due to loss of intravenous access) and median rates of apnea are presented for the seven day study period.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-03-11 20:08:39 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Evidence of the efficacy of doxapram and of methylxanthines compared with control for the treatment of apnea in preterm infants has been reviewed elsewhere showing that they are effective (<LINK REF="REF-Henderson_x002d_Smart-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson-Smart 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Henderson_x002d_Smart-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson-Smart 2004</LINK>). Although no difference in effectiveness of Doxapram and methylxanthines was found, the overall number of subjects is insufficient to exclude the possibility that doxapram, compared to methylxanthine, could result in even a 50% relative risk reduction for treatment failure in the first 48 hours.</P>
<P>Theoretically, the use of intravenous methylxanthine (aminophylline or caffeine) has the advantage of being easily converted to the enteral route (theophylline), where as doxapram is poorly absorbed and causes gastrointestinal disturbance when given orally (<LINK REF="REF-Tay_x002d_Uyboco-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tay-Uyboco 1991</LINK>) and is therefore usually administered intravenously. Furthermore, short term side effects of doxapram, such as hypertension, excessive central nervous system stimulation, and heart block (<LINK REF="REF-De-Villiers-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Villiers 1998</LINK>) have been reported.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-03-12 09:53:44 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Intravenous doxapram and intravenous methylxanthine appear to be similar in their short term effects for treating apnea in preterm infants, although these trials are too small to exclude an important difference between the two treatments or to exclude the possibility of less common adverse effects. Long-term outcome of infants treated in these trials has not been reported.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further studies would require a large number of infants, stratified by gestation, to clarify which infants are likely to benefit and whether there might be differences in responses or side effects with these two drugs at different ages. It would be valuable to include important clinical outcomes such as use of mechanical ventilation as well as subsequent growth and development in future studies. Responses to treatment would have to take account of co-interventions, such as nasal continuous positive airway pressure.</P>
