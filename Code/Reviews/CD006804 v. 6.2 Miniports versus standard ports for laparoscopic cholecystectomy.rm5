<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-07-15 19:10:27 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>About 10% to 15% of the adult western population have gallstones. Between 1% and 4% become symptomatic each year. Removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) is the mainstay treatment for symptomatic gallstones. More than half a million cholecystectomies are performed per year in the United States alone. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (removal of gallbladder through a key-hole, also known as port) is now the preferred method of cholecystectomy. In standard port laparoscopic cholecystectomy, four ports (two of 10 mm diameter and two of 5 mm diameter) are usually used. Recently, use of smaller ports has been reported (miniport laparoscopic cholecystectomy). However, the safety of miniport laparoscopic cholecystectomy and whether it offers any advantages over standard port laparoscopic cholecystectomy is not known. We sought to answer this question by reviewing the medical literature and obtaining information from randomised clinical trials. When conducted well, such studies provide the most accurate information. Two authors searched the literature and obtained information from the studies thereby minimising errors.</P>
<P>We identified 12 randomised clinical trials involving 734 patients that compared miniport laparoscopic cholecystectomy (380) with standard port laparoscopic cholecystectomy (351). The choice of the treatment that the patients received was determined by a method similar to toss of coin so that both treatments were conducted in patients who were as similar as possible. Most of the trials were of high risk of bias, i.e. there is possibility of arriving at wrong conclusions overestimating benefits or underestimating harms because of study design. Miniport laparoscopic cholecystectomy could be completed successfully in more than 80% of patients in most studies. The remaining patients were mostly converted to standard port laparoscopic cholecystectomy but some patients had to undergo open cholecystectomy. These patients were excluded from the analysis by the study authors and so the results of these trials as well as the present systematic review have to be interpreted with extreme caution. There was no mortality in either group in the seven trials that reported mortality (0/226 patients versus 0/234 patients). There were no significant differences between the two operation types in the proportion of patients who developed serious complications, quality of life at 10 days after operation, or in whom the laparoscopic operation had to be converted to open cholecystectomy. Miniport laparoscopic cholecystectomy took five minutes longer to complete than standard port laparoscopic cholecystectomy. There were no significant differences between the two operation types in the length of hospital stay, the time taken to return to activity, or in the time taken to return to work. There was no significant cosmetic difference at six months to 12 months after surgery between the two groups, in the two trials that reported this outcome.</P>
<P>There appears to be no advantage of miniport laparoscopic cholecystectomy in terms of decreasing surgical complications, hospital stay, return to activity, return to work, or improving cosmesis. On the other hand, there is a modest increase in operating time after miniport laparoscopic cholecystectomy compared with standard port laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The safety of miniport laparoscopic cholecystectomy is yet to be established. Miniport laparoscopic cholecystectomy cannot be recommended routinely outside well-designed randomised clinical trials. Further well-designed randomised clinical trials are necessary to determine whether miniport laparoscopic cholecystectomy is safe and whether there is any advantage over standard port laparoscopic cholecystectomy.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-06-09 10:15:05 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>Only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status) comparing miniport versus standard port laparoscopic cholecystectomy were considered for the review.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-06-24 11:33:06 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>Two review authors collected the data independently. We analysed the data with both fixed-effect and random-effects models using RevMan analysis.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-07-19 12:53:49 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>We included 12 trials with 734 patients randomised to miniport laparoscopic cholecystectomy (380 patients) versus standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy (351 patients). Only one trial which included 70 patients was of low risk of bias. Miniport laparoscopic cholecystectomy could be completed successfully in more than 80% of patients in most trials. The remaining patients were mostly converted to standard port laparoscopic cholecystectomy but some were also converted to open cholecystectomy. These patients were included for the outcome conversion to open cholecystectomy but excluded from other outcomes. Accordingly, the results of the other outcomes are on 343 patients in the miniport laparoscopic cholecystectomy group and 351 patients in the standard port laparoscopic cholecystectomy group, and therefore the results have to be interpreted with extreme caution.</P>
<P>There was no mortality in the seven trials that reported mortality (0/194 patients in miniport laparoscopic cholecystectomy versus 0/203 patients in standard port laparoscopic cholecystectomy). There were no significant differences between miniport laparoscopic cholecystectomy and standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the proportion of patients who developed serious adverse events (eight trials; 460 patients; RR 0.33; 95% CI 0.04 to 3.08) (miniport laparoscopic cholecystectomy: 1/226 (adjusted proportion 0.4%) versus standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy: 3/234 (1.3%); quality of life at 10 days after surgery (one trial; 70 patients; SMD -0.20; 95% CI -0.68 to 0.27); or in whom the laparoscopic operation had to be converted to open cholecystectomy (11 trials; 670 patients; RR 1.23; 95% CI 0.44 to 3.45) (miniport laparoscopic cholecystectomy: 8/351 (adjusted proportion 2.3%) versus standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy 6/319 (1.9%)). Miniport laparoscopic cholecystectomy took five minutes longer to complete than standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy (12 trials; 695 patients; MD 4.91 minutes; 95% CI 2.38 to 7.44). There were no significant differences between miniport laparoscopic cholecystectomy and standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the length of hospital stay (six trials; 351 patients; MD -0.00 days; 95% CI -0.12 to 0.11); the time taken to return to activity (one trial; 52 patients; MD 0.00 days; 95% CI -0.31 to 0.31); or in the time taken for the patient to return to work (two trials; 187 patients; MD 0.28 days; 95% CI -0.44 to 0.99) between the groups. There was no significant difference in the cosmesis scores at six months to 12 months after surgery between the two groups (two trials; 152 patients; SMD 0.13; 95% CI -0.19 to 0.46).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-07-01 13:14:14 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi Selvan Gurusamy">
<P>In standard port laparoscopic cholecystectomy, four ports (two of 10 mm diameter and two of 5 mm diameter) are usually used (<LINK REF="STD-Alponat-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Alponat 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bisgaard-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bisgaard 2002</LINK>). Use of smaller ports ('miniports' defined as one or more ports smaller than the standard ports used) has been suggested as an alternative to standard port laparoscopic cholecystectomy (<LINK REF="STD-Alponat-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Alponat 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ainslie-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ainslie 2003</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-07-15 08:59:23 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi Selvan Gurusamy">
<P>The potential advantages of the smaller ports include decreased pain (<LINK REF="STD-Bisgaard-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bisgaard 2002</LINK>) and improved cosmesis (<LINK REF="REF-Hosono-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hosono 2007</LINK>) because of the smaller incisions used for the operation. The smaller ports may also make the operation more complicated, giving rise to more operations with complications and more operations that have to be turned into open operations.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-07-15 08:59:41 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi Selvan Gurusamy">
<P>There is no uniform agreement among surgeons regarding the utility of miniport laparoscopic cholecystectomy. In addition, there have been questions about the safety of miniport laparoscopic cholecystectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Gurusamy-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurusamy 2010</LINK>). With increasing pressure on the surgeons to perform the latest techniques, it is important to have up-to-date information on the safety and effectiveness of the procedure to implement effective procedures and to avoid litigations when the safety has not been established. This is an update of the previous Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Gurusamy-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurusamy 2010</LINK>) and includes revisions of the outcomes into outcomes that are important to patients and healthcare funders.</P>

<P>We excluded quasi-randomised studies (where the method of allocating participants to a treatment are not strictly random (e.g., date of birth, hospital record number, alternation), cohort studies, and case-control studies because of the selection bias in such studies. The patients who are generally considered easy to operate would have been operated by miniport laparoscopic cholecystectomy and patients who would have been considered difficult to operate would have undergone standard port laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Besides, patients in whom the surgery was started as miniport laparoscopic cholecystectomy and converted to standard port laparoscopic cholecystectomy would either have been excluded (as we found was the case in even randomised clinical trials in the previous version of this review) (<LINK REF="REF-Gurusamy-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurusamy 2010</LINK>) or would have been included in standard port laparoscopic cholecystectomy making any such comparisons in non-randomised studies meaningless or misleading.

<P>Miniport laparoscopic cholecystectomy could be completed successfully in more than 80% of patients in most of the trials. The remaining patients were mostly converted to standard port laparoscopic cholecystectomy but some were also converted to open cholecystectomy. These patients were included for the outcome conversion to open cholecystectomy but excluded from other outcomes as this information was not available from the trials. The trials did not report the other outcomes for patients who required conversion to open cholecystectomy in the standard port laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Therefore, the results of the other outcomes are on 343 patients in miniport laparoscopic cholecystectomy group and 351 patients in standard port laparoscopic cholecystectomy group and so the results have to interpreted with extreme caution.</P>

<P>Miniport laparoscopic cholecystectomy was successful in between 61.5% and 100% of the patients who were randomised to miniport laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the 10 trials in which it was possible to calculate this (<LINK REF="STD-Bisgaard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bisgaard 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schwenk-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Schwenk 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Alponat-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Alponat 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bisgaard-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bisgaard 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sarli-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sarli 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Novitsky-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Novitsky 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Abbas-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Abbas 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Carvalho-2013" TYPE="STUDY">de Carvalho 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saad-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Saad 2013</LINK>). The remaining patients were mostly converted to standard port laparoscopic cholecystectomy, but some were also converted to open cholecystectomy. Further information about these patients who underwent conversion to open cholecystectomy was not available in most trials. Therefore, these patients were included only for the outcome 'conversion to open cholecystectomy' and not for any of the other outcomes. Most trials also excluded patients who were converted to standard port laparoscopic cholecystectomy for most of the other outcomes. Thus, we had to use 'per-protocol' analysis for most comparisons. The findings are summarised in the <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Primary outcomes</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Mortality</HEADING>
<P>Seven trials reported on this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Bisgaard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bisgaard 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Alponat-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Alponat 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hsieh-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hsieh 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sarli-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sarli 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Abbas-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Abbas 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Carvalho-2013" TYPE="STUDY">de Carvalho 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saad-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Saad 2013</LINK>). There was no mortality in either group in these seven trials (194 patients in miniport laparoscopic cholecystectomy group and 203 patients in standard port laparoscopic cholecystectomy group). Since there was no mortality in either group, we were unable to use the control group proportion for the calculation of the required information size of the trial sequential analysis. Instead, we used a proportion of 0.2% in the control group based on data from approximately 30,000 patients included in a database in Switzerland (<LINK REF="REF-Giger-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giger 2011</LINK>). The proportion of information accrued was only 0.11% of the diversity-adjusted required information size and so the trial sequential monitoring boundaries were not drawn (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Surgical morbidity (serious adverse events)</HEADING>
<P>Serious adverse events were reported in eight trials (<LINK REF="STD-Schwenk-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Schwenk 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bisgaard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bisgaard 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schmidt-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Schmidt 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Alponat-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Alponat 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hsieh-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hsieh 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sarli-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sarli 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Carvalho-2013" TYPE="STUDY">de Carvalho 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saad-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Saad 2013</LINK>). There were serious adverse events in only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Sarli-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sarli 2003</LINK>). There were no serious adverse events in either group in the remaining seven trials (<LINK REF="STD-Schwenk-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Schwenk 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bisgaard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bisgaard 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schmidt-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Schmidt 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Alponat-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Alponat 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hsieh-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hsieh 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Carvalho-2013" TYPE="STUDY">de Carvalho 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saad-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Saad 2013</LINK>). However, it must be noted that one cannot be sure that there were no serious advents in four of these seven trials as the authors did not report the serious adverse events adequately to be sure about the absence of serious adverse events (<LINK REF="STD-Schwenk-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Schwenk 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schmidt-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Schmidt 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Alponat-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Alponat 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hsieh-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hsieh 2003</LINK>). Overall, there was no significant difference in the proportion of patients who developed serious adverse events between the groups (risk ratio (RR) 0.33; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04 to 3.08) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). There was no change in conclusions by calculating the risk difference. Trial sequential analysis revealed that the proportion of information accrued was only 0.87% of the diversity-adjusted required information size and so the trial sequential monitoring boundaries were not drawn (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>).</P>
<P>Imputation of patients with missing outcome data by various scenarios did not alter the conclusions for best-best scenario, worst-worst scenario, and best-worst scenarios (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). However, the worst-best scenario resulted in a significantly higher proportion of patients who developed serious adverse events in the miniport laparoscopic cholecystectomy group compared with the standard port laparoscopic cholecystectomy group (RR 3.31; 95% CI 1.18 to 9.29) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>), demonstrating the potential impact of post-randomisation drop-outs on serious adverse events.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Quality of life</HEADING>
<P>Only one trial reported this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Saad-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Saad 2013</LINK>). There was no significant difference in the quality of life at 10 days after surgery using the gastrointestinal quality of life index (GIQLI) scale (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.20; 95% CI -0.68 to 0.27) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Conversion to open cholecystectomy</HEADING>
<P>Eleven trials reported conversion to open cholecystectomy (<LINK REF="STD-Bisgaard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bisgaard 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Alponat-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Alponat 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bisgaard-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bisgaard 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schmidt-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Schmidt 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hsieh-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hsieh 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sarli-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sarli 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Novitsky-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Novitsky 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Abbas-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Abbas 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saad-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Saad 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Carvalho-2013" TYPE="STUDY">de Carvalho 2013</LINK>). There was no significant difference in the proportion of patients in whom the laparoscopic operation had to be converted to open cholecystectomy (RR 1.23; 95% CI 0.44 to 3.45) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). Using the random-effects model or risk difference did not alter the conclusion. Although most of the excluded patients could be included for conversion to open cholecystectomy as the trials reported this information, one of the trials did not report the outcome of excluded patients (<LINK REF="STD-Novitsky-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Novitsky 2005</LINK>). Imputation of patients with missing outcome data by various scenarios did not alter the conclusion for best-best scenario, worst-worst scenario, and best-worst scenarios (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>). However, the worst-best scenario resulted in a significantly higher proportion of patients who had to undergo conversion to open cholecystectomy in the miniport group compared with the standard port laparoscopic cholecystectomy group (RR 3.23; 95% CI 1.39 to 7.50) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>), demonstrating the potential impact of post-randomisation drop-outs on conversion to open cholecystectomy. The trial sequential analysis revealed that the proportion of information accrued was only 0.87% of the diversity-adjusted required information size and so the trial sequential monitoring boundaries were not drawn (<LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Operating time</HEADING>
<P>All the trials reported this outcome. The miniport laparoscopic cholecystectomy took five minutes longer to complete (mean difference (MD) 4.91 minutes; 95% CI 2.38 to 7.44) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). Using the random-effects model showed no alteration in results. Either the mean or the standard deviation or both were imputed in seven trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bisgaard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bisgaard 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schwenk-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Schwenk 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bisgaard-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bisgaard 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schmidt-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Schmidt 2002</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Huang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sarli-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sarli 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Abbas-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Abbas 2009</LINK>). Excluding these seven trials did not alter the results (MD 4.91 minutes; 95% CI 1.37 to 8.45) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>). The trial sequential analysis showed that the trial sequential monitoring boundary favouring standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy was crossed by the cumulative Z-curve (<LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK>), suggesting that new trials are unlikely to dispute the finding that the operating time is significantly longer in the miniport laparoscopic cholecystectomy group compared with the standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy group.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Hospital stay</HEADING>
<P>Six trials reported this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Bisgaard-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bisgaard 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schmidt-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Schmidt 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hsieh-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hsieh 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Carvalho-2013" TYPE="STUDY">de Carvalho 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saad-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Saad 2013</LINK>). There was no significant difference in the hospital stay between the groups (MD -0.00 days; 95% CI -0.12 to 0.11) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>). Using the random-effects model showed no alteration in results. Either the mean or the standard deviation or both were imputed in four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bisgaard-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bisgaard 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schmidt-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Schmidt 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Carvalho-2013" TYPE="STUDY">de Carvalho 2013</LINK>). Exclusion of these four trials did not alter the results (MD 0.00 days; 95% CI -0.12 to 0.12) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>). The trial sequential analysis showed that the trial sequential monitoring boundaries could not be drawn since the information fraction from the first trial was greater than 100% (<LINK REF="FIG-08" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 8</LINK>). So, we performed a post hoc trial sequential analysis with a minimal clinically relevant difference of 0.2 days. The cumulative Z-curve does not cross the conventional statistical boundaries and lies in the futility area (<LINK REF="FIG-09" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 9</LINK>) suggesting that it is unlikely that future trials are unlikely to detect a difference in hospital stay as small as 0.2 days between miniport laparoscopic cholecystectomy and standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy irrespective of the sample size. Although a difference of 0.2 days is not clinically significant, this analysis demonstrates that a clinically relevant difference of one day is even more unlikely to be demonstrated in future trials irrespective of sample size.</P>
<P>None of the trials reported on the number of patients eligible to be discharged as day-surgery laparoscopic cholecystectomy.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Return to activity and work</HEADING>
<P>One trial reported the time taken to return to activity (<LINK REF="STD-Bisgaard-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bisgaard 2002</LINK>). There was no significant difference in the time taken to return to activity between the two groups (MD 0.00 days; 95% CI -0.31 to 0.31) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>). Since this was the only trial, the issues of fixed-effect versus random-effects meta-analysis or sensitivity analyses do not arise although the standard deviation was imputed. Trial sequential analysis was not performed since there was only one trial.</P>
<P>Two trials reported the time taken to return to work (<LINK REF="STD-Bisgaard-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bisgaard 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sarli-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sarli 2003</LINK>). There was no significant difference in the time taken to return to work between the groups (MD 0.28 days; 95% CI -0.44 to 0.99) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>). Using the random-effects model showed no alteration in results. Either the mean or the standard deviation or both were imputed in both the trials and so a sensitivity analysis was not performed. Trial sequential analysis revealed that the information from was too small (27.91%) to draw the futility area and the trial sequential boundaries for benefits or harms of miniports were not crossed (<LINK REF="FIG-10" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 10</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cosmesis</HEADING>
<P>Two trials reported this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Huang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saad-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Saad 2013</LINK>). In one trial, the cosmesis was reported at six months after surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Huang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2003</LINK>) and in the other trial, it was reported one year after the surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Saad-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Saad 2013</LINK>). Although the second trial reported the cosmesis at six months after surgery also, we obtained the values at one year since wound remodelling may last even for a year (<LINK REF="REF-Gurtner-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurtner 2008</LINK>). There was no significant difference in the cosmesis scores between the two groups (SMD 0.13; 95% CI -0.19 to 0.46) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>). Using the random-effects model showed no alteration in results. The mean and standard deviation were imputed in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Huang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2003</LINK>). Excluding this trial did not show alteration in the results (SMD 0.29; 95% CI -0.19 to 0.77) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.5</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analysis</HEADING>
<P>Two planned subgroup analyses (trials with high-risk of bias compared to trials with low-risk of bias) and (elective cholecystectomy compared to emergency cholecystectomy) were not performed because one of the subgroups had only one trial (only one trial was of low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Saad-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Saad 2013</LINK>) and only one trial included patients with acute cholecystitis (<LINK REF="STD-Hsieh-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hsieh 2003</LINK>)). Such subgroup analyses are prone to errors.</P>
<P>We performed a subgroup analysis based on the size of the port. We compared whether the results were different between the trials that used less than 3 mm port for at least two of the ports versus those that did not use less than 3 mm port for at least two ports. The only outcome with sufficient trials to allow a subgroup analysis was operating time. The Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test for subgroup differences was not statistically significant (P = 0.27).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Funnel plot</HEADING>
<P>Visual inspection of the funnel plot did not reveal any bias for conversion to open cholecystectomy (<LINK REF="FIG-11" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 11</LINK>) and operating time (<LINK REF="FIG-12" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 12</LINK>), the only outcomes with 10 or more trials. Although 11 trials were included for the outcome 'conversion to open cholecystectomy', eight trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bisgaard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bisgaard 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Alponat-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Alponat 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schmidt-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Schmidt 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Novitsky-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Novitsky 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Abbas-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Abbas 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Carvalho-2013" TYPE="STUDY">de Carvalho 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saad-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Saad 2013</LINK>) did not have any events (conversion to open cholecystectomy) in either group and so were not included in the funnel plot. Thus, this funnel plot has to be interpreted with caution. Egger's linear regression analysis could not be performed for conversion to open cholecystectomy because of the few trials with data. Egger's linear regression analysis was not statistically significant for operating time (P = 0.39).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-07-19 12:50:24 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-07-19 12:50:05 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi Selvan Gurusamy">
<P>This meta-analysis has shown that there is no evidence of any benefit from miniport laparoscopic cholecystectomy compared with standard port laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The proportion of patients with successful operations was more than 80% in most of the trials in the miniport laparoscopic cholecystectomy group. Most of the patients not completing miniport laparoscopic cholecystectomy underwent standard port laparoscopic cholecystectomy. However, some patients underwent conversion to open cholecystectomy. Further information about the patients who underwent conversion to open cholecystectomy was not available in most trials. Most trials did not report morbidity adequately, even in patients who completed miniport laparoscopic cholecystectomy successfully. As a result of this, the potential for bias due to incomplete outcome data (lack of intention-to-treat analysis) and selective outcome reporting bias is very high, and we were accordingly unable to determine the safety of miniport laparoscopic cholecystectomy. We did not identify any specific harm attributable to miniport laparoscopic cholecystectomy from any of the excluded studies identified.</P>
<P>The safety of the procedure should take precedence over any measures of effectiveness in recommending miniport laparoscopic cholecystectomy because of the availability of a very effective method of removal of gallbladder, i.e., standard port laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Because of this reason, miniport laparoscopic cholecystectomy should be confined to appropriately designed randomised clinical trials, which assess the safety and effectiveness of miniport laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Alternatively, an informed consent from the patients explaining that they are willing to undergo a potentially unsafe procedure in spite of the availability of a safe and effective alternative, i.e., standard port laparoscopic cholecystectomy, should be obtained.</P>
<P>While it is appropriate to perform a sensitivity analysis of including and excluding patients who were converted to open cholecystectomy, it is inappropriate to exclude the conversions from miniport to standard port laparoscopic cholecystectomy. By excluding these patients from cosmesis and operating time, the impact of conversion from miniport to standard port laparoscopic cholecystectomy on these outcomes cannot be assessed. Thus, in this review, it is not possible to assess the miniport technology adequately due to insufficient reporting in the trials. Our results are only applicable to patients who underwent successful completion of miniport laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which was between 80% and 97% in most trials.</P>
<P>There was no significant difference in the quality of life between patients even at 10 days after surgery in the only trial which reported the quality of life (<LINK REF="STD-Saad-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Saad 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>The operating time was longer in the miniport than in the standard port laparoscopic cholecystectomy group by about five minutes. The operating time in the individual trials is different in both groups, and individual centres have to assess the difference in the operating time for cost calculations. There was no significant differences in mortality, the length of hospital stay, return to normal activity, or return to work between the two interventions groups. Trial sequential analyses demonstrated that we have only accrued a small fraction of the required information size so far to assess these outcomes appropriately. </P>
<P>Although the early cosmesis following miniport laparoscopic cholecystectomy was better (<LINK REF="REF-Gurusamy-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurusamy 2010</LINK>), there was no significant difference in cosmesis when trials that assessed cosmesis at least six months after surgery were included. Wound remodelling may last even for a year (<LINK REF="REF-Gurtner-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurtner 2008</LINK>) and it is appropriate to assess the cosmesis after at least six months after surgery rather than early cosmesis. None of the trials used a validated scale for measurement of cosmesis. Furthermore, blinding was unclear in one of the two trials that reported cosmesis after at least six months (<LINK REF="STD-Huang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>For performing miniport laparoscopic cholecystectomy, a new set of instruments has to be purchased. However, the standard instruments should also be available because of the significant risk of failure of miniport laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The operating time is also longer with miniport laparoscopic cholecystectomy (even when the patients with conversions to standard port laparoscopic cholecystectomy were excluded). The impact of miniport laparoscopic cholecystectomy on day-case laparoscopic cholecystectomy has not been reported. Thus, from the current evidence, there appears to be no economic benefit in performing miniport laparoscopic cholecystectomy.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-07-19 12:50:15 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi Selvan Gurusamy">
<P>Only one trial included patients with acute cholecystitis (<LINK REF="STD-Hsieh-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hsieh 2003</LINK>). There was no significant differences between the groups in any of the outcomes in this trial. Most of the remaining trials in this review clearly state that they included only elective laparoscopic cholecystectomies. The proportion of patients with acute cholecystitis was low in the remaining trials. Thus, the results of this review may only be considered for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Most of the included patients were of low anaesthetic risk. So, the review is applicable only for such patients.</P>
<P>We did not assess acute or chronic pain. A number of the trials assessed acute pain (<LINK REF="STD-Schwenk-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Schwenk 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bisgaard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bisgaard 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Alponat-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Alponat 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bisgaard-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bisgaard 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schmidt-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Schmidt 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sarli-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sarli 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Novitsky-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Novitsky 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Abbas-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Abbas 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Carvalho-2013" TYPE="STUDY">de Carvalho 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saad-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Saad 2013</LINK>) and some reported that pain following the miniport operation was reduced (<LINK REF="STD-Sarli-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sarli 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Novitsky-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Novitsky 2005</LINK>). Pain is of course important, but it is a complication that can be handled with pain reducing treatments. Furthermore, pain may be considered a surrogate for quality of life, earlier return to normal activity, or earlier return to work. We considered the latter outcomes and found no significant advantage of miniport laparoscopic cholecystectomy compared with standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-07-19 12:50:24 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi Selvan Gurusamy">
<P>The quality of the evidence is generally low or very low as shown in <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>. Blinding was unclear or inadequate in most of the trials. Imputation of missing data under different scenarios showed that the results were vulnerable to post-randomisation drop-outs. Morbidity was not described adequately in many of the trials. However, this is the best quality of evidence available.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-06-24 11:45:15 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi Selvan Gurusamy">
<P>We performed a thorough search of literature. At least two review authors independently identified trials for inclusion and extracted data, thus minimising errors. However, we imputed the mean and standard deviation when these were not available. The alternative was to present the data without imputing these values which would have been even more confusing. Besides, the results of the operating time and hospital stay did not change after exclusion of trials in which mean or standard deviation or both had been imputed.</P>

<P>Miniport laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be completed successfully in more than 80% of patients. There appears to be no advantage of miniport laparoscopic cholecystectomy in terms of decreasing mortality, morbidity, hospital stay, return to activity, return to work or improving cosmesis. On the other hand, there is a modest increase in operating time after miniport laparoscopic cholecystectomy compared with standard port laparoscopic cholecystectomy and the safety of miniport laparoscopic cholecystectomy is yet to be established. Miniport laparoscopic cholecystectomy cannot be recommended outside well-designed randomised clinical trials.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-07-19 12:50:43 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi S Gurusamy">
<OL>
<LI>Further randomised clinical trials are necessary to evaluate miniport cholecystectomy in the emergency and in the elective set-up.</LI>
<LI>Future randomised clinical trials should minimise the risk of bias to lack of blinding (by blinding the patients and outcome assessors), and incomplete outcome data (by measuring all the outcomes in all patients recruited into the trial).</LI>
<LI>Future trials should include the proportion of patients discharged as day-case laparoscopic cholecystectomy as one of the primary outcomes.</LI>
<LI>Future trials need to be designed according to the SPIRIT guidelines (<A HREF="http://www.spirit-statement.org/">http://www.spirit-statement.org/</A>) and conducted and reported according to the CONSORT Statement (<A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org">www.consort-statement.org</A>).</LI>

<P>The outcomes have been divided into primary and secondary outcomes. Three new outcomes - return to activity, return to work, and patient quality of life - have been added as these are important outcomes in the assessment of cost-effectiveness. The outcomes have been ordered according to their clinical and economic importance. The assessment of methodological quality has been updated in line with the updated version of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Intervention</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Changes in the first version of the review</HEADING>
<P>A subgroup analysis of standard port laparoscopic cholecystectomy (four ports with two ports of at least 10 mm ports and two ports of at least 5 mm) was performed following user feedback. The results and discussion were modified to reflect the changes in the subgroup analysis.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Changes in this update (2013)</HEADING>
<OL>
<LI>We excluded any trials that did not compare miniport laparoscopic cholecystectomy and which did not meet the definition of standard port laparoscopic cholecystectomy.</LI>
<LI>We used the ICH-GCP definition of serious adverse events to define the surgical morbidity.</LI>
<LI>We changed quality of life to a primary outcome.</LI>
<LI>We moved conversion to open cholecystectomy to the secondary outcomes as the decision to use miniport or standard port laparoscopic cholecystectomy should be based on mortality, morbidity, and quality of life, and if there are no differences in these outcomes (which are now the primary outcomes), the decision to use miniport or standard port laparoscopic cholecystectomy will depend upon whether there was any difference in the conversion to open cholecystectomy, operating time, length of hospital stay, return to work, return to normal activity, and long-term cosmesis (at six months or beyond). These are the outcomes considered to be important for patients and healthcare funders.</LI>

<B>Trial sequential analysis of mortality </B>
<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was calculated to 352,564 patients, based on the proportion of patients in the control group with the outcome of 0.2%, a relative risk reduction of 20%, an alpha of 5%, a beta of 20%, and a diversity of 0%. To account for zero event groups, a continuity correction of 0.01 was used in the calculation of the cumulative Z-curve (blue line). After accruing a total of 397 patients in seven trials, only 0.12% of the DARIS has been reached. Accordingly, the trial sequential analysis does not show the required information size and the trial sequential monitoring boundaries. As shown, the conventional boundaries have also not been crossed by the cumulative Z-curve.</P>

<B>Trial sequential analysis of serious adverse events </B>
<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was calculated to 52,796 patients, based on the proportion of patients in the control group with the outcome of 1.28%, a relative risk reduction of 20%, an alpha of 5%, a beta of 20%, and a diversity of 0%. To account for zero event groups, a continuity correction of 0.01 was used in the calculation of the cumulative Z-curve (blue line). After accruing a total of 460 patients in eight trials, only 0.87% of the DARIS has been reached. Accordingly, the trial sequential analysis does not show the required information size and the trial sequential monitoring boundaries. As shown, the conventional boundaries have also not been crossed by the cumulative Z-curve.</P>

<B>Trial sequential analysis of conversion to open cholecystectomy </B>
<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was calculated to 36,124 patients, based on the proportion of patients in the control group with the outcome of 1.88%, a relative risk reduction of 20%, an alpha of 5%, a beta of 20%, and a diversity of 0%. To account for zero event groups, a continuity correction of 0.01 was used in the calculation of the cumulative Z-curve (blue line). After accruing a total of 670 patients in 11 trials, only 1.85% of the DARIS has been reached. Accordingly, the trial sequential analysis does not show the required information size and the trial sequential monitoring boundaries. As shown, the conventional boundaries have also not been crossed by the cumulative Z-curve.</P>

<B>Trial sequential analysis of operating time</B>
<BR/>Trial sequential analysis of operating time showing that the accumulative Z-curve crosses the trial sequential monitoring boundary after the fourth trial. The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was 189 participants based on a minimal relevant difference (MIRD) of 15 minutes, a variance (VAR) of 509.29, an alpha (a) of 5%, a beta (b) of 20%, and a diversity (D<SUP>2</SUP>) of 61.91%. The results are compatible with significantly higher operating time in the miniport laparoscopic cholecystectomy group compared with standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy group without risk of random errors.</P>

<B>Trial sequential analysis of length of hospital stay </B>
<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was 20 participants based on a minimal relevant difference (MIRD) of 1 day, a variance (VAR) of 0.61 (we used the variance from all the trials rather than the variance of low bias-risk trial since the variance from the low bias risk trial was 0.13 which will further reduce the required sample size), an alpha (a) of 5%, a beta (b) of 20%, and a diversity (D<SUP>2</SUP>) of 0%. Trial sequential boundaries were not drawn since the information fraction exceeded the required sample size after one trial. The Z-curve does not cross the conventional boundary suggesting that there is no significant difference in the length of hospital between miniport laparoscopic cholecystectomy and standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy.</P>

<B>Trial sequential analysis of length of hospital stay (<I>post hoc</I> analysis)</B>
<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was 479 participants based on a minimal relevant difference (MIRD) of 0.2 days, a variance (VAR) of 0.61, an alpha (a) of 5%, a beta (b) of 20%, and a diversity (D<SUP>2</SUP>) of 0%. This was a post hoc decision.After accruing 351 participants in six trials, the cumulative Z-curve (blue line) lies in the futility area. The conventional statistical boundaries were not crossed by the cumulative Z-curve. This suggests that future trials are unlikely to detect a difference as small as 0.2 days in the length of hospital between miniport laparoscopic cholecystectomy and standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy irrespective of the sample size in those trials.</P>

<B>Trial sequential analysis of return to work </B>
<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was calculated to 670 patients, based on on a minimal relevant difference (MIRD) of 1 day, a variance (VAR) of 12.51, an alpha (a) of 5%, a beta (b) of 20%, and a diversity (D<SUP>2</SUP>) of 41.35%. After accruing 187 patients in two trials, only 27.91% of the DARIS has been reached. Accordingly, the futility area was not drawn. Neither the conventional statistical boundaries nor the trial sequential monitoring boundaries for benefits or harms of miniports versus standard ports were crossed by the cumulative Z-curve (blue line).</P>
