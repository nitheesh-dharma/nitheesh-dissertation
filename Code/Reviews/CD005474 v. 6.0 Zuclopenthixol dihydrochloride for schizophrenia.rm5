<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-10-19 14:00:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness where people experience delusions (strange thoughts/ideas) and/or hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not real). These are often known as positive or acute symptoms. People also experience negative or chronic symptoms which usually follow acute symptoms. These can include withdrawing from social contact, lack of interest in everyday activities, depression as well as problems with memory and thought processing.</P>
<P>Treatment usually involves a package of care involving medications known as antipsychotics, and if necessary, additional therapies such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, Psychoeducation or Occupational therapy.</P>
<P>There are many different antipsychotics available; knowing how effective each one is compared with no treatment or placebo (dummy treatment) and with other antipsychotics is important. This review compares the oral form of the antipsychotic zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride with other antipsychotics and placebo.</P>
<P>
<B>Searching for evidence</B>
</P>
<P>An electronic search was run on 9 June 2015, searching for trials that randomised people with schizophrenia into treatment groups that received either zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride or placebo or another antipsychotic.</P>
<P>
<B>Evidence found</B>
</P>
<P>The review authors found 20 trials with 1850 participants. Most of these participants were patients in psychiatric hospitals.</P>
<P>The trials compared oral zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride to placebo and nine other oral antipsychotics (chlorpromazine, chlorprothixene, clozapine, haloperidol, perphenazine, risperidone, sulpiride, thiothixene, and trifluoperazine). There were also trials that compared oral zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride with an injection of zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride and some that compared two different versions of zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride.</P>
<P>The review authors were interested in finding evidence for zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride's effect on seven main outcomes: global state, mental state, adverse effects, death, duration of stay in hospital, leaving the study early and general functioning. Unfortunately many data provided by the trials were unusable, data were available only for global state, mental state, leaving the study early and the adverse effect of movement disorders. The trials comparing zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride with sulpiride and trifluoperazine did not provide any useable data for any of these main outcomes.</P>
<P>Overall results suggest zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride's effect on global and mental state, and number of participants leaving the study early is similar to the other anti-psychotics listed above.</P>
<P>Zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride may cause more movement disorders than clozapine, risperidone or perphenazine, but there was no difference for the other drug comparisons or placebo.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusions</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence currently available is of very low to low quality and the meaning is therefore unclear. Data for many important outcomes are not available making conclusions about overall effectiveness of zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride difficult.</P>
<P>Evidence available suggest that zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride is not any worse than other antipsychotics in treating the symptoms of schizophrenia, however more trials providing good-quality data are needed before firm conclusions can be made.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-10-19 14:00:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride appears to cause more EPSEs than clozapine, risperidone or perphenazine, but there was no difference in EPSEs when compared to placebo or chlorpromazine. Similar numbers required hypnotics/sedatives when zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride was compared to sulpiride, and similar numbers of reported side-effects were found when its isomers were compared. The other comparisons did not report adverse-effect data.</P>
<P>Reported data indicate zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride demonstrates no difference in mental or global states compared to placebo, chlorpromazine, chlorprothixene, clozapine, haloperidol, perphenazine, sulpiride, thiothixene, trifluoperazine, depot and isomers. Zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride, when compared with risperidone, is favoured when assessed using the PANSS in the short term, but not in the medium term.<BR/>
</P>
<P>The data extracted from the included studies are mostly equivocal, and very low to low quality, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions. Prescribing practice is unlikely to change based on this meta-analysis. Recommending any particular course of action about side-effect medication other than monitoring, using rating scales and clinical assessment, and prescriptions on a case-by-case basis, is also not possible.</P>
<P>There is a need for further studies covering this topic with more antipsychotic comparisons for currently relevant outcomes.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-10-19 13:37:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Schizophrenia afflicts about 1% of the world's population across geographical, racial and gender barriers (<LINK REF="REF-Jablensky-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jablensky 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is characterised by distortions in thinking and perception in the context of inappropriate and/or blunted affects. It often includes the following psychopathological phenomena:</P>
<OL>
<LI>thought echo, thought insertion/withdrawal, thought broadcasting;</LI>
<LI>delusional perception and delusions of control, influence or passivity;</LI>
<LI>hallucinations (often auditory);</LI>
<LI>thought disorders;</LI>
<LI>negative symptoms.</LI>
</OL>
<P>The course of the illness can be continuous or episodic and outcomes are polymorphic (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2010</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-10-19 13:37:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is one oral preparation (marketed as Cisordinol, Clopixol) and two depot forms of zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride: zuclopenthixol acetate (Cisordinol-Acutard, Clopixol-Acuphase, Clopixol-Acutard), and zuclopenthixol decanoate (Cisordinol depot, Clopixol depot, Clopixol Inj.). Zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride (Clopixol tablets) was manufactured by Lundbeck Pharmaceuticals, licensed in 1982 and is currently approved for use in 71 countries.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-10-19 14:00:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Zuclopenthixol belongs to the class of thioxanthene derivatives. Zuclopenthixol is the cis (Z)-isomer of clopenthixoland has a high affinity for both dopamine D1 and D2 receptors. It is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and maximum serum concentration occurs after about four hours following a single oral dose. The elimination half-life is approximately 20 hours (range 12 to 28 hours). It has a moderately high pre-systemic metabolism and about 40% of the drug is eliminated this way (<LINK REF="REF-Dollery-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dollery 1999</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-10-19 13:48:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Antipsychotic medication remains a key means of treating people with schizophrenia (<LINK REF="REF-Awad-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Awad 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dally-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dally 1967</LINK>). Since the introduction of chlorpromazine in the early 1950's numerous antipsychotic drugs have been developed. These include haloperidol, thioridazine, trifluoperazine and zuclopenthixol and they are now inexpensive and accessible to millions. Zuclopenthixol has been licensed since the early 1980's and is used in at least 71 countries including many European countries, Australia, New Zealand and Canada.</P>
<P>A newer generation of so called 'atypical' antipsychotics have been developed and are increasingly prevalent for treating schizophrenia, especially in high-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2000</LINK>). This increase in the use of newer drugs is mirrored by a decline in the use of the older generation antipsychotics such as zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride although they are still used for treating schizophrenia and related psychotic conditions (<LINK REF="REF-Kozyrev-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kozyrev 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mace-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mace 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Percudani-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Percudani 2005</LINK>). However, we have found it difficult to identify reviews on the effects of the oral preparation and we found no relevant meta-analyses. This Cochrane review is the third review relevant to this compound and concentrates on the oral form of zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride. The first review investigated the effects of zuclopenthixol acetate for rapid tranquillisation of disturbed people with serious mental illnesses (<LINK REF="REF-Jayakody-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jayakody 2012</LINK>), and the second concentrates on the decanoate preparation of zuclopenthixol as this is used as a long-acting depot preparation (<LINK REF="REF-da-Silva-Freire-Coutinho-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">da Silva Freire Coutinho 1999</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.1 Forms</HEADING>
<P>We extracted data onto simple standard forms.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.2 Scale-derived data</HEADING>
<P>We included continuous data from rating scales only if:<BR/>
<BR/>a) the psychometric properties of the measuring instrument have been described in a peer-reviewed journal (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>); and<BR/>b) the measuring instrument has not been written or modified by one of the trialists for that particular trial.<BR/>
<BR/>Ideally, the measuring instrument should either be i. a self-report or ii. completed by an independent rater or relative (not the therapist). We realise that this is not often reported clearly, in <LINK TAG="STUDY_DESCRIPTION" TYPE="SECTION">Description of studies</LINK> we noted if this was the case or not.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.3 Endpoint versus change data</HEADING>
<P>There are advantages of both endpoint and change data. Change data can remove a component of between-person variability from the analysis. On the other hand, calculation of change needs two assessments (baseline and endpoint) which can be difficult in unstable and difficult to measure conditions such as schizophrenia. We decided primarily to use endpoint data, and only use change data if the former were not available. Endpoint and change data were combined in the analysis as we used mean differences (MD) rather than standardised mean differences (SMD) throughout (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.4 Skewed data</HEADING>
<P>Continuous data on clinical and social outcomes are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data, we aimed to apply the following standards to all data before inclusion:<BR/>
</P>
<P>Please note, we entered data from studies of at least 200 participants, for example, in the analysis irrespective of the following rules, because skewed data pose less of a problem in large studies. We also entered change data as when continuous data are presented on a scale that includes a possibility of negative values (such as change data), it is difficult to tell whether data are skewed or not. We presented and entered change data into the statistical analyses.</P>
<P>For endpoint data:</P>
<P>(a) when a scale starts from the &#64257;nite number zero, we subtracted the lowest possible value from the mean, and divided this by the standard deviation (SD). If this value was lower than 1, it strongly suggests a skew and the study was excluded. If this ratio was higher than 1 but below 2, there is suggestion of skew. We entered the study and tested whether its inclusion or exclusion changed the results substantially. Finally, if the ratio was larger than 2, the study was included, because skew is less likely (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>b) if a scale starts from a positive value (such as the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) (<LINK REF="REF-Kay-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1987</LINK>), which can have values from 30 to 210), the calculation described above was modified to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skew is present if 2 SD &gt; (S-S min), where S is the mean score and 'S min' is the minimum score.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.5 Common measure</HEADING>
<P>To facilitate comparison between trials, we intended to convert variables that can be reported in different metrics, such as days in hospital (mean days per year, per week or per month) to a common metric (e.g. mean days per month).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.6 Conversion of continuous to binary</HEADING>
<P>Where possible, we made efforts to convert outcome measures to dichotomous data. This can be done by identifying cut-off points on rating scales and dividing participants accordingly into 'clinically improved' or 'not clinically improved'. It is generally assumed that if there is a 50% reduction in a scale-derived score such as the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS, <LINK REF="REF-Overall-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1962</LINK>) or the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS, <LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>), this could be considered as a clinically significant response (<LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005a</LINK>). If data based on these thresholds were not available, we used the primary cut-off presented by the original authors.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.7 Direction of graphs</HEADING>
<P>Where possible, we entered data in such a way that the area to the left of the line of no effect indicates a favourable outcome for Zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride. Where keeping to this made it impossible to avoid outcome titles with clumsy double-negatives, we reported data where the left of the line indicates an unfavourable outcome. This is noted in the relevant graphs.</P>

<P>Again, review author EJB worked independently to assess risk of bias by using criteria described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) to assess trial quality. This set of criteria is based on evidence of associations between overestimate of effect and high risk of bias of the article such as sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data and selective reporting. A random 20% was screened for validity independently by MAP.</P>
<P>If the raters disagreed, the final rating was made by consensus, with the involvement of another member of the review group. Where inadequate details of randomisation and other characteristics of trials were provided, we contacted the authors of the studies in order to obtain further information. We reported non-concurrence in quality assessment , but if disputes arose as to which category a trial was to be allocated, again, we resolved this by discussion.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Binary data</HEADING>
<P>For binary outcomes we calculated a standard estimation of the risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). It has been shown that RR is more intuitive (<LINK REF="REF-Boissel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boissel 1999</LINK>) than odds ratios and that odds ratios tend to be interpreted as RR by clinicians (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2000</LINK>). The number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome/number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTB/NNTH) statistic with its confidence intervals is intuitively attractive to clinicians but is problematic both in its accurate calculation in meta-analyses and interpretation (<LINK REF="REF-Hutton-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hutton 2009</LINK>). For binary data presented in the 'Summary of findings' tableS, where possible, we calculated illustrative comparative risks.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Continuous data</HEADING>
<P>For continuous outcomes we estimated mean difference (MD) between groups. We preferred not to calculate effect size measures (standardised mean difference (SMD)). However, if scales of very considerable similarity were used, we presumed there was a small difference in measurement, and we calculated effect size and transformed the effect back to the units of one or more of the specific instruments.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Cluster trials</HEADING>
<P>Studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice), but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Firstly, authors often fail to account for intra-class correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) whereby P values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This causes type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Where clustering was not accounted for in primary studies, we presented data in a table, with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review we will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) for their clustered data and to adjust for this by using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Where clustering had been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we presented these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjusted for the clustering effect.</P>
<P>We sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a 'design effect'. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the ICC [Design effect = 1+(m-1)*ICC] (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC was not reported it was be assumed to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>If cluster studies have been appropriately analysed taking into account ICCs and relevant data documented in the report, synthesis with other studies was possible using the generic inverse variance technique.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Cross-over trials</HEADING>
<P>A major concern of cross-over trials is the carry-over effect. It occurs if an effect (e.g. pharmacological, physiological or psychological) of the treatment in the first phase is carried over to the second phase. As a consequence, on entry to the second phase the participants can differ systematically from their initial state despite a wash-out phase. For the same reason cross-over trials are not appropriate if the condition of interest is unstable (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). As both effects are very likely in severe mental illness, we only used data of the first phase of cross-over studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Studies with multiple treatment groups</HEADING>
<P>Where a study involved more than two treatment arms, if relevant, the additional treatment arms were presented in the comparisons. If data were binary, we simply added and combined them within the two-by-two table. If data were continuous, we combined data following the formula in section 7.7.3.8  (Combining groups) of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Where the additional treatment arms were not relevant, we did not use these data.</P>

<P>At some degree of loss of follow-up, data must lose credibility (<LINK REF="REF-Xia-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xia 2009</LINK>). We chose that, for any particular outcome, should more than 50% of data be unaccounted for, we would not reproduce these data or use them within the analyses. If, however, more than 50% of those in one arm of a study were lost, but the total loss was less than 50%, we addressed this within the 'Summary of findings' tables by down-rating quality. Finally, we also downgraded quality within the 'Summary of findings' tables should loss be 25% to 50% in total.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Binary</HEADING>
<P>In the case where attrition for a binary outcome was between 0% and 50% and where these data were not clearly described, we presented data on a 'once-randomised-always-analyse' basis (an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis). Those leaving the study early were all assumed to have the same rates of negative outcome as those who completed, with the exception of the outcome of death and adverse effects. For these outcomes, the rate of those who stayed in the study - in that particular arm of the trial - were used for those who did not. We undertook a sensitivity analysis to test how prone the primary outcomes were to change when data only from people who completed the study to that point were compared to the ITT analysis using the above assumptions.</P>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">3.2 Standard deviations</HEADING>
<P>If standard deviations (SDs) were not reported, we first tried to obtain the missing values from the authors. If not available, where there were missing measures of variance for continuous data, but an exact standard error (SE) and confidence intervals available for group means, and either 'P' value or 't' value available for differences in mean, we could calculate them according to the rules described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>): When only the SE is reported, SDs are calculated by the formula SD = SE * square root (n). Chapters 7.7.3 and 16.1.3 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) present detailed formulae for estimating SDs from P values, t or F values, confidence intervals, ranges or other statistics. If these formulae did not apply, we calculated the SDs according to a validated imputation method which is based on the SDs of the other included studies (<LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2006</LINK>). Although some of these imputation strategies can introduce error, the alternative would be to exclude a given study&#8217;s outcome and thus to lose information. We nevertheless examined the validity of the imputations in a sensitivity analysis excluding imputed values.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">3.3 Assumptions about participants who left the trials early or were lost to follow-up</HEADING>
<P>Various methods are available to account for participants who left the trials early or were lost to follow-up. Some trials just present the results of study completers, others use the method of last observation carried forward (LOCF), while more recently methods such as multiple imputation or mixed-effects models for repeated measurements (MMRM) have become more of a standard. While the latter methods seem to be somewhat better than LOCF (<LINK REF="REF-Leon-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leon 2006</LINK>), we feel that the high percentage of participants leaving the studies early and differences in the reasons for leaving the studies early between groups is often the core problem in randomised schizophrenia trials. We therefore did not exclude studies based on the statistical approach used. However, preferably we used the more sophisticated approaches. For example, MMRM or multiple-imputation were preferred to LOCF and completer analyses were only presented if some kind of ITT data were not available at all. Moreover, we addressed this issue in the item "incomplete outcome data" of the 'Risk of bias' tool.</P>

<P>We investigated heterogeneity between studies by considering the I<SUP>2 </SUP>method alongside the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> 'P' value. The I<SUP>2 </SUP>provides an estimate of the percentage of inconsistency thought to be due to chance (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). The importance of the observed value of I<SUP>2 </SUP>depends on i. magnitude and direction of effects and ii. strength of evidence for heterogeneity (e.g. 'P' value from Chi<SUP>2</SUP>  test, or a confidence interval for I<SUP>2</SUP>). An I<SUP>2 </SUP>estimate greater than or equal to around 50% accompanied by a statistically significant Chi<SUP>2</SUP> statistic, was interpreted as evidence of substantial levels of heterogeneity (Section 9.5.2 - <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). When substantial levels of heterogeneity were found in the primary outcome, we explored reasons for heterogeneity (<LINK TAG="SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS" TYPE="SECTION">Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</LINK>).</P>

<P>We understand that there is no closed argument for preference for use of fixed-effect or random-effects models. The random-effects method incorporates an assumption that the different studies are estimating different, yet related, intervention effects. This often seems to be true to us and the random-effects model takes into account differences between studies, even if there is no statistically significant heterogeneity. There is, however, a disadvantage to the random-effects model. It puts added weight onto small studies which often are the most biased ones. Depending on the direction of effect, these studies can either inflate or deflate the effect size. We chose a random-effects model for all analyses. The reader is, however, able to choose to inspect the data using the fixed-effect model.</P>

<P>For this update the original four analyses were modified and adapted in an attempt to reflect the evidence base for realistic clinical questions e.g. should I use zuclopenthixol instead of clozapine? It was felt that the original four comparisons were misleading to clinicians, patients and policy makers as they suggested that zuclopenthixol had been compared to all other possible antipsychotics. This was not the original authors intent.</P>
<P>This review update identified comparisons against nine alternative antipsychotics, only two of which were newer atypical drugs. Comparisons one and four remain and have been updated (see below).</P>

Participants did not leave a study earlier when prescribed oral zuclopenthixol (n = 100, 2 RCTs, RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.01 to 6.60) which is surprising given that we expect the side-effects of being on medication to be more frequent than being on no medication. This information is probably only of use to researchers and caution should be used in transferring this result into community or inpatient settings.</P>
<P>Extrapyramidal effects detected using the UKU side effect rating scale also did not reveal any significant difference, which is again surprising as you would expect more EPSEs on antipsychotic medication than on placebo (n = 28, 1 RCT, RR 6.07, 95% CI 0.86 to 43.04). This may be a consequence of the low number of trials and low participant numbers in these trials (see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was some evidence that zuclopenthixol increased the likelihood of patients experiencing more 'sleepiness/sedation' than placebo (n = 28, 1 RCT, RR 2.89 95% CI 1.01 to 8.3). There was little evidence on whether zuclopenthixol was different to non-pharmacological treatment (e.g. psychotherapeutic methods, community care or no care at all) in terms of genuine improvements in patients' mental health.</P>
<P>The dose range of oral zuclopenthixol in these studies was 150 mg to 205 mg/day.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Compared to chlorpromazine</HEADING>
<P>Again, despite a large number of participants in this comparison, data were lacking and only available for the short term. Chlorpromazine increases the likelihood of patients leaving a study early (n = 766, 6 RCTs, RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.81), though the reasons for this can only be hypothesised as being related to treatment as a whole as this information was not directly reported or commented on by the researchers. This information is probably only of use to researchers and caution should be used in transferring this result into community or inpatient settings (see <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>More side-effects were reported in patients on chlorpromazine (identified using the CGI; n = 94, 1 RCT, RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.97). Additional medication was used for patients on chlorpromazine and zuclopenthixol (trihexphenidyl, scopolamine, benzhexol and diazepam), but there are no data on frequency so inferring likelihood of use in clinical practice is difficult. The evidence does not help us decide to prescribe outside the usual clinical need. There was no evidence that zuclopenthixol was different to chlorpromazine with regards to improvements in patients' mental health.</P>
<P>The dose range of oral zuclopenthixol in these studies was 25 mg to 600 mg/day and the dose range of chlorpromazine was 100 mg to 1800 mg/day.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Compared to chlorprothixene</HEADING>
<P>The evidence for this comparison is severely limited (see <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>). More research is needed in the form of high-quality randomised controlled trials.</P>
<P>The dose of oral zuclopenthixol in this single study was 50 mg to 200 mg/day and the dose range of chlorprothixene was 150 mg to 600 mg/day.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Compared to clozapine</HEADING>
<P>Data were severely lacking for this comparison with no information about global state or mental state changes (see <LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>). Zuclopenthixol appears to have lower likelihood (at face value) of patients reporting 'stimulation', 'confusion', 'GI', 'dizziness', 'orthostatic reaction', 'headache', 'hypersalivation' and 'hyperkinesia' side-effects than clozapine. Conversely, there is an increased likelihood of reporting 'anticholinergic', 'hypokinesia', 'rigor' and 'tremor' side-effects.</P>
<P>The dose range of oral zuclopenthixol in this single study was 100 mg/day and the dose range of clozapine was 200 mg to 300 mg/day.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Compared to haloperidol</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="SOF-05" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 5</LINK> demonstrates the poverty of information available for this comparison. No differences were detected for any of the outcomes when the dose range of oral zuclopenthixol was 40 mg to 205 mg/day and the dose range of haloperidol was4 mg to 12.3 mg/day. It is unlikely that there are no differences between the two medications, but we cannot infer any conclusions based on the current available evidence.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Compared to perphenazine</HEADING>
<P>Patients did not leave a study any earlier whilst prescribed perphenazine or zuclopenthixol in the medium term (n = 104, 2 RCTs, RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.47). Caution should be used in translating this information into clinical practice, but this is useful to those carrying out research.</P>
<P>Zuclopenthixol has a greater likelihood of EPSEs that require medication (n = 50, 1 RCT, RR 1.90, 95% CI 1.12 to 3.22). The number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) is 2.8, thus on average, 2.8 patients would have to receive zuclopenthixol treatment (instead of perphenazine treatment) for one additional patient to require medication for EPSEs. Any patients prescribed zuclopenthixol should be advised that this is the case and appropriate clinical caution should be taken (asking patients about EPSEs on each contact and/or consideration to EPSE rating scales). There is no evidence on how frequently this should be done.</P>
<P>The dose range of oral zuclopenthixol in this single study was 10 mg to 250 mg/day and the dose range of perphenazine was 8 mg to 72 mg/day. See <LINK REF="SOF-06" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 6</LINK>.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Compared to risperidone</HEADING>
<P>The baseline average PANSS general score of 26.4 SD 5.5 reduced to an average score of 19.3 SD 1.8 for patients on zuclopenthixol. The patients in the risperidone arm scored higher baseline averages (32.4 SD 6.2) and experienced a reduction in average scores at follow-up (21.7 SD 2.9) that were roughly equivalent to zuclopenthixol. Despite the disparity in the patient baseline mental states (worse mental states in the risperidone arm), in the short term, there was a clear difference in favour of zuclopenthixol in the PANSS General score (n = 19, 1 RCT, MD -2.40, 95% CI -4.52 to -0.28).</P>
<P>The baseline average PANSS positive score of 19.1 SD 3.0 reduced to an average score of 9.8 SD 1.9 for patients on zuclopenthixol. The patients in the risperidone arm had similar baseline averages (20.9 SD 4.4) and experienced a similar reduction in average scores at follow-up (10.8 SD 2.4). In the medium term there was no difference seen (n = 25, 1 RCT, MD -1.00, 95% CI -2.69 to 0.69).</P>
<P>Additional medication use (benzodiazepines and anticholinergics) in the short and medium term was associated with both antipsychotics, but frequency of use was the only data reported by the RCTs. No clear difference is observed at face value.</P>
<P>In the short term, zuclopenthixol has a greater likelihood of EPSEs requiring medication than risperidone (n = 98, 1 RCT RR 1.92, 95% CI 1.12 to 3.28, NNTH = 4). Any patients prescribed zuclopenthixol should be advised that this is the case and appropriate clinical caution should be taken (asking patients about EPSEs on each contact and/or consideration to EPSE rating scales). There is no evidence on how frequently this should be done.</P>
<P>For the dose ranges (zuclopenthixol 3.8 mg to 38 mg/day, risperidone 1.9 mg to 8 mg/day) in the included trials, the evidence seems to suggest some clinical benefit for using zuclopenthixol over risperidone, in terms of mental state measured using the PANNS, both in the short and medium term. There is some indication in the short term at these doses that zuclopenthixol will lead to more EPSEs that need medication than risperidone, but both are associated with additional medication use, specifically benzodiazepines and anticholinergics (see <LINK REF="SOF-07" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 7</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Compared to sulpiride</HEADING>
<P>For the outcomes in the protocol, very limited evidence exists for this comparison. In the short term, no clear differences were detected causing patients to leave the study early for any reason, in the requirement of hypnotics and/or sedatives, in the global state measured using the CGI and in the mental state measured using the BPRS. Amitriptyline was used four times in the zuclopenthixol group and four times in the sulpiride group, suggesting that the occurrence of mood symptoms could be similar for patients prescribed both antipsychotics (see <LINK REF="SOF-08" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 8</LINK>).</P>
<P>More research is needed in the form of high-quality randomised controlled trials.</P>
<P>The dose of oral zuclopenthixol in this single study was 25 mg to 150 mg/day and the dose range of sulpiride was 200 mg to 1200 mg/day.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Compared to thiothixene</HEADING>
<P>Extremely limited evidence is available for this comparison and only in the medium term. No clear difference was detected causing patients to leave the study early for any reason (n = 20, 1 RCT, RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.35) or in global state scores using the CGI (n = 20, 1 RCT, RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.46). More research is needed in the form of high-quality randomised controlled trials.</P>
<P>The dose of oral zuclopenthixol in this single study was 50 mg to 200 mg/day and the dose range of thiothixene was 10 mg to 40 mg/day (see <LINK REF="SOF-09" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 9</LINK>).</P>

<P>Evidence for this comparison was limited only to the longer term, where there was no clear difference detected causing patients to leave the study early for any reason (n = 46, 1 RCT, RR 1.95, 95% CI 0.36 to 10.58). More research is needed in the form of high quality-randomised controlled trials.</P>
<P>The dose of oral zuclopenthixol in this single study was 35 mg/day and the dose of depot was 233 mg every 14 days (see <LINK REF="SOF-11" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 11</LINK>).</P>

<P>Dry mouth, disturbance of accommodation, disturbance of urination, constipation, dizziness, headache, increased sweating, drowsiness, anxiety, parkinsonism, akathisia, tardive dyskinesia and 'others' were reported for both isomers but no data were presented.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Completeness</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.1 Relevance of the evidence to the review question</HEADING>
<P>Zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride is generally used for patients with a psychotic illness and predominantly those with schizophrenia-spectrum diagnoses. The primary and secondary outcomes of this review (death, service outcomes, mental state, leaving the study early, general functioning, behaviour, adverse effects, engagement with services, satisfaction with treatment, quality of life and economic) were not generally the primary focus of the included evidence. The extracted data were predominantly around mental state, leaving the study early, general functioning and adverse effects. Much of the data were obtained from rating scales which are not always used in clinical practice but are heavily used in research.</P>
<P>The included papers focused on (1) behaviour and therapeutic effect (versus placebo); (2) efficacy, dosage, tolerance and safety (versus chlorpromazine); (3) efficacy, dosage, tolerance and safety (versus clozapine); (4) efficacy, dosage, tolerance and safety (versus haloperidol); (5) efficacy, dosage, tolerance and safety (versus trifluoperazine); (6) clinical profile (versus perphenazine); (7) efficacy, tolerability, baseline and follow-up basal ganglia volumes, executive functions, selective attention and reaction times (versus risperidone); (8) no clear focus (versus thiothixene and chlorprothixene); (9) violence reduction (versus depot zuclopenthixol) and (10) serum levels and clinical effect (versus zuclopenthixol isomers).</P>
<P>The main interventions of the included studies were antipsychotics and the outcomes were generally related to this. None of the included studies covered other psycho-social aspects.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.2 Overall judgement of the external validity of the review</HEADING>
<P>Data were obtained predominantly for the short term (up to 12 weeks) and for inpatient populations. Some data were obtained for the medium term (13 to 26 weeks). Longer-term data (&gt; 26 weeks) were obtained only for depot zuclopenthixol. The studies were conducted either in Europe or North America (though this update does add some Chinese research).</P>
<P>The majority of trials involved inpatient participants with little in the way of physical and psychiatric co-morbidity and with well-defined schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Such people are a minority in everyday care, where it is the norm to find people (not in a hospital setting) who suffer from less well-defined illnesses combined with problems such as depression, personality disorder and substance abuse/misuse. Much of the data were obtained from rating scales which are not always used in clinical practice but are heavily used in research.</P>
<P>The results of this study can be generalised in a limited capacity in the short term (up to 12 weeks) to inpatient populations based mainly in European and American healthcare systems that are similar to those during the period 1968 to 2008.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Applicability of findings</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.1 The results and current practice</HEADING>
<P>Current practice is unlikely to be significantly changed in Europe or the USA by the results of this meta-analysis. The results do continue to support the importance of reviewing patients for EPSEs when they are prescribed oral zuclopenthixol, but advice on frequency of monitoring cannot be drawn from the data included. Much of the data focus on older antipsychotics, which tend to be used as second- or third-line agents currently (including zuclopenthixol), though the data on superiority/inferiority were lacking and limited to only nine comparisons.</P>
<P>Small but significant improvements in average endpoint mental states are seen with zuclopenthixol when compared to the newer risperidone, but at the cost of an increased chance of EPSEs requiring further medication in the form of anticholinergics and benzodiazepines. Again, of the newer agents, evidence was only found for risperidone and clozapine, thus not allowing us to comment on the wide range of other newer anti-psychotics.</P>
<P>The evidence is primarily generated from inpatient samples and caution should be given to using the results for patients in the community, general hospital settings or outpatient departments. The dose range of oral zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride across all of the included studies was 10 mg to 600 mg/day.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.2 The results and current international practice</HEADING>
<P>The authors of this paper are not familiar with all areas of current international clinical practice and advise caution interpreting and generalising the findings of this update to areas outside of Europe and the USA where healthcare systems could be very different from those covered in the included studies.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">1. Possibility of a robust conclusion</HEADING>
<P>The evidence identified in this review is only for 12 comparisons (n = 1850, 20 RCTs, 1968 to 2008), and most of these comparisons are for older antipsychotics and/or antipsychotics that are not used commonly in clinical practice currently.</P>
<P>The largest study had 723 participants but the majority of studies were small. Data were obtained for patients with a psychotic illness and predominantly those with schizophrenia-spectrum diagnoses. The evidence was mainly for the short term (up to 12 weeks) and for inpatient populations. Some data were obtained for the medium term (13-26 weeks) and longer-term data (&gt; 26 weeks) were obtained only for depot zuclopenthixol.</P>
<P>The included studies were all RCTs of varying degrees of quality though no significant key methodological flaws were detected. Inconsistency of results between RCTs was difficult to assess given the small number of included studies and the wide number of non-equal comparisons.</P>
<P>This makes drawing robust conclusions about the use of zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride for schizophrenia in the broader sense more difficult.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">2. Overall quality of the evidence</HEADING>
<P>The overall quality of the evidence contributing to the findings of this review ranged from very low to medium, with much of the evidence falling into either very low to low quality using GRADE. The reasons for the down grading of the included evidence was mostly because of biases (reporting, selection, Berkson, publication and attrition), and these reasons are clarified in the footnote section of each 'Summary of findings' table.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">1. Preventing biases: strengths</HEADING>
<P>The Cochrane systematic review process is designed to prevent and minimise biases introduced by authors of reviews. A single review author (EJB), independently of the original co-authors (AK and DS), and at a different point in time, re-appraised the original papers for inclusion in the review update in addition to appraising the suitability of new evidence for inclusion.</P>
<P>EJB utilised a strict system of appraisal of evidence as guided by the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I>
<I> (</I>
<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) and attempted to contact the original authors where possible/appropriate. At several stages in the review process, a 10% sample of appraised papers, included papers and extracted data was assessed by review author MAP to ensure consensus was reached.</P>
<P>EJB has no known conflicts of interest.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">2. Preventing biases: limitations</HEADING>
<P>A systematic review is only ever as good at preventing bias in the findings as the original evidence used in determining the findings. For example, the review data are predominantly from inpatient samples, so the review findings are predominantly focused on this patient population. The review cannot correct for many of the biases of the original evidence. There may also be biases introduced through the systematic approach that cannot be controlled/minimised. The methods used to identify the evidence could have introduced biases at different stages e.g. searching, study selection, data collection, analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">3. Missing relevant studies</HEADING>
<P>Judging by the preponderance of small positive studies included in this review update, it is likely that not all evidence has been identified. Several of the papers included had results published that could not be extracted for meta-analysis, even though they may have been relevant to the review question.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-10-19 13:37:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The previous incarnation of this review suggested oral zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride caused movement disorders, perhaps more so than newer antipsychotics, but no more frequently than other older antipsychotics. This update agrees partially with these conclusions (it does cause movement disorders), but restricts their breadth as data were only obtained for two newer agents (clozapine and risperidone) and only for seven older agents. The only two comparisons that suggested oral zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride caused more EPSEs was with perphenazine and risperidone. There was no significant evidence of more EPSEs being reported when compared to placebo. More side-effects were reported with chlorpromazine than with zuclopenthixol.</P>
<P>Additionally, the previous version of this review indicated that oral zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride may offer a clinical advantage in terms of global state over other older alternatives in the short term, but would need to be taken with additional medication to temper the sequelae of EPSEs. The results of this update do not support this statement, at least for the comparisons where data were obtained.</P>
<P>This update suggests zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride only has a modest clinical advantage with regards to mental state (measured on the PANSS) when compared to risperidone only (short term).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. For people with schizophrenia</HEADING>
<P>There is evidence that zuclopenthixol causes movement disorders that require additional medication, but no more so than other agents (excepting perphenazine and risperidone where it caused more, and chlorpromazine where it caused less). There is some suggestion from this review update that oral zuclopenthixol may have some clinical advantage with regards to improvements in mental state compared to risperidone in the short term. There was no evidence of a disadvantage or advantage when compared to the other agents in this review.</P>
<P>No significant data were obtained for the following outcomes: death, global state, general functioning, quality of life or satisfaction with treatment. This leaves patients with schizophrenia with a difficult decision to make when deciding on whether to take zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride versus another agent. It should still remain an option for treatment.</P>
<P>If an older drug is going to be used though, zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride is a viable option, but may be best taken with additional medication to offset movement disorders.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. For family/care-givers of people with schizophrenia</HEADING>
<P>There is no relevant data from the included research that pertain to this important dimension of care in the update. There is evidence that zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride causes movement disorders, thus it is important that care-givers/family are aware of the relevant symptoms/signs, that they have clear and straightforward ways to seek help and that they know what to do in the event of an emergency.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">3. For clinicians</HEADING>
<P>There is no evidence that zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride is any worse than other compounds and some indications that it is in fact better. Any difference in the isomers is speculative, but there are some data to suggest a real advantage in improvements in mental state scores in comparison with risperidone in the short term only.</P>
<P>As with other older generation drugs, the use of zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride is tainted by the need for drugs to counter movement disorders. All patients commenced on zuclopenthixol should be advised of the potential for movement disorders and the likely need for additional medication. The patient on zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride should have regular reviews for such side-effects as this may affect adherence to treatment and engagement with services, though evidence for this is lacking.</P>
<P>There are no significant data for death, global states, service outcomes, general functioning, behaviour, engagement with services, satisfaction with treatment or quality of life, which leaves clinicians without a definitive answer when deciding whether or not to suggest zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride in the treatment of schizophrenia. What data are available are mostly for inpatient samples in Western healthcare systems.</P>
<P>The evidence does suggest that zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride should remain an option in the treatment of schizophrenia where indicated, though the clinical effects may be more pronounced in inpatient samples than for other populations.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">4. For managers/policy makers</HEADING>
<P>There are no data on service outcomes and no medium- or long-term data. In the context of finite resources, the lack of good quality data leaves managers and policy makers with difficult decisions to make. Zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride should remain a choice in the treatment of people for whom older generation drugs are indicated.<BR/>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. General</HEADING>
<P>If the recommendations of the CONSORT statement (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>) had been anticipated by trialists much more data would have been available. Allocation concealment is essential for the result of a trial to be considered valid and gives the assurance that selection bias is kept to the minimum. Well-described and tested blinding could have encouraged confidence in the control of performance and detection bias. It is also important to know how many, and from which groups, people were withdrawn, in order to evaluate exclusion bias. It would have been helpful if authors had presented data in a useful manner that reflects association between intervention and outcome, for example, relative risk, odds-ratio, risk or mean differences, as well as raw numbers. Binary outcomes should be calculated in preference to continuous results, as they are easier to interpret. If P values are used, the exact value should be reported.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.1 Reviews</HEADING>
<P>From the excluded studies there are several reviews that are suggested. This review, although far from complete, will not need updating again in the future unless any significant, large multi-centre double-blind randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are published. Each of the comparisons in this review would potentially serve as a review in its own right.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.2 Trials</HEADING>
<P>We do think that more trials are indicated. These should not only be large and long, but should also adhere to a pragmatic design in order to increase applicability. Methods should be strict and involve good concealment of allocation and follow-up. Participants should be people recognisable in everyday life and not those who are so strictly diagnosed as to render them unrecognisable to routine care.</P>
<P>Interventions should involve standard doses of zuclopenthixol and a control drug that is a real choice in the region of the study. This could equally be a new generation drugs such as risperidone, or an older medication such as chlorpromazine. Outcomes should be measured over months rather than weeks as this is the usual period a person would be asked to take the drug. We suggest that if scales are to be used, validated and clinically meaningful outcomes are pre-defined.</P>
<P>Routine outcomes such as relapse, employment, housing status, satisfaction with care, serious or troubling adverse effects can all be easily recorded without the use of scales and we would suggest that these are included in the design of the study. Quality of life measures were generally missing from the trials and we would advocate for more studies including this outcome.</P>

<P>Differences have previously been clarified in the methods section. The main difference is in the comparisons (four in the original review and 12 in the update).</P>
<P>In the original publication the authors completed the following analyses (<LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>).</P>
<OL>
<LI>Zuclopenthixol versus placebo (only short term)</LI>
<LI>Zuclopenthixol versus other typical antipsychotics (only short term)</LI>
<LI>Zuclopenthixol versus atypical antipsychotics (only short term)</LI>
<LI>Cis (Z) zuclopenthixol versus cis (Z)/Trans (E) zuclopenthixol (only short term)</LI>
</OL>
<P>For this update the original four analyses were modified and adapted in an attempt to reflect the evidence base for realistic clinical questions e.g. Should I use zuclopenthixol instead of clozapine? It was felt that the original four comparisons were misleading to clinicians, patients and policy makers as they suggested that zuclopenthixol had been compared to all other possible antipsychotics. This was not the original authors intent.</P>
<P>This review update identified comparisons against nine alternative antipsychotics, only two of which were newer atypicals. Comparisons one and four remain and have been updated (see below).</P>

<APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2017-10-25 14:23:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>1. Selection of trials<BR/>We independently inspected the citations identified from the search. We identified potentially relevant abstracts and ordered full papers and reassessed these for inclusion and methodological quality. We discussed and reported any disagreement.</P>
<P>2. Quality assessment<BR/>We allocated trials to three quality categories, as described in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). When disputes arose as to which category a trial was allocated, again, we attempted resolution by discussion. When this was not possible and further information was necessary to clarify into which category to allocate the trial, we did not enter data but allocated the trial to the list of those awaiting assessment. We only included trials in Category A or B in the review.</P>
<P>3. Data management</P>
<P>3.1 Data extraction<BR/>We independently extracted data from selected trials. When disputes arose, we attempted resolution by discussion. When this was not possible and further information was necessary to resolve the dilemma, we did not enter data but added this outcome of the trial to the list of those awaiting assessment.</P>
<P>3.2 Intention to treat analysis<BR/>We excluded data from studies where more than 50% of participants in any group were lost to follow up, except for the outcome of 'leaving the study early'. In studies with less than 50% dropout rate, everyone allocated to the intervention was counted whether or not they completed follow up. We considered those leaving early to have had the negative outcome, except for the event of death and adverse effects.</P>
<P>Where attrition rates were high (25-50%), we analysed the impact of including this type of data in a sensitivity analysis. If inclusion of high attrition data resulted in a substantive change in the estimate of effect, then we did not pool this data, but presented the data separately.</P>
<P>4. Data analysis</P>
<P>4.1 Binary data<BR/>For binary outcomes we calculated a standard estimate of the relative risk (RR) and its 95% confidence intervals (CI) (fixed effect). Where possible, we estimated the number needed to treat (NNT) using an on-line calculator (http://www.nntonline.net/). If heterogeneity was found (see section 5) we used a random-effects model.</P>
<P>4.2 Continuous data<BR/>4.2.1 Intention-to-treat analyses versus analyses that only take into account those who completed the study: in the case of continuous data, it was supposed that in many cases an intention-to-treat analysis would not be available, so an analysis was presented on those who completed the study.</P>
<P>4.2.2 Rating scales: A wide range of instruments are available to measure mental health outcomes. These instruments vary in quality and it has been shown that the use of rating scales which have not been described in a peer-reviewed journal (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>) are associated with bias, or may not be valid, or even ad hoc. Therefore, some minimum standards were set: (a) the psychometric properties of the instrument should have been described in a peer-reviewed journal; (b) the instrument should either be a self-report, or completed by an independent rater or relative (not the therapist); and (c) the instrument should be a global assessment of an area of functioning.</P>
<P>4.2.3 Normal distribution of data: mental health continuous data are often not normally distributed. Most statistics assume a normal distribution. To avoid including non-normally distributed data in the statistical analysis we applied the following criteria to all data before inclusion:</P>
<P>a. Standard deviations and means were reported or derivable from data in the paper, or were obtainable from the authors.<BR/>b. When a scale started from zero, the standard deviation, when multiplied by two, was less than the mean (as otherwise the mean was unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>)). Endpoint scores on scales often have a finite start and end point and this rule can be applied to them.<BR/>c. When continuous data are presented on a scale which includes a possibility of negative values (such as change on a scale) it is impossible to tell whether data are non-normally distributed (skewed) or not. It is thus preferable to use scale end point data, which typically cannot have negative values. If end point data were not available, we chose to use change data, because the statistics used in Metaview are rather robust towards skew.<BR/>d. If a scale starts from a positive value (such as PANSS, which can have values from 30-210) the calculation described above in (b) should be modified to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skew is present if 2SD&gt; (S-Smin), where S is the mean score and Smin is the minimum score.</P>
<P>4.2.4 Endpoint versus change data: where possible, we presented endpoint data and if both endpoint and change data were available for the same outcomes then we only reported the former in this review.</P>
<P>4.2.5 Summary statistic: For continuous outcomes we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD) and respective 95% CI (fixed effect). If heterogeneity was found (see section 5) we used a random effects model.</P>
<P>4.3 Cluster trials<BR/>Studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Firstly, authors often fail to account for intra class correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) whereby p values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This causes type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Where clustering was not accounted for in primary studies, we presented the data in a table, with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review we will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intra-class correlation co-efficients of their clustered data and to adjust for this using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Where clustering has been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we will also present these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjusted for the clustering effect.</P>
<P>We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a 'design effect'. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the intraclass correlation co-efficient (ICC) [Design effect = 1+(m-1)*ICC] (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC was not reported it was assumed to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Where cluster studies were appropriately analysed taking into account intra-class correlation coefficients and relevant data documented in the report, synthesis with other studies was possible using the generic inverse variance technique.</P>
<P>5. Test for inconsistency<BR/>Firstly, consideration of all the included studies within any comparison was undertaken to estimate clinical heterogeneity. Then visual inspection of graphs was used to investigate the possibility of statistical heterogeneity. This was supplemented employing, primarily, the I-squared statistic. This provides an estimate of the percentage of inconsistency thought to be due to chance. Where the I-squared estimate included 75% this was interpreted as evidence of high levels of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). Data were then re-analysed using a random effects model to see if this made a substantial difference. If it did, and results became more consistent, falling below 75% in the estimate, the studies were added to the main body trials. If using the random effects model did not make a difference and inconsistency remained high, data were not summated, but were presented separately and reasons for heterogeneity investigated.</P>
<P>6. Addressing publication bias<BR/>We entered all data from the included studies into a funnel graph (trial effect against trial size) in an attempt to investigate the likelihood of overt publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>7. Sensitivity analyses<BR/>The effect of including studies with high attrition rates was analysed in a sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>8. General<BR/>Where possible, we entered data in such a way that the area to the left of the line of no effect indicated a favourable outcome for zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride.</P>

<P>1. The search<BR/>We found a total of 85 citations using the search strategy. Out of these 85 only 26 fulfilled the criteria for our review.<BR/>
<BR/>2. COMPARISON 1. ZUCLOPENTHIXOL versus PLACEBO<BR/>
<BR/>This comparison included two studies (total n=74). Neither study reported global or mental state outcomes.<BR/>
<BR/>2.1 Adverse effects<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Serafetinides-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Serafetinides 1972</LINK> showed that zuclopenthixol is associated with less orthostatic adverse effects than placebo but not to conventional levels of statistical significance (n=28, 1 RCT, RR 0.29, CI 0.01 to 6.60). The two studies, <LINK REF="STD-Serafetinides-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Serafetinides 1972</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kordas-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Kordas 1968</LINK>, reported different extrapyramidal adverse effects but overall zuclopenthixol did increase a persons risk of having any of these symptoms compared with placebo (n=64, RR 5.37, CI 1.12 to 29.34 NNH 2 CI 2 to 31). Other adverse effects reported by <LINK REF="STD-Serafetinides-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Serafetinides 1972</LINK> were excitation, sleepiness/sedation and weight change. Excitation, sleepiness/sedation were more prominent with zuclopenthixol than placebo (n=28, 1 RCT, RR 2.89, CI 1.01 to 8.30 NNH 3 CI 2 to 435). However weight gain/loss of ten pounds showed that people in the placebo group were no more prone to lose/gain weight than those in the zuclopenthixol group (n=28, 1 RCT, RR 0.43 CI 0.17 to 1.11).<BR/>
<BR/>2.2 Leaving the study early<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Serafetinides-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Serafetinides 1972</LINK> reported leaving the study early due to adverse effects and we found fewer people allocated zuclopenthixol left in the short term compared with those given placebo. However these did not meet conventional levels of statistical significance (n=28, RR 0.29 CI 0.01 to 6.6).<BR/>
<BR/>3. COMPARISON 2. ZUCLOPENTHIXOL versus OTHER TYPICAL ANTIPSYCHOTICS (only short term)<BR/>
<BR/>This comparison included ten studies (total n=478).<BR/>
<BR/>3. 1 Global state<BR/>Seven studies presented categorical data on global state and reported these in different ways. We were most frequently able to extract data on the short term outcome of unchanged or worse. Being allocated to the various control drugs was significantly associated with being unchanged or worse, compared with being given zuclopenthixol (n=357, 7 RCTs, RR 0.72 CI 0.53 to 0.98, NNT 10 CI 6 to 131).<BR/>
<BR/>3.2 Mental state<BR/>There appeared to be no significant difference between about 122 mg/day zuclopenthixol and about 435 mg/day chlorpromazine, on BPRS as a continuous outcome measure (n=41, 1 RCT, WMD -2.66 CI -9.09 to 3.77). Other BPRS and CPRS data that were too skewed to present graphically also did not point to any difference between groups.<BR/>
<BR/>3.3 Adverse effects<BR/>Several studies report general adverse effects. None of the findings suggest any clear difference between zuclopenthixol and other typical antipsychotics across a whole range of effects, including movement disorders (n=280, 6 RCTs, RR needing additional antiparkinsonian medication 1.07 CI 0.86 to 1.33) and general agitation (n=162, 3 RCTs, RR needing treatment with hypnotic/sedative drugs 1.09 CI 0.76 to 1.56).<BR/>
<BR/>Zuclopenthixol did not clearly cause more adverse effects than other typical antipsychotics.<BR/>
<BR/>3.4 Leaving the study early<BR/>Although two studies did report the reasons for leaving the study early, most simply stated that people had left and did not specify causes. Fewer people allocated zuclopenthixol left in the short term compared with those given other typical antipsychotics (n=424, 22% vs 30%, 8 RCTs, RR 0.70 CI 0.51 to 0.95, NNT 12 CI 7 to 67).<BR/>
<BR/>4. COMPARISON 3. ZUCLOPENTHIXOL versus ATYPICAL ANTIPSYCHOTICS (only short term)<BR/>
<BR/>This comparison included three studies (total n=233).<BR/>
<BR/>4.1 Global state<BR/>Only Huttunen 1995 presented categorical data on global state. We were able to extract data on the short term outcome of unchanged or worse. There was no clear difference between zuclopenthixol and risperidone for the outcome of being 'unchanged or worse' (n=98, 1 RCT, RR 1.30 CI 0.80 to 2.11).<BR/>
<BR/>4.2 Mental state<BR/>There appeared to be no significant difference between zuclopenthixol and risperidone on 'no clinical response' (n=98, 1 RCT, RR not achieving at least 20% reduction in PANSS total score 1.39 CI 0.92 to 2.10). Other, skewed data, for BPRS also did not show any difference between groups.<BR/>
<BR/>4.3 Adverse effects<BR/>Three studies comparing zuclopenthixol with atypical antipsychotics reported different adverse effects. Huttunen 1995 reported general adverse effects (n=98) but showed no difference between the two groups. Fischer 1976 reported different specific autonomic adverse effects (n=74): gastrointestinal adverse effects, anticholinergic adverse effects, orthostatic reaction, headache, hypersalivation and dizziness. Again we found no significant differences between those allocated zuclopenthixol and those given atypical antipsychotics.<BR/>
<BR/>Huttunen 1995 and Fischer 1976 recorded the different aspects of extrapyramidal adverse effects: needing antiparkinsonian medication, hypokinesia, hyperkinesia, rigor, tremor and akathisia. Huttunen 1995 showed that the zuclopenthixol group had been prescribed with antiparkinsonian medication more frequently compared to people treated with risperidone (n=98, 1 RCT, RR 1.92 CI 1.12 to 3.28, NNH 3 CI 3 to 17). Psychic adverse effects (drowsiness, stimulation, confusion) reported by Fischer 1976, were not different between zuclopenthixol and clozapine (n=74).<BR/>
<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Mahadevan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Mahadevan 1991</LINK> reported weight change as continuous data. We found no significant difference between people allocated zuclopenthixol and those given sulpiride (n=61, 1 RCT, WMD 1.60 CI 8.35 to 5.15).<BR/>
<BR/>4.4 Leaving the study early<BR/>Huttunen 1995 and <LINK REF="STD-Mahadevan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Mahadevan 1991</LINK> reported the outcome leaving the study early (45% vs 30%) and we found that fewer people allocated atypical antipsychotics left in the short term compared with those given zuclopenthixol but not to conventional levels of statistical significance (n=159, 2 RCTs, RR 1.48 CI 0.98 to 2.22).<BR/>
<BR/>5. COMPARISON 4. CIS- (Z) ZUCLOPENTHIXOL versus CIS (Z)+TRANS (E) FORM OF ZUCLOPENTHIXOL (only short term)<BR/>
<BR/>This comparison included four studies (total n=140).<BR/>
<BR/>5.1 Global state<BR/>Three studies <LINK REF="STD-Gravem-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Gravem 1978</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gravem-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Gravem 1981</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Heikkila-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Heikkila 1981</LINK>a reported the outcome unchanged or worse in the category of global state but found no difference between the groups (n=131, RR 1.08 CI 0.76 to 1.52).<BR/>
<BR/>5.2 Adverse effects<BR/>General adverse effects were reported by the same studies. None of the findings suggest any clear difference between cis (z) clopenthixol and cis (z)+ trans (e) clopenthixol (n=131, 3 RCTs, RR interfering with functioning/outweighing therapeutic effect 0.75 CI 0.46 to 1.22).<BR/>
<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Gravem-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Gravem 1981</LINK> (n=20) found no difference for the frequency of treatment of extrapyramidal adverse effects between the isomers (n=20, RR 1.40, CI 0.67 to 2.94). <LINK REF="STD-Gravem-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Gravem 1978</LINK> (n=57) provided data for the outcome 'sedation'. Again these researchers found no clear differences between the isomers (RR 0.19 CI 0.02 to 1.55).<BR/>
<BR/>5.3 Leaving the study early<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Aaes_x002d_Jorgensen-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Aaes-Jorgensen 1981</LINK>b and <LINK REF="STD-Gravem-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Gravem 1981</LINK> did not show any significant difference for the outcome leaving the study early by only one week (n=29, 2 RCTs, RR 5.0 CI 0.27 to 92.62).</P>

<P>1. The studies<BR/>Zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride has been widely proposed as a product specifically designed for the management of schizophrenia for inpatients and outpatients (<LINK REF="STD-Bhattacharya-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Bhattacharya 1987</LINK>). Low frequency of adverse effects and good tolerability has also been stressed by open clinical studies and materials produced for marketing purposes (<LINK REF="STD-Gravem-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Gravem 1981</LINK>). In this systematic search for controlled clinical trials we found a small number of studies, some presenting important methodological flaws.<BR/>
<BR/>1.1 Applicability of findings<BR/>The studies were conducted either in Europe or North America. The majority of trials involved inpatient participants with little in the way of physical and psychiatric co-morbidity and with well-defined schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Such people are a minority in everyday care, where it is the norm to find people (not in a hospital setting) who suffer from less well defined illnesses combined with problems such as depression and substance abuse.<BR/>
<BR/>1.2 Limited data, confusing data<BR/>The collection and quality of the data reported was very variable. All included studies reported data only for the short term (less than 12 weeks). To further undermine the value of the studies, many reported mean figures without giving the standard deviation and therefore these averages were meaningless.<BR/>
<BR/>Among the 12 groups of defined outcomes, only five were addressed by the studies. We found no data on hospital and services outcomes, engagement with services, satisfaction with treatment and economic outcomes. There was a lack of information on outcomes that are clinically important such as death, general functioning, behaviour, treatment and hospitalisation. For such a widely used drug there are surprisingly few data. Outcomes were commonly reported using graphs and p-values instead of tables and confidence intervals. The excessive use of graphs did not allow us to acquire sufficient numbers to calculate many measures of effectiveness.<BR/>
<BR/>1.3 Quality of studies<BR/>We appreciate that studies in this population group bring unique difficulties. There were however important methodological difficulties with the trials and therefore any conclusions must be viewed with caution. There is a danger of inclusion of at least a moderate risk of bias in these results (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>2. ZUCLOPENTHIXOL versus PLACEBO (only short term)<BR/>
<BR/>This comparison included two short, small studies (total n=74) but it is a pity that neither reported global or mental state outcomes. Even from the few data there is indication that zuclopenthixol increases a persons risk of having extrapyramidal adverse effects compared with placebo (NNH 2 CI 2 to 31). Zuclopenthixol is also sedating (NNH 3 CI 2 to 435) but does not definitely cause weight gain in the short term. These may not be unexpected results to clinicians who frequently administer this drug, but as far as we are aware, this is the first time that these effects have been quantified from the best available data.<BR/>
<BR/>3. ZUCLOPENTHIXOL versus OTHER TYPICAL ANTIPSYCHOTICS (only short term)<BR/>
<BR/>3.1 Global state<BR/>It has often been stated that there is little to choose between one antipsychotic and another. The older drugs are now often placed in one large category but this review does suggest that the compounds may have different levels of efficacy and zuclopenthixol is statistically significantly better than other older drugs in terms of a broad global outcome (n=357, 7 RCTs, RR unchanged or worse 0.72 CI 0.53 to 0.98, NNT 10 CI 6 to 131). However this result comes from small short trials and needs to be replicated. Real differences between drugs could point to subtle effects that can inform future drug design. It is obvious that, like many others, this is an under researched drug and we would be able to ascertain much more concrete evidence regarding the effects of this compound from larger, longer trials.<BR/>
<BR/>3.2 Mental state<BR/>Data relevant to mental state are few and there is insufficient information on this outcome for us to use in this review.<BR/>
<BR/>3.3 Adverse effects<BR/>Zuclopenthixol did not clearly cause greater or lesser adverse effects than other typical antipsychotics. At these moderately high doses however, over half of both the treatment and control groups required additional drugs to offset movement disorders. In comparison to newer treatment regimens and more modern drugs, this must be seen as disadvantage of using oral zuclopenthixol, but no more so than for other older drugs given in similar doses.<BR/>
<BR/>3.4 Leaving the study early<BR/>Many people left these short studies early (22% zuclopenthixol vs 30% control) and data were lost. Although there was less attrition from the zuclopenthixol groups (NNT 12 CI 7 to 67) we would hope, with more modern trial designs, such low follow up could be avoided in the future. It might well be that despite its disadvantages zuclopenthixol is more acceptable than other older drugs which would be an important finding in need of replication.<BR/>
<BR/>4. ZUCLOPENTHIXOL versus ATYPICAL ANTIPSYCHOTICS (only short term)<BR/>
<BR/>We were surprised to find that zuclopenthixol had been compared to the newer generation of drugs. The new generation are most commonly compared to themselves or older drugs such as haloperidol or chlorpromazine. However the studies were too small and short to be truly informative.<BR/>
<BR/>4.1 Global and mental state<BR/>With a study size of more than 98, conducted over a longer period of time, we may have been able to ascertain more definite results in the comparison zuclopenthixol versus risperidone. However, at the present time, in terms of global measures and mental state scores given in the trials we uncovered, zuclopenthixol compares favourably with risperidone.<BR/>
<BR/>4.2 Adverse effects<BR/>If there had been greater standardisation of studies the three relevant trials would not have all reported different adverse effects. With the exception of the movement disorders in terms of general and specific autonomic effects (gastrointestinal, anticholinergic, orthostatic, headache, hypersalivation, dizziness and weight changes), zuclopenthixol was not clearly different from the newer generation of drugs. People did need more additional antiparkinsonian medication however compared to those treated with risperidone (n=98, 1 RCT, RR 1.92 CI 1.12 to 3.28, NNH 3 CI 3 to 17). This is a real practical disadvantage of using zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride, but no more so than for the other older generation drugs.<BR/>
<BR/>4.3 Leaving the study early<BR/>Normal clinical care would not expect loss to follow up of about 38% across six to ten weeks so it is likely that overall study design promotes attrition. Two studies however did suggest that taking zuclopenthixol may be less acceptable than taking either risperidone or sulpiride (45% vs 30% attrition) and that this did not reach conventional levels of statistical significance (n=159, 2 RCTs, RR 1.48 CI 0.98 to 2.22) may be a function of study size and duration.<BR/>
<BR/>5. CIS- (Z) ZUCLOPENTHIXOL versus CIS (Z)+TRANS (E) FORM OF ZUCLOPENTHIXOL (only short term)<BR/>
<BR/>Three studies attempted to highlight differences between the isomers of zuclopenthixol hydrochloride. Studies were small and short and found no clear differences in terms of global state, adverse effects or attrition. Any differences were always likely to be small and therefore studies would have had to be very large, probably with thousands of participants, to highlight clear disparity in effect. In current circumstances, whether or not there really is a clinically meaningful difference between the two isomers is likely to remain unanswered.<BR/>
<BR/>6. Missing data<BR/>There are no data on outcomes relating to service use (e.g. hospitalisation), relapse, satisfaction with care, behaviour and social function. It would be ideal if newer generation drugs were not widely circulated without such data, but we are sceptical that this is the case considering that three of the studies included in this review are trials of zuclopenthixol versus new compounds.<BR/>

<P>Implications for practice<BR/>1. For people with schizophrenia<BR/>There is evidence that zuclopenthixol causes movement disorders, perhaps more so than newer drugs, but no more frequently than the other older generation antipsychotics. There is some suggestion from this review that oral zuclopenthixol may have some clinical advantage over other older drugs in terms of global state, at least in the short term. If an older drug is going to be used, zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride is a viable option but may be best taken with additional medication to offset movement disorders that occur in about half the people taking this drug. If the clinical advantage is real, zuclopenthixol does come in a depot form, and these data support those in the review of the depot zuclopenthixol (Coutinho 2004) suggesting a moderate advantage over other similar compounds.<BR/>
<BR/>2. For clinicians<BR/>There is no evidence that zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride is any worse than other compounds and some indications that it is in fact better. Any difference in the isomers is speculative, but there are some data to suggest a real advantage in comparison with other older drugs. As with other older generation drugs, the use of zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride is tainted by the need for drugs to counter movement disorders. If the advantage, in terms of global effect, over its fellow older generation drugs is real, then zuclopenthixol could be a preferred choice of these older generation drugs. However in light of just these few trials, there does appear to be an advantage for the newer generation of drugs in terms of extrapyramidal adverse effects.<BR/>
<BR/>3. For managers/policy makers<BR/>There are no data on service outcomes and no medium or long term data. In the context of finite resources, the lack of good quality data leaves managers and policy makers with difficult decisions to make. However, the short term data do favour zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride over several of the older drugs and therefore it should remain a choice in the treatment of people for whom older generation drugs are indicated.<BR/>
<BR/>
<BR/>Implications for research<BR/>1. General<BR/>If the recommendations of the CONSORT statement (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>) had been anticipated by trialists much more data would have been available. Allocation concealment is essential for the result of a trial to be considered valid and gives the assurance that selection bias is kept to the minimum. Well-described and tested blinding could have encouraged confidence in the control of performance and detection bias. It is also important to know how many, and from which groups, people were withdrawn, in order to evaluate exclusion bias. It would have been helpful if authors had presented data in a useful manner which reflects association between intervention and outcome, for example, relative risk, odds-ratio, risk or mean differences, as well as raw numbers. Binary outcomes should be calculated in preference to continuous results, as they are easier to interpret. If p-values are used, the exact value should be reported.<BR/>
<BR/>2. Specific<BR/>We do think that more trials are indicated. These should not only be large and long but should also adhere to a pragmatic design in order to increase applicability. Methods should be strict and involve good concealment of allocation and follow up. Participants should be people recognisable in everyday life and not those who are so strictly diagnosed as to render them unrecognisable to routine care. Interventions should involve standard doses of zuclopenthixol and a control drug that is a real choice in the region of the study. This could equally be a new generation drugs such as risperidone, or an older medication such as chlorpromazine. Outcomes should be measured over months rather than weeks as this is the usual period a person would be asked to take the drug. We suggest that if scales are to be used, validated and clinically meaningful outcomes are pre-defined. Routine outcomes such as relapse, employment, housing status, satisfaction with care, serious or troubling adverse effects can all be easily recorded without the use of scales and we would suggest that these are included in the design of the study.</P>
