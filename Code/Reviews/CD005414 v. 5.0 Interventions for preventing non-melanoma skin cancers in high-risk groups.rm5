<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Non-melanoma skin cancer is still the most common cancer in the UK, the United States and Australia. People at increased risk of getting non-melanoma skin cancer include those with lowered immunity, a history of non-melanoma skin cancer, rare inherited genetic skin disorders, trauma to the skin, exposure to arsenic, albinism or having had psoralen and ultraviolet A treatment. Very few studies have been conducted in people at increased risk of NMSC. </P>
<P>For people with Xeroderma pigmentosum (a rare inherited genetic skin disorder) topical application of T4N5 liposome lotion is beneficial in reducing the rate of appearance of new basal cell carcinomas, however it may increase the risk of a new squamous cell carcinoma. Acitretin in renal transplant recipients may be of some benefit, however, high doses of acitretin are associated with an increased number of adverse events. Retinol or a reduced fat diet may be worth trying for people with a history of non-melanoma skin cancer. Further prevention studies for people at increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer are needed. <I>

</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register (March 2007), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (<I>The Cochrane Library Issue</I> 1, 2007, MEDLINE (from 2003 to March 2007), EMBASE (from 2005 to March 2007), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (February 2007). References from trials and reviews were also searched. Pharmaceutical companies were contacted for unpublished trials.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials of adults and children at high risk of developing NMSC. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two review authors independently selected studies and assessed their methodological quality.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-05-27 15:03:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Diane A  Horsley">
<P>We identified 10 trials (7,229 participants) that assessed a variety of interventions.</P>
<P>One trial found T4N5 liposome lotion significantly reduced the rate of appearance of new BCCs in people with xeroderma pigmentosum.</P>
<P>One of three trials of renal transplant recipients showed a significantly reduced risk of new NMSCs when acitretin was compared to placebo (relative risk (RR) 0.22 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06 to 0.90) and no significant difference in risk of adverse events in two trials (RR 1.80, 95% CI 0.70 to 4.61).</P>
<P>In three trials conducted in people with a history of NMSC, the evidence was inconclusive for the development of BCCs for retinol or isoretinoin. However the risk of a new SCC in one trial (HR 1.79, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.76) and adverse events in another trial (RR 1.76, 95% CI 1.57 to 1.97) were significantly increased in the isotretinoin group compared with placebo.</P>
<P>In one trial selenium showed a reduced risk of other types of cancer compared with placebo (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.85) but also a significantly elevated risk of a new NMSC (HR 1.17, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.34). The evidence for one trial of beta-carotene was inconclusive; and there was a trend towards fewer new NMSC in a trial of a reduced fat diet (RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.31), p = 0.09.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Some preventative treatments may benefit people at high risk of developing NMSC, but the ability to draw firm conclusions is limited by small numbers of trials, often with one trial per intervention or with inconsistent results between studies.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-05-27 15:03:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Diane A  Horsley">
<P>Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer in humans (<LINK REF="REF-Martinez-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martinez 2001</LINK>). Around 97% of skin cancers are epithelial in origin and are either basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) or squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), collectively known as non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC). In this review we shall not address precursor lesions for NMSC, i.e. solar keratoses and Bowen's disease.</P>
<P>BCC is defined as a slow-growing, locally invasive, malignant, epidermal skin tumour that mainly affects people with light coloured skins (<LINK REF="REF-Telfer-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Telfer 1999</LINK>). BCCs are the most common malignant growth found in humans and originate from basal cells of the epidermis (<LINK REF="REF-Lang-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lang 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Telfer-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Telfer 1999</LINK>). SCCs are generally more aggressive than BCCs and originate in skin cells that produce keratin. Unlike BCC, which has no reported precursor lesions, there are two principal precursors of SCC: actinic (solar) keratoses (AKs) and Bowen's disease (intra-epidermal carcinoma; IEC), both of which are described as carcinoma-in-situ. SCC is distinguished from carcinoma-in-situ by having an invasive component (i.e. involving connective tissue and blood vessels in the dermis), which can be determined histologically (<LINK REF="REF-Goldman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldman 1998</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Epidemiology</HEADING>
<P>The incidence of NMSC is unclear but is known to increase the closer a person lives to the equator. Using data from 1947 to 1948, from 10 US cities, age-adjusted rates of skin cancer were found to double for each 3°48' of latitude toward the equator (<LINK REF="REF-Auerbach-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">Auerbach 1961</LINK>). In the year 2000 62,200 cases of NMSC were diagnosed in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-CRUK-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">CRUK 2004</LINK>). This is, however, likely to be an under-estimate due to the incomplete registrations of these tumours and the fact that they very rarely lead to death. Increasing numbers of NMSCs are diagnosed and treated within family practice surgeries using destructive techniques such as cryotherapy (tissue destruction by freezing), which preclude histological confirmation of the lesion. Despite this conservative estimate, NMSC is still the most common cancer in the UK, United States and Australia (<LINK REF="REF-Alam-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alam 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eedy-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eedy 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Staples-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Staples 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stern-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stern 1999</LINK>). NMSC accounts for 75% of all cancers in Australia and is approximately 30 times more prevalent than lung cancer among men, and 10 times more common than breast cancer in women (<LINK REF="REF-AIHW-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">AIHW 2003</LINK>). In the USA the incidence is estimated at over one million people per year, which means it is roughly five times more common than prostate and breast cancer (<LINK REF="REF-ACS-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACS 2003</LINK>). In South Wales (United Kingdom) the incidence rate of NMSC between 1988 and 1998 rose from 173.5 to 265.4 per 100,000 per year, an overall increase of 16% for SCC and 66% for BCC (<LINK REF="REF-Holme-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holme 2000</LINK>). In Australia, data from a population based study conducted between 1985 and 1995 showed that incidence rates for BCC increased by 19% to 788 per 100,000, and for SCC there was a 93% rise from 166 to 321 per 100,000 (<LINK REF="REF-Staples-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Staples 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Worldwide, the incidence of BCC shows a continued rise but for SCC there is a varied picture with increasing incidence in some countries and rates reaching a plateau in others (<LINK REF="REF-Harris-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harris 2001</LINK>). This increase in incidence may be due to increased histopathological examination of suspicious lesions, an increased awareness of, and concern about these tumours and an increased number of dermatologists. SCC incidence rates may be levelling off in some countries because a larger number of precursor lesions are being removed by physicians before they can develop into SCCs (<LINK REF="REF-Harris-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harris 2001</LINK>) and through the use of sunscreens, which are thought to be more protective for SCCs than BCCs (<LINK REF="REF-Green-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 1999</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Causes and risk factors</HEADING>
<P>The five year recurrence rate of SCCs is influenced by the anatomical site, degree of differentiation and depth of tumour (<LINK REF="REF-Rowe-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowe 1992</LINK>). SCCs greater than 2 cm in diameter have a 5 year recurrence rate which is double that of an SCC less than 2 cm (<LINK REF="REF-Rowe-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowe 1992</LINK>). If depth of the lesion is greater than 4 mm, the 5 year recurrence rate is 17% (<LINK REF="REF-Rowe-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowe 1992</LINK>), while lesions on the ears or lips (which are generally aggressive) have 2 to 3 times the 5 year recurrence rate of SCC of the same depth in other anatomical regions (<LINK REF="REF-Alam-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alam 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>The most important risk factors for NMSC are thought to be people's age, skin type and exposure to sunlight (ultraviolet (UV) radiation). UV radiation is subdivided, based on wavelength, into UVA (long wave), UVB (burning rays), and UVC (germicidal rays) and it plays a role in NMSC development through several mechanisms. People are not exposed to UVC since the ozone layer filters it out, preventing it from reaching the earth's surface. UVB is responsible for most skin burning after sun exposure. UVA has a longer wavelength and can therefore penetrate the skin more deeply. In addition to causing mutations in DNA, ultraviolet radiation can cause localised immune suppression (<LINK REF="REF-Grossman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grossman 1997</LINK>). Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is also thought to play a role in skin cancer carcinogenesis (<LINK REF="REF-Karagas-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karagas 2006</LINK>)</P>
<P>Normally, the immune system is able to detect early developing NMSCs and clear them effectively. Impairment of the immune system may allow the cancer to develop and prevent it from being rejected by the body.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">High-risk groups</HEADING>
<P>There are subsets of people that are at greater risk of developing NMSC than the general population. The following is not an all inclusive list but covers a broad range of key groups as highlighted from the literature.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">i) Individuals with precursor lesions</HEADING>
<P>People with a precursor lesion are at more risk than the general population of developing a SCC. Not all precursor lesions, however, develop into SCCs. Only 4 to 6% of Bowen's disease transform to SCC (<LINK REF="REF-Eedy-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eedy 2000</LINK>) while the progression rate from AK to SCC ranges from 0.025% to 20% (<LINK REF="REF-Alam-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alam 2001</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">ii) Individuals with a previous NMSC</HEADING>
<P>The risk of developing a subsequent NMSC in people who have developed a first NMSC is not well defined. A critical review and meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Marcil-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marcil 2000</LINK>) has found that for people with fewer than 3 previous NMSCs the risk of developing another NMSC within the following 3 years is 38%. In people with 3 to 9 previous NMSCs this risk rises to 93%. One study found that individuals with more than nine prior NMSCs develop a new NMSC within two years (<LINK REF="REF-Marcil-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marcil 2000</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">iii) Lowered immunity</HEADING>
<P>People who have had organ transplants (OTs) have a three to four fold increased risk of developing any cancer, over the general population. The risk of developing certain malignancies, including NMSC is dramatically higher in people with OTs. One study suggests that people who have had renal (kidney) transplants are 500 times more likely to develop NMSC than the general population (<LINK REF="REF-Hartevelt-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hartevelt 1990</LINK>). In Australia, incidence rates of NMSC in renal transplant recipients increases exponentially over time: 3% within the first year, 25% at 5 years and 44% at 9 or more years post transplant (<LINK REF="REF-Hardie-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hardie 1980</LINK>). As with the normal population tumour development is more likely with increased ultraviolet exposure, advancing age and fair skin.</P>
<P>Some people's immune systems do not function properly (i.e. they are immunocompromised) due to congenital disorders, viral infection or AIDS. Basal cell carcinoma is one of the most frequent malignant tumours among people with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and its incidence appears to be higher than in the general population, although there is not enough epidemiological data to confirm this (<LINK REF="REF-Demopoulos-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Demopoulos 2003</LINK>). People who are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive develop NMSC at a significantly younger age than people who are HIV negative (<LINK REF="REF-Demopoulos-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Demopoulos 2003</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">iv) Xeroderma pigmentosum</HEADING>
<P>People with the rare inherited genetic (autosomal recessive) skin disorder, xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), have an abnormality in the ability to repair UV-induced DNA damage. This results in the development of a large number of skin cancers from as early as two years of age. The median age of developing an NMSC in people with XP is 8 years old, compared to 60 years old in the general population (<LINK REF="REF-Kraemer-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kraemer 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kraemer-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kraemer 1994</LINK>). People with XP have over a 100 fold increased incidence of BCC or SCC than the general population, with 45% of them developing an NMSC (<LINK REF="REF-Kraemer-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kraemer 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kraemer-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kraemer 1994</LINK>). Photosensitivity begins in infancy, and freckles and keratoses (rough scaly patches) appear on exposed skin in childhood. SCCs, BCCs, keratoacanthomas and malignant melanomas subsequently develop in the UV-damaged skin.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">v) Albinism</HEADING>
<P>Albinism describes people who lack skin pigment and hence the ability to tan. It is caused by a large group of genetic disorders. Albinos are at increased risk of all skin cancers especially SCC, since they lack the protective effects of melanin in the skin. In a study of 164 albinos in Tanzania, 91% of those who were over 20 years of age had AK, rising to 100% of those who were over 30 years old (<LINK REF="REF-Lookingbill-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lookingbill 1995</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">vi) Trauma and burns</HEADING>
<P>SCC is uncommon in Blacks, Asians and Hispanics, however if SCCs occur they do so on sites of pre-existing inflammatory skin conditions, burn injuries, or trauma.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">vii) Basal cell naevus syndrome</HEADING>
<P>Basal cell naevus syndrome (also known as Gorlin's syndrome) is a genetic autosomal dominant condition characterised by a range of skin and skeletal abnormalities and an increased occurrence of 2 or more BCC before the age of 30 (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1996</LINK>). The syndrome is caused by mutations in the patched gene, present on chromosome 9, required for proper embryonic development and tumour suppression (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1996</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">viii) Exposure to arsenic</HEADING>
<P>Arsenic is the 20th most abundant element and exhibits both acute and chronic effects on humans (<LINK REF="REF-Neubauer-1947" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neubauer 1947</LINK>). It is ubiquitous in soil and is found in high concentrations in water wells in Taiwan, Argentina, Sweden and other regions where mining and smelting is prevalent (<LINK REF="REF-Neubauer-1947" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neubauer 1947</LINK>). It is also present in some forms of traditional Indian medicine and in illegally produced alcoholic beverages such as moonshine (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Treleaven-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Treleaven 1993</LINK>). Many occupations involve exposure to arsenic including the agricultural industry. Arsenic is a carcinogen that is able to cause cancerous transformations of mammalian cells under laboratory conditions (<LINK REF="REF-Pershagen-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pershagen 1981</LINK>). Three cutaneous cancers are associated with chronic exposure to arsenic: BCC and two precursors of SCC, Bowen's disease and arsenical keratosis. The distribution of lesions caused by arsenic exposure is not limited to parts of the body that have been exposed to sun or x-rays. A scattering of neoplasms throughout the body are observed with the preferential formation of arsenical keratoses on the palms. It takes an average of 17.8 years from initial exposure to arsenic to developing cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Schwartz-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwartz 1997</LINK>). Chelation therapy, which removes arsenic, is available for people who have been exposed, however by the time cutaneous and other cancers develop there are likely to be no traces of arsenic left to eliminate (<LINK REF="REF-Heyman-1956" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heyman 1956</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">ix) Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB)</HEADING>
<P>RDEB Hallopeau-Siemens (RDEB-HS), the most generalised subtype of RDEB, is thought to be one of the most devastating, chronic diseases known to human beings. It is due to an inherited defect in the type VII collagen gene, whereby there is either no collagen VII produced or very low levels. Collagen VII forms anchoring fibrils, crucial structures that "sew" the outer skin (epidermis) onto the inner skin (dermis). RDEB-HS is characterised by repeated blister formation, leading to mechanical fragility of the skin. It can affect all tissues with an epithelial surface or lining. People who survive recurrent bacterial sepsis during infancy are at high-risk of developing severe complications in later life including renal failure, corneal scarring and blindness, in addition to the progressive mutilation with eventual loss of their fingers and toes (<LINK REF="REF-Fine-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fine 2004</LINK>) . The most severe complications are SCCs, which tend to arise within chronically eroded or hyperkeratotic skin lesions. Approximately 85% of all individuals with RDEB-HS will have developed one cutaneous SCC by the age of 45 years and the risk is about 50 times the normal (<LINK REF="REF-Fine-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fine 1999</LINK>). It is not yet understood why these people are at increased risk for SCC, other than having chronic non-healing wounds for at least 14 years, when the incidence of SCCs starts to rise.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">x) People treated using psoralen and ultraviolet A treatment (PUVA)</HEADING>
<P>PUVA has been widely used as a treatment for psoriasis and other skin conditions since 1974 (<LINK REF="REF-Parrish-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parrish 1974</LINK>). Exposure to PUVA increases the risk of SCC in a dose dependent manner, while a substantial increase in the risk of BCC has not been observed (<LINK REF="REF-Stern-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stern 1998</LINK>). In addition to being both mutagenic and carcinogenic (<LINK REF="REF-Dunnick-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dunnick 1991</LINK>) PUVA is immunosuppressive in the skin. During active treatment it may therefore increase the risk of skin cancer in a pattern similar to that observed with people undergoing immunosuppressive therapy (e.g. transplant recipients). One study has found that people with at least 337 PUVA treatments had more than 100 fold increase in the risk of developing SCC, within 10 years of stopping treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Stern-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stern 1998</LINK>), compared with that expected from population incidence rates. The risk of developing a SCC in the second decade after cessation of PUVA treatment was 70 fold (<LINK REF="REF-Stern-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stern 1998</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Clinical Features</HEADING>
<P>BCCs exhibit several markedly different subtypes and occur at different places on the body (<LINK REF="REF-Wong-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wong 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Eighty-five percent appear on the head and neck region, while the rest are observed mainly on the trunk and lower limbs, especially in women (<LINK REF="REF-McCormack-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCormack 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Subtypes of BCC include:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>superficial, which is a well-demarcated, scaly, red minimally indurated plaque that can mimic a papulosquamous rash such as psoriasis</LI>
<LI>nodular</LI>
<LI>multifocal</LI>
<LI>morphoeic (scarring), which is the most invasive type</LI>
<LI>ulcerated</LI>
<LI>pigmented, which is often confused with melanoma</LI>
<LI>cystic</LI>
</UL>
<P>Sixty percent of the BCCs diagnosed in the UK are nodular, presenting as a pearly papule with telangiectasias (raised areas through which dilated vessels may show) throughout. In other countries, however, such as Australia, superficial BCC is the most common type (<LINK REF="REF-Staples-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Staples 1998</LINK>). Both nodular and superficial BCC usually exhibit a non infiltrative, superficial growth pattern and are therefore associated with low risk (<LINK REF="REF-Martinez-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martinez 2001</LINK>). The most important subtype clinically is morphoeic BCC, which has a more aggressive natural history and accounts for approximately 5% of all lesions (<LINK REF="REF-Wong-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wong 2003</LINK>). Since they are difficult to diagnose, the tumours can be huge and devastating to the individual. Complete surgical excision is difficult under direct vision since morphoeic BCCs have ill defined borders (<LINK REF="REF-Wong-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wong 2003</LINK>), and often lengthy plastic surgical reconstructions are required to correct cosmetic disfigurement (<LINK REF="REF-Wong-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wong 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>SCCs present clinically as nodular, superficial or as cutaneous horns (<LINK REF="REF-Dinehart-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dinehart 1996</LINK>). Actinic keratoses (AKs), sometimes a precursor to SCC, appear as scaly pink patches located on sun exposed areas and are very common. Over 80% of fair skinned people aged 60 to 69 in the USA have at least one AK (<LINK REF="REF-Glass-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glass 1989</LINK>). Most SCCs and AKs (about 70 to 80%) occur on the head and neck (<LINK REF="REF-Glass-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glass 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gray-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gray 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Holme-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holme 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Iversen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iversen 1999</LINK>). Bowen's disease presents as a red scaly or crusted plaque containing squamous cells and tends to be asymptomatic. Bowen's disease can affect any anatomical site, including the lower leg in women and the penis in men (<LINK REF="REF-Cox-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cox 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is a commonly held impression that SCC is a relatively benign form of cancer; however, the potential for metastasis can range from 0.5% to 40% depending on the subtype (<LINK REF="REF-Eedy-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eedy 2000</LINK>). SCCs developing from AKs have a 0.5 to 2 % rate of metastasis (<LINK REF="REF-Eedy-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eedy 2000</LINK>). If SCC evolves from Bowen's disease the metastatic rate soars to 33% (<LINK REF="REF-Cox-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cox 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eedy-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eedy 2000</LINK>). Mortality due to NMSC is mainly due to metastasis of SCC to lymph nodes and other internal organs. NMSC have also been linked to second malignancies. <LINK REF="REF-Rosenberg-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenberg 2004</LINK> found that women with a history of NMSC were 2.3 times more likely to report a history of another cancer, other than NMSC, compared with women who had no history of NMSC.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Diagnosis</HEADING>
<P>The diagnosis of NMSC involves taking a medical history and a physical examination (<LINK REF="REF-NCCN-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCCN 2004</LINK>) where the whole body is examined for spots, bumps, sores and any other potential signs of skin cancer. If the physical examination and medical history suggest the possibility of a NMSC a skin biopsy is performed whereby a sample of skin is taken for microscopic analysis. Two of the most commonly used biopsy techniques are shave biopsy and punch biopsy. Both methods are able to determine the cancer type and pathological growth pattern.</P>

<P>Prevention is a major component in the management of NMSC.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Primary prevention</HEADING>
<P>The best way to lower the risk of NMSC is to decrease skin exposure to sunlight, primarily by avoiding the peak hours of sunlight and avoiding deliberate sun tanning. Educating people, especially children, about the dangers of overexposure of their skin to sunlight is another way to reduce NMSC (<LINK REF="REF-Naldi-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naldi 2004</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Secondary prevention</HEADING>
<P>This has the aim of encouraging people to recognise skin changes and seek early diagnosis and treatment, as well as improving effective diagnosis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Tertiary prevention</HEADING>
<P>This involves extra interventions after treatment to reduce the risk of re-occurrence or further development of the disease.</P>
<P>A combination of primary, secondary and tertiary prevention is particularly necessary for individuals who are at high risk of developing NMSC, as identified earlier.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Sunscreens</HEADING>
<P>Sun protective products include sunscreens and sun blocks. Sunscreens of a chemical nature, (such as oxybenzone, avobenzone) work by absorbing UVR. Physical sunscreens contain titanium dioxide or zinc oxide, which scatter or block UVR. An in depth review on the use of sunscreens in the prevention of NMSC is given elsewhere (<LINK REF="REF-Gasparro-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gasparro 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Naylor-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naylor 1997</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Retinoids</HEADING>
<P>Retinoids are vitamin A derivatives. Experimental vitamin A deficiency, leading to cancer in rats, provided some of the earliest links between vitamin A and malignancies. Early studies, administering high dose retinoids for treating and preventing skin cancer in people considered to be at high-risk of BCC, showed promising results (<LINK REF="REF-Peck-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peck 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peck-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peck 1988</LINK>). Although only a small number of studies have been reported, synthetic retinoids have shown the most promise for preventing NMSC in high-risk groups such as those with XP (<LINK REF="REF-Lippman-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lippman 1987</LINK>) and people who have had renal transplants (<LINK REF="REF-Bavinck-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bavinck 1995</LINK>). Retinoids work by controlling growth, death and differentiation of human cells. In malignant cell lines retinoids inhibit cell growth and induce normal differentiation of the cells (<LINK REF="REF-Lippman-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lippman 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>Since vitamin A is stored in the liver, high doses may produce persistent side effects. Adverse effects include dryness and chapping of the lips, mucous membranes and skin in addition to skeletal toxicities. This has led to the development of synthetic retinoids, designed to have better therapeutic properties with lower toxicity. Osteoporosis, calcification of tendons and ligaments, osteophytes and bone spurs around joints may be accelerated by long-term retinoid therapy (<LINK REF="REF-DiGiovanna-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">DiGiovanna 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-DiGiovanna-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">DiGiovanna 2001</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Antioxidants</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">i) Selenium</HEADING>
<P>Selenium is an essential trace element found in fish, shellfish and garlic. It is necessary for the functioning of the detoxifying enzyme glutathione peroxidase within cells. This enzyme helps to reduce the presence of highly reactive hydroxyl free radicals which are thought to attack DNA, inducing mutations (<LINK REF="REF-Buettner-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buettner 1993</LINK>) and thus its function is essential for a cell to remain damage free. Studies in mice have shown that increased levels of dietary selenium provide protection from UV induced skin tumours (<LINK REF="REF-Pence-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pence 1994</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">ii) Beta-carotene</HEADING>
<P>Beta-carotene (ß-carotene) is the best characterised of a large group of carotenoid pigments that are widely distributed in vegetables and fruit. Although ß-carotene has pro-vitamin A (retinol) activity, it is possible that ingestion of ß-carotene might prevent cancer without the involvement of retinol. It is an antioxidant that may reduce free radical damage of DNA after ultraviolet exposure. Some studies suggest that ß-carotene supplementation works by reducing immunosuppression normally induced by ultraviolet radiation (<LINK REF="REF-Fuller-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fuller 1992</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">iii) Vitamin C</HEADING>
<P>Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is present in citrus fruits and potatoes. It has been shown that UV exposure in the epidermis and dermis in mice leads to the depletion of vitamin C (<LINK REF="REF-Shindo-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shindo 1993</LINK>). Vitamin C may play a role in preventing skin cancers by scavenging free radicals in cells, thus protecting the cells from DNA damage.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">iv) Vitamin E</HEADING>
<P>Vitamin E (present in vegetable oils, nuts and leafy green vegetables), like vitamin C, scavenges free radicals and protects cell membranes from damage. Topical vitamin E in mice has been shown to prevent UV induced immunosuppression (<LINK REF="REF-Gensler-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gensler 1996</LINK>), inhibit UV-induced thymine dimer formation (<LINK REF="REF-McVean-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">McVean 1999</LINK>) and inhibit absorption of UVB radiation (<LINK REF="REF-McVean-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">McVean 1999</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Reduction of fat intake</HEADING>
<P>It has been noted that unsaturated fatty acids are a major target for free radical attack. It is therefore possible that decreased dietary fats could reduce free radical attack and carcinogenesis (<LINK REF="REF-Black-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Black 1998</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Complementary therapies</HEADING>
<P>The use of complementary therapies for the treatment of a number of diseases, including cancer has increased. Their perceived lack of side effects has increased their popularity over conventional synthetic treatments. A literature review is available which outlines the variety of herbal therapies that have been tested to treat or prevent NMSC (<LINK REF="REF-Bialy-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bialy 2002</LINK>). Phytochemicals have been the focus of many studies in the last decade e.g. tea is thought to act by a variety of mechanisms to prevent NMSC, including the induction of apoptosis (cell death) in tumour cells (<LINK REF="REF-Alexis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alexis 1999</LINK>).</P>

<P>NMSC are not usually considered life-threatening but they take a huge toll on health service budgets, as well as contributing to days lost in the workplace. Prevention is a better option than cure, especially given that preventative measures have a good chance of working. Many treatments have been described for the prevention of NMSC in high-risk groups, but there are no evidence-based guidelines. Literature reviews exist on the treatment and prevention of NMSC in the general population in addition to high-risk groups, however, no systematic reviews exist on the topic.</P>

<P>Two authors (FB-H, JL-B) independantly performed data extraction, using a specially designed data extraction form, and discrepancies were resolved by a third author (AW or WP). Missing data were obtained from the trial authors where possible. One author (FB-H) entered data into RevMan and this was double checked by JL-B. Data recorded included: demographics, sites, clinical types, histological diagnosis, follow up period, number of previous NMSC and how they were treated, skin tone and loss to follow-up, country of residence.</P>

<P>We calculated a weighted pooled treatment effect across studies using a random effects model. We expressed the results as risk ratio (RR and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes due to non rare expected events, and mean difference (MD and 95% CI) for continuous outcomes. The hazard ratio and associated statistics were calculated, where necessary, using and Excel spreadsheet developed by the Matthew Sydes (Cancer Division) in collaboration with the Meta-analysis Group of the MRC Clinical Trials Unit, London.</P>

Where data were available, we performed a subgroup analysis if appropriate for BCCs versus SCCs.</P>

<P>The studies identified in this review fell into three main categories of people who are at a high risk of NMSC. These were people with Xeroderma pigmentosum, renal transplant recipients and people with a history of NMSC. The conclusions from the review are presented based on these high risk groups.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">People with Xeroderma pigmentosum</HEADING>
<P>One study, of good methodological quality (<LINK REF="STD-Yarosh-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Yarosh 2001</LINK>) found that topical application of T4N5 liposome lotion significantly reduced the rate of appearance of new BCCs and there was a trend for reducing the risk of getting a new BCC in the treatment group compared to placebo.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Renal transplant recipients (RTRs)</HEADING>
<P>Three studies included RTRs and these were found to be of very different methodological quality. Two studies were of acitretin versus placebo and one study compared high and low doses of acitretin. Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Bouwes-Bavinck-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bouwes Bavinck 1995</LINK>) assessed the primary outcome of the review but found no significant difference in time to developing a new NMSC in either the acitretin group or the placebo group within the first six months of prevention treatment. Pooled data from the two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bouwes-Bavinck-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bouwes Bavinck 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-George-2002" TYPE="STUDY">George 2002</LINK>) found no significant difference in adverse events in the acitretin group compared to the placebo group, and one study (<LINK REF="STD-de-Sevaux-2003" TYPE="STUDY">de Sevaux 2003</LINK>) found no significant difference in adverse events when lower dose acitretin group was compared to the higher dose group.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">People with a history of NMSC</HEADING>
<P>Several RCTs of preventive treatments for people with a history of NMSC have been conducted; these include retinols, isotretinoin, selenium, beta carotene, and a low fat diet.</P>
<P>Two studies of retinol included participants with a history of NMSC (<LINK REF="STD-Levine-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Levine 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moon-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Moon 1997</LINK>). Although one of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Moon-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Moon 1997</LINK>) found that retinol significantly reduced the risk of a first new SCC compared to placebo, pooled data from both studies (<LINK REF="STD-Levine-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Levine 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moon-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Moon 1997</LINK>) showed no significant difference in time to first SCC or BCC. Heterogeneity between the two studies was detected, which could possibly be due to the poorer quality of the Levine study as compared to the Moon study. Only one of the studies (Moon 1997) reported adverse events and death data, however there were no statistically significant differences in the risks of these two outcomes between the treatment groups.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>
</B>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Levine-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Levine 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tangrea-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Tangrea 1992</LINK>) compared isotretinoin versus placebo and included participants with a history of previous NMSC. The methodological quality of one of the studies was very good (<LINK REF="STD-Tangrea-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Tangrea 1992</LINK>) and the other was categorised as poorer quality (<LINK REF="STD-Levine-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Levine 1997</LINK>). Although pooled data from the two trials suggested no significant difference in time to a new BCC or the risk of a new BCC, the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Levine-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Levine 1997</LINK> found that there was an increased risk in the time to a new SCC in the isotretinoin group as compared to the placebo group. One of the studies reported a significant increase in the risk of adverse events in the isotretinoin group compared to placebo. When comparing numbers of participants with new NMSC in the respective groups between the first and last month periods, it should be noted that noncompliance in a large percentage of participants enrolled in retinol chemoprevention studies has been attributed to symptoms associated with vitamin A ingestion (<LINK REF="REF-Cartmel-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cartmel 2000</LINK>)</P>
<P>One good quality study assessed the effect of selenium as compared to placebo in participants with a history of NMSC (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1996</LINK>). There was a significant increased risk of a new NMSC in participants in the treatment group and this seemed to be primarily related to the development of SCCs in particular. Additionally, selenium was also associated with significantly fewer participants in the treatment group developing other cancers at the end of the study. There were no significant differences in adverse events.</P>
<P>One good quality study assessed the effects of beta carotene as compared to placebo in people with a history of NMSC (<LINK REF="STD-Greenberg-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Greenberg 1990</LINK>). They found no significant difference in the number of participants with a new NMSC in first year or at two to five years from the start of the prevention treatment. Additionally, when the analysis was grouped into the type of NMSC, no significant differences were seen in the number of new SCCs or BCCs. Reassuringly, no significant difference was seen in the risk of death at the end of the study.</P>
<P>Only one study was identified which compared a diet of reduced fat and a normal diet over 24 months in 115 people with a history of no more than 2 previous NMSC (<LINK REF="STD-Black-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Black 1995</LINK>). Very little data were available from this study for the outcomes of the review. A diet of reduced fat did not significantly affect the number of NMSCs in the first year as compared to placebo; however there were fewer skin cancers in the reduced fat diet group at the end of the study. There was no significant difference in the risk of death at the end of trial. In an additional paper the authors divided the study into eight month periods and when they compared numbers of patients with new NMSC in the respective groups between the first and last month periods they found a significant improvement in the low-fat diet compared to the normal diet (<LINK REF="REF-Jaax-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jaax 1997</LINK>) .</P>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-05-27 14:50:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Diane A  Horsley">
<P>It should be borne in mind that reduction in sun exposure through seeking shade, clothing protection and wearing sunscreens are all of key importance in the prevention of non melanoma skin cancer. Sun avoidance and protection are not part of the scope of this review as they have been considered elsewhere.</P>
<P>Xeroderma pigmentosum is a rare inherited genetic skin disorder. The frequency of all forms of skin cancer is higher in these people than in the general population. Topical application of T4N5 appears to significantly reduce the rate of appearance of new BCCs and possibly the risk of new BCCs. However these results should not be taken in isolation since this is based on one small study.</P>
<P>Renal transplant recipients
 
are at a significantly increased risk of developing skin cancer compared to immunocompetent individuals. The number of solid organ transplants continue to rise and survival time continues to improve; however with increased survival times comes an increased risk of developing skin cancer. </P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Bouwes-Bavinck-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bouwes Bavinck 1995</LINK>) found significantly fewer participants in the acitretin group developed NMSCs within six months, however this is based on one small study. It is possible that altering the immunosuppresive regimens may have an important effect in reducing NMSC risk and this aspect will be considered in the next update of this review.</P>
<P>People with a history of NMSC are at increased risk of developing further NMSC. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of retinol however only two small studies have been done. Isotretinoin increases the risk of developing a new SCC. No difference in the effectiveness of beta carotene, selenium or a reduced fat diet have been seen in this review, however data are from single studies.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There is an urgent need for more research since the incidence of NMSC is increasing year on year and the number of transplant recipients is also on the increase. Prevention of skin cancers in these groups should be a priority, not only from the patient perspective, but also in terms of financial savings for the Health Services. Further randomised controlled studies of the interventions identified in this review should be done. Further research in people with Xeroderma pigmentosum is needed since this disorder of the skin has a huge impact on the quality of life of these often very young people whose life expectancy may be shortened by over 30 yrs.</P>
<P>Additionally, this systematic review identified no randomised controlled trials for the prevention of non melanoma skin cancer for people with albinism; people with trauma or burns; people with basal cell naevus syndrome; people exposed to arsenic; people with RDEB; or those treated using PUVA. All of these groups of people are at a high risk of NMSC and therefore high quality trials of prevention treatment should be implemented.</P>

<P>This review is being updated by way of 2 new titles (Interventions for preventing keratinocyte carcinoma (non-melanoma skin cancer) in solid organ transplant recipients and Interventions for preventing keratinocyte cancer in high-risk groups not receiving immunosuppressive therapy), because transplant patients are a distinct group.</P>
