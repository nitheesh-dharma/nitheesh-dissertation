I am impressed by the similarity of the auto=CPAP results from parallels and crossovers (as much as the differences). The key issue is how much clinical benefit is there from the extra 15 mins of treatment over the course of years.....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span modified=&quot;2009-02-20 14:45:00 +0000&quot; modified_by=&quot;Christopher J Cates&quot; class=&quot;inserted&quot;&gt;I have used track changes to indicate alterations.

I have added this and a note of the ESS changes for auto-CPAP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Background: Good update with recent references.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Were paired t-test data available to carry out the GIV analysis of the cross-over trials? &amp;quot;Data from crossover studies were entered as generic inverse variance data (GIV) based upon group mean differences and their associated standard errors.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Good description of the study designs and participants.&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Although the summary estimate indicates a significant underlying treatment effect across the studies, this may reflect the preferential weighting given to the more precise estimates reported by studies with significant findings.&amp;quot; I do not agree with this as it stands and have revised this sentence. I am also concerned about removing studies in a senstivity analysis based on the results of the study, especially when this is post hoc. I agree that some patients may benefit more from auto-CPAP than others.&lt;br&gt;When you some to the ESS scores I am also unconvinced by the argument re Noseda having narrower entry criteria. I have revised this para a bit. Beware finding what you are looking for (publication bias)!&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Although auto-CPAP and fixed CPAP machines reduced symptoms significantly from baseline in this study, the reduction with auto-CPAP was numerically superior.&amp;quot; The individual arm results are not randomised and significance testing on a single arm is not useful. I have cut this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion: To me the key outcome for patients is whether auto-CPAP improves symptoms and quality of life and sleep (by allowing more hours of CPAP or working more efficiently)? I agree with the overall thrust of the discussion that it has not been shown to be of huge benefit in unselected users, but this needs to be balanced against the benefit from studies in selected patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contentious issues: I have diluted the post hoc sub-group finding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spellchecked: done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next action: Back to TL. I do not think we can submit this without running the changes past the authors and a peer-reviewer as there has been a substantial amount of new data added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;================================================&lt;br&gt;UPDATE 2006&lt;br&gt;TJL: Are we including different basline titrations? If not we ought to make this explicit, bearing in mind that exposure to only one form of titration could unmask patients to auto-CPAP if they perceive a difference.&lt;br&gt;____________________________________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;CJC relook Aug 5th 2004&lt;br&gt;Narrative description of preference data is fine. I have amended slightly. Thanks for going back and re-entering the cross-over data properly for this review.&lt;br&gt;_____________________________________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;Editing by CJC 6 May 2004&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors' Contribution: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives: fine (efficacy put in for effectiveness and compliance as main outcome).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of included studies: good&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaview Labels: Please add units for treatment pressure (1#12).

[SO'S THE REVIEW]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract; good&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: good but I am not clear how the cross-over data have been entered into RevMAn. Both arms together or first arm data for example? The former should carry a health warning! [HAVE DOUBLE-CHEKCED THE STUDIES FOR T TESTS]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Fine (with caveat that the pooled cross-over results are unreliable unless paired t-tests and GIV are used).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion ; good&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contentious issues ; CROSS-OVER DESIGN?

TJL spellchecked this version 280404&lt;br&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.4&lt;br&gt;John Wright's comments: 240304:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;hi toby - my comments on the review:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its very good! I liked the structure and the writing. However some concerns:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. the synopsis and abstract need more careful structure - can you describe the variety of interventions avaible, (auto, bicpap etc), and then the results for each - outcome of patient preference, then outcome of adherence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;in synopsis - 'mant patients' rather than 'important number'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.In background - need to explain with clarity what you mean by long term adherence, and 'regular use' - definitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Statistics - you mention future versions of review - not appropriate in methods - save for discussion. why not a priori comparison by quality?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. p11 - explain CPAP FOT. maybe drop the post hoc (just day se analysis)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. CBT - at 12 weeks - important point - presumably compliance drops with time - you need to mention this, and how trials should be at least 12 weeks to pick this up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;General points:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. No consistency for adherence vs compliance - need to sort this. personally i am much happier with compliance now - the political correctness of adherence and concordance is just that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Good response from authors - highlight this&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Do you need more about the link with good compliance and better health - is there a clear link?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Costs - important point. I think you need to be braver in your conclusions - implications for research. As there is no evidence of increased compliance, and yet increased costs, CPAP is clearly the first line treatment. the others reserved for patients with problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. references for the three studies with jadad of 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;hope this helps. john&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;TJL - Calculating preference. 101103.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris - would it be appropriate to enter preference APAP versus preference 'not APAP' (i.e. active preference for CPAP or no preference expressed) and pooling that? We seem to be missing out on some useful insights into patient assessment of therapy here and I would like to see how that goes.&lt;br&gt;_________________________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.2&lt;br&gt;TJL - 18/08/03&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COMPARISONS:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BI-LEVEL VERSUS FIXED PRESSURE CPAP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One trial reported two pressure settings (Meurice 1998) - Peff versus Pahs (flow limitation versus abolition of apnoea setting, ie the former is lower than the latter). Should this constitute a new comparison, or does it fit more easily with auto-CPAP versus fixed pressure CPAP?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HEATED VERSUS NO HUMIDIFICATION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The baseline period data in the heated versus cold passover humidification data have provided data for 'no humidification'. Is this strictly appropriate given that it was technically a washout phase of the study? All participants received this humidificationless form of therapy but it may contain carry-over effects. I think that the Massie 1999 should be excluded on this basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SELF-TITRATION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have also idenitifed a home titration versus laboratory titration CPAP study (Fitzpatrick 2003). Should this constitute a new comparison? They measure the effect of self-adjusting pressure on compliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is Proportional PAP? I have identified a trial comparing this with CPAP.&lt;br&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;21/08/03&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL to take out Massie 1999.

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-08-05 09:07:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is caused by intermittent airway closure during sleep such that airflow stops despite continued efforts to breathe. Continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) can be an effective treatment for this condition but requires regular use, and many people cannot tolerate it, or do not use it every night. Attempts to improve compliance with treatment have included changes to the mechanical devices used to deliver airway pressure, such as auto-CPAP, bi-level PAP, expiratory pressure relief and additional humidification. We examined the evidence for these different approaches. None led to large increases in hours of use, though when asked, most participants expressed a preference for the auto-CPAP machine rather than fixed pressure. When bi-level PAP and fixed CPAP were compared, initial patient acceptance was greater for bi-level PAP in one study, but long-term usage in those accepting treatment was similar for both devices. Expiratory pressure relief (C-flex<SUP>TM</SUP>) did not show improvement in hours of use and symptom scores. According to the evidence currently available, compliance with positive airway pressure therapy for OSA is similar, irrespective of the mode of delivery (e.g. fixed, auto-titrating or bi-level device).</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-08-05 09:06:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Continuous Positive Airways Pressure (CPAP) is considered to be the cornerstone of therapy for obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). However, compliance with this treatment is frequently poor, which may lead to ongoing symptoms of sleep disruption, daytime sleepiness and poor waking cognitive function. Mechanical interventions which involve changing the way that positive pressure is delivered, and the addition of humidification, might improve compliance.</P>

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-08-06 16:30:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Forty-five studies met the inclusion criteria (1874 participants). <B>Auto-CPAP</B> <B>(30 studies, 1136 participants):</B> a statistically significant difference in machine usage of 0.21 hours/night (0.08 to 0.35) was observed in favour of auto-CPAP from cross-over studies. This difference is of questionable clinical significance. Pooled effect estimates from parallel group trials detected a similar sized difference for average nightly machine usage, but this was not statistically significant. Evidence from parallel group studies did not identify a statistically significant difference between pressure modes in Epworth Sleepiness Scores, but there was an overall reduction of 0.64 units with cross-over studies (-0.12 to -1.16) in favour of auto-CPAP. Parallel group studies did not identify a significant difference. More participants preferred auto-CPAP to fixed CPAP where this was measured. <B>Bi-level PAP (six studies, 285 participants):</B> no significant differences were observed in machine usage. One small study found no difference in preference. <B>C-Flex (six studies, 318 participants):</B> no significant difference was observed in machine usage. <B>Humidification</B> <B>(three studies, 135 participants):</B> there were conflicting findings between the studies. Two parallel group trials found no significant difference in machine usage, whereas a cross-over study found a significant difference.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-08-05 09:07:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Improvement in average machine use of auto-CPAP was superior in studies with a cross-over design; the point estimate in parallel group trials was similar, but did not reach statistical significance. It is uncertain how use of machines in study settings relates to 'real world' use. Where preference was measured participants preferred auto-CPAP to fixed pressure CPAP. Further studies are required to assess the evidence for Bi-PAP, C-Flex<SUP>TM</SUP> and humidification. The studies assembled were characterised by high machine usage in the control groups, and low withdrawal rates. Future studies need to consider the effects of treatment in participants with more mild disease, and those who struggle to accept therapy despite persistent symptoms.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-08-06 16:18:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Obstructive sleep apnoea is caused by repetitive closure of the upper airway during sleep. This may lead to episodes of arterial oxygen desaturation and interrupted sleep. It presents with a range of severity from socially inconvenient snoring to life threatening ventilatory failure. In prospective series of untreated subjects, sleep disordered breathing has been associated with ischaemic heart disease, strokes and increased mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Marin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marin 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mooe-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mooe 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yaggi-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yaggi 2005</LINK>). It increases the risk of road traffic collisions by three times or more (<LINK REF="REF-George-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">George 2001</LINK>). Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) delivered via a nasal mask is an effective treatment for OSA that patients can tolerate at home (<LINK REF="REF-Sullivan-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sullivan 1984</LINK>). It has become the treatment of choice for patients with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnoea (<LINK REF="REF-Giles-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giles 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2003</LINK>) and has been shown to improve: ventilatory function (<LINK REF="REF-Berthen_x002d_Jones-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berthen-Jones 1987</LINK>); objective and subjective measures of daytime somnolence (<LINK REF="REF-Engleman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Engleman 1998</LINK>); quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Jenkinson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jenkinson 1999</LINK>); and also been demonstrated to reduce driving accidents in patients with moderate to severe OSA (<LINK REF="REF-George-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">George 2001</LINK>). When hypertension coexists with OSA, CPAP may reduce blood pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Pepperell-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pepperell 2002</LINK>). Reviews of the evidence base for alternative treatment modalities have not reached conclusive findings with regard to the place of surgery, lifestyle modification, drug therapy and oral appliances in managing sleep apnoea in adults (<LINK REF="REF-Lim-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lim 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shneerson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shneerson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sundaram-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sundaram 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>As with many medical therapies for chronic conditions, there are issues with uptake and ongoing compliance. There is some variation in definition of non-adherence, with rates of refusal or poor long-term uptake reported in the literature ranging from 20% to 83% (<LINK REF="REF-Hoffstein-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoffstein 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nino-Murcia-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nino Murcia 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rolfe-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rolfe 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Waldhorn-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waldhorn 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weaver-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weaver 2008</LINK>), with 8% to 15% of patients refusing to accept treatment after a single night's use (<LINK REF="STD-Krieger-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Krieger 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Waldhorn-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waldhorn 1990</LINK>). The number of hours per night and the frequency of usage required to achieve and maintain therapeutic effectiveness is unknown, although six to eight hours each night is the usual prescription. Some studies have assessed compliance in terms of 'regular' CPAP use. <LINK REF="REF-Kribbs-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kribbs 1993</LINK> reported that only 46% of people with OSA used CPAP for at least four hours per day on more than 70% of the days. Applying similar criteria, <LINK REF="STD-P_x00e9_pin-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pépin 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Lewis-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 2004</LINK> deemed between 71% and 85% of CPAP users 'compliant'.</P>
<P>A number of interventions have been developed in order to target discomfort associated with the interface of the CPAP machine (<LINK REF="REF-Chai-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chai 2006</LINK>). Pressure modification interventions include the use of automatically titrating CPAP (auto-CPAP), designed to vary and achieve the necessary pressure to maintain airway patency through the night. This mechanism of action proposes that the reduction in mean pressure minimises local side effects of CPAP, improving tolerance and increasing associated usage. Bi-level PAP and C-Flex<SUP>TM</SUP> are also designed to lower expiratory pressure and reduce the expiratory work of breathing thereby increasing patient comfort. Adding humidification to the delivery of pressure in the airway might decrease side effects in the upper airway due to cold, dry airflow, and improve tolerance to CPAP and improve usage.</P>
<P>Having previously considered these interventions as well as educational and behavioural interventions and patient-adjusted CPAP devices in the same review (<LINK REF="REF-Haniffa-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haniffa 2004</LINK>), we have narrowed the focus of this updated version. This enables us to undertake a more thorough assessment of the evidence base for machines which differ from fixed pressure CPAP devices in terms of the mode of pressure delivery (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> for details of each device and its mechanism). In addition to this question we consider evidence from studies which assess the addition of humidification to fixed pressure CPAP. We previously concluded with some caution that in certain selected groups of patients, the modification of pressure delivery with auto-CPAP conferred benefits in terms of hours of use. However, this observation was only evident from pooled analyses of cross-over studies, and was based on outlying effect estimates. Additional work on other forms of pressure modification such as Bi-PAP and C-Flex<SUP>TM </SUP>was warranted (<LINK REF="REF-Haniffa-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haniffa 2004</LINK>). The question of educational and behavioural strategies is now covered by another review (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2009</LINK>).</P>

<P>Based on the overall assessment of the risk of bias for each domain of the studies, the most common source of possible bias was the handling of incomplete data (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). For a number of cross-over studies this relates to the withdrawal of participants from the first arm of the trial.</P>
<P>Details of randomisation and blinding procedures were generally inadequately reported, and this leaves the risk of bias for a number of the studies unknown. Information was sufficiently reported in 10 studies for us to ascertain that allocation generation was at a low risk of bias. Six authors provided sufficient information in correspondence for us to ascertain that processes for generating allocation sequences were at a low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Blau-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Blau 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dolan-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Dolan 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jarvis-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jarvis 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marshall-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Marshall 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-S_x00e9_ri_x00e8_s-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sériès 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-To-2008" TYPE="STUDY">To 2008</LINK>). Correspondence with the remaining study investigators has not been successful.</P>
<P>Blinding procedures were not commonly used across the studies. Eleven studies attempted to blind investigators and participants to treatment, whereas in 18 studies the design was either single-blind or open label. For the remaining studies insufficient information was available to determine whether blinding was attempted. In five studies monitoring of machine usage was disclosed or was unblinded to participants; in four studies this was avoided and in the remaining studies this was either not clear or the risk of bias was uncertain based on the described methods.</P>

</SUBSECTION>

<P>The pooled effect estimate was identical when data for either of the two auto-CPAP devices studied in <LINK REF="STD-Senn-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Senn 2003</LINK> were included in the analysis.</P>
<P>However, we noted that two studies recruited participants who were carefully selected, and may have stood to benefit more from auto-CPAP than the other study populations. <LINK REF="STD-Rostig-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rostig 2003</LINK> was the only study to have recruited 'poorly compliant' participants (i.e. prior exposure to fixed CPAP, but not accepting it) and <LINK REF="STD-Massie-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Massie 2003</LINK> sought to include participants with higher AHIs (&gt; 15 per hour) and who required CPAP pressure greater than 10 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O to treat their sleep apnoea. When these two studies were removed from the analysis the pooled effect from the remaining studies was not statistically significant (0.13 hours/night; 95% CI -0.02 to 0.28, P = 0.09).

<P>In seven of the 10 studies reporting this outcome, there was a numerically superior preference for auto-CPAP over either fixed CPAP, or neither treatment. However, in <LINK REF="STD-Senn-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Senn 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hussain-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hussain 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-To-2008" TYPE="STUDY">To 2008</LINK> study preference was in the opposite direction.

We were unable to find a satisfactory explanation for this apparent discrepancy in terms of study design and technology of active interventions.

<P>There was a significant difference between auto and fixed CPAP on subjective sleepiness as measured by the ESS score of -0.67 (95% CI -1.18 to -0.16; 11 studies, 321 participants). One study contributes much of the weight in this meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Noseda-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Noseda 2004</LINK>). The entry criteria were narrower than in some other studies, and the resultant population in this study was more carefully selected than for other trials. Furthermore the clinical impact of this difference is small. The funnel plot for this outcome indicates some possible asymmetry, although the direction of this asymmetry would suggest that missing unpublished trials would potentially increase the size of the effect that was found (<LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Kendrick-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kendrick 2002</LINK> reported data that were in a format unsuitable for use in the meta-analysis.</P>

Potential explanations for heterogeneity between this set of trials could be differences between the machines used to alter pressure (auto-CPAP<SUB>FOT </SUB>versus auto-CPAP non-<SUB>FOT</SUB> machines), and varying treatment pressures necessary for patients within and between studies, which may also have contributed to the conflicting results.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-08-05 09:10:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>We have reviewed 45 randomised studies of pressure modification and humidification interventions designed to improve initial acceptance and maximise usage of CPAP. Most of the patients recruited to the studies were CPAP naive at baseline, had high AHI, and demonstrated high levels of machine use in the control groups. The average difference in machine on time between auto-CPAP and fixed CPAP was around 15 minutes per night. It may be that certain subgroups, such as those who require a high treatment pressure, stand to gain perceptible benefit from this therapy, and data from symptom scores support this interpretation. Other alternative devices, such as Bi-PAP, C-flex<SUP>TM</SUP> or the addition of humidification, have not been proven to improve machine usage consistently. Data in participants with mild OSA are lacking and this is an important area for additional research.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Auto-CPAP</HEADING>
<P>The level of CPAP required to treat OSA varies through the night. Sleep stage and body position have been identified as possible contributory factors in determining this (<LINK REF="REF-Oksenberg-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oksenberg 1999</LINK>). Many of the adverse effects of CPAP such as mask discomfort, leaks and aerophagia probably depend on the level of CPAP treatment pressure. It is not known whether the maximum or the mean level of CPAP is relevant to the incidence of adverse effects. If the maximum pressure is more important, then auto-CPAP would not be expected to improve tolerability as it will probably produce similar maximum pressures or even exceed those of fixed CPAP. If the mean pressure level is more closely related to adverse effects, the difference in pressure achieved with auto-CPAP of between 1.6 and 2 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O may have been insufficient to improve machine usage significantly. Seven out of 10 studies reported that participants preferred using auto-CPAP to either fixed CPAP or neither treatment. This may correlate with small differences in symptomatic benefit (<LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>), although we urge caution with this interpretation as the pooled estimate for symptoms was dominated by one small study in carefully selected participants (<LINK REF="STD-Noseda-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Noseda 2004</LINK>). Furthermore, the numerically superior proportion of participants expressing preference for auto-CPAP did not seem to lead to a consistently higher average machine usage across the trials.</P>
<P>The conservative conclusion from the available data is that auto-CPAP does not increase machine usage by a meaningful amount in otherwise unselected study participants. The benefit of auto-CPAP may be greatest in a subgroup of patients who have featured in only a few RCTs to date, namely those who struggle to accept fixed CPAP or require higher treatment pressures. In a single study participants were identified as poor compliers with fixed CPAP and used auto-CPAP more (<LINK REF="STD-Rostig-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rostig 2003</LINK>). In one other study, participants were selected if they required a relatively high (&gt; 10 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O) CPAP level (<LINK REF="STD-Massie-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Massie 2003</LINK>), and the authors found significantly fewer adverse effects and increased hours of use with auto-CPAP compared with fixed CPAP. On the basis of current evidence, therefore, the prescription of auto-CPAP in people who are new to CPAP therapy does not worsen symptoms or polysomnographic findings compared with fixed pressure settings, and may lead to only modest improvements in machine usage. Data on blood pressure outcomes are limited and further observations would help to ascertain whether the difference favouring fixed pressure in <LINK REF="STD-Patruno-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Patruno 2007</LINK> represents a consistent effect across other samples. Auto-CPAP may offer greater tolerability to people who struggle to accept fixed pressures, although the evidence base for these patients is currently weak.</P>
<P>The dose of CPAP treatment can be thought of as a function of pressure level and time (<LINK REF="REF-Stepnowsky-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stepnowsky 2003</LINK>). If pressure is reduced by, for example, auto-CPAP, an increase in hours does not necessarily equate to improved treatment, but may be a compensatory mechanism to achieve similar subjective benefit. The heterogeneity in the outcomes of trials with auto-CPAP may be explained not only by different populations recruited, but also different machines and their operating principles which were also used. One cross-over study compared the effects of different CPAP machines, but did not detect significant differences between Auto Set and DeVilbiss machines (<LINK REF="STD-Senn-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Senn 2003</LINK>), and a sensitivity analysis based on the method of delivering auto-CPAP did not demonstrate statistically significant treatment responses between different machines. Further studies designed to investigate the differences between machines might throw more light on this matter.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Alternative pressure modes and humidification</HEADING>
<P>CPAP with expiratory pressure relief (C-flex<SUP>TM</SUP>)<SUP> </SUP>differs from fixed pressure CPAP in that there is a reduction in expiratory pressure designed to reduce the work of breathing and mask leaks in this phase of breathing. In this regard it is similar to bi-level ventilation but it does not have a back-up rate, and the airway pressure increases again at the end of expiration before any inspiratory effort is recorded. The effect estimates in our review did not detect a statistically significant difference between treatment options in terms of machine usage, although the wide confidence intervals justify confirmatory work in this area.</P>
<P>Six studies have compared fixed CPAP and bi-level PAP. In one study there was no difference in the hours of use but significantly more patients withdrew from the fixed CPAP limb (<LINK REF="STD-Reeves_x002d_Hoch_x00e9_-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Reeves-Hoché 1995</LINK>). Five patients stopped fixed CPAP as a result of mask discomfort or treatment intolerance. None of the withdrawals from the bi-level PAP group were related to treatment intolerance or mask discomfort. When this result was combined with data from two other studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ballard-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ballard 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gay-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gay 2003</LINK>), there was no significant difference between CPAP and bi-level PAP in terms of average usage. It is of note however that there were no withdrawals from <LINK REF="STD-Gay-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gay 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ballard-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ballard 2007</LINK>, which does not reflect usual clinical experience and may have been a consequence of their shorter duration. Our analyses do not currently demonstrate a statistical difference in usage between these treatment options. It should be noted that in the UK bi-level PAP devices are up to 10 times as expensive as a basic CPAP pump.</P>
<P>One cause of CPAP intolerance is dryness of the upper airway mucosa and rebound nasal congestion in the daytime. Humidification has been promoted to reduce nasal side effects and increase the tolerability of CPAP treatment. We identified three small trials that reported conflicting findings. In the parallel group trials there was no significant difference in usage between humidification and placebo. Conversely, <LINK REF="STD-Neill-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Neill 2003</LINK> reported better usage in participants treated with humidification, but no significant difference in their rates of suffering nasal symptoms. The data from both control groups indicated high levels of usage, and both these studies may have been conducted in 'compliant' patients. This is an area where further studies are required.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Study design and generalisability</HEADING>
<P>It is striking that in comparison to the previous clinical reports of CPAP use the control limbs of the studies showed very few withdrawals from treatment and good average hours of use in those continuing treatment (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). Several plausible mechanisms may have contributed to this phenomenon:</P>
<P>The aims and settings of clinical trials can exert bias in patient selection (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 2001</LINK>) and even though a small number of studies disclosed that machine usage would be monitored, patients who participated in the remaining trials may have become unblinded to this aspect of the study aims. Under these circumstances the way that they use CPAP machines more likely reflects awareness of monitoring irrespective of perceived benefit and clinical need (<LINK REF="STD-P_x00e9_pin-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pépin 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-P_x00e9_pin-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pépin 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Across the reviewed studies most of the participants had a high baseline AHI (mean: 30 to 57.8) making them potentially more likely to persist with treatment despite adverse effects (<LINK REF="REF-Pelletier-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pelletier 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zozula-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zozula 2001</LINK>). The principle aim in many of the studies we included was to intervene at an early stage of CPAP treatment, and the limited duration of the studies provides evidence of how patients respond to different therapeutic strategies in the short-term. At this juncture, relief from the symptoms of daytime sleepiness is likely to be perceptible, and may have contributed to high levels of machine usage.</P>
<P>The participants in the control limbs of some of the studies were also probably given more extensive education and support than in routine clinical practice.</P>
<P>Whatever the reasons behind the high levels of adherence in the control groups the net effect would have reduced the power of the studies to demonstrate a benefit from intervention.</P>
<P>The primary outcome of our review was hours of use but a failure of initial acceptance of treatment is also an important issue in clinical practice. The cross-over design used for many of the studies does not lend itself to assessment of treatment effects from participants who withdraw in the first arm of the study. Whilst intention-to-treat analyses for average machine usage include data from participants who withdraw from parallel groups, the rate of withdrawal and the reasons for doing so still require elucidation.</P>
<P>We did not specify whether or not participants recruited to the studies should be CPAP-naive. Five studies included prior users of CPAP (<LINK REF="STD-Ballard-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ballard 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jarvis-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jarvis 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Muir-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Muir 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rostig-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rostig 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-S_x00e9_ri_x00e8_s-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sériès 2001</LINK>). The findings of this review should therefore only be applied with caution to individuals previously prescribed CPAP and who are already infrequent users of treatment. There is evidence that the behaviour of patients in the first two weeks of CPAP treatment predicts whether they will use it in the long term (<LINK REF="REF-Popescu-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Popescu 2001</LINK>). The advent of scales to facilitate early identification of poorly compliant CPAP users may help future researchers to select these patients (<LINK REF="REF-Weaver-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weaver 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>It seems self-evident that better compliance must be a favourable outcome, but the evidence base for improved health status as a consequence of increased hours of CPAP use is slight (<LINK REF="REF-Stepnowsky-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stepnowsky 2002</LINK>), which leaves the important question of what constitutes optimum CPAP usage unanswered. A difference in average usage of 10 to 15 minutes per night with auto-CPAP did coincide with a reduction in symptoms in favour of auto-CPAP of just over half a point on the Epworth scale. However, the clinical relevance of this effect size is limited by the short-term nature of the cross-over studies, with uncertain impact on long-term cardiovascular morbidity, and the lack of an effect for the same outcomes in longer-term parallel group trials. In addition it is not known whether for a population and a given amount of resource a greater health gain could be achieved by offering more patients a trial of pressure modification, rather than trying to optimise treatment in those already given a CPAP device, but failing to adhere. Auto-CPAP is more expensive than fixed CPAP and bi-level PAP is considerably more expensive than both (at least in the UK; see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> for approximate price differences). Cost-benefit analysis was not reported in any of the reviewed studies but is an important issue and should be addressed in any future studies along these lines.</P>

<P>Most of the studies showed high levels of compliance with CPAP in the control limbs. In unselected patients with moderate to severe disease, the auto-titration of delivered pressure has been shown to increase the average 'machine-on' time by around 10 to 15 minutes per night, although this result is drawn from cross-over studies. The direction of the effect from data analysed from parallel studies was similar, but the pooled result did not reach statistical significance. Selected patients may stand to gain greater benefit from the use of auto-CPAP machines; possibly relating to their required level of pressure to suppress apnoea, or because they have not tolerated fixed CPAP. Confirmatory work in these patients would help to clarify the results of our analyses. Bi-level PAP may increase initial uptake but a cost analysis is needed before it is recommended as first line treatment. The effects on machine usage of humidification and CPAP with expiratory pressure relief are uncertain. The studies we assessed recruited participants with moderate to severe OSA judging by baseline respiratory disturbance indices, and it is unclear whether modifying pressure in patients with less pronounced sleep apnoea is beneficial. Generally, research to date has failed to address what interventions are effective in people who find CPAP difficult to tolerate. Further work to identify responders would help to elucidate this issue.</P>

<P>'An urn with 2 differently coloured paper clips was prepared. One clip was blindly withdrawn, and its corresponding treatment noted on a folded piece of paper in an opaque envelope which was then sealed. The clip was then replaced in the urn along with another coloured clip, which represented the other treatment. This was repeated until 20 envelopes had been produced. Because a number of patients who did not meet the entry requirements, were randomised and then withdrawn from the study, a further 5 envelopes were subsequently prepared using the same method. This method leads toward roughly equal group sizes whilst maintaining unpredictability of sequence and sample sizes.'</P>

<P>Following electronic searches conducted on the Cochrane Airways Group sleep apnoea trials register 1180 studies were identified. From searches run on Psycinfo on 16 April 2003, 243 references were identified. Seventy studies were retrieved for full paper assessment. Four studies were ongoing (Douglas 2000; Hukins 2001; <LINK REF="STD-Morton-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Morton 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zozula-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zozula 2001</LINK>). A total of 46 studies were excluded - please see '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>'. Twenty-four studies met the inclusion criteria for the review. One study (<LINK REF="STD-S_x00e9_ri_x00e8_s-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sériès 1997</LINK>) was identified from the bibliography of <LINK REF="STD-d_x0027_Ortho-2000" TYPE="STUDY">d'Ortho 2000</LINK>. One non-English language paper is awaiting assessment from the most recent electronic search (<LINK REF="STD-Huang-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2001</LINK>, January 2004).</P>
<P>The most common reason for exclusion from the review was lack of randomisation (N = 16). Nine studies were excluded as they were laboratory-based and not designed to detect effects on long-term compliance. Four papers were review articles. <LINK REF="STD-Plan_x00e8_s-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Planès 2003</LINK> compared home-titrated auto-CPAP with laboratory-titrated fixed CPAP and was excluded on the basis that the study comparison was two-fold, and subject to confounding. Four studies were excluded due to the comparison of active interventions, rather than active and control treatments (<LINK REF="STD-Khanna-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Khanna 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Massie-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Massie 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wiest-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Wiest 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wiest-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Wiest 2002</LINK>).<BR/>

<P>Following an update search conducted in January 2005, a total of 65 references were identified. Following the identification of duplicates, a total of 16 studies were identified as being potentially relevant. Two studies are ongoing (Allen 2004; CRISP). A supplementary search of PubMed in March 2005 identified one additional reference (<LINK REF="STD-Hukins-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hukins 2004</LINK>). Seven new studies met the inclusion criteria of the review (DeMolles 2004; <LINK REF="STD-Hussain-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hussain 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hukins-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hukins 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marrone-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Marrone 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marshall-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Marshall 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Noseda-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Noseda 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 2003</LINK>).</P>
