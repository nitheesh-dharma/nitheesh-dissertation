<P>Giving early selective surfactant to newborn babies on assisted ventilation who have early signs of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) reduces the risk of short-term and longer-term lung injury.</P>
<P>Pulmonary surfactant is a substance that prevents the air sacs of the lungs from collapsing by reducing surface tension. Surfactant is often lacking in the lungs of newborn babies with RDS. The effectiveness of surfactant extracts in increasing their survival rate has been confirmed. The question remains about the best time to start giving surfactant. The review of trials compared early selective treatment of RDS (within the first two hours of life) to late selective treatment and found evidence of the benefit of early therapy.</P>

<P>Clinical trials have confirmed that surfactant therapy is effective in improving the immediate need for respiratory support and the clinical outcome of premature newborns. Trials have studied a wide variety of surfactant preparations used either to prevent (prophylactic or delivery room administration) or treat (selective or rescue administration) respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Using either treatment strategy, significant reductions in the incidence of pneumothorax, as well as significant improvement in survival, have been noted. It is unclear whether there are any advantages to treating infants with respiratory insufficiency earlier in the course of RDS.</P>

<P>Six randomized controlled trials met selection criteria. Two of the trials utilized synthetic surfactant (Exosurf Neonatal) and four utilized animal-derived surfactant preparations.</P>
<P>The meta-analyses demonstrate significant reductions in the risk of neonatal mortality (typical risk ratio (RR) 0.84; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 0.95; typical risk difference (RD) -0.04; 95% CI -0.06 to -0.01; 6 studies; 3577 infants), chronic lung disease (typical RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.55 to 0.86; typical RD -0.04; 95% CI -0.06 to -0.01; 3 studies; 3041 infants), and chronic lung disease or death at 36 weeks (typical RR 0.83; 95% CI 0.75 to 0.91; typical RD -0.06; 95% CI -0.09 to -0.03; 3 studies; 3050 infants) associated with early treatment of intubated infants with RDS.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-09-29 13:04:53 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of pulmonary surfactant. Surfactant lines the alveolar surface and prevents atelectasis at end expiration. Pulmonary surfactant is predominantly dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine with lesser amounts of other phospholipids including phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylinositol. In addition, pulmonary surfactant also contains neutral lipids and four distinct surfactant proteins (SP-A, SP-B, SP-C, and SP-D). These proteins may play a role in surfactant secretion, recycling, cooperative functioning with other SPs and phospholipids (<LINK REF="REF-Possmayer-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Possmayer 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schurch-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schurch 1992</LINK>), and innate host defense of the lung (<LINK REF="REF-Wright-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 1997</LINK>). The physiologic functions of surfactant include the ability to lower surface tension, and the ability to rapidly adsorb, spread, and reform a monolayer in the dynamic conditions associated with the respiratory cycle (<LINK REF="REF-Jobe-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jobe 1993</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-10-01 18:08:40 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Clinical trials have confirmed that surfactant therapy is effective in improving the immediate need for respiratory support and the clinical outcome of premature newborns (<LINK REF="REF-Sinclair-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sinclair 1992</LINK>). Trials have studied a wide variety of surfactant preparations used either prophylactically or in the treatment of established RDS. Using either treatment strategy, significant reductions in the incidence of pneumothorax, as well as significant improvement in survival, has been noted.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-09-29 12:38:10 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although both prophylactic surfactant administration and surfactant treatment of infants with established RDS are successful treatment strategies, the original trials comparing treatment strategies appeared to demonstrate that prophylactic surfactant had greater clinical benefit. In one systematic overview of trials performed in the 1990s that compared prophylactic surfactant administration to surfactant treatment of established RDS, infants who received prophylactic therapy had a decreased incidence of pneumothorax, pulmonary interstitial emphysema (PIE), and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Soll-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soll 2001</LINK>). Selective treatment in infants with RDS ranged from 90 minutes to eight hours of age. In a more recent systematic review that included trials of prophylactic surfactant compared to early stabilization on nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), the advantages of prophylactic administration are no longer apparent (<LINK REF="REF-Rojas_x002d_Reyes-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rojas-Reyes 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Earlier treatment of infants with evolving RDS may offer many of the advantages of prophylactic therapy. Early treatment may decrease the need for ventilatory support and avoid barotrauma that results from even short periods of assisted ventilation (<LINK REF="REF-Nilsson-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nilsson 1978</LINK>). However, surfactant treatment reserved for infants with more severe RDS offers the advantage of treating only infants with serious clinical disease, eliminating the potential risks and costs of treating relatively mildly affected infants.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Cochrane reviews that address trials of pulmonary surfactant in neonates</HEADING>
<P>Multiple systematic reviews have addressed the use of animal-derived surfactant preparations or synthetic surfactant preparations in the prevention or treatment of RDS. Meta-analyses of the original randomized controlled trials of surfactant for the treatment and prevention of RDS were first published in <I>Effective Care of the Newborn</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Soll--1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soll 1992</LINK>). Since then, multiple systematic reviews have been published in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> including reviews of protein-free synthetic surfactant for the prevention and treatment of RDS (<LINK REF="REF-Soll-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soll 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soll-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soll 2010</LINK>) and reviews of animal-derived surfactant for the prevention and treatment of RDS (<LINK REF="REF-Soll-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soll 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seger-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seger 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Reviews that compare different surfactant preparations (<LINK REF="REF-Soll-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soll 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pfister-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pfister 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pfister-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pfister 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Singh-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 2011</LINK> (non-Cochrane review)) as well as different treatment strategies (<LINK REF="REF-Soll-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soll 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stevens-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevens 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soll-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soll 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rojas_x002d_Reyes-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rojas-Reyes 2012</LINK>) have been published.</P>
<P>A companion review to this systematic review addresses the clinical issue of prophylactic surfactant administration (intubation and surfactant administration to infants at high risk of developing RDS) compared to surfactant treatment of RDS (<LINK REF="REF-Rojas_x002d_Reyes-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rojas-Reyes 2012</LINK>). In recent years, the increased utilization of prenatal steroids and the routine use of early continuous distending pressure may have changed the risk/benefit analysis of aggressive universal prophylactic intubation and treatment of infants at high risk of RDS.</P>
<P>This review evaluates early selective treatment of RDS (within the first two hours of life) compared with late selective treatment in infants with established RDS. The previous published version of this review was last updated in 1999 (<LINK REF="REF-Soll-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soll 1999</LINK>).</P>

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2012-09-29 12:43:37 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors separately extracted, assessed, and coded all data for each study using a form that was designed specifically for this review. For each included study, information was collected regarding the method of randomization, blinding, drug intervention, stratification, and whether the trial was conducted at a single center or multiple centers. Information regarding inclusion criteria, including gestational age, postnatal age at the time of treatment, and disease severity criteria for the rescue treatment group was noted. Information was collected on clinical outcomes including pneumothorax, PIE, PDA, sepsis, NEC, IVHs (any IVH and severe IVH), PVL, BPD (defined at 28 days), CLD (defined at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age) ROP, neonatal mortality, mortality prior to hospital discharge, and BPD or death. Long-term outcomes were sought, including neurodevelopmental outcome at approximately two years corrected age (acceptable range 18 months to 28 months) including: cerebral palsy, mental retardation (Bayley Scales of Infant Development Mental Developmental Index &lt; 70), legal blindness (&lt; 20/200 visual acuity), and hearing deficit (aided or &lt; 60 dB on audiometric testing). The composite outcome "neurodevelopmental impairment" was defined as having any one of the aforementioned deficits.</P>
<P>Limited data were available on long-term follow-up. The one study that reported on follow-up included the following clinically important outcomes that were added to our analysis post hoc visual impairment, auditory impairment, pathologic muscle tone, and pathologic walking.</P>
<P>Differences in assessment were resolved by discussion. For each study, final data were entered into Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>) by one review author and then checked by the second review author. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-European-Study-1992" TYPE="STUDY">European Study 1992</LINK> was a<B> </B>randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study that compared a policy of giving surfactant to all intubated babies of gestational age 26 to 29 weeks with a policy of treating only those babies developing RDS. A total of 420 babies were included in the study with 212 given early surfactant treatment and 208 babies given selective surfactant. The study involved blinded administration of either surfactant (colfosceril palmitate, Exosurf) or air placebo, within two hours of birth. Babies in either group developing RDS during the following 18 hours received two unblinded doses of surfactant 12 hours apart. Babies without RDS received a second dose of surfactant or air as originally randomized 18 hours after the first dose. The primary outcome of the trial was survival to age 28 days with an intact central nervous system (CNS), specifically without cranial ultrasound evidence of parenchymal cyst formation or post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus. The secondary outcomes were incidence of RDS requiring rescue treatment, and the duration of intubation, intensive care, and oxygen therapy. In addition, the study measured and reported the following outcomes: any air leak syndrome (including PIE, pneumothorax, and pneumomediastinum), pneumothorax, PIE, PDA, and NEC. The use of prenatal steroids in each group was 24%.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">OSIRIS 1992</HEADING>
<P>The aim of this randomized multicenter trial was to determine the best regimen for the administration of a synthetic surfactant in efforts to prevent and treat RDS (<LINK REF="STD-OSIRIS-1992" TYPE="STUDY">OSIRIS 1992</LINK>). Of the 6774 babies recruited to the trial, the outcome was known for 6757 (99.7%) infants. There were 2690 babies judged to be at high risk of RDS at less than two hours of age and these were randomly allocated to either early administration or delayed selective administration. These 2690 infants were further randomized in a factorial design to either two doses of surfactant 12 hours apart or the option of third and fourth doses at 12- to 36-hour intervals if signs of RDS persisted or recurred. There were another 4067 infants who later developed RDS who were also recruited to this comparison, giving a total of 3376 infants allocated up to four doses (of whom, 45% received more than two) and 3381 allocated two doses. The primary outcomes measured in this study were death or dependence on supplemental oxygen at 28 days of life, death at any time, and prolonged oxygen dependence. The secondary outcomes measured were major cerebral abnormality, pneumothorax, pulmonary hemorrhage, other air leak, treated PDA, recurrent apnoea, NEC, pneumonia diagnosed after 48 hours, neonatal seizures, and cryotherapy for ROP. The use of prenatal steroid was 23.3% in the early surfactant treatment group and 20.7% in the delayed surfactant treatment group.</P>

<P>The aim of this prospective, randomized, controlled study was to investigate if a single dose of surfactant given shortly after birth to infants with established surfactant deficiency would prevent progression of RDS and development of BPD (<LINK REF="STD-Konishi-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Konishi 1992</LINK>). Thirty-two neonates weighing 500 g to 1500 g with documented surfactant deficiency and without evidence of severe birth asphyxia, infection, prolonged rupture of membranes of 72 hours or longer, or oligohydramnios were randomly assigned to receive a single intratracheal dose of surfactant-TA (100 mg/kg) either within 30 minutes of birth (N = 16, early group) or at six hours of age (N = 16, late group). The primary outcomes reported were neonatal mortality, BPD, air leaks, IVH, PDA, and ROP. None of the infants in the early treatment group received steroids.

<P>The aim of this randomized controlled multicenter clinical trial was to investigate whether early (&lt; one hour after birth) surfactant administration would be superior to late treatment (two to six hours after birth) in preterm infants 27 to 32 weeks' gestational age (<LINK REF="STD-Gortner-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gortner 1998</LINK>). Animal-derived surfactant was given to 317 infants randomized to either early surfactant treatment (154 infants) or late surfactant treatment (163 infants).The primary outcome measured was time on mechanical ventilation. The secondary outcomes measured were survival until discharge, survival without BPD (i.e. supplemental oxygen or need for mechanical ventilation at 28 days), oxygen dependency at 36 weeks' postconceptional age, PIE, pneumothorax requiring chest tube drainage, pulmonary hemorrhage, and time on nasal CPAP. Further secondary outcomes included PDA, IVH, PVL, and ROP.

The study included 43 extremely premature infants who needed artificial ventilation within three hours after delivery who were randomly assigned to either early (N = 21) or delayed (N = 22) administration of animal-derived surfactant. The secondary outcomes reported were: duration of mechanical ventilation, incidence of air leaks, pneumothorax, PIE, radiographic score according to the Toce scale at age 28 to 30 days, and the incidence of other complications of prematurity such as IVH, PVL, ROP, and NEC.

The 75 infants included in this study were intubated in the delivery room owing to respiratory insufficiency and were randomized into two groups: group A, comprising 35 neonates who were submitted to surfactant within the first hour of life and group B, comprising 40 neonates who were not submitted to surfactant within the first hour of life. The surfactant used in this study was animal-derived surfactant. The outcomes measured and reported were pneumothorax, intracranial hemorrhage, PDA, pulmonary hemorrhage, NEC and sepsis, ROP, BPD (oxygen requirement at 28 days or requirement for supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks adjusted age) and further need for oxygen therapy, and neonatal survival.

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Timing of surfactant</HEADING>
<P>While each of the studies sought to compare early versus delayed surfactant administration, significant differences were noted in the timing of the first dose. <LINK REF="STD-Konishi-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Konishi 1992</LINK> administered the early dose of surfactant within the first 30 minutes of life with a mean time of 18 minutes to surfactant administration in the early group. The European Exosurf Trial (<LINK REF="STD-European-Study-1992" TYPE="STUDY">European Study 1992</LINK>) and the OSIRIS Trial (<LINK REF="STD-OSIRIS-1992" TYPE="STUDY">OSIRIS 1992</LINK>) both defined early treatment as prior to two hours of life. The median time to surfactant administration in the early group in the OSIRIS trial (<LINK REF="STD-OSIRIS-1992" TYPE="STUDY">OSIRIS 1992</LINK>) was 118 minutes in the early group. <LINK REF="STD-Gortner-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gortner 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Lefort-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lefort 2003</LINK> used one hour of life as the cut-off for early treatment. The average time to surfactant administration in the early group in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Gortner-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gortner 1998</LINK> was 31 minutes. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Plavka-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Plavka 2002</LINK> considered early treatment as surfactant administration given immediately after intubation, with an eligibility criteria for the study as intubation and assisted ventilation needed within three hours after delivery for significant RDS with a mean time of five minutes to surfactant administration in the early group.</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Study population</HEADING>
<P>All studies attempted to evaluate a population at high risk for RDS, but differed slightly in their inclusion criteria. <LINK REF="STD-Konishi-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Konishi 1992</LINK> included babies of 500 g to 1500 g whose weight was appropriate for gestational age and whose surfactant deficiency had to be documented by analysis of the gastric aspirate. The European Exosurf Trial (<LINK REF="STD-European-Study-1992" TYPE="STUDY">European Study 1992</LINK>) included infants between 26 and 29 weeks' gestational age. <LINK REF="STD-Gortner-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gortner 1998</LINK> included neonates between 27 and 32 weeks' gestational age. The OSIRIS trial (<LINK REF="STD-OSIRIS-1992" TYPE="STUDY">OSIRIS 1992</LINK>) did not specify specific inclusion criteria for gestational age or weight. <LINK REF="STD-Plavka-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Plavka 2002</LINK> included newborns with a gestational age of less than 30 weeks. <LINK REF="STD-Lefort-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lefort 2003</LINK> studied infants less than 34 weeks' gestational age. All studies excluded infants with pre- or postnatal congenital anomalies, as well as infants with oligohydramnios or prolonged rupture of membranes &gt; 72 hours; all studies required informed consent.</P>

In the studies utilizing a natural surfactant extract, <LINK REF="STD-Konishi-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Konishi 1992</LINK> measured ventilatory requirements in the first seven days of life. <LINK REF="STD-Gortner-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gortner 1998</LINK> measured length of mechanical ventilation as primary outcomes. <LINK REF="STD-Plavka-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Plavka 2002</LINK> measured CLD or death at 36 weeks' postconceptional age as the primary outcome. <LINK REF="STD-Lefort-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lefort 2003</LINK> did not differentiate primary from secondary outcomes but did measure pneumothorax, intracranial hemorrhage, PDA, pulmonary hemorrhage, NEC and sepsis, ROP, BPD (oxygen requirement at 28 days or requirement for supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks' adjusted age) and further need for oxygen therapy, and neonatal survival. Secondary outcomes in six of the seven studies included complications of prematurity. Hentschel 2009 reported on follow-up outcomes which included auditory impairment, visual impairment, pathologic walking, and pathologic muscular tone (<LINK REF="STD-Gortner-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gortner 1998</LINK>).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-10-01 17:57:13 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Surfactant replacement therapy has been shown to improve clinical outcome, whether given prophylactically to infants at high risk of developing RDS, or when given to infants with established RDS (<LINK REF="REF-Soll--1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soll 1992</LINK>). A broad range of criteria for both timing of treatment and disease severity (two related but clearly distinct clinical issues) has been successfully utilized. This leaves clinicians with uncertainty regarding the optimal timing of surfactant treatment.</P>
<P>In this review, we evaluated the merits of early selective surfactant treatment compared to delayed selective surfactant treatment in intubated infants with RDS. Six studies were identified. Of the six studies, the OSIRIS trial (<LINK REF="STD-OSIRIS-1992" TYPE="STUDY">OSIRIS 1992</LINK>), which utilized synthetic surfactant, is by far the largest study, and dominated the estimates of the effect of these treatment strategies. Given the relatively small number of infants studied in the trials of animal-derived surfactant extracts, it is hard to draw conclusions regarding any differences in the effects of animal-derived versus synthetic surfactant when used early in the treatment of respiratory distress. Overall, early selective surfactant administration decreased the risk of acute pulmonary injury (decreased risk of pneumothorax, PIE, and overall air leak syndromes) and decreased the risk of neonatal mortality and CLD compared to delayed selective treatment of infants with established RDS. There was also a trend toward a reduction in the risk of BPD or death at 28 to 30 days of life with the use of early selective surfactant. Based on these data, recommendations favoring earlier treatment seem reasonable.</P>
<P>Early surfactant treatment is distinct from true 'prophylactic' surfactant administration. In this review, early treatment was given to infants already intubated for respiratory support; in trials of prophylactic surfactant administration, infants at high risk of developing RDS are intubated for the purpose of giving surfactant therapy. It is hard to judge the relative value of early surfactant treatment compared to true prophylactic use of surfactant in the absence of any randomized trials that have directly compared these policies.</P>
<P>The evidence supporting prophylactic surfactant treatment has changed in recent years. The original studies comparing prophylactic to selective treatment were conducted in a clinical setting where there was little prenatal use of corticosteroids to promote lung maturation. In addition, infants were not stabilized in the delivery room on CPAP in order to help establish an adequate functional residual capacity. Analysis of these studies from the 1990s suggests that prophylactic rather than delayed administration of surfactant to all infants deemed at high risk for RDS reduces the risk of pneumothorax, PIE, BPD or death, as well as mortality. More recent trials suggest the opposite effect; the Vermont Oxford Delivery Room Trial (<LINK REF="STD-Dunn-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Dunn 2011</LINK>) and the NICHD SUPPORT trial (<LINK REF="STD-SUPPORT-2010" TYPE="STUDY">SUPPORT 2010</LINK>) suggest improved outcome in infants who are stabilized on nasal CPAP and only receive surfactant if intubated for respiratory insufficiency. Meta-analysis of these trials clearly demonstrates the differences in these studies and those conducted in the 1990s (<LINK REF="REF-Rojas_x002d_Reyes-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rojas-Reyes 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>This apparent tension can be resolved if the following is considered; in current practice, it may be best to stabilize infants on nasal CPAP and treat only if they have signs and symptoms of worsening RDS. However, once intubated, it is probably of some value to administer surfactant very shortly thereafter. The potential benefit of earlier treatment is consistent with evidence of lung injury from animal studies that demonstrate leakage of proteins into the alveolar spaces of the surfactant-deficient lung that act as surfactant inhibitors (<LINK REF="REF-Jobe-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jobe 1993</LINK>). Exogenous surfactant has reduced the leakage of such surfactant-inhibiting proteins in animal models (<LINK REF="REF-Ikegami-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ikegami 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jobe-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jobe 1993</LINK>). In the original trials of prophylaxis, even small delays in treating infants with established RDS appear to be clinically important. <LINK REF="STD-Kattwinkel-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kattwinkel 1993</LINK> conducted a study comparing prophylactic versus early surfactant therapy in the 29 to 32 week' gestational age population of premature neonates. Criteria for intubation and early selective surfactant treatment were liberal; an FiO<SUB>2</SUB> requirement of 0.30 with radiographic findings not consistent with another respiratory process prompted intubation for surfactant therapy. In the studies of early treatment, criteria for the early selective treatment group were frequently more stringent than in the selective treatment group of <LINK REF="STD-Kattwinkel-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kattwinkel 1993</LINK>. The OSIRIS trial (<LINK REF="STD-OSIRIS-1992" TYPE="STUDY">OSIRIS 1992</LINK>) required intubation for respiratory distress prior to surfactant dosing; however, no child was intubated for the sole purpose of surfactant administration. The European Exosurf trial (<LINK REF="STD-European-Study-1992" TYPE="STUDY">European Study 1992</LINK>) enrolled only infants at high risk for RDS and intubated for respiratory distress before two hours of life. <LINK REF="STD-Gortner-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gortner 1998</LINK> administered the first dose of surfactant within the first hour of life if respiratory distress required intubation. <LINK REF="STD-Plavka-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Plavka 2002</LINK> included infants that required intubation within the first three hours of life, with immediate administration of surfactant and subsequent initiation of HFOV. <LINK REF="STD-Lefort-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lefort 2003</LINK> administered surfactant to infants if they clinically presented with RDS and they required mechanical ventilation, with an FiO<SUB>2</SUB> of &gt; 0.04 and PaO<SUB>2</SUB>/FiO<SUB>2</SUB> ratio of 175 mmHg or less. Clearly, <LINK REF="STD-Kattwinkel-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kattwinkel 1993</LINK> had a lower threshold for selective surfactant treatment, and surfactant was given earlier than in most of the included studies in this review. The selective treatment group of <LINK REF="STD-Kattwinkel-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kattwinkel 1993</LINK> had a median time to first surfactant dose of 90 minutes versus the 118 minutes noted in the OSIRIS study (<LINK REF="STD-OSIRIS-1992" TYPE="STUDY">OSIRIS 1992</LINK>) trial for early selective treatment.</P>
<P>Estimates show that not all infants judged to be at high risk for RDS are surfactant deficient. Of the trials included in this meta-analysis, only <LINK REF="STD-Konishi-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Konishi 1992</LINK> estimated surfactant deficiency prior to surfactant administration. He found only 66% of those judged at risk for RDS based on a birthweight criterion of 500 to 1500 g to have surfactant deficiency at birth. <LINK REF="STD-Kattwinkel-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kattwinkel 1993</LINK> noted that of those randomized to early selective surfactant treatment only 43% of 621 infants required surfactant as indicated by their admittedly liberal criteria. Clearly prophylaxis with surfactant would over treat a large number of infants judged at risk for RDS, and this over treatment may be justified to save the life of every 20th child. However, it appears that treatment with surfactant within the first three hours of life in those infants intubated for respiratory distress confers the benefits of reduced mortality and pneumothorax while treating a substantially smaller portion of those infants judged at risk prenatally.</P>
<P>Prenatal steroids improve the outcome of premature infants at risk for RDS (<LINK REF="REF-Crowley-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowley 2006</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Gortner-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gortner 1998</LINK> provided the only included study carried out in a population where the majority of infants' mothers had received a complete course of prenatal steroids. He did not document a significant reduction in rates of pneumothorax or neonatal mortality. The review of studies comparing prophylactic versus delayed selective surfactant administration was also carried out in populations not fully benefiting from the documented effects of prenatal steroids. <LINK REF="STD-Gortner-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gortner 1998</LINK> questions the impact of prophylactic or early treatment in the population of steroid-treated infants, who are at less risk of RDS. However, most other studies of surfactant replacement have suggested a synergistic effect of these two therapies (<LINK REF="REF-Jobe-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jobe 1993</LINK>).</P>

<P>Early surfactant administration to intubated infants significantly reduces the risk of key clinical outcomes including pneumothorax, PIE, CLD, and neonatal mortality. The difficulty of judging which infant is at risk for surfactant deficiency continues. The meta-analysis would suggest that intubated neonates with early respiratory distress should be given surfactant as early as possible.</P>

<P>Improved identification of infants at risk for RDS will improve the selection criteria for prophylactic or early selective surfactant therapy. Newer less invasive techniques of surfactant administration should be tested in both an at-risk population (prophylactic treatment) and in infants with early signs of respiratory distress (early selective surfactant treatment).</P>
