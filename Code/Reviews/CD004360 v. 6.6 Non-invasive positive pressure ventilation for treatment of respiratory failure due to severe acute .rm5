<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-10-23 17:16:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) enhances breathing in acute respiratory conditions by resting tired breathing muscles. It has the advantage that it can be used intermittently for short periods, which may be sufficient to reverse the breathing problems experienced by patients during severe acute asthma. We undertook this review to determine the effectiveness of NPPV in patients with severe acute asthma. Six randomised controlled trials were included in the review. Compared to usual medical care alone, NPPV reduced hospitalisations, increased the number of patients discharged from the emergency department, and improved respiratory rate and lung function measurements. The application of NPPV in patients with asthma, despite some promising preliminary results, still remains controversial. Further studies are needed to determine the role of NPPV in the management of severe acute asthma and especially in status asthmaticus.</P>

<P>Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition causing inflammation and changes to the airways. Care of people with asthma includes routine and urgent management across primary and tertiary care; however, due to sub-optimal long-term care and delays in obtaining help during acute exacerbations, the mortality and morbidity related to asthma is still a major health concern.

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-10-15 23:49:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We carried out a search in the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials (July 2012). Following this, the bibliographies of included studies and review articles were searched for additional studies (July 2012).</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-09-10 16:45:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomised controlled trials of adults with severe acute asthma as the primary reason for presentation to the emergency department or for admission to hospital. Asthma diagnosis was defined by internationally accepted criteria. Studies were included if the intervention was usual medical care for the management of severe acute asthma plus NPPV applied through a nasal or facemask compared to usual medical care alone. Studies including patients with features of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were excluded unless data were provided separately for patients with asthma in studies recruiting both COPD and asthmatic patients.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-09-10 16:45:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A combination of two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information where required. All data were analysed using RevMan 5.1. For continuous variables, a mean difference and 95% confidence interval were used and for dichotomous variables, risk ratio with 95% confidence interval were calculated.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-10-23 17:16:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified six trials for inclusion. Five studies on 206 participants contributed data, while one study was available in abstract form only and was not fully incorporated into this review. For the primary outcome of endotracheal intubation there were two studies that contributed data: two intubations were needed in 45 participants on NPPV and no intubations in 41 control patients (risk ratio 4.48; 95% CI 0.23 to 89.13). There were no deaths in either of these studies. Length of hospital stay was reported in two studies, though meta-analysis was not possible. Hospitalisation was reported in one small study, in which there were three admissions out of 17 on NPPV and 10 admissions out of 16 in control patients (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.09, 0.84).</P>

<P>This review of studies has highlighted the paucity of data that exist to support the use of NPPV in patients in status asthmaticus. As such this course of treatment remains controversial despite its continued use in current clinical practice. Larger, prospective randomised controlled trials of rigorous methodological design are needed to determine the role of NPPV in patients with asthma.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-10-23 17:16:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition causing inflammation, as well as structural and related functional changes of the airways. It is characterised by recurrent attacks on breathlessness and wheezing, which vary in severity and frequency from person to person. During acute exacerbations of asthma the lining of the bronchial tube swells, and the smooth muscle around the airway contracts, causing a narrowing of the airway that reduces the flow of air into and out of the lungs, which is known as bronchoconstriction (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2011</LINK>). This narrowing of the airways may be in response to exposure to a variety of stimuli including allergens (i.e. immunoglobulin E (IgE)-dependent release of mediators from mast cells) or other factors such as exercise, cold air or irritants (<LINK REF="REF-NHLBI-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHLBI 2007</LINK>). Current evidence suggests asthma affects 300 million people globally (<LINK REF="REF-Masoli-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Masoli 2004</LINK>) and is estimated to account for one in every 250 deaths worldwide, many of which are preventable (<LINK REF="REF-Masoli-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Masoli 2004</LINK>). In 2009, the Global Initiative for Asthma reported that asthma prevalence ranges from 1% to 18% in different populations around the world (<LINK REF="REF-GINA-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 2010</LINK>). In 2009, the prevalence of asthma in the US was 8.2% of the population, that is 24.6 million people (<LINK REF="REF-Akinbami-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akinbami 2011</LINK>). Asthma is the tenth leading contributor to the overall burden of disease in Australia (<LINK REF="REF-AIHW-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">AIHW 2010</LINK>) affecting 14.7% of all Australians (<LINK REF="REF-Braman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Braman 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-AIHW-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">AIHW 2008</LINK>). As such, asthma has been an Australian national health priority since 1996, with one in five Australians diagnosed with asthma at some point in their lives (<LINK REF="REF-AIHW-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">AIHW 2008</LINK>). One study suggests a cumulative incidence of asthma to middle age of 37% (<LINK REF="REF-Burgess-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burgess 2008</LINK>). In one calendar year, asthma is reported to account for 2.4 million general practice encounters, 105,000 emergency department visits and 40,000 hospital admissions (0.5% of all admissions) in Australia (<LINK REF="REF-AIHW-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">AIHW 2005</LINK>). The asthma healthcare burden is significant and increasing (<LINK REF="REF-Bahadori-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bahadori 2009</LINK>), with costs in the developed world estimated at USD300 to USD1300 per patient (<LINK REF="REF-Braman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Braman 2006</LINK>). The effects of asthma on quality of life are also significant. In one survey, 25% of adults with asthma rated their health as only 'fair to poor' compared with 14% of adults without asthma (<LINK REF="REF-AIHW-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">AIHW 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>The causes of asthma are not completely understood, although known risk factors for developing asthma include inhaling asthma triggers, such as allergens, tobacco smoke and chemical irritants. Asthma is incurable; however, appropriate management can control the disorder and enable people to enjoy a high quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2011</LINK>). Care of people with asthma includes routine and urgent management across primary and tertiary care.  However, due to sub-optimal long-term care and delays in obtaining help during acute exacerbations, the mortality and morbidity related to asthma is still a major health concern (<LINK REF="REF-Braman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Braman 2006</LINK>).  A 2010 publication on asthma control across five European countries reported that the proportion of asthmatics with 'not well-controlled' asthma had not improved since 2006, with a patient-reported 'physician diagnosis' of asthma of 6.1% of the study population (15 million people) (<LINK REF="REF-Demoly-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Demoly 2010</LINK>). The subsequent burden of disease is steadily increasing resulting in confounding pressures on the healthcare system as well as families and patients themselves (<LINK REF="REF-Masoli-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Masoli 2004</LINK>). This morbidity has been attributed to sub-optimal delivery of care, including under-treatment with corticosteroids, limited knowledge and poor asthma self-management skills among patients with severe asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Gibson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibson 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kandane_x002d_Rathayake-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kandane-Rathayake 2009</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-09-10 16:45:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kristin V Carson">
<P>While non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) is not commonly used in asthma, it has been established as an alternative treatment option for patients admitted to hospital with hypercapnic respiratory failure secondary to acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (<LINK REF="REF-Meduri-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meduri 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Foglio-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foglio 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bott-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bott 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kramer-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kramer 1995</LINK>). Traditionally, patients who do not respond to conventional treatment are invasively mechanically ventilated. This involves sedation, intubation, attachment to a ventilator and transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU). Most patients do recover with tracheal intubation and assisted ventilation. However, these treatments are associated with high morbidity and there may be considerable difficulties weaning this patient group from ventilation (<LINK REF="REF-Brochard-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brochard 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Esteban-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esteban 1995</LINK>). In addition, although intubation and mechanical ventilation are common practice, complications can result from the intubation process (damage to local tissue, drug interactions, side effects to procedures) and during the course of ventilation (ventilator-associated pneumonia, pneumothorax and sinusitis) (<LINK REF="REF-Fagon-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fagon 1993</LINK>). Prolonged stays in ICU are therefore common.</P>
<P>NPPV employs a full facial or nasal mask that administers ventilatory support from a flow generator. NPPV may include bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). In BiPAP, a different pressure is used during the inspiratory and expiratory phases of the respiratory cycle, while in CPAP, only one constant positive airway pressure is maintained throughout the respiratory cycle (<LINK REF="STD-Gupta-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 2010</LINK>). NPPV enhances ventilation by unloading fatigued ventilatory muscles and its use has been established in the treatment of patients with a variety of chronic hypo-ventilatory syndromes (<LINK REF="REF-Moloney-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moloney 1999</LINK>). NPPV has the advantage that it can be applied intermittently for short periods, which may be sufficient to reverse the ventilatory failure. Moreover, sedation is not required allowing patients to eat, drink and talk, and also permitting participation in decisions about their own care. Finally, the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia with NPPV use is lower than in intubated patients (<LINK REF="REF-Guerin-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guerin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kramer-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kramer 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nourdine-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nourdine 1999</LINK>). Since the 2000s NPPV has been increasingly used as an adjunct therapy in the management of acute exacerbations of COPD, congestive heart failure and other conditions. NPPV has been successfully used to treat patients with COPD who are prone to exacerbations of respiratory failure. One systematic review of trials in patients with respiratory failure has shown significant reductions in mortality, need for intubation, complications, treatment failure and length of hospital stay with rapid improvements in blood gases and respiratory rate among patients with COPD (<LINK REF="REF-Ram-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ram 2003</LINK>). A trend favouring NPPV for other causes of respiratory failure, including acute respiratory distress syndrome and asthma has also been observed (<LINK REF="REF-Brochard-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brochard 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ram-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ram 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Keenan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keenan 2009</LINK>). For these reasons it is believed that NPPV may be an effective and worthwhile intervention for use in people with a severe acute exacerbation of asthma.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-09-10 16:45:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>NPPV has been postulated to have a direct bronchodilating effect (<LINK REF="REF-Buda-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buda 1979</LINK>) and improve alveolar recruitment. The bronchodilatory effect has been found to be independent of drug dispersion (<LINK REF="STD-Soroksky-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Soroksky 2003</LINK>). This is thought to be due to the effect of external positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) offsetting intrinsic PEEP that builds up during an asthma attack (<LINK REF="REF-Broux-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Broux 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Aldrich-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aldrich 1993</LINK>). The improved flow through collateral lung channels to atelectatic lung segments then re-expands atelectatic lung regions (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 1979</LINK>) and improves ventilation-perfusion mismatch, subsequently reducing the work of breathing (<LINK REF="STD-Soroksky-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Soroksky 2003</LINK>). As such, NPPV has been thought to assist inspiratory muscles (<LINK REF="REF-Shivaram-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shivaram 1987</LINK>). CPAP has also been shown in two small studies to improve respiratory mechanics in histamine-induced asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Martin-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin 1982</LINK>) and reduced bronchial hypersensitivity in methacholine-induced asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Lin-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 1995</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-09-10 16:45:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kristin V Carson">
<P>Evidence has shown that NPPV is effective in COPD patients with acute respiratory failure (<LINK REF="REF-Jasmer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jasmer 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Liesching-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liesching 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ferrer-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferrer 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schmidbauer-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmidbauer 2011</LINK>); however, the role of NPPV in patients with acute respiratory failure following an exacerbation of asthma is not clear. In some ways the pathophysiological condition of acute respiratory failure in asthma is similar to that of acute respiratory failure in COPD. As such, patients with respiratory failure due to acute exacerbations of asthma that are not responding to conventional therapy and require mechanical ventilation could also improve with the administration of NPPV. Few reports have described the use of NPPV in patients with respiratory failure due to exacerbations of asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Meduri-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meduri 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Benhamou-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benhamou 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thys-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thys 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soma-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Soma 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soma-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Soma 2008</LINK>) with conflicting results. To consolidate the available evidence into a usable summary, this review is necessary to provide a systematic overview of the evidence to support the use of NPPV in respiratory failure due to severe acute exacerbations of asthma.</P>

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2012-09-10 16:45:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Data for each study were extracted independently by a combination of two review authors onto standardised data collection forms.

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2012-10-23 17:16:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Two review authors independantly assessed each study for risk of bias in relation to allocation sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and outcome assessors, handling of missing data, selective outcome reporting and other threats to validity, in line with recommendations made in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>). A retrospective risk of bias assessment using the above method was also applied to the original study included in the review.</P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2012-09-10 16:45:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>We did not have any unit of analysis issues as we did not include any cross-over studies, cluster randomised studies or multiple observational studies in the review.

Where statistics essential for analysis were missing (e.g. group means and standard deviations for both groups were not reported) and could not be calculated from other data, we attempted to contact the study authors to obtain data. Loss of participants that occurred prior to performance of baseline measurements was assumed to have no effect on the eventual outcome data of the study. Any losses after the baseline measurement were taken were assessed and discussed on an intention-to-treat analysis basis. A narrative synthesis was also performed for each of the included studies.</P>

We reported results using the fixed-effect model; however, in the presence of significant heterogeneity, we planned to investigate possible sources of heterogeneity using the following pre-planned sensitivity analyses: study quality, duration of NPPV, time to initiation of NPPV, type of NPPV and type of mask used to administer NPPV.</P>

<BIAS_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2012-09-10 16:45:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Providing the minimum inclusion of 10 studies, we planned to explore potential reporting biases using a funnel plot. Asymmetry in the plot could have been attributed to publication bias though it could also have been due to true heterogeneity, poor methodological design, quality or artefact.

<P>Blinding would be difficult given the nature of the study where intervention would use non-invasive ventilation. It is especially difficult to employ blinding of personnel as titration of the respiratory pressures in the ventilators requires expert knowledge. It is also likely that participants and personnel would be aware of the allocation of any sham NPPV. However, four of the five studies were judged to have been at low risk of performance bias since objective outcome measures were included and lack of blinding is unlikely to have influenced the outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Soroksky-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Soroksky 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Miranda-2004" TYPE="STUDY">De Miranda 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brandao-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Brandao 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gupta-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 2010</LINK>).

<P>A total of five studies met all of the inclusion criteria and combinations of these were able to assess the effectiveness of NPPV for various outcomes. These included mortality and tracheal intubation as primary outcomes in addition to the secondary outcomes of the number of hospital admissions, length of hospital stay, length of ICU/ITU stay, symptom scores, lung function tests, ABG, respiratory rate and complications. Data were analysed as per the pre-defined methods described in '<LINK TAG="SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS" TYPE="SECTION">Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</LINK>'.

We were unable to meta-analyse data for the following reasons. <LINK REF="STD-Gupta-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 2010</LINK> reported a statistically significant shortening of hospital stay favouring intervention; however, data were reported using median and interquartile range, which is unsuitable for meta-analysis. <LINK REF="STD-Soroksky-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Soroksky 2003</LINK> reported that the mean stay in hospital was 2.5 days (SD 1.3 days) in the control group compared to 4 days (SD 0 days) for people receiving NIPV, but the authors were unable to calculate a P value as there was no variance for an independent sample t-test of days in hospital. </P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Length of ICU stay</HEADING>
<P>One study conducted in the ICU with 53 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Gupta-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 2010</LINK>) showed that NPPV provided a statistically significant benefit towards shortening of ICU stay. The data were reported using median and interquartile range, and as such meta-analysis was not possible. Another study (<LINK REF="STD-Soroksky-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Soroksky 2003</LINK>) reporting ICU stay in hours for 15 NPPV and 15 control participants found no difference between groups (MD 0.30; 95% CI -0.63 to 1.23; <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>).</P>

NPPV was found to confer an absolute PEF improvement of 19.97 %predicted, which was both clinically and statistically significant (MD 19.97; 95% CI 15.01 to 24.93; <LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-De-Miranda-2004" TYPE="STUDY">De Miranda 2004</LINK> reported peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) using litres per minute and, as such, was unable to be meta-analysed with the other studies (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>). The results reported by <LINK REF="STD-De-Miranda-2004" TYPE="STUDY">De Miranda 2004</LINK> showed statistically significant improvements in PEF across both the control and intervention groups, with an inter-group analysis showing a statistically significant advantage in the intervention group compared to the control group (P &lt; 0.05).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-10-23 17:16:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Five RCTs with a total of 203 participants were selected for inclusion in this review. A further RCT was identified as an ongoing study that could not be used for meta-analyses at the present time. Although there were some methodological variations between studies, all were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of NPPV in the treatment of acute respiratory failure due to asthma. All six studies concluded that the addition of NPPV to standard therapy may be beneficial. The results did not show a clear benefit for NPPV when the primary outcomes, namely mortality rate and tracheal intubation, were examined. This could partly be explained by the fact that only two studies with a total of 86 participants could be meta-analysed. Both studies showed a mean admission pH that was above 7.35. At this non-acidotic range of pH (being neutral to slightly basic), significant mortality or tracheal intubation is not expected. </P>
<P>In general, NPPV provided favourable outcomes when used in conjunction with usual medical care in most secondary objectives. Treatment with NPPV provided statistically significant improvements for the number of hospital admissions, length of ICU stay and length of hospital stay. In addition, the use of NPPV in the ward setting had statistically and clinically significant positive impacts on many important lung function parameters, namely PEF, FVC, FEV1 and FEF<SUB>25-75</SUB>. However, this did not translate into corresponding improvements in ABG results. As such, there is a need for more studies to be conducted to investigate the effectiveness of NPPV for these aspects. There was also a marginal statistically significant reduction in respiratory rate when NPPV was used. Subgroup analyses for respiratory rate showed a clinically significant improvement when given in the ward setting, although it was not statistically significant. Unfortunately, no data were available to formally examine the symptom scores, treatment failure or complications associated with the use of NPPV.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-09-10 16:45:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Following the update of this review additional studies have been identified to examine the effectiveness of NPPV in the treatment of respiratory failure due to severe acute exacerbations of asthma. NPPV certainly confers some degree of benefit for patients with severe acute asthmatic attacks. However, the lack of published data in terms of complications and treatment failure leaves questions regarding the overall safety of NPPV largely unresolved. </P>
<P>More studies are required to demonstrate the effectiveness of NPPV in terms of the primary outcomes, namely mortality and endotracheal intubation, particularly among patients who become acidotic due to respiratory failure. Studies addressing the effectiveness and safety of NPPV when conducted in a general ward setting versus an ICU setting are needed as some degree of expertise is required to monitor patients using NPPV. Further studies using different forms of NPPV, such as bi-PAP or CPAP are also required to allow subgroup analysis comparing specific forms of NPPV. Applying varying settings of NPPV in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Brandao-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Brandao 2009</LINK>) provided some information regarding the benefit of using higher pressure ventilation settings versus lower pressure ventilation settings. This was a positive step towards understanding the benefit of NPPV in different ventilation settings and should be considered in future studies.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-10-23 12:02:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Study quality was an issue in this review with all studies having at least one source of unclear or high risk of bias identified. The greatest barrier in the assessment of study quality was inadequate reporting by study authors. In addition, two RCTs had unclear allocation concealment and three had unclear random sequence generation. One study was translated from Portuguese (<LINK REF="STD-De-Miranda-2004" TYPE="STUDY">De Miranda 2004</LINK>), with some aspects unable to be clearly translated. In summary, the body of evidence identified from the included six RCTs with 253 patients did not allow for a robust conclusion in favour of the use of NPPV for patients with acute severe asthma. For more information regarding the quality of included studies see Summary of findings table 1. The reasons or rationale for up- or downgrading the quality of a body of evidence in the <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> are described in the table footnotes.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2012-10-23 17:16:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Selecting only RCTs ensures that only high-quality investigations are included. However, it has the potential of introducing selection bias by excluding relevant studies that do not fulfil the studies strict criteria. The review is also susceptible to publication bias, even though we attempted to search all relevant databases for published and non-published studies. Despite numerous attempts to contact study authors for raw data, the inability to obtain all relevant information might introduce a bias, which has the potential to alter the outcome of the meta-analysis. In addition, biases that occur because of methodological designs of included studies might not be adequately accounted for, despite the rigorous assessment by two independent review authors.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2012-09-10 16:45:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>One review by <LINK REF="REF-Keenan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keenan 2009</LINK> identified two studies that examined the effects of NPPV in the treatment of respiratory failure due to severe asthma. The studies included were <LINK REF="STD-Soroksky-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Soroksky 2003</LINK>, which was also included in this review, and a second study <LINK REF="REF-Holley-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holley 2001</LINK>, which was stopped early due owing to a recognised marked bias in recruitment of participants. The authors concluded that although the trials showed trends towards the benefits of NPPV, the small number of participants included rendered the evidence weak. Similarly more recent studies by <LINK REF="REF-Soroksky-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soroksky 2010</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Murase-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murase 2011</LINK> produced limited evidence to support the use of NPPV in carefully selected patients with severe asthma attack, although the authors reported that larger and higher-quality studies are required to confirm these findings. Our review did include a larger number of studies, however we agree that while the effects of intervention showed a trend towards the benefits of NPPV in asthma, the small number of trials and participants in the review highlights the paucity of data while making it impossible to provide any recommendations for the use of NPPV in the treatment of respiratory failure due to acute exacerbations of asthma.</P>

<P>This review highlights the paucity of evidence available to support NPPV for the treatment of respiratory failure due to severe acute asthma exacerbations and as such no implications for current practice can be made. Some promising results in favour of NPPV are evident; however, the weaknesses described above and the concern with prolonged hospitalisation suggest that the regular use of NPPV in status asthmaticus remains controversial and additional research is required before changes to practice can be made.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-10-23 12:04:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>RCTs of good methodological design are needed to address the question of NPPV for treating respiratory failure in asthmatics following acute exacerbations adequately. Researchers should consider:</P>
<UL>
<LI>RCTs with a sample size large enough to demonstrate a meaningful result;</LI>
<LI>attention should be paid to maximising the treatment of the control group with efficacious asthma treatments) such as early systemic corticosteroids, frequent short-acting beta-agonists combined with ipratropium bromide, inhaled corticosteroids and intravenous magnesium sulfate) and all treatment groups should have maximal medical management (i.e. best practice minimum);</LI>
<LI>a core set of outcome measures for future studies need to be included with primary outcomes of endotracheal intubation and mortality during the hospital admission and secondary outcomes of respiratory rate, ABGs and pH, lung function measurements, length of hospital and ITU/ICU stay, treatment failure (adverse events and complications) and symptom scores (e.g. Borg scores);</LI>
<LI>adequate reporting of methodology, outcomes and potential biases in the study design need to be included in the publications;</LI>
<LI>clearly defined respiratory failure on based on the presence of hypoxaemia;</LI>
<LI>attempts to mask NPPV treatment (as demonstrated by <LINK REF="STD-Soroksky-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Soroksky 2003</LINK>) are possible and should be encouraged to reduce the bias associated with a lack of blinding.</LI>

<P>statistical analysis was performed with statistics software (SPSS 10, SPSS, Chicago, IL, US). The analysis was based on intention to treat. Statistical significance was assumed at a P value of &lt; 0.05. The normalcy of distribution was evaluated with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The differences between continuous variables were analysed with the Mann-Whitney U test if not normally distributed, or with Student's t test if normally distributed. The differences between categorical variables were analysed with Fisher's exact test. Improvements in RR, HR, pH, PaO<SUB>2</SUB> and PaCO<SUB>2</SUB>, were analysed with repeated-measures ANOVA. The within-groups factor was time (0, 1, 1, 2 and 4 hours) and the between-groups factor was the experimental group (NPPV vs. standard medical therapy). Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed to study the effect of NPPV on ICU and hospital stay. Differences between the 2 curves were analysed with the log-rank test</P>

<P>The fraction of inspired oxygen was titrated to maintain SpO<SUB>2</SUB> &#8805; 92%</P>
<P>The patient was started on an inspiratory/expiratory pressure of 8/4 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O, and titrated in increments of 2 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O, based on continuous pulse oximetry, ABG values (at 1, 2 and 4 hours, and periodically thereafter, as clinically indicated), alleviation of dyspnoea, decrease in RR and patient-ventilator synchrony (Maximum inspiratory pressure was 20 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O, maximum expiratory pressure was 10 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O)</P>
<P>Frequently checked for air leaks, and the patient was constantly encouraged and reassured. NPPV was applied continuously for as long as possible, and interruption of NPPV was allowed only for spirometry or secretion clearance, and for no more than 5 minutes. Inhaled bronchodilators were given via T-piece in the ventilator circuit, with the ventilator's built-in ultrasonic nebuliser, without discontinuing the circuit</P>

<P>The median length of stay in hospital for the intervention group was 38 hours (interquartile range 24 to 48 hours) compared to 54 hours (interquartile range 48 to 72 hours) for the control group (P = 0.01). The median length of stay in the respiratory ICU was 10 hours (interquartile range 8 to 20 hours) for the intervention group compared to 24 hours (interquartile range 18 to 36 hours) in the control group (P = 0.01). 64% (16/25) of patients in the control group and 85.7% (24/28) of patients in the intervention group had a &#8805; 50% improvement in FEV1 at 4 hours (P = 0.08). Time to disappearance of accessory muscle use was 2.3 (± 1.4) hours in the intervention group and 3.2 (± 1.7) hours in the control group (P = 0.06). The mean dose of inhaled salbutamol required during hospitalisation was 31.2 mg (± 14.5) in the NPPV group and 42.8 mg (± 10.4) in the control group (P = 0.008). This was significantly lower in the NPPV group. The mean dose of inhaled ipratropium required during hospitalisation was 5.2 mg (± 2.8) in the NPPV group and 7.6 mg (± 2.2) in the control group with a P value of 0.007.

<TD>
<P>The number of hospital admissions was analysed on an intention-to-treat basis with 17.6% (3/17) participants in the intervention group and 62.5% (10/16) in the control group requiring hospitalisation (P = 0.0134). During follow-up (1 month), only 1 patient in each group was re-admitted to the emergency department and both were discharged after a short treatment without re-hospitalisation. Average length of stay in the emergency department was 5.9 hours (± 1.3) for the intervention group and 5.6 hours (± 1.3) for the control (P = NS). There was an increase in FEV1 for the intervention group during the 3 hours of BPV treatment (mean ± SD; intervention: 56.1 ± 16.3; control: 42.3 ± 15.9; P = 0.03), which steadily increased for an additional hour after discontinuation of treatment (mean ± SD; intervention: 57.4 ± 17.7; control: 43.9 ± 16.7; P = 0.04). PEFR also increased in the intervention arm at both 3 and 4 hours post treatment (P = 0.03 and P = 0.04, respectively), and although FVC showed a similar improvement at 3 hours for the intervention arm (P = 0.03) this was not maintained at 4 hours post BPV administration (P = NS). Respiratory rate decreased significantly in the BPV group (41.3 ± 12.8%) compared to the control group (31 ± 11.4%) at 4 hours' follow-up (P = 0.02). 2 patients in the intervention arm and 1 in the control arm could not tolerate the nasal mask and did not complete the 3-hour protocol, subsequently they were withdrawn from the study</P>
