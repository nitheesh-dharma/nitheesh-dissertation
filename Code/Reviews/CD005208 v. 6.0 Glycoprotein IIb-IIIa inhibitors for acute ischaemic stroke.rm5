<TITLE>Glycoprotein IIb-IIIa inhibitors for acute ischaemic stroke</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-02-09 19:57:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Question:</B> We wanted to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of GP IIb-IIIa inhibitors, alone or in combination with thrombolytic agents, in individuals with acute ischaemic stroke.</P>
<P>
<B>Background:</B> Most strokes are due to a sudden blockage of an artery in the brain (this type of stroke is called an ischaemic stroke). In most ischaemic strokes, the blockage is caused by a blood clot. Clots form because platelets circulating in the blood in determined conditions aggregate. Glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa inhibitors are potent, fast and selective blockers of the platelet aggregation and, thus, might help to dissolve blood clots, prevent new clots from forming, and so improve the blood supply to the brain. It is possible, if the drug is given within a few hours of the start of a stroke, that this would reduce brain damage and improve the chances of the individual making a good recovery. However, GP IIb-IIIa inhibitors can also cause bleeding in the brain, which are associated with poorer outcomes. This review aimed to evaluate whether GP IIb-IIIa inhibitors, administered within six hours from stroke onset, reduce the proportion of dead or dependent individuals.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics: </B>We identified four trials with a total of 1365 participants in searches conducted up to June 2013: three trials compared the intravenous GP IIb-IIIa inhibitor Abciximab with intravenous placebo and one trial compared the intravenous GP IIb-IIIa inhibitor Tirofiban with intravenous aspirin.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results: </B>The results showed that GP IIb-IIIa inhibitors cause bleeding in the brain, and that this complication offset any benefits. Therefore, GP IIb-IIIa inhibitors should be avoided in people with acute ischaemic stroke.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence:</B> Overall, the studies were considered at low risk of bias.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-02-08 11:08:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa inhibitors are antiplatelet agents that act by antagonising GP IIb-IIIa receptors on the platelet surface and block the final common pathway to platelet aggregation by preventing the binding of fibrinogen molecules that form bridges between adjacent platelets. Thus, GP IIb-IIIa inhibitors could favour endogenous thrombolysis by reducing thrombus growth and preventing thrombus re-formation through competitive inhibition with fibrinogen and, due to their mechanism of action, are likely to have a more profound antiplatelet effect with more rapid onset than conventional antiplatelet agents, such as aspirin or clopidogrel. Currently used in clinical practice for the treatment of individuals with acute coronary syndromes and during coronary angioplasty, GP IIb-IIIa inhibitors could also be useful for the treatment of people with acute ischaemic stroke.</P>

<P>We included four trials involving 1365 participants. Three trials compared the intravenous GP IIb-IIIa inhibitor Abciximab with intravenous placebo (1215 participants) and one trial compared the intravenous GP IIb-IIIa inhibitor Tirofiban with intravenous aspirin (150 participants). Treatment with either of these GP IIb-IIIa inhibitors did not significantly reduce long-term death or dependency (odds ratio (OR) 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77 to 1.22, for the comparison between Abciximab and placebo; OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.92, for the comparison between Tirofiban and aspirin) and had no effect on deaths from all causes (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.53, for the comparison between Abciximab and placebo; OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.35 to 2.82, for the comparison between Tirofiban and aspirin). Abciximab was associated with a significant increase in symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (OR 4.6, 95% CI 2.01 to 10.54) and with a non-significant increase in major extracranial haemorrhage (OR 1.81, 95% CI 0.96 to 3.41), whereas the only small trial comparing Tirofiban with aspirin showed no increased risk of bleeding complications with Tirofiban (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.03 to 3.19, for symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage; OR 3.04, 95% CI 0.12 to 75.83, for major extracranial haemorrhages).

<BODY MODIFIED="2014-02-12 11:11:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-02-12 10:52:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Currently, there is evidence that two pharmacological therapies are effective in treating individuals with acute ischaemic stroke: thrombolysis using recombinant tissue plasminogen activators (rt-PA) and the antiplatelet agent aspirin. The risks and benefits of these two therapies are summarised in two systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) produced by the Cochrane Stroke Group (<LINK REF="REF-Sandercock-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandercock 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wardlaw-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wardlaw 2009</LINK>). Thrombolytic therapy with intravenous rt-PA reduces the risk of death and disability, but not the risk of death alone, is associated with a definite risk of symptomatic cerebral haemorrhage and is deliverable to only a minority of people with stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Wardlaw-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wardlaw 2009</LINK>). Aspirin, which is indicated within 48 hours of the onset of a presumed ischaemic stroke, can be administered to the majority of individuals without a major risk of early haemorrhagic complications, but its benefit on an individual level is modest (for every 1000 people treated 13 more were alive and independent at the end of follow up) (<LINK REF="REF-Sandercock-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandercock 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Most of the data in the Cochrane review of antiplatelet agents referred to drugs that were given orally (<LINK REF="REF-Sandercock-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandercock 2008</LINK>); hence, the speed of onset of any antiplatelet effect may have been quite slow. There is therefore a strong case for looking for antithrombotic agents that are less risky than rt-PA but, like aspirin, can be given to the majority of individuals who experience a stroke. Antiplatelet agents that can be given intravenously and have a rapid onset of effect would also be advantageous. Glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa inhibitors, which are already used in clinical practice for the treatment of individuals with coronary disease, potentially fulfil these criteria. These agents were developed on the premise that blockade of the GP IIb-IIIa integrin present in platelets, the final pathway of platelet aggregation, would be more effective than blockade of the activation single pathway of platelet aggregation, the mechanism of action of conventional agents such as aspirin, ticlopidine, or clopidogrel. The GP IIb-IIIa inhibitor class includes the human/murine monoclonal antibody Abciximab, the synthetic peptide Eptifibatide, and the synthetic non-peptides Tirofiban, Lamifiban, Xemilofiban, Orbofiban and Sibrafiban (<LINK REF="REF-Bogousslavsky-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bogousslavsky 2001</LINK>). Currently, GP IIb-IIIa inhibitors are not licensed for any indication in cerebrovascular disease. However, these agents are approved for use, in addition to aspirin and heparin, during percutaneous coronary revascularisation (i.e. coronary angioplasty with or without stent implantation), in individuals with or without an acute coronary syndrome, and in the initial medical management of those with unstable angina or myocardial infarction (MI). Their effects have been analysed in a Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Bosch-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bosch 2010</LINK>). In individuals undergoing percutaneous coronary revascularisation, the periprocedural parenteral administration of GP IIb-IIIa inhibitors markedly reduced the risk of death or MI, albeit at the price of a moderate increase in the risk of severe bleeding. In people with unstable angina or MI, the risk of death or MI was only slightly reduced, the risk of death alone was not reduced and the risk of severe bleeding was slightly increased with these agents. Because it has been hypothesised that they can work to increase reperfusion of the ischaemic brain, GP IIb-IIIa inhibitors have been investigated for the treatment of individuals with acute ischaemic stroke.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-01-22 10:50:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Stroke is the second most common cause of death and the leading cause of disability in developed countries. Ischaemic stroke (i.e. stroke caused by a sudden blockage of an artery in the brain, usually by a blood clot) is the most common type of stroke, and the quick restoration of blood flow, as soon as the blockage occurs, is crucial for a good long-term outcome.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-02-12 10:49:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We aimed to evaluate the effect of GP IIb-IIIa inhibitors administered early after an ischaemic stroke, either alone or combined with thrombolytic agents, based on the hypothesis that they may favour clinical improvement, aiding reperfusion of the brain ischaemic area.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-02-12 10:52:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>GP IIb-IIIa inhibitors are potent antiplatelet agents that act quickly by antagonising GP IIb-IIIa receptors on the platelet surface where fibrinogen molecules bind, forming bridges between adjacent platelets. Because GP IIb-IIIa inhibitors inhibit the final pathway of platelet aggregation, they may be more effective than conventional antiplatelet agents, such as aspirin and clopidogrel, which interact with platelet aggregation with different mechanisms involving single pathways of platelet aggregation. This class of drug may favour endogenous thrombolysis by reducing thrombus growth and preventing thrombus re-formation and, therefore, they may aid reperfusion and clinical improvement if administered early after an ischaemic stroke.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-02-09 18:22:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>GP IIb-IIIa inhibitors, which are already used in clinical practice for the treatment of individuals with coronary disease, have also been studied for use in the treatment of those with ischaemic stroke. A systematic review of controlled clinical trials appeared necessary in order to assemble all the available data by which to evaluate the potential efficacy and safety of these agents in individuals with acute ischaemic stroke. The previous version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Ciccone-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ciccone 2006</LINK>) found that there was not enough evidence to draw conclusions regarding the efficacy or safety of GP IIb-IIIa inhibitor therapy in people with acute ischaemic stroke, but results from ongoing trials were awaited.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-02-09 16:47:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found a three-fold statistically significant excess risk of a symptomatic ICH associated with the use of GP IIb-IIIa inhibitors, which was not offset by any benefit on long-term death or disability.

<P>The review indicates high-level evidence for a negative risk to benefit ratio for GP IIb-IIIa inhibitors in the treatment of individuals with acute ischaemic stroke. Such evidence is derived mainly from trials of Abciximab. However, data from the only trial of Tirofiban included in this review did not show any trend for a clinical benefit in 150 participants. If data for participants who started treatment with Tirofiban or placebo within six hours from stroke onset in <LINK REF="STD-SaTIS-2011" TYPE="STUDY">SaTIS 2011</LINK> were available, additional information for this agent would be available. In the meantime, the present evidence does not support the conduct of further RCTs of GP IIb-IIIa inhibitors in individuals with acute ischaemic stroke.</P>
<P>We did not find any unconfounded studies investigating a GP IIb-IIIa inhibitor combined with intravenous rt-PA. We did not include either of the two studies of a GP IIb-IIIa inhibitor combined with intravenous rt-PA compared with intravenous rt-PA alone (<LINK REF="STD-CLEAR-2008" TYPE="STUDY">CLEAR 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CLEAR_x002d_ER-2013" TYPE="STUDY">CLEAR-ER 2013</LINK>) because both comparisons were confounded (both trials tested a lower dose of rt-PA in the combined group than in the control group).</P>

<P>We aimed to include all relevant publications in this review by using multiple overlapping searches of a number of databases, and contacting trial authors, colleagues and researchers in the field of study.
