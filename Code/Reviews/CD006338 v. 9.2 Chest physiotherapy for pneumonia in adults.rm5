<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-01-14 07:50:05 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Pneumonia is one of the most common health problems affecting all age groups around the world. Antibiotics represent the mainstay of pneumonia treatment, while other therapies are mostly supportive. Chest physiotherapy has been widely used as an adjunctive therapy for pneumonia in adults without any reliable evidence.</P>
<P>Six randomised controlled trials assessing 434 participants were included. The studies appraised four types of chest physiotherapy, namely conventional chest physiotherapy, osteopathic manipulative treatment (including paraspinal inhibition, rib raising, and diaphragmatic or soft myofascial release), active cycle of breathing techniques (including active breathing control, thoracic expansion exercises and forced expiration technique) and positive expiratory pressure. None of these techniques (versus no physiotherapy or placebo therapy) reduce mortality. Among three of the techniques (conventional chest physiotherapy, active cycle of breathing techniques and osteopathic manipulative treatment) there is no evidence to support a better cure rate in comparison with no physiotherapy or placebo therapy. Limited evidence indicates that positive expiratory pressure (versus no physiotherapy) and osteopathic manipulative treatment (versus placebo therapy) can slightly reduce the duration of hospital stay (by 2.02 and 1.4 days, respectively). In addition, positive expiratory pressure (versus no physiotherapy) can slightly reduce the duration of fever by 0.7 day, and osteopathic manipulative treatment (versus placebo therapy) might reduce the duration of antibiotic use by 1.93 days. No severe adverse events were found.</P>
<P>In summary, chest physiotherapy should not be recommended as routine additional treatment for pneumonia in adults. The limitation of our review is that six published studies which appear to meet the inclusion criteria are awaiting classification (five of which are published in Russian).</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-01-14 07:52:00 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-01-11 21:15:12 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Pneumonia is caused most commonly by bacteria but occasionally by viruses, fungi, parasites and other infectious agents. It is the leading cause of death from infectious disease (<LINK REF="REF-Niederman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Niederman 2001</LINK>). Pneumonias are typically classified as community-acquired pneumonia, hospital-acquired pneumonia (nosocomial pneumonia) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (the most serious form of nosocomial pneumonia, infecting patients who are mechanically ventilated for other reasons). It is estimated that community-acquired pneumonia costs the United States USD 12.2 billion in treatment per year (<LINK REF="REF-Colice-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colice 2004</LINK>), with an average mortality rate of 14% (<LINK REF="REF-Fine-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fine 1990</LINK>). Nosocomial pneumonia is the second most common nosocomial infection and the leading cause of death from hospital-acquired infection (<LINK REF="REF-Bowton-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bowton 1999</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-12-22 00:11:25 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Antibiotics represent the mainstay of pneumonia treatment, while other therapies are mostly supportive. These adjunctive therapies include supplementary oxygen, intravenous hydration and chest physiotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-George-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">George 1995</LINK>). Chest physiotherapy is an airway clearance technique that combines manual percussion of the chest wall by a caregiver, strategic positioning of the patient for mucous drainage, and teaching cough and breathing techniques.</P>
<P>Conventional chest physiotherapy includes postural drainage, percussion, chest shaking, huffing and coughing. Recently, several new physiotherapy techniques have been developed, including the active cycle of breathing techniques, positive expiratory pressure and osteopathic manipulative treatment. Active cycle of breathing techniques include active breathing control, thoracic expansion exercises and forced expiration technique, and sometimes postural drainage and chest clapping. Positive expiratory pressure uses devices to provide a positive expiratory pressure of 10 to 25 cmH<SUB>2</SUB>0 during expiration. It may stabilise airways by keeping them open during expiration, which may facilitate airway clearance. Osteopathic manipulative treatment includes bilateral paraspinal inhibition, bilateral rib raising, diaphragmatic myofascial release and soft myofascial release to the anterior thoracic inlet. It may improve chest wall mobility and enhance exercise tolerance.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-07-30 16:54:36 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>Chest physiotherapy assists in treating some of the symptoms of respiratory disorders, such as airflow obstruction, alterations in ventilatory pump functions and impaired exercise performance. The aim is to improve the patient's respiratory status and expedite recovery by enhancing airway clearance in lung diseases associated with hypersecretion and reduced airway resistance. Increased airway clearance enhances gas exchange and reduces the work of breathing (<LINK REF="REF-Wallis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wallis 1999</LINK>). Chest physiotherapy is best used for patients with copious secretions (more than 30 ml/day) and reduced ability to cough (<LINK REF="REF-Cochrane-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cochrane 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Graham-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Graham 1978</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-01-14 07:52:00 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Chest physiotherapies for cystic fibrosis, acute bronchiolitis and patients undergoing mechanical ventilation have been reviewed (<LINK REF="REF-Flenady-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flenady 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roqu_x00e9_-i-Figuls-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roqué i Figuls 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-der-Schans-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van der Schans 2009</LINK>). However, the clinical effectiveness of chest physiotherapy for pneumonia is controversial. Some clinical studies have concluded that chest physiotherapy did not hasten the resolution of pneumonia (<LINK REF="STD-Graham-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Graham 1978</LINK>) or was not useful (<LINK REF="REF-Britton-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Britton 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Britton-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Britton 1985</LINK>). Two studies suggested that larger or multi-centre trials were needed to confirm the findings (<LINK REF="REF-Ntoumenopoulos-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ntoumenopoulos 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tydeman-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Tydeman 1989</LINK>). Others concluded that chest physiotherapy had beneficial effects in patients with pulmonary infection (<LINK REF="REF-Hanying-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanying 2005</LINK>). However, chest physiotherapy may be ineffective and even harmful. It may cause an increase in oxygen consumption (<LINK REF="REF-Horiuchi-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horiuchi 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weissman-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weissman 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weissman-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weissman 1993</LINK>), bronchospasm (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 1975</LINK>), induce hypertension, increase oxygen demand (<LINK REF="REF-Horiuchi-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horiuchi 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weissman-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weissman 1993</LINK>), cause hypoxaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Connors-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Connors 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Poelaert-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poelaert 1991</LINK>) and even lead to rib fractures (<LINK REF="REF-Chalumeau-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalumeau 2002</LINK>).</P>

<P>In total, 434 participants (215 males, 219 females) were involved in the six trials, with 211 participants in the treatment group and 223 participants in the control group. The participants' ages ranged from 15 to 94 years. The included trials involved participants with acute pneumonia. Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bjorkqvist-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bjorkqvist 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tydeman-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Tydeman 1989</LINK>) included community-acquired pneumonia only, two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Noll-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Noll 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Noll-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Noll 2000</LINK>) included community-acquired pneumonia, nosocomial pneumonia and nursing home-acquired pneumonia. The remaining two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Britton-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Britton 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Graham-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Graham 1978</LINK>) did not describe the type of pneumonia. The severity of pneumonia was mild to moderate in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Graham-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Graham 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tydeman-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Tydeman 1989</LINK>), and not stated in the other four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bjorkqvist-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bjorkqvist 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Britton-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Britton 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Noll-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Noll 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Noll-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Noll 2000</LINK>).

Among these trials, the types of chest physiotherapies were significantly different to each another, including conventional chest physiotherapy, osteopathic manipulative treatment, active cycle of breathing techniques and positive expiratory pressure. Both treatment groups and control groups were given routine treatments such as antibiotics, oxygen therapy and other drug therapies, if necessary.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-01-11 21:15:12 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>Six randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 434 participants were included in this review, which appraised four types of chest physiotherapies (i.e. conventional chest physiotherapy, active cycle of breathing techniques, osteopathic manipulative treatment and positive expiratory pressure). None of the techniques were found to improve mortality of pneumonia in adults. Conventional chest physiotherapy, active cycle of breathing techniques and osteopathic manipulative treatment did not increase the cure rate of pneumonia nor the rate of chest X-ray improvement. Osteopathic manipulative treatment and positive expiratory pressure did reduce the mean duration of hospital stay by 2.02 and 1.4 days, respectively, whereas conventional chest physiotherapy and active cycle of breathing techniques did not. Positive expiratory pressure might reduce the duration of fever, while osteopathic manipulative treatment might not. In addition, osteopathic manipulative treatment might have an effect on reducing the duration of intravenous and total antibiotic treatments.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-01-11 21:15:12 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Most of the included RCTs were conducted around 10 to 30 years ago. The main positive conclusions (a decrease in duration of hospital stay, fever and antibiotic treatment) were based on two trials with small sample sizes, conducted more than 10 years ago. There have been advances in chest physiotherapies which have not yet been appraised in randomised controlled trials. The authors of <LINK REF="STD-Noll-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Noll 2008</LINK> are conducting a RCT which evaluates the effect of osteopathic manipulative treatment for elderly patients with pneumonia. The results are supposed to offer valuable information for this special population. Moreover, to a large extent, the effects of physiotherapy depend upon the skills of the practitioners. It has been reported that the duration, sessions and quality of chest physiotherapies vary from case to case (<LINK REF="REF-Guessous-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guessous 2008</LINK>). Misleading results may occur if the treatments are administered by unskilled practitioners. However, information on the experience and training of the physiotherapists who implemented the treatments was not available in most of the included trials. The techniques, the number and duration of sessions and the duration of the intervention period also varied across trials. We therefore recommend that caution is required when interpreting the results of this review and applying them to current practice.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-01-11 21:15:12 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>All included studies were of poor to moderate methodological quality. Firstly, although all studies stated that randomisation was used, none mentioned the method of randomisation. Secondly, only two of the six studies (<LINK REF="STD-Noll-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Noll 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Noll-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Noll 2000</LINK>) were double-blinded trials (in which participants and outcome assessors were blinded), and one (<LINK REF="STD-Britton-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Britton 1985</LINK>) was a single-blinded trial. Lack of blinding might cause overestimation of the effects. It should be noted that chest physiotherapy was performed by a physiotherapist, so it might be difficult to blind the practitioners. Thirdly, four of the six studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bjorkqvist-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bjorkqvist 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Britton-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Britton 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Graham-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Graham 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tydeman-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Tydeman 1989</LINK>) had more than 10% drop-outs, but none used an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, which aims to maintain the unbiased group comparison afforded by randomisation and to resolve the problem of non-compliance. Absence of an ITT analysis might lead to potential biases. Finally, the sample sizes of the six trials were too small to permit adequate assessment of this intervention. Moreover, there were challenges in obtaining high-quality evidence for physiotherapy interventions because of the difficulties in blinding the intervention, standardising the method of chest physiotherapy and defining clinically meaningful outcomes.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-01-11 21:32:03 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Six published studies appeared to meet the inclusion criteria but have not yet been included or excluded. Five papers are published in Russian and one was published in 1947 and we have not yet managed to retrieve a copy of the trial. This is the major limitation in our review and may lead to selective reporting bias. It was impossible to perform a funnel plot analysis to assess potential publication bias because of the limited number of trials for each outcome. Another limitation of our review is that none of the included studies were recent publications; most trials reported on participants treated in the 1980s and 1990s. Moreover, the publication date of the included studies varied from 1978 to 2000, which leads us to consider that definitions of care and cure in the different studies, plus medical management (including the methods of chest physiotherapy) may have differed. For these reasons, clinical heterogeneity was inevitable, although we had performed subgroup analyses on different types of chest physiotherapies and outcomes to minimise the effect of heterogeneity. Clinical heterogeneity might lead to bias if we combined the results of different studies by meta-analysis.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2009-12-22 00:35:26 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Although chest physiotherapy has been widely used in pneumonia, there is little evidence of any benefit (<LINK REF="REF-Guessous-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guessous 2008</LINK>). To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review to examine chest physiotherapy for pneumonia in adults. According to our results, chest physiotherapy has no benefit for mortality and cure rate. It can be costly as it requires equipment and experienced respiratory therapists, physiotherapists or clinicians to perform (<LINK REF="REF-Guessous-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guessous 2008</LINK>). Therefore, we recommend caution when prescribing chest physiotherapy for pneumonia in adults.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-12-22 00:35:47 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-12-10 10:39:50 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is limited evidence indicating that osteopathic manipulative treatment and positive expiratory pressure may reduce the mean duration of hospital stay. Osteopathic manipulative treatment could also reduce the duration of antibiotic treatment, while positive expiratory pressure could reduce the duration of fever. However, based on current evidence, chest physiotherapy should not be recommended as a conventional adjunctive treatment for pneumonia in adults.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-12-22 00:35:47 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Further well-designed randomised controlled trials addressing the role of chest physiotherapy for pneumonia in adults may be warranted. The following key points should be considered in the future studies: appropriate sample size with power to detect expected difference, rigorous standardisation of the method of chest physiotherapy, an appropriate comparator therapy, appropriate outcomes (the following categories might be included: mortality, cure rate, improvements in symptoms, improvements in laboratory results, duration of hospital stay, duration of antibiotic or other therapies, and quality of life), and the cost-effectiveness of the therapy.</P>

<P>The physiotherapy was positive expiratory pressure (PEP). In this study a bottle containing 10 cm of tap water was used. Patients were asked to sit up with their feet on the floor and blow bubbles at a calm speed into the bottle through a plastic tube (10 mm in diameter) with an air pressure just sufficient to overcome the resistance of the water. This method was used 20 times per hour from 9 am to 8 pm and continued after discharge. This study consisted of three group (A, B, C). Group A was control which underwent early mobilisation and "huffing". Group B members were given the same as A and deep breaths. Group C members were given the same as A and the method of bottle-blowing</P>
