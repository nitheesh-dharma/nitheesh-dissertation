Amended comparison two to GIV throughout. Interestingly very little correlation detected, as analysis as if the trials were parallel gives very similar results! Text now needs updating with methods and results amended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC amended following Peer review comments. I think Tom said he would come off as a review author, so could he be added to acknowledgements? Brian needs to have a look and could sign off on Peer Review at the same time perhaps?????&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks Emma J for comments on PLS. Happy for this to go to CJC,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC Dec 20th&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;=============================================================================&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks Emma,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have amended the abstract to clarify that we could not pool as there were almost no confirmed influenza infections in either of the other two trials in adults. Please could you run the revised version by Tom and Brian as they have not seen it yet!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;_________________________________________________&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma comments 11 Oct 2011&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looks much better, so thank you for the changes which I think will help readers. A few things (please also chec trhough tracked changes in the review):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The addition to the abstarct is not very good, but I was not quite sure why you didn't pool the data, so didn't try to spend ages crafting a sentence!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1. SPLIT VIRUS OR SURFACE ANTIGEN VACCINE VERSUS PLACEBO&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Protective effects of vaccination measured during the influenza season (late benefits):&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;it's confusing as to why the first sentence says there is a single study and the last paragraph of this sentence is about two other relevant trials - I think it's because these were older trials, perhaps with irrelevant vaccinations, but it would be helpful to be clearer in the results section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The text was lost from the original protocol so I added it back in (in modified form):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sub-group analysis will also be performed to compare the immediate and delayed response to whole virus and split virus vaccines in children and adults, as adverse reactions have been reported to be more frequent with whole virus vaccination in children. If possible, sub-group analysis will also be used to compare the main outcomes in subjects in long term hospital care and those in the community. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firstly I globally accepted tracked changes and made most of my own changes using tracked changes. I have quite a few queries. I think the review is quite a challenging read and there are many forest plots unlinked from the text and it was not always easy to work out which analysis matched with which statement in the review. As often happens with updates, the text has got a little convoluted in places and I think this needs attention from the authors before being ready for copy editing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wonder whether having a SOF and new ROB table means that we should make it a new citation version conclusions not changed? I think we will need to talk about SoF for this review. Is it a help or a hindrance?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PLS - does not follow recommendations in the Cochrane handbook. Please rewrite (I am not sure that I am able to do this effectively).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Had a go but you may be able to improve this!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Background&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have there been any more reviews on influenza vaccines? I am not sure that 2003 can any longer be classified as recent. Agreed, recent removed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;did you actually use kappa statistics, if so where reported? No so taken this out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I linked these unlinked refs: &lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Ashkenazi 2006&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Ashkenazi 2006&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Belshe 2007&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Belshe 2007&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;), but they had a and b after the refs respectively, so can you check these are the correct refs?&lt;/span&gt; Thanks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;you mention a quality score of 5 out of 5 which is a concept that is now not included in the review. Quite right. Removed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Please rephrase sentence containing 'non significant trend' Done&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sometimes it can be a bit confusing whether you are discussing results from a single study or pooled results and why. I can see this. Addressed where I can.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Because the analyses are not linked, it makes it confusing as to when one might expect to see one. E.g. is there a forest plot for this? &amp;quot;A small study in 24 volunteers with mild asthma (&lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Sener 1999&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Sener 1999&lt;/a&gt;) found no increase in asthma symptoms or deterioration in lung function in the two weeks following vaccination with split antigen trivalent vaccine&amp;quot; No!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The number of participants contributing to outcomes should be included I have started to do this for you. Thanks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why is there such a huge variation in the number of people contributing data to comparison 1 when the results are all from the same trial? Well spotted, the smaller numbers are those who had any exacerbation or tested postive for flu which is a small subset of those included&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are all the tables in the analyses (e.g. analysis 3)? They show nothing on the library or in RevMan I have removed the empty table. The others have narrative data from individual trials&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;3. WHOLE VIRUS SPLIT VIRUS versus SUBUNIT VACCINE - is this a three way comparison? In which case accept change from v to versus. There doesn't seem to be any data in the meta analysis, so can this be deleted? Wouldn't we normally suggest show one comparison and divide the control group? These are three active treatments. Versus is fine. Meta-analysis comparison deleted&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Where did this come from - I can't see a meta-analysis for it? No significant difference was found between exacerbation rates in the two groups over the first 42 days following vaccination; the risk difference -0.1 percentage points, (95% CI: -2.8 to 2.6 percentage points). This is a narrative description from an excluded study so I have moved it to the discussion&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;discussion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why is this disappointing? We are seeking to evaluate evidence an reviews, not to be disappointed in the results of a trial! &amp;quot;On the other hand the data from the new trial on longer term benefit of influenza vaccination in the prevention of asthma exacerbations caused by exposure to influenza virus in the community is disappointing &amp;quot;Ok&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Added a link to characteristics of included studies in the discussion to replace 'other data' - we don't have a section called other data do we?? Fair enough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There seems to be an inconsistent use of the work killed - and whether the viruses are alive or killed is not clear from the titles of the results section or the meta-analyses.Changed to inactivated throughout instead of killed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC July 2011 Elora will do second assessment in relation to risk of bias table. After discussion of disagreements in relation to blinding of participants and personnel we agreed to only call studies at low risk of bias for performance if an indication was given that the placebo was similar to the active injection. Text updated and now SoF to be added. &lt;span&gt;Andreeva excluded after translation as not RCT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC May 2011 Busse excluded, new search needed from Liz (now done and references added). RoB added&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC Aug 2010 Pedroza added and Kmiecik but data is cross-over so not entered!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC 2010 Update with Joannie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;8 new abstracts, 2 need translation and 2 new included studies on trivalent inactivated vaccine with short term outcomes only (both sponsored by Sanofi Pasteur).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have amended the RoB template and will await response from Joannie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC revision Feb 18&lt;br&gt;1. I have changed the order and labels of the Forest plots to benefits and then harms. The text also reflects this change in the order and labels for benefits and harms.&lt;br&gt;2. The results of the search has been moved up so that it now comes before the study descriptions.&lt;br&gt;3. Clarification of results from Bueving have been made in red. The significant difference was found in asthma quality of life scores in a small number of children....&lt;br&gt;Could you run this by Brian and Tom please, so they can see the changes post peer review? Ready for submission.&lt;br&gt;Chris&lt;br&gt;+++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;br&gt;Peer Review from Hans&lt;br&gt;1.General&lt;br&gt;Throughout the review, there is a disbalance between potential benefits and harms. Given the assumption that people are vaccinated in order to benefit from it, I would expect a larger emphasis on the benefits of the intervention. Harm (side-effects) are important, but secondary to benefit. If vaccination does not work, don't worry about side-effects.&lt;br&gt;I have difficulties understanding why the labeling 'early harmful effects' and 'late benefits' was chosen (see headings of results). What is late, what is early? Why not just benefits and harms (again, in that order), which can both be short term and long term? Or short term (2 weeks) and long term (6 months) which can be beneficial or harmful?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second point is, that a clear view on the relative importantce of the outcome methods might be helpful to give the review somewhat more focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A third point is, that for a good assessment of the benefits and harms of influenza vaccination, we need to take into account the incidence of influenza in children. This deserves some attention in background and discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MINOR: in the methods harms are labeled as 'early adverse effects', whereas in the results they appear under the heading 'early harmful effects'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.Abstract&lt;br&gt;Objectives: change order, by starting with benefits.&lt;br&gt;Results: too much focus on side-effects.&lt;br&gt;Authors'conclusions: change order: 1. uncertainty about degree of protection; 2. no increase in asthma exacerbations; 3. concern about side-effects of intranasal vaccination.&lt;br&gt;I would also stress the paucity of evidence for benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3.Plain language summary&lt;br&gt;See remarks under 1 and 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4.Main text - description of studies - results&lt;br&gt;There is a sequence problem: description of studies (with all studies being mentioned as well as their quality) now precedes the description at the start of the results that tells us how many studies were selected and included.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5.Results, section 1 (split virus - late benefits), third and second paragraph from the end.&lt;br&gt;The third paragraph from below, starting with &amp;quot;A study on 696 children&amp;quot; reports on a risk difference of -0.04, which may be statistically significant (although not sure, depends on rounding off). However, the paper provides crude and adjusted odds ratios. Adjusted odds ratio's are not significant (p = 0.10).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The structure of the second paragraph from below, starting with 'Bueving 2003' needs clarification. The 48% and 68% mentioned in the text are differences between influenza weeks and baseline, in 21 vs 19 children.&lt;br&gt;The last sentence does not make sense:. &amp;quot;...influenza vaccination ... in children when they show positive tests for influenza.&amp;quot; It seems to imply that you can vaccinate them after they show positieve tests. Please reword.&lt;br&gt;+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;br&gt;CJC FEb 2008&lt;br&gt;Brian has not come back to me on this review, so I have incorporated the changes advised by Tom (early harms and late benefits) and this is ready to go for Peer Review.&lt;br&gt;Thanks.&lt;br&gt;+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;br&gt;Jan 2008&lt;br&gt;Toby,&lt;br&gt;Could you send this on to Brian as an RM4 file so that he can edit it and return?&lt;br&gt;Thanks,&lt;br&gt;Chris&lt;br&gt;=====================================================&lt;br&gt;CJC picked up again Nov 2007&lt;br&gt;1. Try to Contact Walker about the trial that ended in 2003 - this turns out to be Fleming 2006&lt;br&gt;2. Feb 2004 is last listed search here...... new ones now incorporated.&lt;br&gt;3. Extra refs for Bueving need to be added and possibly data entered. Early data added and text updated from Vaccine publication. Also late data from ERJ publication. This is also reported in the results now.&lt;br&gt;4. Liz asked for a combined search result and references.&lt;br&gt;5. Boundaries for this review need checking. Separate issue relating to children with wheeze? Authors contacted for further data.&lt;br&gt;6. Results of searches now incorporated into the text. Need to go into what's new.&lt;br&gt;7. Search references imported.&lt;br&gt;8. New comparisons, data and characteristics need to be entered for Fleming. Study characteristics added and new outcome comparisons also added. Hard to untangle the high numbers reporting reactogenic events but rather small numbers saying that these are adverse events.&lt;br&gt;9. Fleming has now been incorporated into the results and Belshe and Askenasi mentioned.&lt;br&gt;Discussion and What's new have been revised.&lt;br&gt;I have removed Anna Bara from the author list as we have had no contact with her for several years.&lt;br&gt;Needs to go to Tom and Brian next. I will send them RTF file with changes tracked.&lt;br&gt;Refs for Belshe and Askenasi added.&lt;br&gt;=====================================================&lt;br&gt;1.This review is from the May Module.&lt;br&gt;2. References sorted in text.&lt;br&gt;3. Background for Abstract&lt;br&gt;Influenza vaccination is recommended for asthmatic patients in many countries as observational studies have shown that influenza infection can be associated with asthma exacerbations, but influenza vaccination itself has the potential to adversely affect pulmonary function. A recent overview concluded that there was no clear benefit of influenza vaccination in patients with asthma but this conclusions was not based on a systematic search of the literature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Synopsis&lt;br&gt;Although influenza vaccination is recommended for asthmatics in many national guidelines it is uncertain whether the benefits of potentially preventing asthma attacks due to influenza infection outweighs the risk of giving the vaccine (which may also worsen asthma for a few days after the vaccine is given). This review was designed to find all the evidence from randomised controlled trials that consider the impact of influenza vaccination in asthmatic patients of all ages. Nine trials were included in the review and four of these trials were of high quality. The studies covered a wide diversity of people, settings and types of influenza vaccination, so the results from the different trials were not combined . In one trial, no protective effect of influenza vaccination against asthma exacerbation was demonstrated, but the incidence of influenza was low during the study period. A higher number of asthma exacerbations following killed influenza vaccination was found in one trial such that for every 32 patients given the vaccine one would suffer a significant reduction in their airflow. The confidence interval for this result was wide and the estimated number to vaccinate for one such adverse effect ranged from seventeen to 333. When people with upper respiratory tract infections were excluded, this difference was no longer significant. The data available from randomised controlled trials is not of sufficient quality to resolve the issue of whether asthmatic patients benefit overall from influenza vaccination and a new trials are needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;5. Corrections as pointed out by Hans:&lt;br&gt;I have not put in relievers and need Patriarca's initial&lt;br&gt;Background section, line 5:&lt;br&gt;'asthma epidemics' should read 'influenza epidemics'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives section, under types of outcome measure:&lt;br&gt;I think you should add the use of bronchodilators (and perhaps other&lt;br&gt;relief medication as well), because you mention these in the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following has been added to the results:&lt;br&gt;The small new high quality study identified for the update of this review (Reid 1998) compared mean FEV1 and airway responsivess (PD20 metacholine) at 48 and 96 hours following injection of inactivated surface antigen in 17 adult asthmatic patiens compared with 5 patients who were given placebo. No significant differences were found in the mean levels in either group and no patient had a change in PD20 of more than two-fold.&lt;br&gt;The additional new study is mentioned in the abstract as well and no change in conclusions reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Additional references:&lt;br&gt;Jadad et al: 4th author: Jenknson - &amp;gt; Jenkinson&lt;br&gt;Patriarca, 1994: in full reference author is missing.&lt;br&gt;Update 1999&lt;br&gt;Ahmed added to excluded list.&lt;br&gt;Reid added to included list.&lt;br&gt;Data requested from Bourke 6_99&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2_5_3&lt;br&gt;New papers found and data extraction carried out by Jo. For me to look through.&lt;br&gt;_______________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;5 August 2003&lt;br&gt;EMAIL SENT TO MARIO CASTRO (first time vaccinees) and Toby is trying to track down KARL NICHOLSON.&lt;br&gt;Van der Wouden included. (both agreed). &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Citation needs to be completed. Done. details added to included studies from poster and draft paper.&lt;br&gt;Kut added and data entered&lt;br&gt;Redding added and data entered&lt;br&gt;What's new has been amended:&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;In July 2003 this review was updated and three new trials have been included. The first, Castro 2001, was a large cross-over trial (2032 asthmatic children and adults) that did not find an increase in adverse asthmatic events following inactivated influenza vaccine in the two weeks after vaccination. The second, Redding 2002, assessed the safety and tolerability of intra-nasal vaccination in 48 children and adolescents with asthma (parallel-designed trial) and found that it was safe and well-tolerated. The third, van der Wouden 2003, carried out a longer-term parallel-design trial in 696 children with inactivated influenza vaccine, but did not find a significant difference in influenza related asthma exacerbations compared to placebo over the following five months.&lt;br&gt;The conclusions of the current review are therefore that influenza vaccine does not appear to precipitate asthma exacerbations, but nor has it been conclusively shown to prevent influenza related asthma exacerbation.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract:&lt;br&gt;Synopsis altered to reflect new evidence&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Main results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nine trials were initially included. Four of these trials were of high quality. Four further articles have been included in two updates(Castro 2001;Redding 2002;Reid 1998;van der Wouden 2003). The included studies covered a wide diversity of people, settings and types of influenza vaccination, but data from the more recent studies that used similar vaccines have been pooled. The pooled results of two trials on 2126 people with asthma did not show any overall increase in asthma exacerbations following in the two weeks following influenza vaccination (Risk Difference 0.01, 95% confidence interval -0.01 to 0.04). A recent study on 696 children with asthma did not show a significant reduction in influenza related asthma exacerbations (Risk Difference 0.02, 95% confidence interval -0.02 to 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reviewers' conclusions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence from recently published trials indicates that there is no significant increase in asthma exacerbations immediately after vaccination (at least with inactivated influenza vaccination), but uncertainty remains about the degree of protection vaccination affords against asthma exacerbations that are related to influenza infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;RESULTS:&lt;br&gt;New text is in red in the review....&lt;br&gt;1. SPLIT VIRUS OR SURFACE ANTIGEN VACCINE v PLACEBO&lt;br&gt;EARLY OUTCOMES&lt;br&gt;Five high quality studies contributed to the data for this outcome (Castro 2001;Nicholson 1998; Stenius 1986; Reid 1998:van der Wouden 2003). The results of the two largest studies have been combined and the pooled results on 2126 people with asthma did not show any significant overall increase in asthma exacerbations following in the two weeks following influenza vaccination with a risk difference (RD) of 0.01, 95% confidence interval(CI) -0.01 to 0.04. Similarly the pooled results showed no significan difference in relation to a fall in Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR)of over 30% (RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.03), increased use of bronchodilators (RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.02), medical consultations (RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.02), or new or increased oral steroid usage (RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.01).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the earlier study on 262 patients (Nicholson 1998), with a quality score of five out of five, found a significant increase in the number of patients who suffered an exacerbation of asthma after inactivated split-virus or surface antigen vaccine administration. This was defined as a fall in PEFR of over 20%, in the first three days after injection; the risk difference was 0.031 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.058). Similarly, the number of patients with a fall of over 30% in their PEFR in the first three days after active vaccination was significantly higher than after placebo; risk difference 0.031 (95%CI 0.007 to 0.054). In a sub-group analysis, excluding patients with 'common colds' from the analysis reduced the difference to a non-significant trend, and subgroup analysis performed by the authors suggested that the majority of the exacerbations were observed in patients receiving vaccine for the first time. No other significant differences were found in the mean PEFR, bronchodilator usage (via nebuliser or metered dose inhaler), hospital admission, medical consultations, and oral steroid usage or asthma symptoms. No significant difference was reported between the results for patients given split-virus or subunit vaccines, but original data were not provided for the two groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The subsequent large high quality study (Castro 2001) on 2032 adults and children given inactivated influenza vaccination excluded a significant increase in asthma exacerbations both for three days and for 14 days following vaccination. The predefined significant difference was an absolute increase of 6% (Risk Difference of 0.06) and this was outside the confidence interval for this study and for the pooled result. It was also outside the confidence interval of the pooled results for 30% fall in PEFR, increased use of bronchodilators and oral steroids, and unscheduled medical consultations for asthma. Significant increase in any of these outcomes was therefore excluded for inactivated influenza vaccination in this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The heterogeneity between the results of Castro 2001and Nicholson 1998 is significant when the results are analysed as Peto Odds Ratios or Risk Differences. Further information has been requested from the authors of Nicholson 1998, particularly in relation to the two vaccines types used in this study. Information has also been sought from the authors of Castro 2001in relation to whether data is available about the previous vaccination status of the participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LATE OUTCOMES&lt;br&gt;A new study on 696 children has been identified for the 2003 update of this review (van der Wouden 2003). This was carried out the Netherlands over two influenza seasons and in the 42 asthma exacerbations related to positive throat swab identification of influenza virus, 24 occured in the vaccinated group and 18 in the placebo group. This represents a Risk Difference of 0.02 (95% CI -0.02 to 0.05) with a narrow confidence interval excluding a 6% absolute difference in exacerbations in the longer term following vaccination. The duration and severity of exacerbations were not significantly different between the two groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. LIVE ATTENUATED COLD RECOMBINANT VACCINE v PLACEBO&lt;br&gt;EARLY OUTCOMES&lt;br&gt;A further high quality study on 48 children was identified for the 2003 update (Redding 2002). There was no significant difference between groups in the primary outcome of the study (percentage change in percent predicted FEV1). There was also no significant difference in the secondary outcomes of asthma exacerbations, number of participants with reduction in PEF of over 15% or over 30% and use of beta-2 agonists as rescue medication. A previously identified study (Atmar 1989) of high quality (quality score: 3 out of five) included 17 asthmatic patients. No significant differences were found in adults for hospital admission with asthma exacerbation, fall in mean FEV1, number of patients with exacerbation (fall in FEV1 of over 12% or 50 ml). This study also reported that none of the vaccine recipients reported an increase in bronchodilator therapy following vaccination, but no numerical data were provided. The pooled results from these two studies did not show a significant difference in the risk of a drop in FEV1 on days 2-4 post vaccination, but the confidence interval was wide due to small numbers of participants: RD 0.01(95% CI -0.12 to 0.15).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DISCUSSION&lt;br&gt;This systematic review examines the effectiveness of influenza vaccination in patients with stable asthma. Despite employing an exhaustive search, few articles were identified that met methodological inclusion criteria. Whilst this review is largely descriptive in nature, the potential for short term adverse effects and long term benefits can be summarised. There are now two large cross-over trials assessing the adverse effects of split virus or surface antigen influenza vaccination on asthma (Castro 2001;Nicholson 1998). The overall result is reassuring that the likelihood of an asthma exacerbation following influenza vaccination is small, and that the absolute difference in risk of exacerbation between active vaccination and placebo lies between a 1% reduction and 4% increase. The excess of early exacerbations in Nicholson 1998 following first time vaccination is unexplained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand the data from the new trial on longer term benefit of influenza vaccination in the prevention of asthma exacerbations caused by exposure to influenza virus in the community is disappointing. van der Wouden 2003 did not find a significant benefit in children in the Netherlands in two seasons of exposure and the absolute benefit of vaccination from this trial lies between a 2% reduction and a 5% increase in exacerbations. Again this confidence interval excludes the pre-determined 6 percentage point difference used by Castro in the power calculation for Castro 2001. Consequently, there is no evidence from controlled clinical trials to support the adoption of universal vaccination in patients with asthma as a clinical policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;METHODOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS&lt;br&gt;1. The trials identified in this review represent a wide diversity of patients, settings and types of influenza vaccine. Initially most of the trials involved small numbers of patients, but the review has now been strenghtened by the addition of two new larger trials of high methodological quality (Castro 2001;van der Wouden 2003).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protective effect of vaccination:&lt;br&gt;There are very limited data from randomised controlled trials available to assess the protective effect of influenza vaccination in asthma. Only two studies of high quality used clinically important outcomes to test for a reduction in asthma exacerbations following influenza vaccination (Stenius 1986;van der Wouden 2003). Significant benefit in terms of reducing asthma exacerbations caused by influenza virus infection has not been demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors conclude that the risk of exacerbation is low in comparison to the possible protective effect of the vaccine. This has not been borne out by the subsequent trial from the Netherlands (van der Wouden 2003). The recent large study on split virus vaccine (Castro 2001) gives reassurance in terms of the safely of this type of influenza vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other high quality studies (Atmar 1989; Redding 2002) which measured individual exacerbations following recombinant vaccine did not show a significant difference between the vaccinated and placebo groups, but the pooled results were underpowered to detect the risk difference of 3% found in the Nicholson study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reviewers' conclusions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Implications for practice&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. The evidence available from randomised controlled trials has not been able to identify a protective effect against asthma exacerbations following influenza infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Overall a significant increase in asthma exacerbations immediately following influenza vaccination has now been excluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BHR 08/10/2003&lt;br&gt;Extramural Funding: CIHR for me inserted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Regards,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brian&lt;br&gt;______________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;Chris:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the references and report of stats should be consistent: ';'&lt;br&gt;separates references, space after ';', RD: 0.01; 95% CI: -0.01 to 0.04.&lt;br&gt;See other comments below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsis:&lt;br&gt;Changed: Newly published studies suggest... to: Newly published research&lt;br&gt;suggests&lt;br&gt;Changed: Few trials have been carried out in way ..to: Few trials have been&lt;br&gt;carried out in a way&lt;br&gt;FINE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract:&lt;br&gt;Changed to: The pooled results of two trials involving 2126 people with&lt;br&gt;asthma did not demonstrate a significant increase in asthma exacerbations&lt;br&gt;in the two weeks following influenza vaccination (Risk Difference 0.01, 95%&lt;br&gt;confidence interval -0.01 to 0.04). A recent study on 696 children with&lt;br&gt;asthma did not demonstrate a significant reduction in influenza related&lt;br&gt;asthma exacerbations (Risk Difference 0.02, 95% confidence interval -0.02&lt;br&gt;to 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion changed to: Evidence from recently published trials indicates&lt;br&gt;that there is no significant increase in asthma exacerbations immediately&lt;br&gt;after vaccination (at least with inactivated influenza vaccination);&lt;br&gt;however, uncertainty remains about the degree of protection vaccination&lt;br&gt;affords against asthma exacerbations that are related to influenza infection.&lt;br&gt;FINE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods:&lt;br&gt;Outcomes:&lt;br&gt;5. Lung function measurements (Peak Expiratory Flow Rate {PEFR}, Forced&lt;br&gt;Expiratory Volume in 1 seond {FEV-1}; both absolute and % predicted), both&lt;br&gt;in the week following immunisation and in the following six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stats:&lt;br&gt;A weighted treatment effect (using random effects) was calculated across&lt;br&gt;trials using the Cochrane statistical package, RevMan version 3.1.&lt;br&gt;changed to: ..... RevMan version 4.2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results:&lt;br&gt;Three further studies were identified for this update and have been&lt;br&gt;included (Castro 2001; Redding 2002; van der Wouden 2003).&lt;br&gt;Five high quality studies contributed to the data for this outcome (Castro&lt;br&gt;2001; Nicholson 1998; Stenius 1986; Reid 1998; van der Wouden 2003).&lt;br&gt;Note: - the spacing of references was off and : was used instead of ;!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edited: The results of the two largest studies have been combined and the&lt;br&gt;pooled results involving 2126 people with asthma failed to demonstrate any&lt;br&gt;significant overall increase in asthma exacerbations in the two weeks&lt;br&gt;following influenza vaccination with a risk difference (RD: 0.01; 95% CI:&lt;br&gt;-0.01 to 0.04). Similarly, the pooled results failed to demonstrate any&lt;br&gt;significant difference in relation to a fall in PEFR of over 30% (RD: 0.00;&lt;br&gt;95% CI: -0.02 to 0.03), increased use of bronchodilators (RD: 0.00; 95% CI:&lt;br&gt;-0.02 to 0.02), medical consultations (RD: 0.00; 95% CI: -0.01 to 0.02),&lt;br&gt;or new or increased oral corticosteroid use (RD: 0.00; 95% CI: -0.01 to 0.01).&lt;br&gt;Note: RD, PEFR and 95% CI do not need to be re-defined here again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edited: The predefined significant difference was an absolute increase of&lt;br&gt;6% (RD: 0.06) and this was outside the confidence interval for this study&lt;br&gt;and for the pooled result. It was also outside the confidence interval of&lt;br&gt;the pooled results for 30% fall in PEFR, increased use of bronchodilators&lt;br&gt;and oral steroids, and unscheduled medical consultations for asthma.&lt;br&gt;Significant increase in any of these outcomes was therefore excluded for&lt;br&gt;inactivated influenza vaccination in this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edited: The heterogeneity between the results of two trials (Castro 2001;&lt;br&gt;Nicholson 1998) is significant when the results are analysed as Peto Odds&lt;br&gt;Ratios or Risk Differences. Further information has been requested from the&lt;br&gt;authors of one trial (Nicholson 1998), particularly in relation to the two&lt;br&gt;vaccines types used in this study. Information has also been sought from&lt;br&gt;the other study authors (Castro 2001) in relation to whether data are&lt;br&gt;available about the previous vaccination status of the participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edited: The pooled results from these two studies failed to demonstrate a&lt;br&gt;significant difference in the risk of a drop in FEV-1 on days 2-4 post&lt;br&gt;vaccination; however, the confidence interval was wide due to small numbers&lt;br&gt;of participants (RD: 0.01; 95% CI: -0.12 to 0.15).Hope that helps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edited: There are now two large cross-over trials assessing the adverse&lt;br&gt;effects of split virus or surface antigen influenza vaccination on asthma&lt;br&gt;(Castro 2001; Nicholson 1998). Overall, it is reassuring that the&lt;br&gt;likelihood of an asthma exacerbation following influenza vaccination is&lt;br&gt;small, and that the absolute difference in risk of exacerbation between&lt;br&gt;active vaccination and placebo lies between a 1% reduction and 4% increase.&lt;br&gt;The excess of early exacerbations in one study (Nicholson 1998) following&lt;br&gt;first time vaccination remains unexplained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edited: On the other hand the data from the new trial on longer term&lt;br&gt;benefit of influenza vaccination in the prevention of asthma exacerbations&lt;br&gt;caused by exposure to influenza virus in the community is disappointing&lt;br&gt;(van der Wouden 2003). The authors failed to demonstrate a significant&lt;br&gt;benefit in children in the Netherlands in two seasons of exposure and the&lt;br&gt;absolute benefit of vaccination from this trial lies between a 2% reduction&lt;br&gt;and a 5% increase in exacerbations. Again this confidence interval excludes&lt;br&gt;the pre-determined 6% difference used by Castro in their power calculation&lt;br&gt;(Castro 2001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical&lt;br&gt;Edited: The other high quality studies (Atmar 1989; Redding 2002) which&lt;br&gt;measured individual exacerbations following recombinant vaccine failed to&lt;br&gt;demonstrate a significant difference between the vaccinated and placebo&lt;br&gt;groups; however, the pooled results were underpowered to detect the risk&lt;br&gt;difference of 3% found in the Nicholson study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Implications&lt;br&gt;2. Overall, influenza vaccination appears safe in patients with asthma; a&lt;br&gt;significant increase in asthma exacerbations immediately following&lt;br&gt;influenza vaccination has now been excluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potential conflict of interest&lt;br&gt;Edited: None. The authors have not represented the producers of these&lt;br&gt;vaccine products. CJC acted in an advisory capacity in the design of one of&lt;br&gt;the studies (van der Wouden 2003).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hope that helps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regards,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brian&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;_______________________________________________&lt;br&gt;CJC revision 17 October 2003&lt;br&gt;Many thanks for turning this around so fast and improving it with your editorial input.&lt;br&gt;Castro has provided data on first time and repeat vaccinees so this has been added to comp1 outcome1.

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>This review was previously updated as follows:</P>
<P>
<I>2008 update</I>: Three large new trials were identified comparing intranasal cold-attenuated live vaccine with intramuscular inactivated vaccine. <LINK REF="STD-Fleming-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fleming 2006</LINK> included 2300 children aged 6 to 17 years and found the impact on asthma to be similar in both groups. One of the studies in younger children (<LINK REF="STD-Belshe-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Belshe 2007</LINK>) showed an increase in wheezing episodes and hospital admissions in the infants given intranasal vaccination. Children under two years of age are not included in this review so further information is being sought from the authors, to see if they can provide data on the older children. Meanwhile it may be wise to avoid intranasal vaccination in infants who are prone to wheezing.<BR/>
<BR/>
<I>2003 update</I>: four new trials were included. The first, <LINK REF="STD-Castro-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Castro 2001</LINK>, was a large cross-over trial (2032 asthmatic children and adults) that did not find an increase in adverse asthmatic events following inactivated influenza vaccine in the two weeks after vaccination. The second, <LINK REF="STD-Redding-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Redding 2002</LINK>, assessed the safety and tolerability of intra-nasal vaccination in 48 children and adolescents with asthma (parallel-designed trial) and found that it was safe and well-tolerated. The third, <LINK REF="STD-Bueving-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bueving 2003</LINK>, carried out a longer-term parallel-design trial in 696 children with inactivated influenza vaccine, but did not find a significant difference in influenza related asthma exacerbations compared to placebo over the following five months. The fourth, <LINK REF="STD-Sener-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sener 1999</LINK>, was a small cross-over study on 24 volunteers with mild asthma that did not find deterioration in symptoms or lung function after influenza vaccination.<BR/>
<BR/>
<I>1999 update</I>: this review was updated to include the results of one new study (<LINK REF="STD-Reid-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Reid 1998</LINK>). The results and implications for practice and research were not been altered.<BR/>

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-12-19 11:37:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Asthma is a condition that affects the airways &#8211; the small tubes that carry air in and out of the lungs - and the symptoms are generally coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath and chest tightness. The symptoms can be occasional or persistent. When a person with asthma breathes in an asthma trigger (something that irritates their airways), the muscles around the walls of the airways tighten so that the airways become narrower and the lining of the airways becomes inflamed and starts to swell. For many people with asthma, cold and flu viruses trigger their symptoms. Therefore, getting a flu virus makes their asthma worse and having a flu jab (influenza vaccine) may protect people against some of the flu viruses that they will come into contact with in a given winter. However, the effects of a flu jab (vaccination) are not straightforward as there is also the possibility that the flu jab itself could cause a worsening of asthma. Current guidelines in the UK recommend that high-risk groups such as people with severe asthma should have a flu jab each winter (<A HREF="http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Flu-jab/Pages/Whyitshouldbedone.aspx">NHS Choices</A>); however, there is limited evidence for this approach.</P>
<P>In this review, we evaluated evidence from randomised trials (RCTs) in relation to potential benefits and harms of all types of influenza vaccination in adults and children (over the age of two years) with asthma.</P>
<P>One trial in 696 children assessed the benefits of injecting inactivated influenza vaccine (inactivated virus vaccines are the type currently used in the US and UK and cannot cause flu). There were no significant differences in the number of people experiencing an asthma attack (worsening of symptoms); however, there were better symptom scores (people reporting fewer asthma symptoms) in weeks in which children had a positive test for influenza, in those who had received the jab compared to those who did not.</P>
<P>Two trials involved 1526 adults and 712 children who were given inactivated influenza vaccination, examined the harmful effects caused immediately after injection. These studies ruled out the likelihood of any more than four out of 100 people having a resultant asthma attack in the first two weeks after getting their flu jab. There was not enough information to compare different vaccination types.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-12-19 11:36:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>Influenza vaccination is recommended for asthmatic patients in many countries as observational studies have shown that influenza infection can be associated with asthma exacerbations. However, influenza vaccination has the potential to cause wheezing and adversely affect pulmonary function. While an overview concluded that there was no clear benefit of influenza vaccination in patients with asthma, this conclusion was not based on a systematic search of the literature.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2012-11-28 22:50:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>The objective of this review was to assess the efficacy and safety of influenza vaccination in children and adults with asthma.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-12-03 10:00:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Airways Group trials register and reviewed reference lists of articles. The latest search was carried out in November 2012.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2011-10-11 11:15:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>We included randomised trials of influenza vaccination in children (over two years of age) and adults with asthma. We excluded studies involving people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-12-19 11:36:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Inclusion criteria and assessment of trial quality were applied by two review authors independently. Data extraction was done by two review authors independently. Study authors were contacted for missing information.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-12-19 11:37:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Nine trials were included in the first published version of this review, and nine further trials have been included in four updates. The included studies cover a wide diversity of people, settings and types of influenza vaccination, and we pooled data from the studies that employed similar vaccines.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>Protective effects of inactivated influenza vaccine during the influenza season</B>
</P>
<P>A single parallel-group trial, involving 696 children, was able to assess the protective effects of influenza vaccination. There was no significant reduction in the number, duration or severity of influenza-related asthma exacerbations. There was no difference in the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<SUB>1</SUB>) although children who had been vaccinated had better symptom scores during influenza-positive weeks. Two parallel-group trials in adults did not contribute data to these outcomes due to very low levels of confirmed influenza infection.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>Adverse effects of inactivated influenza vaccine in the first two weeks following vaccination</B>
</P>
<P>Two cross-over trials involving 1526 adults and 712 children (over three years old) with asthma compared inactivated trivalent split-virus influenza vaccine with a placebo injection. These trials excluded any clinically important increase in asthma exacerbations in the two weeks following influenza vaccination (risk difference 0.014; 95% confidence interval -0.010 to 0.037). However, there was significant heterogeneity between the findings of two trials involving 1104 adults in terms of asthma exacerbations in the first three days after vaccination with split-virus or surface-antigen inactivated vaccines. There was no significant difference in measures of healthcare utilisation, days off school/symptom-free days, mean lung function or medication usage.</P>
<P>
<B>Effects of live attenuated (intranasal) influenza vaccination</B>
</P>
<P>There were no significant differences found in exacerbations or measures of lung function following live attenuated cold recombinant vaccine versus placebo in two small studies on 17 adults and 48 children. There were no significant differences in asthma exacerbations found for the comparison live attenuated vaccine (intranasal) versus trivalent inactivated vaccine (intramuscular) in one study on 2229 children (over six years of age).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-12-03 10:00:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>Uncertainty remains about the degree of protection that vaccination affords against asthma exacerbations that are related to influenza infection. Evidence from more recently published randomised trials of inactivated split-virus influenza vaccination indicates that there is no significant increase in asthma exacerbations immediately after vaccination in adults or children over three years of age. We were unable to address concerns regarding possible increased wheezing and hospital admissions in infants given live intranasal vaccination.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-12-19 11:37:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>The primary goal of influenza vaccination policy has been the reduction of excess deaths associated with influenza epidemics (<LINK REF="REF-Barker-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barker 1982</LINK>). Mortality statistics suggest that influenza may be associated with 3000 excess deaths per year in the UK alone and in epidemic years this may increase to as many as 18,000 (<LINK REF="REF-Ashley-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ashley 1991</LINK>). A large observational study in the US compared expected with observed mortality during seven influenza epidemics between 1957 and 1966 with similar results (<LINK REF="REF-Housworth-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Housworth 1974</LINK>). These results have consistently demonstrated the majority of excess mortality during influenza outbreaks occurs in the elderly population. The major limitations of these studies involve a lack of a direct causal link between mortality and influenza infection and the biases inherent in their retrospective research methods (<LINK REF="REF-Patriarca-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patriarca 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>While there is still little evidence that influenza vaccination has an impact upon mortality, a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of patients aged over 65 years without known risk factors has demonstrated a 50% reduction in serologically confirmed influenza infection (<LINK REF="REF-Govaert-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Govaert 1994</LINK>). One review advocated immunisation of all patients aged over 65 years, irrespective of risk factor status (<LINK REF="REF-NHS-CRD-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHS CRD 1996</LINK>), despite the lack of supporting evidence for this approach. However, the current policy in the UK and many other countries is to concentrate on those who are deemed to be at higher risk including those with severe asthma (<LINK REF="REF-NHS-Choices-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHS Choices 2011</LINK>). Recommendations for asthmatics are not supported by evidence from RCTs, and provide no indication of which subgroups of patients with asthma, if any, should receive immunisation.</P>
<P>Observational studies have shown that exacerbations of asthma in children are often associated with viral infections; however, there is disagreement between studies on the relative importance of influenza compared to other viruses in this respect (<LINK REF="REF-McIntosh-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">McIntosh 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roldaan-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roldaan 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnston-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnston 1995</LINK>). To counter the argument that immunisation might benefit patients, the potential exists for influenza vaccination to precipitate an exacerbation in some asthmatics. This is one reason why some physicians remain reluctant to recommend the vaccine for people with asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Rothbarth-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rothbarth 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>While the beneficial effect of influenza vaccine in people with asthma may be limited and there exists some concern about potential harm, other research suggests that some asthmatics who acquire influenza infections demonstrate reductions in pulmonary function (<LINK REF="REF-Kondo-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kondo 1991</LINK>). Therefore, immunisation has the potential to protect asthmatic patients from deterioration in lung function.</P>
<P>One previously published overview addressed the issue of influenza vaccination in patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (<LINK REF="REF-Rothbarth-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rothbarth 1995</LINK>). This review concluded that there was no clear benefit of influenza vaccination in patients with asthma and COPD. One review (<LINK REF="REF-Nicholson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicholson 2003</LINK>) concluded that influenza vaccination is safe in asthma. However, these results were not based on a systematic search of the published and unpublished literature. Moreover, other methodological issues limit the validity of their conclusions.</P>
<P>This systematic review aims to systematically search for, and combine all evidence from, RCTs relating to the effects of influenza vaccination in asthmatic patients in order to generate the best available evidence on which to base recommendations for clinical practice and further research.</P>

<P>The original database search identified 36 abstracts for screening and 26 were selected for possible inclusion in the review. Two further papers were identified from references in other papers (<LINK REF="STD-Govaert-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Govaert 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Govaert-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Govaert 1994</LINK>). The full text of each paper was obtained and translated when necessary (three from German). Papers were excluded for the following reasons: retrospective studies (five studies); not randomised (five studies); COPD (two studies) and no separate asthma data (five studies). Nine studies were included in this review with complete agreement between the two review authors. Two further studies had been identified for the first update of this review; one was excluded as it was not randomised (<LINK REF="STD-Ahmed-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ahmed 1997</LINK>) and one new study was included (<LINK REF="STD-Reid-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Reid 1998</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Inactivated influenza vaccine (intramuscular injection) versus placebo</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Protective effects of vaccination measured during the influenza season</HEADING>
<P>There was a single study, at low risk of bias, on 696 children reporting on the late benefits of inactivated vaccine compared with placebo that contributed data to the review (<LINK REF="STD-Bueving-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bueving 2003</LINK>). This study was conducted in the Netherlands over two influenza seasons and, in the 37 children who suffered asthma exacerbations related to positive throat swab identification of influenza virus, 20 were in the vaccinated group and 17 in the placebo group. This represented no change (RD 0.0089; 95% CI -0.024 to 0.042) with a narrow CI excluding a 6% absolute difference in exacerbations in the longer term following vaccination (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). It should be noted that a small proportion of exacerbations were related to confirmed influenza infection and when all exacerbations were considered the proportion of children in each group suffering an exacerbation was 85.5% in the vaccinated group and 90.1% in the placebo group; this represented an RD of -0.044 (95% CI -0.092 to 0.0048). The adjusted OR reported in the paper did not identify a significant difference between the groups (P = 0.10). The duration and severity of exacerbations were also not significantly different between the two groups.</P>
<P>There was no significant difference in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> (% predicted) during influenza positive weeks in 41 children (MD 9%; 95% CI -3.86% to 21.86%). In 40 children who tested positive for influenza and had asthma quality of life measurements, there was a statistically significant difference in the change in total scores in influenza-positive weeks (MD 0.6; 95% CI 0.08 to 1.12). The total scores did not reach significance in "all illness" weeks. The number of patients with a change in quality of life score of at least 0.5 units (the minimally clinically important difference) was 10 (48%) in the vaccine group and 13 (68%) in the placebo group; however, this change only reached significance in the symptoms and activities domains and not in the total score. Nevertheless, these results do suggest a potential for influenza vaccination to be of benefit in increased asthma quality of life scores associated with test-positive influenza in children.</P>
<P>Data from two studies could not be pooled. These studies were also designed to examine the late outcomes of influenza vaccination (<LINK REF="STD-Stenius-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Stenius 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Govaert-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Govaert 1992</LINK>). In a study involving 328 adults, the incidence of influenza was low in Finland during the study and only one confirmed influenza infection was detected (<LINK REF="STD-Stenius-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Stenius 1986</LINK>). No differences were found between the vaccinated and control groups in daily PEF measurements, symptom scores, daily medication use, and courses of oral corticosteroids or hospitalisation in the eight months following vaccination. In one other study for which data were available from the author for asthmatic patients (<LINK REF="STD-Govaert-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Govaert 1992</LINK>), none of the 25 asthmatic patients had serologically confirmed influenza.</P>

<P>Two cross-over trials (<LINK REF="STD-Castro-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Castro 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kmiecik-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kmiecik 2007</LINK>) involving 1526 adults and 712 children (over three years old) with asthma compared inactivated trivalent split-virus influenza vaccine with a placebo injection. The pooled data excluded any clinically important overall increase in asthma exacerbations in the two weeks following influenza vaccination (RD 0.01; 95% CI -0.01 to 0.04; <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). The results in adults (RD 0.02; 95% CI -0.01 to 0.05) and children (RD 0.01; 95% CI -0.04 to 0.05) both excluded the pre-specified increase in risk of six percentage points (<LINK REF="STD-Castro-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Castro 2001</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Castro-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Castro 2001</LINK> was judged to be at low risk of bias, and exclusion of the results from <LINK REF="STD-Kmiecik-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kmiecik 2007</LINK> (which was at unclear risk of bias and reported only descriptive statistics), made very little difference to the findings.</P>
<P>There was unexplained heterogeneity between the results of <LINK REF="STD-Castro-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Castro 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Nicholson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Nicholson 1998</LINK> in terms of the risk of asthma exacerbation in the first three days after influenza vaccination (RD 0.01; 95% CI -0.03 to 0.05, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 83%, <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). The increased risk of exacerbation found in <LINK REF="STD-Nicholson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Nicholson 1998</LINK> was greatest in first-time vaccinees (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>), and no separate data were reported for the two different vaccines used in this study (split-virus and surface vaccine). The heterogeneity between the results of <LINK REF="STD-Castro-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Castro 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Nicholson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Nicholson 1998</LINK> is significant (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 83%). While further information has been requested from the authors of <LINK REF="STD-Nicholson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Nicholson 1998</LINK>, particularly in relation to the two vaccines types used in this study, this information has not been provided. Information has been obtained from the other authors (<LINK REF="STD-Castro-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Castro 2001</LINK>) in relation to whether data are available about the previous vaccination status of the participants, indicating that first time vaccinees are not at increased risk of exacerbation in this study.</P>
<P>There were no significant differences found in hospital admissions from one study on 510 adults (<LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>) or symptom-free days or days off work or school from one study involving 1952 adults and children (<LINK REF="CMP-002.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.5</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.6</LINK>). Medical consultation following vaccination was not increased in three studies involving 2894 adults and children (RD 0.00; 95% CI -0.01 to 0.01). Similarly, no significant differences were found in lung function or use of rescue medication (<LINK REF="CMP-002.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.8</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.9</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.10</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.11</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.12</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Individual study results</HEADING>
<P>In the earlier study on 262 patients (<LINK REF="STD-Nicholson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Nicholson 1998</LINK>), there was a significant increase in the number of patients who suffered an exacerbation of asthma after inactivated split-virus or surface antigen vaccine administration. This was defined as a fall in PEF of over 20%, in the first three days after injection (RD 0.031; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.058). Similarly, the number of patients with a fall of over 30% in their PEF in the first three days after active vaccination was significantly higher than after placebo (RD 0.031; 95% CI 0.007 to 0.054). In a subgroup analysis, excluding patients with 'common colds' from the analysis reduced the difference to statistically non-significant, and subgroup analysis performed by the authors suggested that the majority of the exacerbations were observed in patients receiving vaccine for the first time. No other significant differences were found in the mean PEF, bronchodilator usage (via nebuliser or metered dose inhaler), hospital admission, medical consultations, oral corticosteroid usage or asthma symptoms. No significant difference was reported between the results for patients given split-virus or subunit vaccines, but the authors have not been able to provide separate data for the two groups.</P>
<P>The subsequent large high-quality study (<LINK REF="STD-Castro-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Castro 2001</LINK>) involving 2032 adults and children given inactivated influenza vaccination ruled out a significant increase in asthma exacerbations both for three days and for 14 days following vaccination. The pre-defined significant difference was an absolute increase of 6% (RD 0.06) and this was outside the CI for this study and for the pooled result. It was also outside the CI of the pooled results for 30% fall in PEF, increased use of bronchodilators and oral corticosteroids, and unscheduled medical consultations for asthma. Significant increases in any of these outcomes were therefore excluded for inactivated influenza vaccination in this study.</P>
<P>In another study at low risk of bias, 318 patients were administered inactivated vaccine or placebo immunisation (<LINK REF="STD-Stenius-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Stenius 1986</LINK>). No difference was found in the mean morning or evening PEF for the seven days after vaccination. No individual data on patients with a fall in PEF of over 20% were collected.</P>
<P>One study identified for the first update of this review (<LINK REF="STD-Reid-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Reid 1998</LINK>) compared mean FEV<SUB>1</SUB> and airway responsiveness (PD20 methacholine) at 48 and 96 hours following injection of inactivated surface antigen in 17 adult asthmatic patients compared with five patients who were given placebo. No significant differences were found in the mean levels in either group and no patient had a change in PD20 of more than two-fold.</P>
<P>One small cross-over study in 24 volunteers with mild asthma (<LINK REF="STD-Sener-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sener 1999</LINK>) found no increase in asthma symptoms or deterioration in lung function in the two weeks following vaccination with split antigen trivalent vaccine.</P>
<P>One early study, regarded by its authors as being preliminary (<LINK REF="STD-Bell-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Bell 1978</LINK>), identified a significant fall (-12% from baseline, standard error (SE) 6%) in morning PEF at 48 hours after immunisation of children in a residential asthma care centre with inactivated influenza vaccine compared to a control group that received no vaccination. This was accompanied by a rise in nebuliser usage at 48 hours, but no change was observed in the afternoon PEF. The original data are no longer available (Bell, personal communication), and the published results cannot be used for meta-analysis as control and treatment group data were not presented separately. Moreover, this was an open study with no placebo, randomisation by the patients' chart number and no checks for period effects were reported.</P>
<P>There were two other small studies in this group. No significant deterioration in home PEF measurement was reported by Hahn using split virus vaccine, subunit vaccine or placebo groups in the two weeks following vaccination, but no numerical data were provided (<LINK REF="STD-Hahn-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Hahn 1980</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Govaert-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Govaert 1992</LINK> also reported no adverse symptoms from any of the 14 asthmatic patients immunised with split virus vaccine or the 11 asthmatic patients given placebo (data provided by author in response to a request for further information).</P>
<P>The data from <LINK REF="STD-Kmiecik-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kmiecik 2007</LINK> were only reported using descriptive statistics, so we were incorporated the trial using a conservative approach (as if it were a parallel trial). Nine out of 286 adults experienced a severe asthma exacerbation in the 14 days after influenza vaccine compared to four out of 286 on placebo; this is reported as a difference of 1.7% ("descriptive statistics" in the paper reports 95% CI 1% to 2.7%, with no details of the derivation of this interval).</P>

There was no significant difference between groups in the primary outcome of the study (percentage change in % predicted FEV<SUB>1</SUB>).

This study also reported that none of the vaccine recipients reported an increase in bronchodilator therapy following vaccination, but no numerical data were provided. The pooled results from these two studies did not demonstrate a significant difference in the risk of a drop in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> on days two to four after vaccination; however, the CI was wide due to small numbers of participants (RD 0.01; 95% CI -0.12 to 0.15).</P>

<P>One single study, which was at risk of performance and detection bias, on 2229 children over six years of age contributed data to the review (<LINK REF="STD-Fleming-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fleming 2006</LINK>). Since there was no placebo arm in <LINK REF="STD-Fleming-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fleming 2006</LINK> the absolute benefit of CIAV could not be assessed.

Out of 2229 participants, there were two hospitalisations for respiratory illness with TIV or CIAV; this was not a significant difference (OR 0.2; 95% CI 0.01 to 4.17) (<LINK REF="CMP-004.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.2</LINK>). There was a marginally significant difference between groups for days off school (RR 1.09; 95% CI 1.0 to 1.2) (<LINK REF="CMP-004.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.3</LINK>); however, significant differences for unscheduled healthcare visits or children with serious adverse events were not identified (1.8% with CIAV and 1.7% with TIV) (<LINK REF="CMP-004.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.4</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-12-19 11:41:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>This systematic review examines the best available evidence regarding the effectiveness of influenza vaccination in patients with stable asthma. Despite employing an exhaustive search, few articles were identified that met the inclusion criteria. While this review is largely descriptive in nature, the potential for short-term adverse effects and long-term benefits can be summarised. There are now three cross-over trials assessing the adverse effects of inactivated influenza vaccination on asthma (<LINK REF="STD-Nicholson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Nicholson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Castro-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Castro 2001</LINK> at low risk of bias, and <LINK REF="STD-Kmiecik-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kmiecik 2007</LINK> at unclear risk of bias). Overall, it is reassuring that the likelihood of an asthma exacerbation following influenza vaccination in adults and children (over the age of three years) is small, and that the absolute difference in risk of exacerbation between active vaccination and placebo lies between a 4% reduction and 5% increase, respectively. The excess of early exacerbations in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Nicholson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Nicholson 1998</LINK>) following first-time vaccination remains unexplained.</P>
<P>In contrast, the data from the trial on longer-term benefit of influenza vaccination in the prevention of asthma exacerbations caused by exposure to influenza virus in the community have shown few significant benefits (<LINK REF="STD-Bueving-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bueving 2003</LINK>). The authors failed to demonstrate a significant benefit in children in the Netherlands in two seasons of exposure and the absolute benefit of vaccination from this trial lies between a 3% reduction and a 4% increase in exacerbations related to confirmed influenza infection. Again the CI excludes the pre-determined 6% difference used by Castro in their power calculation (<LINK REF="STD-Castro-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Castro 2001</LINK>). The point estimate for the difference in all exacerbations was a 4% reduction in risk, but the CI included an increase of 0.05% and a decrease of 9% in risk difference. Consequently, there is no firm evidence from controlled clinical trials to support the adoption of universal vaccination in patients with asthma as a clinical policy. More information has been published on asthma symptoms during influenza positive illness weeks in <LINK REF="STD-Bueving-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bueving 2003</LINK>, indicating that the asthma quality of life scores in such weeks may be improved by influenza vaccination (in 40 of the 696 children who had confirmed influenza infection).<BR/>Several new large studies have been identified comparing intranasal vaccine to intramuscular injection in children aged six to 17 years (<LINK REF="STD-Fleming-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fleming 2006</LINK>), and in infants from six to 72 months (<LINK REF="STD-Ashkenazi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ashkenazi 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Belshe-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Belshe 2007</LINK>). Although there was no indication of an increase in adverse respiratory outcomes in the older children, one of the studies on infants (<LINK REF="STD-Belshe-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Belshe 2007</LINK>) has raised concerns over increased wheezing and hospital admissions following intranasal vaccination in the younger age group. A subsequent epidemiological survey (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2012</LINK>), from two of the cohorts in <LINK REF="STD-Belshe-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Belshe 2007</LINK> found that family history of asthma was a risk factor for wheezing after influenza vaccination in this study.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Methodological limitations</HEADING>
<P>1. The trials identified in this review represent a wide diversity of patients, settings and types of influenza vaccine. Initially most of the trials involved small numbers of patients; however, the review has now been strengthened by the addition of two new larger placebo-controlled trials of high methodological quality (<LINK REF="STD-Castro-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Castro 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bueving-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bueving 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>2. Influenza vaccination is administered at a time of year when upper respiratory viral infections are common; these can cause symptoms and asthma exacerbation that may occur soon after vaccination. The importance of a valid placebo control is demonstrated in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Atmar-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Atmar 1989</LINK>) in which four of the six patients from the placebo group had an illness in the week following the vaccination. One patient from the placebo group was also admitted to hospital with an asthma exacerbation. This problem was addressed by other authors who re-analysed their data after excluding patients with symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection in order to minimise the risk of including patients with exacerbations due to viral illness (<LINK REF="STD-Nicholson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Nicholson 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>3. Many studies did not report numerical outcomes for use of bronchodilator therapy and worsening of asthma symptoms. These data are therefore included in tables of results in the other data tables. Reports of "no significant difference" may hide small effects that become important when pooled; however, such comments are not useful without the data from which they are derived. Our attempts to contact the authors met with limited success, as most did not reply to a letter and a fax requesting further details.</P>
<P>4. The use of mean values for lung function data and asthma symptoms is of limited value as individual changes in important specific outcomes (i.e. asthma exacerbations or pulmonary function) may be missed.</P>
<P>5. The proportion of asthmatic patients who might contract influenza in a non-pandemic winter may be small, and similarly the proportion suffering an adverse event from the vaccine may also be low. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Stenius-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Stenius 1986</LINK>) identified only one serologically confirmed case of influenza among 157 asthmatics who were given a placebo vaccination. In another (<LINK REF="REF-Govaert-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Govaert 1994</LINK>), none of the 11 asthmatic patients given placebo developed serologically confirmed influenza, and in the total 911 elderly patients given placebo only 9% went on to develop serologically confirmed infection. Of those patients who develop influenza, not all would be expected to develop asthma exacerbations.<BR/>6. Many other respiratory viruses can cause symptoms and asthma exacerbations. One observational study (<LINK REF="REF-Nicholson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicholson 1993</LINK>) found that in 27 adults with viral infections leading to a fall of over 50 L/min in PEF, only one was due to confirmed influenza virus (compared to 16 in which human rhinovirus was confirmed). Similarly, in children aged nine to 11 years old, common cold viruses were identified in 80% of reported asthma exacerbations; influenza viruses were detected seven times less commonly in exacerbations (<LINK REF="REF-Johnston-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnston 1995</LINK>). It is therefore important that any exacerbations following an influenza-like illness are only regarded as being due to influenza if confirmed by a rise in antibody titre or virus detection, such as carried out in <LINK REF="STD-Bueving-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bueving 2003</LINK>.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Clinical practice</HEADING>
<P>The potential impact of influenza vaccine will depend upon the frequency with which this virus causes acute exacerbations and infections in asthmatic individuals. This may also vary between epidemic/pandemic and non-epidemic/non-pandemic years. Such data are not available. Interpretation of the protective effects of influenza vaccines has to be viewed within this background.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Protective effect of vaccination</HEADING>
<P>There are very limited data available from randomised trials to assess the protective effect of influenza vaccination in asthma. Only two studies of high quality used clinically important outcomes to test for a reduction in asthma exacerbations following influenza vaccination (<LINK REF="STD-Stenius-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Stenius 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bueving-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bueving 2003</LINK>). Significant benefit in terms of reducing asthma exacerbations caused by influenza virus infection has not been demonstrated, although there is now a suggestion of a benefit in asthma quality of life scores in relation to episodes of proven influenza infection in a small number of children.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison of vaccine types</HEADING>
<P>Randomised comparisons of different vaccination types have been carried out in three studies looking for short-term adverse effects (<LINK REF="STD-Hahn-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Hahn 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ortwein-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Ortwein 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nicholson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Nicholson 1998</LINK>); however, reporting of the outcomes was restricted to "no significant differences" found between groups.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Asthma exacerbation following vaccination</HEADING>
<P>A higher incidence of asthma exacerbations following inactivated influenza vaccination was found in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Nicholson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Nicholson 1998</LINK>), with a risk difference of 3.1% (95% CI 0.3 to 5.8) compared to placebo. This study was methodologically strong and was designed to identify patients in which common colds might explain the exacerbation. When patients with upper respiratory tract infections were excluded, the difference was no longer significant. It is not possible to say whether the risk difference was less, as the total number of patients excluded from each group due to colds was not reported. The authors concluded that the risk of exacerbation was low in comparison to the possible protective effect of the vaccine. This has not been borne out by the subsequent trial from the Netherlands (<LINK REF="STD-Bueving-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bueving 2003</LINK>). The large study on split virus vaccine (<LINK REF="STD-Castro-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Castro 2001</LINK>) gives reassurance in terms of the safely of this type of influenza vaccination. More recently three large studies in children (<LINK REF="STD-Ashkenazi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ashkenazi 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fleming-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fleming 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Belshe-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Belshe 2007</LINK>) have compared intranasal vaccine with intramuscular injection in infants and older children. It appears that in children aged six to 17 years of age, intranasal and intramuscular vaccines have similar profiles for asthma exacerbations and wheeze of sufficient severity to be considered an adverse event. Two further studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ashkenazi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ashkenazi 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Belshe-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Belshe 2007</LINK>) were found comparing intranasal vaccine with intramuscular vaccine in children from six to 71 months of age; some of these children had a clinical diagnosis of asthma and further information has been sought from the authors on this subgroup of children. At present these studies have not been included in this review. However, concern was raised in the <LINK REF="STD-Belshe-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Belshe 2007</LINK> study as the new intranasal vaccine was associated with an increase in hospital admissions of any cause in children from six to 11 months (6.1% versus 2.6% over 180 days; rate difference 3.5%; 95% CI 1.4 to 5.8), and more episodes of medically significant wheezing in the first 42 days following the vaccine (2.3% versus 1.5%; rate difference 0.77%; 95% CI 0.12 to 1.46).</P>
<P>Two other studies (<LINK REF="STD-Atmar-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Atmar 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Redding-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Redding 2002</LINK>) that measured individual exacerbations following recombinant vaccine demonstrated no significant difference between the vaccinated and placebo groups; however, the pooled results were underpowered to detect the risk difference of 3% found in the Nicholson study.</P>

<LI>The evidence available from RCTs identified no significant reduction in the frequency of asthma exacerbations following influenza infection; however, one study has now demonstrated improved asthma quality of life scores in a small number of children with confirmed influenza infection.</LI>
<LI>Overall, influenza vaccination appears safe in adults and older children with asthma; a significant increase in asthma exacerbations immediately following split-virus influenza vaccination has now been excluded. No significant difference has been identified between vaccine types in these age groups. However, there are insufficient trials and the number of patients upon which these comparisons are based is small.</LI>

<OL>
<LI>Further large randomised trials are needed to determine whether there is a protective effect of influenza vaccination in ambulatory adults and children with stable asthma. The trial should have sufficient power to detect infrequent exacerbations (such as the 6% risk difference used by <LINK REF="STD-Castro-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Castro 2001</LINK>) due to the immunisation or influenza infection and changes in asthma quality of life in relation to proven influenza infection.</LI>
<LI>The infrequent nature of influenza illness among patients with asthma implies that studies with adequate sample size and sufficiently long follow-up are required to add clarity to this important clinical question. Ideally more than one influenza season should also be studied, in view of the variation in vaccination and influenza infection serotypes from year to year.</LI>
<LI>Future trials should include an analysis of exacerbation rate using recognised methods and definitions for detecting asthma exacerbations and verification of influenza exposure. Other important asthma-related outcomes should also be reported, such as hospital admission, rescue courses of oral corticosteroids and unscheduled attendance in primary care or emergency departments.</LI>

<ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS MODIFIED="2012-12-19 11:41:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>The NHS Executive (North Thames) provided funding for Dr Cates to prepare the original version of this review. We would especially like to thank Tom Jefferson for co-authoring the original review and initial updates, but who stepped down from the review byline in 2012. In addition we would like to acknowledge the assistance provided by the CARG staff (Steve Milan, Jane Dennis, Toby Lasserson and Karen Blackhall) in identifying the trials from the register and obtaining copies of the papers. We would also like to thank Klaus Linde for help with translation of the German papers and assessment of their methodological quality, and Jo Picot for assisting with trial selection and data extraction for the 2003 update. We would like to thank the following authors for responding to correspondence and supplying additional data for the review: Dr Robert Atmar, Dr Mario Castro, Dr Phile Govaert, Dr Brita Stenius-Aarnalia, Dr Tom Bell, Jonathan Nguyen-Van-Tam, Dr Stephen Bourke, Jing-Long Huang and Hans van der Wouden. We would like to thank Anna Bara for her contribution to the original review and Toby Lasserson for help with assessment of papers to include in the 2007 update. We would also like to thanks Joannie Shen (JS), Charlotta Karner (CK) and Elora Baishnab (EB) for their contributions to the 2012 update.</P>

<P>Christopher Cates (CJC) had the idea of carrying out the original review and wrote the protocol in conjunction with Tom Jefferson (TOJ) and Brian Rowe (BR). Studies for inclusion were assessed by CJC and TOJ and quality scoring was also carried out by the same review authors. In the first update of the review CJC and Anna Bara assessed the new studies for inclusion and quality, and for the 2007 update CJC and Toby Lasserson assessed the new studies. CJC wrote and revised the review with assistance and advice from TOJ and BR. The 2012 update was carried out by CJC with assistance for Joannie Shen and Charlotta Karner in selecting the new studies and Elora Baishnab in assessing the risk of bias of the new studies and extracting outcome data. BH revised text and CJC is the guarantor of the review.</P>

<P>The 2011 updated review includes a 'Risk of bias' table, in which the assessment of risk of bias for blinding of participants and personnel was not judged to be low risk unless there was a clear indication that the placebo injection was similar in appearance to the active injection. Jadad scores (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>) were used in the early versions of this review and have been preserved in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>. The generic inverse variance method has been used for meta-analysis using paired data from cross-over trials in the 2012 update.</P>

<P>Primary outcome of the study: culture-confirmed influenza caused by a subtype that was antigenically similar to the vaccine. The primary safety end point was the incidence of asthma exacerbation, defined as acute wheezing illness associated with hospitalisation, any unscheduled clinical visit or any new prescription (including rescue medication)<BR/>Secondary outcomes: influenza due to any subtype, prescribed medication, unscheduled healthcare visits, hospitalisations, days missed from work or school. Secondary safety end points were (1) recurrent episodes during the surveillance period of acute wheezing illness associated with hospitalisation, unscheduled clinical visit, or increased or new asthma medication use (medically required increase in daily dosage of currently prescribed asthma medication or newly prescribed asthma medication); (2) the first asthma exacerbation episode within 42 days; (3) peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) scores; (4) night-time awakenings (or sleep scores) and (5) asthma symptom scores. Daily monitoring was carried out by parents or guardians for the first 15 days post vaccination; this included daily PEF and asthma symptom scores and medication. Adverse events were also recorded (e.g. symptoms requiring medication or an unscheduled visit to a healthcare provider), as were pre-defined reactogenicity events that could be related to vaccination (such as runny nose and wheeze)<BR/>Time of measurements: early (first 15 days), medium (first 42 days) and late (from 15 days up to May the following year)<BR/>Reliability of measurements: unreported<BR/>Source of extracted data: paper publication<BR/>
