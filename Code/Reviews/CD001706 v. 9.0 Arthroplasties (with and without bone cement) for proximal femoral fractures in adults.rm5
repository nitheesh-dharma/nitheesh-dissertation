<TITLE>Comparison of different types of artificial hip joints that may be used for treating fractures of the hip</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-05-05 15:09:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>Many different types of artificial hip joints (arthroplasties) may be used to treat hip fractures, which are breaks (fractures) in the thigh bone (femur) near the hip joint. Differences in these artificial joints include different shapes of the stem set into the bone; the incorporation of a secondary joint (bipolar joint); joints that replace only the ball part of the ball and socket hip joint (hemiarthroplasty) and those that also involve replacing the socket part of the hip joint (total hip replacement). In addition an arthroplasty may be of the press fit type or secured in place within the bone using a filler (bone cement).</P>
<P>Twenty-three trials involving 2861 older and mainly female patients with hip fractures are included in this review. The findings from the three main comparisons are summarised here. Six studies involving 899 participants compared a press fit arthroplasty with one that was secured in place with bone cement. Those joints that were cemented in place resulted in less pain and better mobility than those that were of the press fit type. Seven trials involving 857 participants compared those implants which have a second joint built into them (bipolar hemiarthroplasties) with those without this additional joint (unipolar hemiarthroplasties). No notable differences between these two types of implant were demonstrated. Seven studies of 734 participants compared different types of hemiarthroplasty with a total hip replacement. Most implants had been cemented in place. There was a trend to better functional outcomes after total hip replacement, but firm conclusions could not be made because of the lack of patient numbers.</P>
<P>There is good evidence that people with arthroplasties that are cemented in place have less pain and better mobility after the operation than those, which are inserted as a press fit. There is limited evidence that a total hip replacement leads to better functional outcome than a hemiarthroplasty.</P>

<P>Numerous types of arthroplasties may be used in the surgical treatment of a hip fracture (proximal femoral fracture). The main differences between the implants are in the design of the stems, whether the stem is cemented or uncemented, whether a second articulating joint is included within the prosthesis (bipolar prosthesis), or whether a partial (hemiarthroplasty) or total whole hip replacement is used.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-05-05 15:09:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>Twenty-three trials involving 2861 older and mainly female patients with proximal femoral fractures are included. Cemented prostheses, when compared with uncemented prostheses (6 trials, 899 participants) were associated with a less pain at a year or later and improved mobility. No significant difference in surgical complications was found. One trial of 220 participants compared a hydroxyapatite coated hemiarthroplasty with a cemented prosthesis and reported no notable differences between the two prosthesis. Comparison of unipolar hemiarthroplasty with bipolar hemiarthroplasty (7 trials, 857 participants, 863 fractures) showed no significant differences between the two types of implant. Seven trials involving 734 participants compared hemiarthroplasty with a total hip replacement (THR). Most studies involved cemented implants. Dislocation of the prosthesis was more common with the THR but there was a general trend within these studies to better functional outcome scores for those treated with the THR.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-10-19 19:23:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is good evidence that cementing the prostheses in place will reduce post-operative pain and lead to better mobility. From the trials to date there is no evidence of any difference in outcome between bipolar and unipolar prosthesis. There is some evidence that a total hip replacement leads to better functional outcome than a hemiarthroplasty. Further well-conducted randomised trials are required.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-11-30 16:42:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>Arthroplasty of the hip refers to replacement of all or part of the hip joint with a prosthetic implant. Numerous different types of arthroplasty exist for the hip. Those that involve replacement of the femoral head can be divided into two groups: hemiarthroplasty and total hip replacement (THR). Hemiarthroplasty involves replacing the femoral head with a prosthesis whilst retaining the natural acetabulum and acetabular cartilage. The type of hemiarthroplasty can be divided into two groups: unipolar and bipolar. Total hip replacement involves the replacement of the acetabulum in addition to the femoral head. The acetabular component is usually made of a combination of high density polyethylene and metal, and is often cemented into place. The femoral stems may be either held in place with cement or inserted as a 'press fit', without cement.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-04-15 15:33:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Unipolar hemiarthroplasty</HEADING>
<P>The best known of the early hemiarthroplasty designs are the Moore prosthesis (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-1952" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1952</LINK>) and the FR Thompson Hip Prosthesis (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-1954" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 1954</LINK>). These are both one-piece all-metal implants and remain, 40 years after their introduction, two of the most frequently used hemiarthroplasty prostheses. Both these prostheses were designed before the development of polymethylmethacrylate bone cement and were therefore originally inserted as a 'press fit'. The Moore prosthesis has a femoral stem, which is fenestrated and also has a square stem with a shoulder to enable stabilisation within the femur, which resists rotation within the femoral canal. It is generally used without cement and, in the long term, bone in-growth into the fenestrations frequently occurs. The Thompson prosthesis has a smaller stem without fenestrations and nowadays is often used in conjunction with cement. Numerous other designs of unipolar hemiarthroplasties exist based on stems that have been used for total hip replacements. Depending on the design of the stem they may be used either with or without cement.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Bipolar prostheses</HEADING>
<P>These prostheses are designed to allow movement to occur, not only between the acetabulum and the prosthesis, but also at a joint within the prosthesis itself. The object of the second joint is to reduce acetabular wear. This type of prosthesis has a spherical inner metal head with a size between 22 to 36 millimetres in diameter. This fits into a polyethylene shell, which in turn is enclosed by a metal cap. There are a number of different types of prostheses with different stem designs. Examples of bipolar prostheses are the Charnley-Hastings, Bateman, Giliberty and the Monk prostheses, but many other types with different stem designs exist. The bipolar concept has been further developed by the incorporation of a modular joint into some of the prostheses. This is a tapered joint in which a socket in the head of the prosthesis fits onto a tapered projection from the stem. The modular joint enables a variety of different stems to be used with or without cement fixation. A range of different heads are available and the options include a bipolar jointed head, ceramic head or a simple unipolar head.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Total hip replacement</HEADING>
<P>This arthroplasty consists of both a femoral component and an acetabular component. Numerous designs of THR exist. Either one or both components may be held in place with cement.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Hydroxyapatite coating</HEADING>
<P>A prosthesis may be coated with a substance such as hydroxyapatite which promotes bone growth around the prosthesis, thus forming a strong bond between the prosthesis and the bone. Implants coated with this are therefore inserted as a press fit rather than with cement.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Bone cement</HEADING>
<P>Polymethylmethacrylate bone cement may be inserted at the time of surgery. It sets hard to form a solid bond between the prosthesis and the femoral bone at the time of surgery. Without cement a firm bond between the prosthesis and femur is dependent upon bony in-growth and osseous integration. Potential advantages of cement are a reduced degree of post-operative pain, as the prosthesis is more firmly fixed within the femur and a reduced long-term revision rate from loosening of the prosthesis. Major side effects of cement are cardiac arrhythmias and cardio-respiratory collapse, which occasionally occur following its insertion. These complications may be fatal. The cause of this is either embolism from marrow contents forced into the circulation (<LINK REF="STD-Christie-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Christie 1994</LINK>) or a direct toxic effect of the cement. Another consideration with cement is that it may make revision arthroplasty more difficult.</P>
<P>Potential complications of arthroplasty of the hip include wound infection (superficial and deep), dislocation of the prosthesis, loosening of the prosthesis stem, loosening of the acetabular component (THR only), acetabular wear (hemiarthroplasty only), breakage of the implant, disassembly of the implant, and fracture below the implant.</P>

<P>For each study, risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for dichotomous outcomes, and mean differences and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for continuous outcomes. Where appropriate, results of comparable groups of trials were pooled using both the fixed-effect and the random-effects models. Heterogeneity between comparable trials was tested using a standard chi-squared test with additional consideration of the I² statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). Generally, the results for the random-effects model are presented when there is significant heterogeneity (P &lt; 0.10; I² = 50% or more) in the results of individual trials.

<P>Twenty-three randomised controlled trials were identified and included in this review. One quasi-randomised trial (<LINK REF="STD-Dorr-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Dorr 1986</LINK>) compared a cemented bipolar hemiarthroplasty with an uncemented bipolar hemiarthroplasty with a cemented total hip replacement in 89 patients. However, on reappraisal of the study methods, it became clear that the two bipolar hemiarthroplasty groups were not concurrent.

<LINK REF="CMP-001.26" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.26</LINK>).</P>
<P>In addition there was a trend to an increased operative blood loss (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>), need for blood transfusion (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>), occurrence of medical complications (<I>see </I>
<LINK REF="CMP-001.15" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.15</LINK> and <LINK REF="CMP-001.16" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.16</LINK>), a longer hospital stay (<I>see </I>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Sonne_x002d_Holm-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Sonne-Holm 1982</LINK>, which compared a cemented Austin Moore hemiarthroplasty with an uncemented Austin Moore hemiarthroplasty inserted via a posterior approach in 112 people, provided no operative results. Mortality was reported only at six weeks from operation: there was no difference between the two groups (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-001.19" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.19</LINK>). Functional outcome, recorded in terms of hip movements, pain and mobility, was assessed at six weeks, and three, six and 12 months post-operatively. While no difference between groups was reported for hip mobility at final follow up (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-001.22" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.22</LINK>), significantly better walking was reported at three and six months for those treated with a cemented prosthesis. Pain was assessed using a scale of one (most pain) to six (no pain). Significantly more patients had residual pain at six months for the uncemented group. There was a trend to more pain for the uncemented group at six weeks, three months and one year, however the difference between groups was not statistically significant (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-001.24" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.24</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Harper-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Harper 1994</LINK> compared a cemented Thompson prosthesis with an uncemented Thompson prosthesis in 137 people. Clinical follow up at 8 to 12 weeks after surgery was achieved in only 60 patients (29 cemented, 31 uncemented). There were inconsistencies between the full report (in a thesis) and a conference abstract: one intra-operative death, which occurred in the cemented group, was reported in the thesis, but two deaths in the theatre recovery room were reported in the abstract, which also reported a study population of 140 patients rather than 137. Differences between the two groups in mortality at three months and one year (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-001.19" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.19</LINK> and <LINK REF="CMP-001.20" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.20</LINK>) were not statistically significant. Follow-up assessment of pain at eight to 12 weeks after surgery was for fewer than 60 participants (exact number not stated). Pain was reported as being significantly reduced (P &lt; 0.001) in participants with a cemented prosthesis.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Branfoot-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Branfoot 2000</LINK> also compared a cemented Thompson prosthesis with an uncemented Thompson prosthesis in 91 patients. The only operative complications reported were one dislocation and one fracture of the femur, both in the uncemented group. There was no significant difference in mortality, assessed at a mean follow up of 16 months (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-001.20" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.20</LINK>). Pain was graded on a scale of zero (no pain) to three (night pain). The mean pain scores for the 70 surviving participants (0.42 versus 0.24) were reported to be not statistically significantly different. Other assessments using the Harris Hip Score were for limp, mobility, use of walking aids, and activities: none of the Harris Hip Scores showed any statistical difference between the two groups.</P>

There was no significant difference between the two groups in length of hospital stay (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-001.17" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.17</LINK>).

Pain at 17 months (mean follow up) was significantly less in the cemented group (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-001.25" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.25</LINK>). In addition, significantly fewer people in this group were more dependent on walking aids (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-001.22" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.22</LINK>). Similar numbers were unable to return to their pre-fracture residence (<I>see </I>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Santini-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Santini 2005</LINK> also compared a cemented bipolar hemiarthroplasty with an uncemented bipolar hemiarthroplasty in 106 patients. Length of surgery was significantly longer in the cemented group (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). There was no significant difference in units of blood transfused (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). Surgical complications reported were one dislocation in the cemented group and two cases of operative fracture of the femur in the uncemented group. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in deep wound infection (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>) or specific medical complications (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-001.15" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.15</LINK>). The difference between the two groups in the mean costs (3090 Euros versus 4008 Euros) was entirely due to the difference in cost of the prostheses. One-year mortality was similar between the two groups (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-001.20" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.20</LINK>). Function was assessed using a scoring system for walking, personal activities, daily activities and living conditions. None of the scores, either overall or for the separate items, showed any statistically significant difference between the two groups.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Parker-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Parker 2009</LINK> compared a cemented Thompson hemiarthroplasty with an uncemented Austin Moore hemiarthroplasty for 400 patients. Length of surgery was significantly longer in the cemented group (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). There was no significant difference in use of blood transfusion between groups (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK> and <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>). Surgical complications reported were two dislocations in the cemented group and one in the uncemented group. In addition there were 14 cases of operative fracture of the femur in the uncemented group and two patients in the cemented group had cement retained in the acetabulum. There was a tendency to reduced medical complications in the cemented group, although the difference was not statistically significant (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-001.15" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.15</LINK> and <LINK REF="CMP-001.16" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.16</LINK>). Hospital stay was on average four days shorter with the cemented prosthesis (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-001.17" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.17</LINK>). This difference was not statistically significant using the fixed effect method but using a non-parametric test (Mann-Whitney U test) in the published article the difference was reported as being statistically significant (difference in total hospital stay 20.3 days versus 24.7 days, P value = 0.004). There was no difference in mortality between groups at any time period after surgery (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-001.18" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.18</LINK> to <LINK REF="CMP-001.21" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.21</LINK>). Residual pain was assessed by a blinded observer using a visual analogue scale at six weeks after discharge and using a six point pain scale at three, six, nine, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months after surgery. Pain was consistently less for the cemented prosthesis with the result being statistically significant for all time periods up to and including two years from surgery. Regain of mobility was also assessed by the blinded observer using a nine point mobility score and showed a statistically significant better regain of mobility at six, nine and 12 months after surgery. Also reported was the regain of 16 activities of daily living. There was a tendency for these to be regained quicker in the cemented group but only in three activities did this reach statistical significance. These were the ability to bend down and pick up an object from the floor (mean 15.7 weeks versus 23.6 weeks, P value reported as 0.0045), the ability to get in and out of a car (mean 9.1 weeks versus 15.9 weeks (reported P = 0.006) and ability to go shopping without assistance (mean 16.6 weeks versus 27.0 weeks, reported P = 0.0002).</P>

Outcomes reported included the length of surgery, operative blood loss and total blood loss all of which were less for the hydroxyapatite coated implant (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK> to <LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>). Other reported outcomes were requirement for blood transfusion, dislocation, operative and later fracture of the femur, reoperation, wound sepsis, medical complications and length of hospital stay (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK> to <LINK REF="CMP-002.15" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.15</LINK>). None of the other reported outcomes were shown to have any statistically significant difference between groups. One intra-operative cardiac arrest was reported in the cemented group with the patient dying within 72 hours and another patient had hypotension on cement insertion and died 24 hours later. Mortality was reported at 7, 30, 90 days and one and two years. There was no statistically significant difference between groups, but a tendency to a lower mortality at one year from surgery for the cemented group (see <LINK REF="CMP-002.16" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.16</LINK>). Other outcomes reported by a blinded assessor, at three and 12 months, were the number of patients with residual pain requiring medication, number of patients who still needed to use walking aids, Harris hip score, Barthel index and a health related quality of life score (ED-5D). None of these outcomes showed any statistical significance difference between the two groups (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-002.17" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.17</LINK> to <LINK REF="CMP-002.22" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.22</LINK>).<BR/>

<LINK REF="STD-Livesley-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Livesley 1993</LINK> compared an uncemented Moore stem bipolar prosthesis with a hydroxyapatite coated Furlong stem bipolar prosthesis for 82 patients The various outcome measures recorded are presented in the analyses. None of the differences between the two groups in the outcomes shown in the analyses reached statistical significance. There were, however, seven cases of operative fracture of the femur in the Furlong prosthesis group compared with none in the Moore group, a difference that approaches statistical significance (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-002.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.5</LINK>). The single reoperation in the Moore group was for persistent thigh pain. The four reoperations in the Furlong group were for dislocation (twice in one patient), deep infection and fracture at the tip of the prosthesis. At follow up, 30 of the Moore prosthesis group were reported to have radiographic evidence of loosening and a further five to have acetabular wear. Conversely, only one Furlong case was reported to have acetabular wear with no radiographic loosening of the prosthesis. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in mortality (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-002.16" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.16</LINK>) or the number back at home or able to shop at one year (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-002.19" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.19</LINK> and <LINK REF="CMP-002.20" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.20</LINK>). The study reported without data, that at one year from injury fewer patients in the Furlong group used walking aids (reported P = 0.0001). Some of the other outcomes assessed using a functional assessment scale were reported to show a tendency for better results in the Furlong group; these were rest pain (reported P = 0.05), pain on rising from the chair (P = 0.003), activity pain (P = 0.005), ability to climb stairs (P = 0.05) and the patient's opinion of their hip (P = 0.03). Factors showing a non statistically significant difference were assistance in walking (P = 0.08) and walking distance (P = 0.08).</P>

<P>Summation of the data available from these studies is given in <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK> to <LINK REF="CMP-003.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.12</LINK>. These indicate no statistically significant differences between the two types of prostheses for the outcomes of dislocation, acetabular erosion, deep wound sepsis, reoperations, deep vein thrombosis, mortality or mobility.</P>
<P>Summaries and comments on specific aspects of the seven trials are given below.</P>
<P>The 68 participants of <LINK REF="STD-Malhotra-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Malhotra 1995</LINK> were much younger (mean age 66 years) and more likely to be male (56%) than in the other studies. Length of surgery was equal in both groups. The difference in mean blood loss (350 ml versus 400 ml) was reported as not statistically significant. Dislocation occurred in one participant in each group; however, the dislocation in the bipolar group could not be reduced closed and required an open reduction. Both cases of deep wound infection, which occurred in the unipolar group, were treated by a Girdlestone arthroplasty. In addition, two participants of the unipolar group were later revised to a THR for acetabular protrusion. The mean hospital stay was similar in both groups (18.1 versus 17.2 days). No deaths were reported during the two year (average) follow-up period. <LINK REF="STD-Malhotra-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Malhotra 1995</LINK> also stated, without data, that patients treated with the bipolar mobilised more quickly and had less post-operative pain. Follow-up assessment was by the use of a scoring system, which included pain, walking ability and range of hip movement. A greater proportion of 'excellent results' were noted in the bipolar group (24/32 (75%) versus 17/36 (47%)).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Rosen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rosen 1992</LINK>, which included 96 participants, was only reported as a conference abstract with no data. The length of surgery and operative blood loss were stated to be significantly greater for the bipolar hemiarthroplasty. Reoperations were equal in both groups but significantly more post-operative complications occurred in the bipolar group. Mortality was reported as not significantly different between groups. Of only 27 participants followed up, pain was reported to be slightly less in the bipolar group and mobility better in the unipolar group.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Van-Thiel-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Van Thiel 1988</LINK>, which included 93 participants, was only reported as a conference abstract with no data. The only clinical outcome measure was the Harris Hip Score, which was reported as showing no significant difference between groups. Radiographic parameters of loosening, peri-articular ossification and protrusion acetabuli also showed no significant difference between groups.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Cornell-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Cornell 1988</LINK> compared a cemented modular unipolar hemiarthroplasty with a cemented bipolar hemiarthroplasty in 48 patients. All the stems used were identical and all the prostheses were inserted via a posterior approach. Follow up was only six months. Length of surgery and operative blood loss were stated without data as showing no significant difference between the two groups. Dislocation occurred in one person in each group. The only other complication reported was one case of deep vein thrombosis in the bipolar group. Mean length of hospital stay was reported as not being significantly shorter in the unipolar group (10.3 versus 13.4 days). There was no significant difference in mortality at six months (1/15 versus 2/33; RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.11 to 11.21) (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-003.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.10</LINK>). Overall hip function was assessed using the Johansen Hip Scoring system, which showed no difference between the two groups (64.9 versus 63.2 points). However, hip movements were stated as being "greater" after the bipolar prosthesis (flexion: 110 versus 104 degrees; rotation: 50 versus 36.6 degrees; abduction: 38 versus 22 degrees). Walking speed was also reported to be better for the bipolar (2.67 versus 1.93 feet/sec, reported P &lt; 0.03) as was the 'get up and go test' (27.3 versus 33.1 seconds), although the last difference was not statistically significant.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Raia-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Raia 2003</LINK> compared a cemented unipolar hemiarthroplasty with a cemented bipolar in 115 people. All prostheses stems were identical and inserted by a posterolateral approach. Follow up was for one year. Mean operative blood loss was similar between the two groups (252 ml versus 237 ml) and there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in the numbers of participants receiving blood transfusion (15/55 versus 18/60; analysis not shown). One person in the unipolar group had three dislocations and one person in the bipolar group had a single dislocation. All dislocations were treated by closed reduction. The one case of deep sepsis, reported in the unipolar group, required debridement and later implant removal. No other surgical complications were reported. Length of stay on the orthopaedic ward was similar in the two groups (mean 5.5 days versus 5.2 days). Mortality and failure to regain mobility at one year were similar in the two groups as shown in <LINK REF="CMP-003.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.11</LINK> and <LINK REF="CMP-003.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.12</LINK> respectively. Seventy-eight participants were assessed at one year from surgery using the Short Form 36 questionnaire and the Musculoskeletal Functional Assessment score. No significant differences or trends were noted between the two groups.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Calder-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Calder 1996</LINK> compared a Thompson prosthesis with a Monk bipolar prosthesis in 250 patients aged over 80 years of age. All prostheses were cemented in place, had identical stems and were inserted via an antero-lateral Hardinge approach. Dislocation occurred twice in the unipolar group and once in the bipolar group (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>). Radiographic evidence of acetabular erosion was seen in three cases, all with unipolar prosthesis; none of these had needed revision surgery by the time of final follow up (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK> and <LINK REF="CMP-003.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.4</LINK>). Deep wound infection occurred in five unipolar group participants and four bipolar group participants (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-003.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.5</LINK>). The length of hospital stay was similar in the two groups (medians: 18 versus 17 days). There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in mortality at six months (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-003.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.10</LINK>) or one year (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-003.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.11</LINK>). Other results for this trial were reported as percentages without actual numbers. The proportions of patients with no or mild pain at follow up were reported similar in the two groups (53% versus 55%), as were the proportions returning to their pre-operative place of residence (41% versus 42%). <LINK REF="STD-Calder-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Calder 1996</LINK> reported that, after adjustment for confounding factors, the proportion of patients returning to their pre-injury subjective status was significantly greater in the unipolar group (P = 0.041). This statement conflicted with the proportions given in the text (29% versus 40%). There was no statistical difference between the two groups in the proportions of patients who reported a limp (23% versus 25%) or who were satisfied with their operation (67% versus 63%). Similarly, there was no significant difference in the mean Harris Hip Scores of the two groups (70 versus 72). The Nottingham Health Profile, which was conducted on a subgroup of 128 participants, showed no statistically significant difference between implant groups.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Davison-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Davison 2001</LINK> compared a cemented unipolar Thompson prosthesis with a cemented Monk bipolar prosthesis involved 187 participants aged between 65 and 79 years, with a minimum of follow up of two years. Dislocation occurred twice in one unipolar group participant and in two participants of the bipolar group (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>). Open reduction was required for one of the bipolar dislocations (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>). The sole deep wound infection occurred in one patient in the bipolar group (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-003.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.5</LINK>). Acetabular erosion requiring revision was required twice in the unipolar group and once in the bipolar group (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-003.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.4</LINK>). Other reoperations, all in the bipolar group, were one Girdlestone for sepsis and one biopsy and excision of heterotopic ossification. Other outcomes, which were reported as showing no significant difference between the two groups during the follow-up period of up to five years, were the mean Harris Hip Score, Barthel Index, patient satisfaction, return to pre-injury state and mortality. The Nottingham Health Profile, assessed in 73 participants, was reported as showing a non-statistically significant trend to lower physical mobility for the unipolar group.</P>

There were also no significant differences between the two groups in the number of reoperations (5/69 versus 6/69; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.27 to 2.60) (<I>see </I>
<LINK REF="CMP-004.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.12</LINK>) or medical complications (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-004.13" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.13</LINK>). The mean cost for those treated with a hemiarthroplasty was £15,263 compared with a mean cost of £12,253 for those treated with a THR (reported 95% confidence interval for the difference was £1400 to £7420). The study reported no statistically significant differences between the two groups in mortality (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-004.15" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.15</LINK>) or in residual pain or discomfort at 12 months (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-004.16" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.16</LINK>). Patient-reported outcomes were obtained at four months, and one and two years using a Hip Rating Questionnaire (modified Johansen hip scoring system), which assessed impact of the hip problem (global), pain, walking, and function, and the EuroQol (EQ-5D) questionnaire to assess general health status. The P values for these are summarised in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Baker-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 2006</LINK> compared a cemented unipolar hemiarthroplasty with a cemented total hip replacement in 81 patients. The mean surgical time was less for hemiarthroplasty (78 versus 93 minutes, reported P = &lt; 0.001). There were three dislocations in the THR group; one of these was recurrent (<I>see </I>
<LINK REF="CMP-004.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.10</LINK> to <LINK REF="CMP-004.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.12</LINK>). Three patients in the hemiarthroplasty group required revision surgery: two for acetabular wear and one for fracture around the prosthesis. One patient of the THR group required revision for loosening and one wound required debridement in the same group. Radiographic changes of acetabular wear were also reported for 21 out of 32 cases in the hemiarthroplasty group. Medical complications were reported for 15 patients as detailed in <LINK REF="CMP-004.13" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.13</LINK>. Mortality at three years is given in <LINK REF="CMP-004.15" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.15</LINK>, with no statistically significant difference between groups.

Surgical complications were one later fracture below the implant in the THR group, which was treated by plating of the femur, and one deep wound infection in the THR group requiring three debridements and then closure of the wound. There were also two superficial wound infections in each group. Medical complications reported in for this study are presented in <LINK REF="CMP-004.13" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.13</LINK>.

<LINK REF="STD-Dorr-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Dorr 1986</LINK> compared bipolar hemiarthroplasty, either cemented (37 cases) or uncemented (13 cases), with a cemented total hip replacement (39 cases). Surgical complications were two dislocations in the hemiarthroplasty group, both involved a cemented arthroplasty, and seven dislocations in the THR group. No wound infections were reported. Three participants with a cemented hemiarthroplasty required revision for removal of cement in the acetabulum, heterotopic ossification and repeated dislocations. One participant with an uncemented hemiarthroplasty group required revision for recurrent dislocation and loosening. Two of the THR cases required revision for recurrent dislocation and loosening. No difference in the length of hospital stay was noted. Trial participants were assessed at three, 12 and 24 months post-operatively. Mortality was only reported as 'no difference between groups'. Mean pain scores on a scale of zero to six (with the most severe pain score of 0) were 5.4, 5.2 and 5.1 for participants with a cemented hemiarthroplasty, 3.7, 3.6 and 3.0 for participants with an uncemented hemiarthroplasty and 4.9, 5.5 and 5.5 for participants with a THR.This difference was reported to be statistically significant for participants with an uncemented hemiarthroplasty. Mobility was assessed on a scale of 0 to 6 (with worst mobility at 0). Mean mobility at three, 12 and 24 months after surgery was 4.0, 4.2 and 4.0 for participants with a cemented hemiarthroplasty and 3.7, 3.6 and 3.0 for those with an uncemented hemiarthroplasty versus 4.1, 4.1 and 5.5 for the those with a THR. The reduced mobility for participants with an uncemented hemiarthroplasty was reported as being statistically significant. More participants in the hemiarthroplasty group used walking aids compared with the THR group (15/50 (30%) versus 7/39 (18%)). However, the excess in the use of walking aids was in those treated with an uncemented hemiarthroplasty (9/13 (69%)) compared with those with a cemented hemiarthroplasty (6/37 (16%)). Gait analysis of walking velocity and single limb stance showed no difference between the cemented prostheses but a greater degree of impaired gait for participants with an uncemented hemiarthroplasty.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Macaulay-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Macaulay 2008</LINK> compared a hemiarthroplasty with a THR in 40 patients. There was only limited data available because of incomplete reporting of denominators. Surgical complications were one dislocation in the THR group and one wound infection in the hemiarthroplasty group. There was no difference in mortality between groups (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-004.15" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.15</LINK>). Final outcomes were assessed using the Harris hip score, timed get up and go score, WOMAC score, and SF-36 scale at 12 and 24 months. Numbers of patients assessed at these timed intervals were not given. The only differences that were reported to be statistically significant were more bodily pain for the hemiarthroplasty group at 12 months (P value reported as 0.02) and 24 months (P = 0.03) and improved function on the WOMAC score at 24 months (P = 0.03).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Skinner-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Skinner 1989</LINK> compared an uncemented Moore hemiarthroplasty with a cemented Howse THR in 180 patients. All prostheses were inserted with a posterior-lateral approach. The main implant-related complication was dislocation in 11 hemiarthroplasties and 10 THRs. The only case of deep sepsis occurred in a THR patient. Revision surgery was required in 13 hemiarthroplasties for recurrent dislocation, loosening, fracture around the prosthesis or ectopic calcification. Three of the THRs were revised for recurrent dislocation. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in mortality at 2 or 12 months follow up (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-004.15" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.15</LINK>). Pain was more prevalent in those treated with hemiarthroplasty. Mobility, graded on a scale of one to four, was reported to be significantly better for the THR. However, there was no significant difference in the numbers failing to regain their former mobility (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-004.17" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.17</LINK>). A later conference abstract (<LINK REF="REF-Ravikumar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ravikumar 1998</LINK>), reported a 13-year follow up. The mean survival was 3.17 years for the hemiarthroplasty group and 4.27 years for the THR group, with no significant difference found. The number of surviving patients assessed was not stated but would be small given the approximately 85% overall mortality. The mean Harris Hip Score for survivors treated by THR was significantly better than that for those treated by hemiarthroplasty (mean score 80 versus 55). Pain was also reported to be less for THR group survivors, and this group was also stated to be more mobile. The long-term revision rate was significantly higher for those treated with a hemiarthroplasty (13/100 (13.0%) versus 3/80 (3.8%); RR 3.47, 95% CI 1.02 to 11.75<I> (see </I>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-05-05 15:11:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>Many of the trial reports indicated a poor level of methodological rigour, in particular regarding concealment of allocation, assessor blinding and intention-to-treat analysis. Inadequate trial methodology may allow a patient being randomised to a more extensive surgical procedure such as use of cement or a THR, then being excluded when they are felt to be unfit for the more extensive procedure at the time of surgery. Such events will bias results in favour of the more extensive procedure. Furthermore, many of the studies involved small numbers of patients and had limitations, including inadequate length of follow up, in their assessment and reporting of outcome. In addition some of the studies were only reported as conference abstracts with a failure to provide additional information. However in some cases this apparent poor methodology may reflect poor reporting of the trial rather than poor trial methodology. The variation in characteristics of the prostheses used in the individual trials hampers interpretation of their findings. For instance, in the comparison of cemented versus uncemented prostheses, the two prostheses under test sometimes differed in other important ways as well as in the use of cement when comparing a hemiarthroplasty with THR. For some of the findings, it may not be possible to attribute an outcome to the intervention under test (cement) or to the other differences in the implants. While remaining a source of heterogeneity, pooling of data from several trials with this comparison should help to address the basic question (whether to use cement of not). The presentation of the results of this review, which subgroups the different combinations of implants under test, also should help to get the answers to the basic questions and explore the differences. So far, the limited numbers of patients studied preclude the drawing of definite conclusions for many of the comparisons under review.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Cemented versus uncemented prostheses</HEADING>
<P>The six included studies investigating this comparison involved a total of 899 patients. The largest study was that of <LINK REF="STD-Parker-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Parker 2009</LINK> with 400 participants. This study, which had the strongest methodology including blinded assessment of outcome, found strongly in favour for the use of cement. The study of <LINK REF="STD-Harper-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Harper 1994</LINK> with 137 patients, was of poor methodology with very limited reporting of outcomes and inadequate follow up of patients: therefore no conclusions can be made from this study. <LINK REF="STD-Santini-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Santini 2005</LINK> had an inadequate method or randomisation and limited reporting of outcomes. <LINK REF="STD-Sonne_x002d_Holm-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Sonne-Holm 1982</LINK> excluded the results of 37 patients who had either died, moved away or had the wrong prosthesis implanted. <LINK REF="STD-Branfoot-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Branfoot 2000</LINK> had limited reporting of results for 91 patients. Despite the methodology limitations of many of the studies, most reported similar findings.</P>
<P>Most studies reported increased pain for uncemented prostheses (<LINK REF="STD-Emery-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Emery 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harper-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Harper 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Parker-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Parker 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sonne_x002d_Holm-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Sonne-Holm 1982</LINK>). This is particularly relevant in <LINK REF="STD-Parker-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Parker 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sonne_x002d_Holm-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Sonne-Holm 1982</LINK> both of which used blinded outcome assessors. <LINK REF="STD-Branfoot-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Branfoot 2000</LINK> also reported less pain for the cemented group although the results did not reach statistical significance. Three studies reported better mobility in the cemented group ( <LINK REF="STD-Emery-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Emery 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Parker-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Parker 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sonne_x002d_Holm-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Sonne-Holm 1982</LINK>), however <LINK REF="STD-Santini-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Santini 2005</LINK> found no difference in walking ability. Regarding hospital stay and post-operative medical complications, there was a tendency for these to be less with the cemented prosthesis, although the differences were not statistically significant. Very few major adverse effects of cement were reported. There was one intra-operative death from 77 patients treated with a cemented prosthesis in <LINK REF="STD-Harper-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Harper 1994</LINK> and one intra-operative cardiac arrest from 200 cemented prosthesis in <LINK REF="STD-Parker-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Parker 2009</LINK>. The other studies did not report any intra-operative adverse events associated with bone cement. No difference in mortality was reported between groups.</P>
<P>It is notable that in two quasi-randomised studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dorr-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Dorr 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Skinner-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Skinner 1989</LINK>) comparing hemiarthroplasty with a cemented THR, some (<LINK REF="STD-Dorr-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Dorr 1986</LINK>) or all (<LINK REF="STD-Skinner-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Skinner 1989</LINK>) patients in the hemiarthroplasty group had an uncemented implant. Both studies found superior results for the THR but it is not possible to determine if these improved outcomes were due to the use of cement or the differences in type of implant.</P>
<P>Potential biases in the results of the studies may occur if frailer participants are omitted from the cemented group. This is more likely to occur if the method of randomisation was inadequate, which is particularly relevant for <LINK REF="STD-Harper-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Harper 1994</LINK> who used an open method of randomisation.</P>
<P>In summary, there is reasonable evidence from randomised studies to date that cementing a prosthesis in place will reduce the amount of residual pain in the hip and also allow better regain of mobility. There is no evidence of any significant adverse effects of cement on mortality or other complications encountered apart from the very occasional adverse reaction to cement during surgery.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Hemiarthroplasties (with and without cement) versus hydroxyapatite hemiarthroplasty</HEADING>
<P>Only one study to date has addressed the issue as to whether a modern uncemented hydroxyapatite coated arthroplasty will produce comparable results to that of a cemented arthroplasty (<LINK REF="STD-Figved-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Figved 2009</LINK>). This study of 220 participants essentially found comparable outcomes between the two groups for all the outcome measures studied. However further studies with increased patient numbers with a longer follow up are required before definite conclusions regarding similar outcome measures can be made.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Livesley-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Livesley 1993</LINK> compared two very different prostheses: a standard Austin Moore with its single size fenestrated stem and collar versus a solid collarless hydroxyapatite coated Furlong stem of different sizes. Both prostheses were used with a bipolar head. Any difference in the results, for the two implants may be due to either the hydroxyapatite, the collar, the stem shape or the availability of different stem sizes. The results from this small quasi-randomised trial showed a tendency to better final outcome results with the Furlong prosthesis. However, the limitations in the available evidence from this small study means that definite conclusion on the relative effects of the two implants cannot be made.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Unipolar hemiarthroplasty versus unipolar hemiarthroplasty (differing head materials)</HEADING>
<P>The one trial included for this comparison (<LINK REF="STD-Stock-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Stock 1997</LINK>) was reported only as a conference abstract without any details of the trial methodology and only one outcome measure, the Harris Hip Score. Thus, no conclusions can be drawn on the relative effects of a ceramic and metal-headed Thompson prosthesis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Unipolar hemiarthroplasty versus bipolar hemiarthroplasty</HEADING>
<P>The limited data available from the seven studies testing this comparison showed no statistically significant differences between the groups. Some significant differences were reported for specific outcomes in individual studies, but confirmatory data were rarely provided. Notably, two of the three studies that compared an Austin Moore hemiarthroplasty with a Bateman bipolar hemiarthroplasty (<LINK REF="STD-Rosen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rosen 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Thiel-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Van Thiel 1988</LINK>) were only reported as conference abstracts and provided minimal information. The third study (<LINK REF="STD-Malhotra-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Malhotra 1995</LINK>) gave more information but the characteristics of the trial participants were markedly different to those of the general population of people with hip fractures. The mean age of the participants was 66 years (as opposed to 75 to 80 years for most other studies), 56% were male (as opposed to 25% to 35% in other studies), and there were no deaths by two years follow up. This as well as the small sample size (68 participants), means that the results of this study, which tended to favour bipolar hemiarthroplasty, may not anyway apply to the general hip fracture population.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Raia-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Raia 2003</LINK> compared cemented unipolar and cemented bipolar arthroplasties in 115 people followed up for one year. No differences in outcomes were noted between groups. <LINK REF="STD-Cornell-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Cornell 1988</LINK> undertook a similar study with only 48 participants. There appeared to be a greater range of movement and improved gait for those treated with the bipolar prosthesis but there was no difference in the hip scores between the two groups. Because the number of participants in this study was small, no definite conclusions can be made. The larger study of <LINK REF="STD-Calder-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Calder 1996</LINK> for those aged 80 years and over with a more complete reporting of outcomes showed no advantages for the bipolar prosthesis in this age group. In the study involving those aged less than 80 years of age (<LINK REF="STD-Davison-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Davison 2001</LINK>), again no advantage was demonstrated for the bipolar implant.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Hemiarthroplasty versus total hip replacement</HEADING>
<P>Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Baker-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Blomfeldt-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Blomfeldt 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-STARS-2006" TYPE="STUDY">STARS 2006</LINK>) involving 339 patients compared a cemented hemiarthroplasty with a cemented THR. These found little differences between prostheses except for a definite trend towards better long term hip function and mobility in the THR group. Two further (<LINK REF="STD-Macaulay-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Macaulay 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mouzopoulos-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mouzopoulos 2008</LINK>) involving 126 patients did not specify the use of cement although it seems likely that most implants were cemented in place. Both studies again reported a tendency to better functional outcomes with a THR. One dated and flawed study (<LINK REF="STD-Dorr-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Dorr 1986</LINK>), in which three-quarters of the patients in the hemiarthroplasty group had a cemented prosthesis, failed to find any differences between the prostheses.</P>
<P>Two quasi-randomised studies compared an uncemented hemiarthroplasty with a cemented THR (<LINK REF="STD-Dorr-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Dorr 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Skinner-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Skinner 1989</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Dorr-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Dorr 1986</LINK>, 13 of the 52 participants in the hemiarthroplasty group had an uncemented prosthesis. Both studies reported increased pain for the uncemented prosthesis. <LINK REF="STD-Skinner-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Skinner 1989</LINK>, which included 180 participants, reported better mobility and a lower long-term revision rate for those treated with a THR. It is not possible to be certain if the improved results in the THR group were due to the use of cement or the acetabular replacement as part of the THR.</P>

<P>There is reasonable evidence to indicate that cementing a prosthesis in place for a hemiarthroplasty will reduce pain in the limb and result in improved mobility. It is possible that these differences may not exist for a hydroxyapatite coated uncemented prosthesis. There is limited evidence that a THR results in less residual pain and better function than an hemiarthroplasty. There is inadequate evidence to support or refute the use of a bipolar prosthesis.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-09-29 21:20:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further well conducted randomised trials with full reporting of outcomes, blinding of outcome assessors, adequate length of follow up and correct methodology are required to determine the optimum prosthesis for a hip fracture. Of particularly relevance is THR versus hemiarthroplasty and also bipolar versus unipolar hemiarthroplasty. Trials of older hemiarthroplasties such as the Austin Moore or Thompson with or without cement are of less relevance now, but there is still a place for trials of a contemporary uncemented hydroxyapatite coated stem with a cemented stem hemiarthroplasty.</P>

<EXCLUDED_CHAR STUDY_ID="STD-Karpman-1992">
<CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION>
<P>This study was only reported in the conference proceedings of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. The study involved 125 patients randomised to either an Austin Moore prosthesis, cemented bipolar or uncemented bipolar. Follow up of patients ranged from two to five years (mean 3.7 years). Results were presented without data and stated that there was "no significant difference between any of the groups with regard to functional outcome." The study was excluded, as there was inadequate reporting of the trial. Attempts were made to contact the trialists for further information, without success.</P>

<EXCLUDED_CHAR STUDY_ID="STD-Leidinger-2002">
<CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION>
<P>This was a randomised study of 72 patients. In the control group of 36 patients, surgical repair was performed with palacos mixed conventionally. In the second group (vacuum group) of 36 patients, surgical repair was performed with palacos mixed in vacuum. Invasive haemodynamic monitoring and transoesophageal echocardiography was performed in all cases. Those in the vacuum group had a lower incidence of echocardiographical changes (86% versus 14%) and clinical complications (53% versus 11%). Mortality in the control group was 14% compared with 3% in the vacuum group. </P>
<P>The study was excluded, as it was not within the remit of this review which is choice of arthroplasty or use of cement. Variations of cementing technique are not included.</P>

<EXCLUDED_CHAR STUDY_ID="STD-Pitto-2000">
<CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION>
<P>This was a randomised study of 40 patients in which, for 20 patients, the femoral component was cemented using a contemporary technique. For the other 20 patients, a drainage hole was placed in the trochanteric region, along the prolongation of the linea aspera and a distal hole was placed 2 cm below the tip of the femoral component. The medullary cavity was then aspirated during cement insertion. Embolic phenomena were documented intraoperatively by continuous transoesophageal echocardiographic imaging of the right atrium and ventricle. Patients in the control group showed more severe and longer-lasting episodes of embolism than patients of the bone vacuum group. No other outcome measures were given. The study was excluded because of the small numbers and lack of other outcome measures.</P>

<EXCLUDED_CHAR STUDY_ID="STD-Sadr-1977">
<CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION>
<P>This was a comparison of 20 patients with an intracapsular fracture treated using Thompson prosthesis coated with Proplast, compared with 20 patients treated using a cemented Thompson prosthesis. The study stated patients were allocated to one of the groups by a "random selection", but it remained unclear as to the exact method of randomisation. Radiographic loosening occurred in one case of the cemented group versus nine in the Proplast group. Two cases of ectopic calcification and one dislocation were also reported in the Proplast group. Mortality at one year was four in the Proplast group and nine in the uncemented group. Functional outcome for the survivors (excluding the two patients lost to follow up) showed no difference between groups.</P>
<P>The study was excluded for the following reasons.<BR/>1. It was not possible to be confident that this was a randomised study rather than a case comparison study.<BR/>2. The use of Proplast coated prosthesis is no longer prevalent.<BR/>3. The total number of patients in the study is small (40) with limited reporting of outcomes for the 25 patients assessed at follow up.</P>
