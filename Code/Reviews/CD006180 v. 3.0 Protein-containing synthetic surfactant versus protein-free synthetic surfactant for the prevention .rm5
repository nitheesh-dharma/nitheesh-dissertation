<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-08-04 17:00:18 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is a significant cause of illness in preterm infants. RDS is caused by a deficiency or a dysfunction of the chemicals that line the lung, called pulmonary surfactant. Numerous preparations that contain surfactants of either animal origin or synthetic design have been developed and tested to treat or prevent RDS. In general, these surfactant preparations have decreased lung rupture (pneumothorax), decreased the risk of dying, and increased the number of survivors without lung damage. From previous research, the surfactants that are obtained from animal lungs seem to have a better effect than the synthetic surfactants. This might be due to the surfactant proteins contained in animal surfactant that are absent in the previously available synthetic surfactants. </P>
<P>Recently developed synthetic surfactant preparations include whole surfactant proteins or parts of the proteins (called peptides) that act like naturally occurring surfactant protein. These preparations have been recently tested in comparison to the protein free synthetic surfactant preparations. </P>
<P>A recent trial of protein containing synthetic surfactant compared to protein free synthetic surfactant suggests that these protein containing synthetic surfactants help prevent respiratory distress syndrome and may or may not lead to a decrease in lung injury (chronic lung disease). Other clinical outcomes were similar. Further studies will help refine recommendations concerning use of protein containing synthetic surfactants.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-08-04 17:02:59 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. RDS is caused by a deficiency, dysfunction, or inactivation of pulmonary surfactant. Pulmonary surfactant forms a lipid-rich monolayer that coats the alveoli and airways of the lung and is essential for proper inflation and function (<LINK REF="REF-Jobe-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jobe 1993</LINK>). Surfactant lowers surface tension and improves pulmonary dynamic compliance. Pulmonary surfactant is predominantly dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine with lesser amounts of other phospholipids including phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylinositol. Pulmonary surfactant also contains neutral lipids and four distinct surfactant proteins (SP-A, SP-B, SP-C and SP-D). Surfactant proteins may play a role in surfactant secretion, recycling, cooperative functioning with other surfactant proteins and phospholipids (<LINK REF="REF-Schurch-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schurch 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Possmayer-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Possmayer 1990</LINK>), and innate host defences of the lung (<LINK REF="REF-Wright-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Numerous surfactants of either animal extract or synthetic design have been developed and tested. Surfactants from animal derivation include porcine (poractant alfa) and bovine (beractant, calfactant) lung extracts. Non-protein containing surfactants are phospholipid preparations both with (colfosceril palmitate) and without (DPPG/PG) additional dispersion agents and polymers. In very low birth weight preterm infants, the intratracheal administration of these exogenous surfactants has resulted in decreased mortality, reduced severity of RDS, decreased likelihood of pneumothorax, and increased survival without chronic lung disease (<LINK REF="REF-Soll-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soll 1992</LINK>). Although both synthetic and animal derived surfactant preparations have been shown to be beneficial, studies comparing animal derived surfactant preparations to non-protein containing synthetic preparations have demonstrated improvement in immediate ventilator support, decreased risk of pneumothorax, and decreased risk of mortality in infants receiving the animal derived products (<LINK REF="REF-Soll-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soll 2001</LINK>). Furthermore, there is a marginal decrease in chronic lung disease among preterm newborns treated with animal derived surfactant preparations when compared to the non-protein containing synthetic preparations (<LINK REF="REF-Soll-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soll 2001</LINK>). The increased efficacy of animal derived surfactants might be due to the surfactant protein content of these animal derived preparations (<LINK REF="REF-Tooley-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tooley 1987</LINK>). Both animal derived and synthetic surfactant preparations are comprised largely of phospholipids, of which DPPC is the major surface-active component (<LINK REF="REF-Clements-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clements 1977</LINK>). However, only animal derived surfactant preparations contain the highly lipophilic proteins that are present in native surfactant <I>in situ</I>.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-08-04 17:08:24 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Recently developed surfactant preparations include peptides or whole proteins that, when added in an aqueous dispersion of phospholipids, function in a fashion similar to endogenous pulmonary surfactant protein. One new synthetic surfactant preparation contains peptide fragments that mimic domains of Surfactant protein B (SP-B). This peptide is called sinapultide (developmental name KL4 peptide). The form and function of SP-B are related to its repeating pattern; stretches of basic hydrophilic residues with intermittent hydrophobic domains (<LINK REF="REF-Revak-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Revak 1988</LINK>). This unique design is thought to increase lateral stability of the phospholipid layer and thus the ability of pulmonary surfactant to lower surface tension at an air-water interface, which in turn maintains expansion of alveoli (<LINK REF="REF-Cochrane-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cochrane 1991</LINK>). Sinapultide consists of a stretch of four hydrophobic leucines (L) interspersed with cationic lysine (K) to create a sequence KLLLLKLLLLKLLLLKLLLLK whose spatial structure resembles one of the amphipathic domains of SP-B. Lucinactant (Surfaxin, Discovery Laboratories) contains sinapultide and phospholipids. <I>In vitro</I> studies have demonstrated the ability of lucinactant to lower surface tension at an air-fluid interface in a pulsating bubble surfactometer to a greater magnitude than natural surfactants (<LINK REF="REF-Manalo-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manalo 1996</LINK>). <I>In vivo</I> studies in preterm rhesus monkeys demonstrated that lucinactant successfully expanded the pulmonary alveoli and promoted gas exchange (<LINK REF="REF-Revak-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Revak 1996</LINK>). Furthermore, administration of this peptide-containing synthetic surfactant demonstrated improved gas exchange, reduced ventilator requirements, and reduced mortality in a small non-randomized uncontrolled pilot study of preterm infants with RDS. Although there was no comparison group, the lucinactant treated infants had a comparable rate of complications when compared to surfactant treated infants in other trials (<LINK REF="STD-Cochrane-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cochrane 1996</LINK>). Other SP-B domains have been modelled with synthetic peptides to produce their own version of SP-B (<LINK REF="REF-Walther-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walther 2002</LINK>). This product has a different peptide structure than lucinactant, and is not yet commercially available.</P>
<P>Lusupultide (Venticute, Altana Pharma) is a synthetic surfactant preparation that contains recombinant SP-C (rSP-C) and phospholipids. The tendency of native SP-C (nSP-C) to aggregate into insoluble amyloid-like fibrils when separated from lipids has limited its investigation and usage (<LINK REF="REF-Walther-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walther 2000</LINK>). Recombinant SP-C is similar to the 34-amino acid human SP-C sequence, but differs from it with the replacement of cysteine by phenylalanine in positions four and five, and of methionine by isoleucine in position 32. rSP-C was designed to circumvent the aggregation characteristics of SP-C while maintaining the physical properties of the dipalmitoylated form of nSP-C (<LINK REF="REF-Ikegami-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ikegami 1998</LINK>). SP-C is palmitoylated at one or more cysteines located near the surface of the membrane that are able to move within and between lipid layers. This biochemical configuration may help create multilayer phospholipid films and facilitate the movement of lipids that line the alveoli, thereby improving film stability (<LINK REF="REF-Whitsett-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitsett 2002</LINK>). <I>In vitro</I>, lusupultide was shown to lower surface tension more than natural sheep surfactants. In addition, <I>in vivo</I> studies of lusupultide utilizing two common preterm animal models of surfactant deficiency (lambs and rabbits) demonstrated similar improvement in ventilation, lung mechanics, and compliance when compared to animal derived surfactants (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 1998</LINK>).</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-06-16 11:39:07 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The rationale for the development of protein containing synthetic surfactants includes both practical and theoretical considerations. Synthetic surfactants would have highly reproducible composition with potentially less batch-to-batch surfactant protein (or mimic) variability (<LINK REF="REF-Ainsworth-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ainsworth 2002</LINK>), would be more readily available with no dependence on an animal source, and could theoretically be produced in large quantities. Furthermore, synthetic surfactants may lessen the risk of inflammation (<LINK REF="REF-Moya-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moya 1993</LINK>), and immunogenicity (<LINK REF="REF-Merritt-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merritt 1988</LINK>) associated with animal derived surfactants as well as the theoretical risk of infection.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Moya-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Moya 2005</LINK> was a 50 center study performed in Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Hungary, Mexico, Panama, Poland, Russia, and Uruguay.</P>
<P>
<I>Objective:</I> To compare the efficacy and safety of a synthetic surfactant containing a SP-B mimic to a non-protein containing synthetic surfactant and an animal derived surfactant in the prevention of RDS and RDS-related death.</P>
<P>
<I>Population:</I> Preterm infants between 24 and 32 weeks gestational age with birth weights between 600 and 1200 grams and having undergone endotracheal intubation. 1294 infants were randomised in this trial; 527 to lucinactant, 509 to colfosceril palmitate, and 258 to beractant. Therefore, for the purposes of this review, the relevant population are the 1036 infants randomised to either lucinactant or colfosceril palmitate. These infants were similar with respect to their baseline demographic and clinical characteristics.</P>
<P>
<I>Intervention:</I> The synthetic surfactant containing surfactant protein mimics group received 5.8 mL/kg of lucinactant, a synthetic surfactant containing a SP-B mimic with phospholipids and the protein-free synthetic surfactant group received 5 mL/kg of colfosceril palmitate, a protein-free synthetic surfactant that contains a single phospholipid, DPPC, cetyl alcohol, and tyloxapol. In this study, a third group received a beractant, a bovine lung extract containing phospholipids and bovine surfactant proteins. This comparison is not included in this review. The infants in this third group are addressed in a companion review comparing trials of synthetic surfactants with surfactant protein mimics to animal derived surfactant extract preparations. In all groups, the pulmonary surfactant was administered intratracheally within 20 - 30 minutes of birth. Infants were randomised in a masked manner to receive lucinactant, colfosceril palmitate, or beractant in a 2:2:1 ratio. The need for additional surfactant therapy was determined individually based on pre-determined clinical and respiratory status and ventilator management and was kept uniform for both groups by adherence to specific guidelines developed for the study.</P>
<P>
<I>Outcomes assessed: </I>The primary comparison of interest within the trial was between lucinactant and colfosceril palmitate. The group that received beractant contained half as many patients. The beractant group was included as a reference arm, and was not included in the sample size computation. The pre-specified primary endpoints from which the sample size was generated were development of RDS at 24 hours and the occurrence of death related to RDS by 14 days. Other outcomes included mortality, BPD, air leaks, IVH, PVL, ROP, pulmonary haemorrhage, and sepsis.</P>
<P>Moya 2007 reports follow-up data from the aforementioned randomised controlled trial as well as data from a second RDS prophylaxis trial of protein containing synthetic surfactants that did not have a protein-free synthetic surfactant comparison group (<LINK REF="STD-Moya-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Moya 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sinha-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sinha 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<I>Objective:</I> To determine survival, rehospitalization, growth, neurologic, and pulmonary outcomes through one year corrected age of infants administered synthetic surfactant containing a SP-B mimic.</P>
<P>
<I>Population:</I> 1269 infants preterm infants enrolled in the <LINK REF="STD-Moya-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Moya 2005</LINK> trial (described above) who were either known to have died or successfully seen at follow-up at approximately one year of age were included. Of these infants, 1018 were randomised to either lucinactant or colfosceril palmitate. 288 of these infants were known to have died (lucinactant N = 140; colfosceril palmitate N = 148) and 730 were known to have survived and to potentially be available for follow-up (lucinactant N = 379; colfosceril palmitate N = 351).</P>
<P>Intervention: Described above in the <LINK REF="STD-Moya-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Moya 2005</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<I>Outcomes assessed:</I> Postdischarge rehospitalization rates, respiratory morbidity after 36 weeks postmenstrual age, growth measurements at one year of age, neurologic assessment at one year of age, and death by one year of age were recorded. Included in the neurologic examination was assessment of gross motor tone, reflex abnormalities, presence of unilateral or bilateral deafness, presence of unilateral or bilateral blindness, or a history of seizures that required treatment with anticonvulsants. For survival comparisons, infants who were lost to follow-up or who had consent withdrawn were analyzed and reported both as if they had died and separately as if they were not in the study.</P>

This study enrolled preterm infants between 24 and 28 weeks gestational age with birth weights between 600 and 1250 grams who were successfully intubated at birth. The trial compared lucinactant, a synthetic surfactant containing a SP-B mimic with phospholipids with poractant alfa, a porcine lung extract containing phospholipids and porcine surfactant proteins. The trial is not included in this review as it did not have an arm that included a non-protein containing synthetic surfactant.</P>

<P>Methodological quality of included studies:</P>
<P>Trials were evaluated for their methodological quality in terms of concealment of allocation, masking of intervention, completeness of follow-up, and masking of outcome assessment. Details are given in the table "Characteristics of Included Studies" and the Risk of Bias table.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Moya-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Moya 2005</LINK>
</P>
<P>In the initial trial of Moya and coworkers (<LINK REF="STD-Moya-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Moya 2005</LINK>), infants were randomised in a masked manner to receive lucinactant, colfosceril palmitate, or beractant in a 2:2:1 ratio, with randomizations stratified according to birthweight (600 - 800 grams; 801 - 1000 grams; 1001 - 1250 grams). Birthweight stratum randomizations codes were computer-generated by an independent university-based statistical center. Each participating institution received sealed envelopes with randomizations codes to be opened sequentially.</P>
<P>To mask the intervention, the identity of the surfactant assignment was not known to the neonatologists, staff, or families, but only to those who prepared and administered the drugs. These individuals included nurses, respiratory therapists, and pharmacists who were trained in administering surfactant, but who worked in other areas of the hospital. Following the surfactant preparation and/or administration, these individuals did not further participate in the management of the infants nor did they unblind the intervention. All treatments were administered in four aliquots using syringes covered with adhesive opaque paper. In cases of dosing interval discrepancy between the three surfactants, sham air was administered. </P>
<P>1294 infants (527 lucinactant, 509 colfosceril palmitate, and 258 beractant) were randomised. Six infants (three lucinactant, three colfosceril palmitate) comprising 0.46% of the total randomised population were not dosed with any surfactant. Four patients received the incorrect treatment. One patient assigned to receive beractant received lucinactant and another patient assigned to receive beractant received colfosceril palmitate. Two patients assigned to receive colfosceril palmitate received beractant. Infants were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. 522 of 527 of the lucinactant treated infants, 505 of 509 of the colfosceril palmitate treated infants, and all 258 beractant treated infants were followed and either died or were accounted for at the final evaluation, which took place at 36 weeks postmenstrual age. </P>
<P>Clinicians providing care to study infants remained blinded to surfactant assignment throughout their initial NICU hospitalizations and through one year corrected age. An independent adjudication committee, masked to surfactant group assignment, used clinical and radiological data to ascertain whether prespecified criteria were met for the authors&#8217; definitions of the primary outcomes, RDS at 24 hours or death from RDS at 14 days. In addition, two secondary outcomes, airleaks and cause of death, were evaluated by the independent adjudication committee. </P>
<P>In the follow-up report of Moya 2007 that analyzed survival, pulmonary, and neurologic outcomes through one year corrected age, clinicians involved in the follow-up procedures were similarly blind to surfactant assignment.</P>
<P>Of the 1036 infants who were to receive either a protein containing synthetic surfactant or a protein-free synthetic surfactant from the original study, 288 died and 18 either were lost to follow-up or withdrew consent from the study. 1018 were either known to have died or were available for follow-up at one year corrected age. Of these, 730 infant survivors were available for follow-up at one year corrected age and 585 (80%) of these infants had a neurologic evaluation. </P>
<P>
<B>Subgroup Analysis</B> </P>
<P>The single prophylaxis study that met inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Moya-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Moya 2005</LINK>) did not report subgroups based on gestational age and, therefore, no subgroup analyses could be performed.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-08-11 09:10:29 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Both animal derived surfactant extracts and synthetic surfactant preparations containing only phospholipids have been shown to be beneficial in the treatment and prevention of neonatal RDS. Although greater efficacy of the animal derived surfactant extracts has been demonstrated, the synthetic surfactant preparations have been shown to cause statistically significant reductions in rates of pneumothorax, pulmonary interstitial emphysema, and mortality when given as prophylaxis (<LINK REF="REF-Soll-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soll 1992</LINK>). The clinical differences in outcomes noted between the animal derived surfactant extracts and the protein free synthetic surfactants suggests an important role of surfactant protein. Newer synthetic surfactants that include surfactant protein or peptide mimics have recently been developed, introduced, and tested. Hypothetical benefits of these protein (or peptide) containing synthetic surfactants include increased resistance to inactivation, freedom from the need of an animal reservoir, less infectious risk, less risk of inflammation and immunogenicity, less batch-to-batch variability and potentially lower cost. Potential limitations of the utility of protein (or peptide) containing synthetic surfactants include unknown cost, involved preparation process, and drug tolerability. </P>
<P>Lucinactant is currently the only peptide containing synthetic surfactant that has been tested in human neonatal clinical trials. The efficacy of lucinactant compared to protein-free synthetic surfactant extracts in the prevention of neonatal RDS has been evaluated in a well-conducted randomized, double blinded, controlled multicenter trial. Lucinactant was compared to a commercially approved protein-free synthetic surfactant, colfosceril palmitate, composed of DPPC (~84%), cetyl alcohol, and tyloxapol (<LINK REF="STD-Moya-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Moya 2005</LINK>). In this study, a third group received beractant, a bovine lung extract containing phospholipids and bovine surfactant proteins. This comparison is not included in this review. Inclusion criteria were a gestational age 24 - 32 weeks, a birth weight between 600 g and 1250 g, and successful endotracheal intubation (<LINK REF="STD-Moya-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Moya 2005</LINK>). Lucinactant was administered intratracheally within 20 - 30 minutes of birth. Exclusion criteria were reasonable: Apgar score of less than three at five minutes, congenital malformations, chorioamnionitis, or cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the delivery room. The trial had adequate sample size: 1294 infants were analyzed based on the intention-to-treat principle (<LINK REF="STD-Moya-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Moya 2005</LINK>). </P>
<P>No statistically significant differences were noted in the primary outcomes of interest, although a trend towards decreased incidence of chronic lung disease was noted in the group that received protein containing synthetic surfactant at both 28 days and at 36 weeks postmenstrual age. Additionally trends were noted towards decreased incidence of the combined outcomes of death or chronic lung disease at both 28 days and at 36 weeks postmenstrual age. No statistically significant differences between infants who received protein-free synthetic surfactant and protein containing synthetic surfactant were noted in incidence of neonatal mortality at any follow-up interval. </P>
<P>The recently developed protein containing synthetic surfactant is meant to function in a fashion similar to endogenous and animal derived surfactant pulmonary surfactants. Previous meta-analysis comparing trials of animal derived surfactant extract to protein-free synthetic surfactant (<LINK REF="REF-Soll-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soll 2001</LINK>) demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in rates of pneumothorax. While pneumothorax rates alone were not reported, this meta-analysis of protein containing synthetic surfactant compared to protein-free synthetic surfactant did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference in the combined incidence of all varieties of air leak syndromes (pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, PIE). A statistically significant decrease in the rates of RDS at 24 hours was demonstrated in those infants who received a protein containing synthetic surfactant compared those who received a protein-free synthetic surfactant (<LINK REF="STD-Moya-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Moya 2005</LINK>). The determination of both of these two outcomes, RDS at 24 hours and the presence of airleaks, was determined by an independent adjudication committee, masked to surfactant group assignment, which used clinical and radiological data to ascertain whether criteria were met for the authors&#8217; prespecified definitions. </P>
<P>No data have been reported on mortality or neurodevelopmental outcomes at two years corrected age. However follow up data on deafness, blindness, and mortality at one year were presented and have been analyzed <I>post-hoc</I>. No statistically significant differences were noted at one year of age in the rates of blindness, deafness, or mortality in those infants who received a protein containing synthetic surfactant compared those who received protein-free synthetic surfactant. </P>
<P>In a well-controlled trial for prevention of RDS, lucinactant has shown clinical efficacy in improving survival and decreasing complications of prematurity similar to animal derived surfactants (<LINK REF="STD-Sinha-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sinha 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pfister-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pfister 2007</LINK>). No significant differences in our prespecified primary outcomes were noted between infants who received a protein containing synthetic surfactants and a protein-free synthetic surfactants although a trend towards decreased chronic lung disease was noted with use of protein containing synthetic surfactant. A statistically significant decrease in the incidence of RDS at 24 hours was associated with the use of protein containing synthetic surfactant. More well designed studies of adequate size and power are needed to evaluate the effects of these new surfactant preparations.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-08-04 18:09:21 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Intratracheal administration of protein-free synthetic surfactant has been previously shown to be effective in decreasing risk of pneumothorax, pulmonary interstitial emphysema, and neonatal mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Soll-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soll 2001</LINK>). The lone study that compared protein containing synthetic surfactant to protein-free synthetic surfactant identified in this review suggests that the protein containing synthetic surfactant lucinactant decreases the severity of RDS and may or may not help decrease the risk of CLD. Contemporarily, most infants are treated with surfactant extracts from mammalian derivation which have been shown to be superior to protein-free synthetic surfactant due to decreased mortality, reduced severity of RDS, decreased likelihood of pneumothorax, and increased survival without chronic lung disease (<LINK REF="REF-Soll-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soll 1992</LINK>). A companion review has been performed that compares the outcomes of infants given protein containing synthetic surfactant compared to animal derived suractant extracts (<LINK REF="REF-Pfister-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pfister 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>While protein containing synthetic surfactant holds great promise of improved efficacy when compared to existing protein-free synthetic surfactants, they are not currently approved for use. In addition, no studies are available using protein containing synthetic surfactants to treat existing disease. Further studies will be needed to refine these estimates prior to any specific recommendations regarding their use in lieu of animal-derived surfactants.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-07-13 18:21:37 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Future independent studies of adequate size and power are needed to precisely compare the effect of protein containing synthetic surfactants to the widely used animal derivied surfactant preparations. The sample size should be structured to evaluate differences between important clinical outcomes such as mortality and chronic lung disease. This should include trials of other synthetic surfactants with mimics of surfactant proteins B and C.</P>
