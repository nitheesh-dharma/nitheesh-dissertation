<P>Intravenous oxytocin and amniotomy compares well with other forms used in the third trimester (full term) to bring on labour.</P>
<P>Sometimes it is necessary to help get labour started. There are several methods used and they either ripen the cervix or make the uterus start contracting. Oxytocin is a drug used to stimulate contractions of the uterus. Amniotomy (breaking the waters) helps bring on contractions. The review of trials found that oxytocin combined with amniotomy compares well with other forms of labour induction. However, adverse risks of amniotomy include pain and discomfort, bleeding, possible infection in the uterus and a decreased heart rate in the baby. The risk of infection following amniotomy is particularly important in areas where HIV is prevalent.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Induction of labour is a common obstetric intervention. Amniotomy alone for induction of labour is reviewed separately and oxytocin alone for induction of labour is being prepared for inclusion in The Cochrane Library. This review will address the use of the combination of these two methods for induction of labour in the third trimester. This is one of a series of reviews of methods of cervical ripening and labour induction using standardised methodology.</P>

<P>We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register and reference lists of articles were searched. Date of last search: May 2001. We updated the search of the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register on 21 September 2009 and added the results to the awaiting classification section of the review.</P>

<P>Clinical trials comparing amniotomy plus intravenous oxytocin used for third trimester cervical ripening or labour induction with placebo/no treatment or other methods listed above it on a predefined list of labour induction methods.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Trial quality assessment and data extraction were done by both reviewers. A strategy was developed to deal with the large volume and complexity of trial data relating to labour induction. This involved a two-stage method of data extraction. The initial data extraction was done centrally, and incorporated into a series of primary reviews arranged by methods of induction of labour, following a standardised methodology. The data is to be extracted from the primary reviews into a series of secondary reviews, arranged by category of woman. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Seventeen trials involving 2566 women were included. Amniotomy and intravenous oxytocin were found to result in fewer women being undelivered vaginally at 24 hours than amniotomy alone (relative risk (RR) 0.03, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.001-0.49). This finding was based on the results of a single study of 100 women. As regards secondary results amniotomy and intravenous oxytocin resulted in significantly fewer instrumental vaginal deliveries than placebo (RR 0.18, CI 0.05-0.58). Amniotomy and intravenous oxytocin resulted in more postpartum haemorrhage than vaginal prostaglandins (RR 5.5, CI 1.26-24.07). Significantly more women were also dissatisfied with amniotomy and intravenous oxytocin when compared with vaginal prostaglandins, RR 53, CI 3.32-846.51.<BR/> </P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-09-21 11:10:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Data on the effectiveness and safety of amniotomy and intravenous oxytocin are lacking. No recommendations for clinical practice can be made on the basis of this review. Amniotomy and intravenous oxytocin is a combination of two methods of induction of labour and both methods are utilised in clinical practice. If their use is to be continued it is important to compare the effectiveness and safety of these methods, and to define under which clinical circumstances one may be preferable to another.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2009-09-21 11:14:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Induction of labour is a common obstetric intervention which is usually undertaken for a clinical indication, however rightly or wrongly, it may also be undertaken for other reasons, such as a woman's request or clinician's convenience. This review is one of a series of reviews of methods of labour induction using a standardised protocol. For more detailed information on the rationale for this methodological approach, please refer to the currently published 'generic' protocol (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2000</LINK>). The generic protocol describes how a number of standardised reviews will be combined to compare various methods of preparing the cervix of the uterus and inducing labour.</P>
<P>Amniotomy alone for induction of labour and intravenous oxytocin alone for cervical ripening and induction of labour are reviewed separately (<LINK REF="REF-Bricker-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bricker 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tan-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tan 2001</LINK>). This review will address the two in combination. Concomitant administration is regarded when the two are initiated within two hours of each other, irrespective of which is initiated first.</P>

<LI>intravenous oxytocin and amniotomy versus amniotomy.</LI>
</OL>
<P>In the studies of oxytocin and amniotomy versus prostaglandins, the prostaglandins used were PGE2(1-2mg) in a gel preparation; vaginal pessaries(3mg); PGE2 tablets(3mg); PGE2 in methyl hydroxyethyl cellulose gel(400ug); and PGF2 alpha(50mg).</P>
<P>The oxytocin dosage used varied between studies with a most common maximum dosage of 32 mU/min (16 mU/min-40 mU/min), flow rate doubled half hourly, with 5% Dextrose in Water used as administration fluid.</P>
<P>Amniotomy and intravenous oxytocin were considered as concomitant if the amniotomy was performed within two hours from the start of the oxytocin infusion or vice versa. This time interval was determined before evaluation of studies for inclusion into the review was commenced and was agreed upon by both reviewers. In most studies the two interventions were commenced simultaneously but in five studies this was not specified (<LINK REF="STD-Saleh-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Saleh 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thompson-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martin-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ratnam-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Ratnam 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 1978</LINK>). In two studies failure to rupture the membranes occurred (<LINK REF="STD-Maclennan-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Maclennan 1989</LINK>, two women; <LINK REF="STD-Orhue-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Orhue 1995</LINK>, nine women). Amniotomy was, however, successful after oxytocin administration for one to two hours prior to amniotomy.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>Clinically relevant outcomes for trials of methods of cervical ripening/labour induction have been prespecified by two authors of labour induction reviews (Justus Hofmeyr and Zarko Alfirevic). Differences were settled by discussion.</P>
<P>Five primary outcomes were chosen as being most representative of the clinically important measures of effectiveness and complications. Sub-group analyses were limited to the primary outcomes: <BR/>(1) vaginal delivery not achieved within 24 hours;<BR/>(2) uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate (FHR) changes;<BR/>(3) caesarean section;<BR/>(4) serious neonatal morbidity or perinatal death (e.g. seizures, birth asphyxia defined by trialists, neonatal encephalopathy, disability in childhood); <BR/>(5) serious maternal morbidity or death (e.g. uterine rupture, admission to intensive care unit, septicaemia. </P>
<P>Secondary outcomes relate to measures of effectiveness, complications and satisfaction:</P>
<P>Measures of effectiveness:<BR/>(6) cervix unfavourable/unchanged after 12-24 hours;<BR/>(7) oxytocin augmentation.</P>
<P>Complications:<BR/>(8) uterine hyperstimulation without FHR changes;<BR/>(9) uterine rupture;<BR/>(10) epidural analgesia;<BR/>(11) instrumental vaginal delivery;<BR/>(12) meconium stained liquor;<BR/>(13) Apgar score &lt; 7 at 5 minutes;<BR/>(14) neonatal intensive care unit admission;<BR/>(15) neonatal encephalopathy;<BR/>(16) perinatal death;<BR/>(17) disability in childhood;<BR/>(18) maternal side effects (all);<BR/>(19) maternal nausea;<BR/>(20) maternal vomiting;<BR/>(21) maternal diarrhoea;<BR/>(22) other maternal side-effects;<BR/>(23) postpartum haemorrhage (as defined by the trial authors);<BR/>(24) serious maternal complications (e.g. intensive care unit admission, septicaemia but excluding uterine rupture);<BR/>(25) maternal death.</P>
<P>Measures of satisfaction:<BR/>(26) woman not satisfied;<BR/>(27) caregiver not satisfied.</P>
<P>While all the above outcomes were sought, only those with data appear in the analysis tables.</P>
<P>The terminology of uterine hyperstimulation is problematic (<LINK REF="REF-Curtis-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curtis 1987</LINK>). In the reviews we will use the term 'uterine hyperstimulation without FHR changes 'to include uterine tachysystole (&gt; 5 contractions per 10 minutes for at least 20 minutes) and uterine hypersystole/hypertonus (a contraction lasting at least two minutes) and 'uterine hyperstimulation with FHR changes' to denote uterine hyperstimulation syndrome (tachysystole or hypersystole with fetal heart rate changes such as persistent decelerations, tachycardia or decreased short term variability).</P>
<P>Outcomes were included in the analysis: if reasonable measures were taken to minimise observer bias; missing data were insufficient to materially influence conclusions and data were available for analysis according to original allocation.</P>

<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Trials under consideration were evaluated for methodological quality and appropriateness for inclusion according to the prestated selection criteria, without consideration of their results. Allocation concealment was scored as A: adequate (e.g. double blind, placebo controlled; envelopes administered centrally) B: unclear (e.g. numbered sealed envelopes not administered centrally) C: inadequate e.g. alternation). Individual outcome data were included in the analysis if they met the presented criteria in 'Types of outcome measures'. Included trial data were processed as described in <LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2000</LINK>.</P>
<P>Data were extracted from the sources and entered onto the Review Manager computer software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2000</LINK>), checked for accuracy, and analysed as above using the RevMan software. For dichotomous data, relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were calculated, and in the absence of heterogeneity, results were pooled using a fixed effects model. The predefined criteria for sensitivity analysis were: trial quality assessment and interval between amniotomy and commencement of oxytocin. </P>
<P>Primary analysis was limited to the prespecified outcomes and sub-group analyses. In the event of differences in unspecified outcomes or sub-groups being found, these were analysed post hoc, but clearly identified as such to avoid drawing unjustified conclusions.</P>

<P>(i) Primary outcomes:<BR/>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Martin-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 1978</LINK>), with 184 participants, evaluated serious neonatal morbidity or mortality. There was no serious neonatal morbidity or mortality in the amniotomy and intravenous oxytocin group and 1(1.08%) case in the placebo group, relative risk (RR) 0.33, confidence interval (CI) 0.01-8.08. Although statistically there is no difference between the groups, the data should be interpreted with caution as this is a rare outcome and the confidence intervals are wide.</P>
<P>(ii) Other outcomes:<BR/> A significant reduction in the amount of meconium stained liquor was found in the oxytocin and amniotomy group with 3 (3.3% ) cases in the amniotomy and oxytocin group and 13 (14.2% ) cases in the expectant group, RR 0.23, CI 0.068-0.783.<BR/> <BR/>Amniotomy and intravenous oxytocin versus vaginal prostaglandins - all women.</P>
<P>(i) Primary outcomes:<BR/>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1993</LINK>) that included 42 participants, all of who had had previous caesarean sections, found that there was no difference in vaginal delivery not achieved in 24 hours.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Despite the fact that amniotomy and intravenous oxytocin appear to be widely used for induction of labour, surprisingly little research has been done in this area. Due to the paucity of information, firm conclusions cannot be drawn on the use of amniotomy and intravenous oxytocin for the induction of labour.</P>
<P>No single study addressed all the primary outcomes and no conclusions can be made as regards primary outcomes. Two studies that included 550 women, reported more postpartum haemorrhage in the amniotomy and intravenous oxytocin group compared with women induced with vaginal prostaglandins. One study that included 100 women, reported more women were not satisfied with amniotomy and intravenous oxytocin than vaginal prostaglandins. While interesting, the small sample sizes preclude a definitive conclusion.</P>
<P>This review did not evaluate comparisons between different methods of oxytocin administration and dosages and these studies have therefore been excluded (<LINK REF="STD-Mercer-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Mercer 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Arulkumaran-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Arulkumaran 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thomas-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Calder-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Calder 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chua-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Chua 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Orhue-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Orhue 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Orhue-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Orhue 1993b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Orhue-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Orhue 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pavlou-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Pavlou 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pavlou-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Pavlou 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reid--1995" TYPE="STUDY">Reid 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steer-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Steer 1985</LINK>). It is however important to evaluate this in a separate review as the success of oxytocin induction may be dependant on the method of oxytocin administration, as it has not been standardised in the studies included in this review. </P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-09-21 11:10:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Although amniotomy and intravenous oxytocin have been used widely in obstetric practice, the available literature does not clearly support or refute the value of using the combination instead of the separate methods individually. </P>
<P>Data on the effectiveness and safety of amniotomy and intravenous oxytocin are lacking. No recommendations for clinical practice can be made on the basis of this review. Cognizance however must be taken of the possibility of increased perinatal transmission of HIV following amniotomy (<LINK REF="REF-Biggar-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Biggar 1996</LINK>) particularly in areas where the prevalence of HIV may be high and due to limited resources or other reasons HIV status of the woman is unknown.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-09-21 11:10:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite the paucity of data, there is probably little role for further research into the use of the combination of amniotomy and intravenous oxytocin as a primary method of induction. In clinical settings where resources are limited, amniotomy alone may be the favoured method of induction.</P>
<P>Amniotomy may also be the favoured method of induction in women not keen on pharmacological intervention or in cases where avoiding uterine stimulation may be advantageous. Under these circumstances we concur with Bricker and Luckas (<LINK REF="REF-Bricker-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bricker 2001</LINK>) that it is reasonable to recommend that further research into the method of amniotomy alone for the induction of labour is needed, and would urge researchers to evaluate this method in the context of different time intervals between the primary (amniotomy) and secondary intervention (addition of a pharmaceutical agent and with reference to this review, the use of intravenous oxytocin).</P>
<P>This research should include assessment of women and caregiver satisfaction and economic analysis. The suggestion from this review that oxytocin may be associated with greater risk of postpartum haemorrhage than prostaglandin, warrants further research.</P>
