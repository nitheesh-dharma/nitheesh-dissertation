<P>When a mother's own breast milk is not available for feeding her preterm or low birth weight infant, the alternatives are either formula or expressed breast milk from a donor mother ('donor breast milk'). This review of nine randomised controlled trials suggests that feeding with formula increases short-term growth rates, but is associated with a higher risk of developing the severe gut disorder called 'necrotising enterocolitis'. There is no evidence of an effect on longer-term growth or on development. Further trials that compare these two strategies are needed. These should probably compare formula adapted for preterm infants with donor breast milk supplemented with extra nutrients.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-03-31 12:42:07 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nine trials, in which 1070 infants participated, fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Four trials compared standard term formula versus donor breast milk and five compared nutrient-enriched preterm formula versus donor breast milk. Only the two most recent trials used nutrient-fortified donor breast milk. The trials contain various methodological quality weaknesses, specifically uncertainty about adequate allocation concealment methods in three trials and lack of blinding in most of the trials.</P>
<P>Formula-fed infants had higher in hospital rates of increase in weight [mean difference (MD): 2.58 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.98 to 3.71) g/kg/day], length [MD 1.93 (95% CI 1.23 to 2.62) mm/week] and head circumference [MD 1.59 (95% CI 0.95 to 2.24) mm/week]. We did not find evidence of an effect on post-discharge growth rates or neurodevelopmental outcomes. Formula feeding increased the risk of necrotising enterocolitis: typical risk ratio 2.77 (95% CI 1.40 to 5.46); risk difference 0.04 (95% CI 0.02 to 0.07).</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-06-19 11:37:37 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In preterm and low birth weight infants, feeding with formula compared with donor breast milk results in a higher rate of short-term growth but also a higher risk of developing necrotising enterocolitis. Limited data on the comparison of feeding with formula versus nutrient-fortified donor breast milk are available. This limits the applicability of the findings of this review as nutrient fortification of breast milk is now a common practice in neonatal care. Future trials may compare growth, development and adverse outcomes in infants who receive formula milk versus nutrient-fortified donor breast milk given as a supplement to maternal expressed breast milk or as a sole diet.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2014-03-31 12:47:44 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-03-31 12:44:42 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Maternal breast milk is the recommended form of enteral nutrition for preterm or low birth weight (LBW) infants. Breast milk contains non-nutrient factors including immunoglobulins that may promote intestinal adaptation and maturation, improve enteral feed tolerance, and protect against infective and inflammatory disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Agostoni-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agostoni 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>When sufficient maternal breast milk is not available, the two common alternatives available for feeding preterm or LBW infants are artificial formula and donor breast milk (donated by other lactating women). These may be given either as the sole form of enteral feeding or as a supplement to maternal breast milk.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-03-26 07:26:06 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Providing appropriate nutrition for preterm or LBW infants is a critical component of neonatal care. Early enteral nutrition, particularly the use of donor breast milk or formula, may have a substantial impact on clinically important outcomes such as necrotising enterocolitis, invasive infection and short-term growth. These infectious and inflammatory complications may increase the risk of mortality and other morbidities and adversely affect long-term growth and neurodevelopmental outcomes.<BR/>
</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-03-31 12:44:42 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A variety of artificial formulas (usually adapted from cow's milk) are available. These vary in energy, protein and mineral content but can, broadly, be considered as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>standard 'term' formula, designed for term infants based on the composition of mature breast milk: the typical energy content is between about 67 to 70 kcal/100 ml;</LI>
<LI>nutrient-enriched 'preterm' formula, designed to provide nutrient intakes to match intrauterine accretion rates (<LINK REF="REF-Tsang-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tsang 1993</LINK>): these are energy-enriched (typically up to about 80 kcal/100 ml) and variably protein- and mineral-enriched (<LINK REF="REF-Fewtrell-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fewtrell 1999</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>The comparison arm for the intervention is donor breast milk. Expressed breast milk from donor mothers, usually mothers who have delivered at term, generally has a lower content of energy and protein than term formula milk (<LINK REF="REF-Gross-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gross 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gross-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gross 1981</LINK>). The nutrient content of donor breast milk may be further compromised by pasteurisation (<LINK REF="REF-Wight-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wight 2001</LINK>). Donor human milk also varies with regard to fat, energy and protein content depending upon the stage of lactation at which it is collected. Milk expressed from the donor's lactating breast usually has a higher energy and protein content than that collected from the contralateral breast ('drip' breast milk) (<LINK REF="REF-Lucas-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucas 1978</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-03-26 07:26:06 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is concern that the nutritional requirements of preterm or LBW infants, who are born with relatively impoverished nutrient reserves and are subject to additional metabolic stresses compared with term infants, may not be fully met by enteral feeding with donor breast milk (<LINK REF="REF-Hay-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hay 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schanler-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schanler 1995</LINK>). These deficiencies may have adverse consequences for growth and development. However, a major putative benefit of donor breast milk is that the delivery of immuno-protective and growth factors to the immature gut mucosa may prevent serious adverse outcomes, including necrotising enterocolitis and invasive infection (<LINK REF="REF-Beeby-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beeby 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lucas-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucas 1990</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-03-26 07:26:06 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Given the potential for the type of enteral nutrition to affect important outcomes for preterm or LBW infants, and since uncertainty exists about the balance between the putative benefits and harms, an attempt to detect, appraise and synthesise evidence from randomised controlled trials is merited.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2014-03-31 10:41:06 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-03-27 13:19:17 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found nine randomised controlled trials in which 1070 preterm or low birth weight infants participated. Preterm or low birth weight infants who receive formula regain birth weight earlier and have higher short-term rates of weight gain, linear growth and head growth than infants who receive donor breast milk. These effects on growth parameters are greater in trials that compare feeding with nutrient-enriched preterm formula compared to standard term formula versus donor breast milk. Follow-up of the infants who participated in two of the largest trials did not find any statistically significant effects on long-term growth parameters or neurodevelopmental outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Lucas-1984a" TYPE="STUDY">Lucas 1984a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lucas-1984b" TYPE="STUDY">Lucas 1984b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Meta-analysis of data from six trials suggests that feeding with formula significantly increases the risk of feeding intolerance and necrotising enterocolitis in preterm and low birth weight infants. The pooled estimate suggests that one extra case of necrotising enterocolitis will occur in every 25 infants who receive formula.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-03-31 10:41:06 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>These findings should be interpreted with caution. Substantial heterogeneity in the meta-analyses of the effect on growth parameters limits the validity of the pooled estimates of effect size. Most of these trials were undertaken more than 20 years ago and the trials used different inclusion criteria and varied with respect to the type of formula and donor breast milk used. Only two trials were undertaken in the past 15 years and only these trials compared feeding with formula versus donor breast milk with added multi-nutrient fortifier (<LINK REF="STD-Schanler-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Schanler 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cristofalo-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Cristofalo 2013</LINK>). This limits the applicability of the findings to current practice, where nutrient fortification of breast milk is commonly undertaken (<LINK REF="REF-Klingenberg-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klingenberg 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Meta-analysis of data from six trials suggests that feeding with formula more than doubles the risk of necrotising enterocolitis. The observed effect sizes were similar across the trials and there was no statistical evidence of heterogeneity. The pooled estimate suggests that one extra case of necrotising enterocolitis will occur in every 25 infants who receive formula. This beneficial effect of donor breast milk exists even when donor breast milk is given as a supplement to maternal breast milk rather than as a sole diet and also when the donor breast milk is fortified. However, only one of the trials was able to blind caregivers and assessors to the intervention. This methodological weakness may have resulted in surveillance and ascertainment biases that contributed to the higher rate of detection of necrotising enterocolitis in formula-fed infants. Finally, caution should be exercised in applying these data to growth-restricted preterm infants or sick infants, since these infants, although at high risk of developing necrotising enterocolitis, were generally excluded from the included trials.</P>
<P>The data in this review are from trials undertaken in high-income countries. In low- or middle-incomes countries, the anti-infective properties of breast milk may confer advantages that outweigh the lower rate of short-term growth. In India, a randomised trial in low birth weight infants "at risk of infection" found that serious infections (diarrhoea, pneumonia, septicaemia) were statistically significantly less common in infants allocated to received "expressed human milk" versus formula milk (<LINK REF="STD-Narayanan-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Narayanan 1982</LINK>). "Expressed human milk" in this study referred to a mixture of maternal and donor breast milk. As these could not be separated into subgroups, the data were not included in the review.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-03-27 13:26:12 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The trials contain various methodological quality weaknesses, specifically uncertainty about adequate allocation concealment methods in three trials and lack of blinding in most of the trials. Parents, caregivers, clinicians and investigators were likely to have been aware of the treatment group to which infants had been allocated and this knowledge may have affected some care practices or investigation strategies including thresholds for screening or diagnosing for necrotising enterocolitis, which may have affected the outcomes assessed.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2014-03-26 07:26:06 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The main concern with the review process is the possibility that the findings are subject to publication and other reporting biases, including more availability of numerical data for inclusion in meta-analyses from trials that reported statistically significant or clinically important effects. We attempted to minimise this threat by screening the reference lists of included trials and related reviews and searching the proceedings of the major international perinatal conferences to identify trial reports that are not (or not yet) published in full form in academic journals. However, we cannot be sure whether other trials have been undertaken but not reported and the concern remains that such trials are less likely than published trials to have detected statistically significant or clinically important effects. The meta-analyses that we performed did not contain sufficient trials to explore symmetry of funnel plots as a means of identifying possible publication or reporting bias.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-03-27 13:27:55 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-03-27 13:27:21 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Feeding with formula compared with donor breast milk may increase rates of short-term growth in preterm or low birth weight infants but is associated with a doubling of the risk of developing necrotising enterocolitis. There are only limited data from randomised trials on the comparison of feeding with formula milk versus nutrient-fortified human milk. This limits the implications for practice from this review as nutrient fortification of human milk is now a common practice in neonatal care.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-03-27 13:27:55 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further randomised controlled trials are needed to assess the effect of feeding preterm or low birth weight infants with formula versus donor breast milk in situations where the expressed breast milk of the infant's mother is not consistently available. Future studies should probably compare enteral feeding with formula milk versus nutrient-fortified donor breast milk in a population of infants at increased risk of necrotising enterocolitis. Separate comparisons of formula versus donor breast milk as supplements to maternal expressed breast milk and as sole diets are warranted since their effects may vary. Trials should attempt to ensure that caregivers and assessors are blind to the intervention. Although more easily achievable for the longer-term assessments, this is also important with regard to ascertainment of adverse events, such as feeding intolerance and necrotising enterocolitis, where the threshold for investigation or diagnosis may be affected by knowledge of the intervention.</P>

<P>We revised the structure of the review in 2007. We now include:<BR/>1. Trials that compared feeding with formula milk with either term or preterm donor breast milk (inception protocol and review restricted to term breast milk).<BR/>2. Trials that compared feeding with formula versus donor breast milk as a sole diet or as a supplement to maternal expressed breast milk (inception protocol and review restricted to sole diet).<BR/>

Subsequently the volume of fortified human milk was advanced by 20 ml/kg/day until 160 ml/kg/day was achieved. If no mother's milk was available and the baby was assigned to donor breast milk then a similar advancement and fortification protocol was followed. For all infants, adjustments in milk intake between 160 and 200 ml/kg/day were recommended to ensure an average weekly weight gain of at least 15 g/kg per day<BR/>17 enrolled infants were switched from donor breast milk to preterm formula because of poor weight gain but all of these analyses were by intention-to-treat.

The randomised blocked design was followed strictly at first, but in the second year, many of the low birth weight infants were allocated to one of the human milk groups (rather than the formula group). Hence, the data for year 1 are completely random (all 4 groups can be compared and be included in our review), but the data for year 2 (and beyond) were not completely random (and should not be included). The authors reported that the results in the random and "non-random" phases were similar and therefore presented the combined results.
