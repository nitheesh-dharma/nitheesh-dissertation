<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-05-20 14:03:44 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Anaemia (having too few red blood cells) is a major cause of tiredness and other problems often experienced by people on dialysis. Dialysis is treatment for kidney disease using an artificial kidney machine (haemodialysis) or by exchanging fluid through a tube in the abdomen (peritoneal dialysis).</P>
<P>Manufactured erythropoietin (a hormone that increases red blood cell production) improves anaemia and is often prescribed for people on dialysis. Several different forms of manufactured erythropoietin that can be given less often are now available.</P>
<P>We looked at evidence from 33 studies that involved over 5500 people that were published before March 2013 to find out if how often erythropoietin agents are given to people who are receiving dialysis can help to improve anaemia.</P>
<P>We found that the newer erythropoietin agents given less often (weekly to every four weeks) resulted in similar correction of anaemia compared with older agents (given two to three times per week) for people on haemodialysis. We did not find any significant differences in side effects between the newer and older agents, but not all studies reported information on side effects.</P>
<P>There was not enough information about use of these agents for children or people on peritoneal dialysis to determine if less frequent administration was effective for these groups of people.</P>
<P>This review updates information previously published in 2002 and 2005.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-05-19 20:29:27 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The benefits of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) for dialysis patients have been demonstrated. However, it remains unclear whether the efficacy and safety of new, longer-acting ESA given less frequently is equivalent to recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) preparations. This is an update of a review first published in 2002 and last updated in 2005.</P>

<P>This review aimed to establish the optimal frequency of ESA administration in terms of effectiveness (correction of anaemia, and freedom from adverse events) and efficiency (optimal resource use) of different ESA dose regimens.</P>

<P>We included randomised control trials (RCTs) comparing different frequencies of ESA administration in dialysis patients.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-09-25 16:08:26 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two authors independently assessed study eligibility, risk of bias and extracted data. Results were expressed as risk ratio (RR) or risk differences (RD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes. For continuous outcomes the mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was used. Statistical analyses were performed using the random-effects model.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-10-30 12:33:17 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Elisabeth M Hodson">
<P>This review included 33 studies (5526 participants), 22 of which were added for this update. Risk of bias was generally high; only nine studies were assessed at low risk of bias for sequence generation and 14 studies for allocation concealment. Although only four studies were placebo-controlled, all were considered to be at low risk of performance or detection bias because the primary outcome of haemoglobin level was a laboratory-derived assessment and unlikely to be influenced by lack of blinding. We found that 16 studies were at low risk of attrition bias and five were at low risk of selection bias; only one study reporting sources of support was not funded by a pharmaceutical company.</P>
<P>We compared four different interventions: Continuous erythropoietin receptor agonists (CERA) versus other ESA (darbepoetin or rHuEPO); different frequencies of darbepoetin administration; darbepoetin versus rHuEPO; and different frequencies of rHuEPO administration.</P>
<P>There were no significant differences in maintaining final haemoglobin between CERA administered at two weekly intervals (4 studies, 1762 participants: MD 0.08 g/dL, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.21) or four weekly intervals (two studies, 1245 participants: MD -0.03 g/dL, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.12) compared with rHuEPO administered at two to three weekly intervals. In one study comparing CERA administered every two weeks with darbepoetin administered once/week, there was no significant difference in final haemoglobin (313 participants: MD 0.30 g/dL, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.55). In comparisons of once/week with once every two weeks darbepoetin (two studies, 356 participants: MD 0.04 g/dL, 95% CI -0.45 to 0.52) and once every two weeks with monthly darbepoetin (one study, 64 participants: MD 0.40 g/dL, 95% CI -0.37 to 1.17) there were no significant differences in final haemoglobin levels. There was marked heterogeneity among studies comparing weekly darbepoetin with once every two weeks and was possibly related to different administration protocols. Eight studies compared weekly darbepoetin with rHuEPO given two to three times/week; no statistical difference in final haemoglobin was demonstrated (6 studies, 1638 participants: MD 0.02 g/dL, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.12). Fourteen studies compared different frequencies of rHuEPO. No statistical difference was demonstrated in final haemoglobin (7 studies, 393 participants: SMD -0.17 g/dL, 95% CI -0.39 to 0.05). Adverse events did not differ significantly within comparisons; however, mortality and quality of life were poorly reported, particularly in earlier publications.<BR/>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-05-20 14:13:22 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Longer-acting ESA (darbepoetin and CERA) administered at one to four week intervals are non-inferior to rHuEPO given one to three times/week in terms of achieving haemoglobin targets without any significant differences in adverse events in haemodialysis patients. Additional RCTs are required to evaluate different frequencies of ESA in peritoneal and paediatric dialysis patients and to compare different longer-acting ESA (such as darbepoetin compared with CERA).</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-05-20 15:02:30 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Anaemia is a condition very often encountered among people with chronic kidney disease (CKD). There is a direct relationship between anaemia severity and decline in kidney function (<LINK REF="REF-Koch-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koch 1991</LINK>). Anaemia results in significant morbidity causing symptoms including lack of energy, breathlessness, dizziness, angina, poor appetite and decreased exercise tolerance (<LINK REF="REF-Canadian-EPO-1990a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Canadian EPO 1990a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lundin-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lundin 1989</LINK>). Decreased production of erythropoietin, a naturally occurring hormone mainly produced by the kidney, is the major cause of anaemia among people with CKD (<LINK REF="REF-Jensen-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jensen 1994</LINK>). Improvement in energy levels (<LINK REF="REF-Wolcott-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolcott 1989</LINK>), increased cardiac performance and ejection fraction (<LINK REF="REF-Pappas-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pappas 2008</LINK>), and normalisation of increased cardiac output and left ventricular mass (<LINK REF="REF-Cannella-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cannella 1990</LINK>) occurred with increasing haemoglobin levels. Before recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) became available, anaemia was treated by blood transfusion together with iron and folate supplements. Blood transfusions were used sparingly because they have associated risks of infection transmission and inducing cytotoxic antibodies that could jeopardise future kidney transplantation (<LINK REF="REF-Ward-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ward 1990</LINK>). Cloning of the human gene for erythropoietin was achieved in 1983 (<LINK REF="REF-Lin-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 1985</LINK>), and production of rHuEPO followed. The efficacy of rHuEPO treatment in dialysis patients was demonstrated by 1986 (<LINK REF="REF-Winearls-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winearls 1986</LINK>). National (<LINK REF="REF-CARI-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">CARI 2011</LINK>) and international guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-KDIGO-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">KDIGO 2012</LINK>) currently recommend target haemoglobin levels of 110 mg/L to 120 mg/L in people with CKD.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-05-20 18:53:39 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Administration of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) aims to replace endogenous erythropoietin production, which is reduced in CKD, and to raise haemoglobin levels to alleviate signs and symptoms of anaemia.</P>
<P>ESA products, such as epoetin-&#945; and epoetin-&#946;, have proven efficacy in treating anaemia in people with CKD (<LINK REF="REF-Eschbach-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eschbach 1987</LINK>). However, because of the relatively short half-life of these agents (six to eight hours when administered intravenously, and 19 to 24 hours when administered subcutaneously), they require administration at two to three weekly intervals in most people, although some stable haemodialysis patients with low dose requirements may require weekly administration only (<LINK REF="REF-Locatelli-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Locatelli 2011</LINK>). Such frequent administration may be inconvenient for both patients and healthcare workers. Following red cell aplasia, a complication predominantly associated with subcutaneous administration of epoetin-&#945;, intravenous administration was recommended (<LINK REF="REF-Ortho-Biotech-Jansen-Cilag-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ortho Biotech Jansen Cilag 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>There has been a general trend towards less frequent dosing regimens using new long-acting ESA preparations that offer greater patient comfort and convenience. Darbepoetin was the first ESA with a prolonged half-life to enter the market. It has five N-linked carbohydrate chains, whereas rHuEPO has only three. Because of its increased sialic acid-containing carbohydrate content, darbepoetin has a threefold longer terminal half-life (25 hours intravenous and 48 hours subcutaneous) compared with rHuEPO. This enables once a week or once every two weeks administration in people with CKD (<LINK REF="REF-Macdougall-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macdougall 1999</LINK>). More recently, the continuous erythropoietin receptor activator (CERA), methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin-&#946; has been developed to ensure stable maintenance and correction of haemoglobin levels at less frequent administration in people with CKD. CERA differs from rHuEPO through the formation of a chemical bond between either the N-terminal amino group or the &#603;-amino group of any lysine present in erythropoietin and methoxy polyethylene glycol-butanoic acid (<LINK REF="REF-Macdougall-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macdougall 2005</LINK>). Despite lower receptor affinity, CERA induces a more prolonged response than epoetin-&#945; or epoetin-&#946;.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-05-20 14:18:40 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The primary cause of anaemia in CKD is the relative insufficiency of erythropoietin production associated with CKD. ESA accelerate erythropoiesis, increase iron utilisation and raise haemoglobin levels with clinical improvement in signs and symptoms of anaemia. ESA requirements are difficult to predict in individual patients, and may be increased in people with associated comorbidities including cardiovascular disease, diabetes and chronic inflammation. ESA requirements are generally lower in patients not receiving dialysis. ESA therapy aims to increase haemoglobin levels slowly at a rate of &lt; 1 g/dL to 2 g/dL per month during the correction phase. This is done to avoid major side effects including hypertension, vascular access thrombosis and cardiovascular events, and then maintain stable haemoglobin.</P>
<P>A major issue in ESA use relates to the haemoglobin target to be achieved. Recent systematic reviews have suggested that aiming for haemoglobin levels similar to those seen in healthy adults is associated with a significantly higher risk of all-cause mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Palmer-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palmer 2010</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-05-20 14:32:42 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>ESA are effective in correcting anaemia associated with kidney disease and increasing haemoglobin levels but choice of agent should include the drug's pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, route and frequency of administration, adverse effects, availability and economic issues. The 2002 review (<LINK REF="REF-Cody-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cody 2002</LINK>) and subsequent 2005 update (<LINK REF="REF-Cody-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cody 2005a</LINK>) assessed different frequencies of rHuEPO. This update (2013) evaluated the benefits and adverse effects of the newer ESA, which are administered at less frequent intervals than rHuEPO.</P>
<P>This review assessed different frequencies of ESA in patients on dialysis. A review by (<LINK REF="REF-Cody-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cody 2005b</LINK>), which assessed rHuEPO frequencies in non-dialysis patients, is being updated to include longer-acting ESA.</P>

Where more than one report of a study was identified, data were extracted from all reports. Where there were discrepancies between reports, data from the primary source were used. Study authors were contacted for additional information about studies; however, no additional information was obtained.</P>

<P>In this review, the following items were assessed using the risk of bias assessment tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) (see <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>).</P>
<UL>
<LI>Was there adequate sequence generation (selection bias)?</LI>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-05-20 18:59:28 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Previous versions of this review presented analyses based on 11 studies that assessed different frequencies of rHuEPO - epoetin-&#945; or epoetin-&#946;. An additional 22 studies were included in this update, most of which evaluated the longer-acting ESA darbepoetin and CERA. For ease of comparison, we divided the included studies into four groups.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">CERA versus other ESA</HEADING>
<P>Our findings demonstrated that CERA administered at reduced frequencies compared with rHuEPO provides comparable degrees of anaemia correction without new or increased numbers of adverse effects or increase in all-cause mortality. In addition, no significant differences in efficacy or adverse effects were demonstrated using different frequencies of CERA. Two studies investigated intravenous ESA administration, one used subcutaneous administration and another used both routes. Interpretation of the meta-analyses revealed no obvious variation in results according to route of administration, but this could not be formally tested in subgroup analyses.</P>
<P>Only <LINK REF="STD-AMICUS-Study-2007" TYPE="STUDY">AMICUS Study 2007</LINK>, an open-label study, reported on quality of life with improvement and determined greater improvement with CERA compared with rHuEPO.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-MAXIMA-Study-2007" TYPE="STUDY">MAXIMA Study 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-PROTOS-Study-2007" TYPE="STUDY">PROTOS Study 2007</LINK> compared administration of CERA at two weekly and four weekly intervals. No significant differences were found in final haemoglobin or reports of adverse events.</P>
<P>CERA administered intravenously every two weeks showed no significant difference in maintaining haemoglobin compared with darbepoetin administered at once/week. There were no significant differences between groups for all-cause mortality and adverse events including hypertension, vascular access complications and transfusion requirements.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Different frequencies of darbepoetin</HEADING>
<P>Two studies compared darbepoetin administered once weekly with every two weeks. There were no significant differences in final haemoglobin, all-cause mortality and other reported adverse events between frequencies. There was significant heterogeneity between studies for the outcomes of haemoglobin and darbepoetin dosage, which may have resulted from different dosing schedules.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Darbepoetin versus rHuEPO</HEADING>
<P>Six studies compared once/week darbepoetin with two to three times/week administration of rHuEPO, with no significant differences in final haemoglobin or change in haemoglobin, all-cause mortality and adverse effects. ESA dose was significantly lower in darbepoetin-treated patients but this outcome was only reported in three studies (757 participants).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Different frequencies of rHuEPO</HEADING>
<P>No significant differences in final haemoglobin, haematocrit or rHuEPO dose were identified in 10 studies that compared rHuEPO once/week with two to three times/week. No studies reported all-cause mortality, and there were limited data on other adverse effects. The other included studies assessed different frequencies of rHuEPO administration and identified no significant differences in final haemoglobin or rHuEPO dose with limited data on other outcomes.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-05-20 19:00:02 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review included only studies that evaluated ESA for people on dialysis. However, most participants were on haemodialysis. <LINK REF="STD-Lui-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Lui 1991</LINK> only included peritoneal dialysis patients and evaluated rHuEPO. Other studies included few participants on peritoneal dialysis but did not separate data according to mode of dialysis. Furthermore, we did not identify any studies in children on dialysis. An open-label, non-inferiority study that compared darbepoetin-&#945; and rHuEPO in 124 children with CKD not on dialysis found no significant difference in maintaining haemoglobin (<LINK REF="REF-Warady-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warady 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>There were limited data available that compared long-acting ESA. We identified one study in dialysis patients which compared darbepoetin and CERA and included 313 participants (<LINK REF="STD-STRIATA-Study-2008" TYPE="STUDY">STRIATA Study 2008</LINK>). This study identified a small (0.3 g/dL) statistically significant, but not clinically significant, benefit from CERA over darbepoetin with no differences in adverse event profiles. However, further studies comparing different frequencies are required to determine if these drugs provide similar clinical benefits. <LINK REF="STD-PATRONUS-Study-2009" TYPE="STUDY">PATRONUS Study 2009</LINK>, which did not match our inclusion criteria for this review, found that CERA was superior to darbepoetin when both drugs were given at four weekly intervals.</P>
<P>Patient-centred outcomes were generally poorly reported. We found that 13/33 studies recorded all-cause mortality; only four reported cardiovascular mortality data; and none reported on cardiovascular morbidity. <LINK REF="STD-AMICUS-Study-2007" TYPE="STUDY">AMICUS Study 2007</LINK>, which compared CERA with rHuEPO, provided limited quality of life data. Six older studies (<LINK REF="STD-Lee-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leung-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Leung 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lui-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Lui 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lui-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Lui 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paganini-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Paganini 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weiss-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Weiss 2000</LINK>) that evaluated different frequencies of rHuEPO were less likely to report adverse effects data, and none reported on all-cause mortality.</P>
<P>Although hypertension and vascular access complications are known to be associated with ESA administration, these were reported in only 14 and 11 studies respectively. It is widely accepted that ESA therapy reduces transfusion requirements, however, 22 studies failed to report on transfusion events.</P>
<P>ESA doses in the CERA studies could not be meta-analysed because data were reported as medians and IQR. Furthermore, ESA doses in other studies could not be meta-analysed because of different reporting methods. <LINK REF="STD-Nagaya-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Nagaya 2010</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Locatelli-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Locatelli 2004</LINK> compared different frequencies of darbepoetin administration, but there was marked heterogeneity in the analyses for haemoglobin (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>) and darbepoetin dose (<LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>). Reasons for heterogeneity were unclear, but may be related to different schedules used to alter darbepoetin dose in these studies.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-11-13 09:50:00 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 33 studies that involved 5526 participants in this review. Of these, 13 were available only in abstract form.</P>
<P>We found that nine (27%) studies demonstrated adequate random sequence generation, and 14 (42%) were assessed as showing allocation procedures at low risk of bias. These parameters were found to be less commonly reported in earlier studies that compared erythropoietin administration frequencies. Blinding was reported in only a few studies, but because outcome measures were reported as laboratory results, this was considered to confer a low risk of bias. Attrition bias (incomplete outcome data) was identified in 50% of the included studies, and reporting bias (selective reporting) was identified or unclear in fewer than 15% of studies (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>Quality of studies comparing CERA and rHuEPO was considered high for the outcome of final haemoglobin (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>), but a small sample size meant that quality was moderate in the study that compared CERA and darbepoetin. Small numbers of events meant that study quality was assessed as moderate for all-cause mortality. The quality of studies reporting on adverse events was considered to be moderate for all outcomes, except hypertension, where quality was high. These studies were all well-funded, large multicentre studies, with potentially better study design and reporting.</P>
<P>Overall, quality of studies comparing different durations of CERA administration was considered to be high or moderate for all outcomes (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the studies comparing darbepoetin and rHuEPO for outcomes of final haemoglobin and all-cause mortality, overall quality was assessed as moderate (<LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>). In relation to adverse effects, overall quality was assessed as moderate or low because of heterogeneity and high risk of bias in individual studies.</P>
<P>In studies that compared different frequencies of rHuEPO administration, quality of evidence was considered to be low for all outcomes (<LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>). Many of these studies were available only in abstract form. Among these earlier studies participant numbers were low, important outcomes such as mortality were not reported, and components of study design were poorly reported or at high risk of bias.</P>
<P>Only 17/33 studies could be included in Summary of findings tables because other comparisons involved single studies only or data could not be included in meta-analyses.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2014-05-20 19:30:16 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A comprehensive search of the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register was undertaken; the last search was completed in March 2013. This decreased the likelihood that published eligible studies were omitted from our review. However, more recently published eligible studies and eligible studies in congress proceedings not searched could have been missed. We found that 40% of included studies were available only in the abstract form that provided limited information on study methods and results; inclusion of these data could be a source of bias. Two potentially eligible studies in progress were identified from study registries.</P>
<P>This was an extensive review completed independently by two authors who both participated in all steps of the review. This limited the risk of errors in determining study eligibility, data extraction, risk of bias assessment and data synthesis.</P>
<P>Many of the earlier rHuEPO studies were small with incomplete information on study methods and results. Further information could not be obtained about these studies from investigators or the literature.</P>
<P>Among the more recent studies of longer-acting ESA per-protocol data were meta-analysed for the primary outcome of haemoglobin level in three (<LINK REF="STD-MAXIMA-Study-2007" TYPE="STUDY">MAXIMA Study 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PROTOS-Study-2007" TYPE="STUDY">PROTOS Study 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-RUBRA-Study-2008" TYPE="STUDY">RUBRA Study 2008</LINK>) of the four studies; ITT data were either not provided or were presented in graphical form only. We did not receive responses from authors we contacted with requests for ITT data. Sensitivity analysis that excluded the study that provided ITT data (<LINK REF="STD-AMICUS-Study-2007" TYPE="STUDY">AMICUS Study 2007</LINK>) did not alter the MD and 95% CI. This suggested that use of per-protocol data did not bias the results.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Carrera-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carrera 2007</LINK> published a narrative review that assessed different frequencies of darbepoetin or comparisons of darbepoetin with rHuEPO in dialysis patients and patients not yet on dialysis. Among dialysis patients, the review included 13 studies of which seven were RCTs. We included six of those RCTs in our review; the other study compared different routes of administration, and therefore was not eligible for inclusion in this review.</P>
<P>A narrative review by <LINK REF="REF-Foley-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foley 2010</LINK> included 10 studies that evaluated darbepoetin or CERA. Of those, seven involved dialysis patients and were included in this review.</P>
<P>Our review results concur with these earlier reviews that longer-acting ESA administered at less frequent intervals are non-inferior in RCTs to rHuEPO without differences in adverse events.</P>
<P>The Anaemia Working Group of the European Renal Best Practice (<LINK REF="REF-Locatelli-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Locatelli 2009</LINK>) recommended that CERA be administered every two weeks for anaemia correction, and then every four weeks. The Group considered that the safety and tolerability of CERA was similar to other ESA.</P>
<P>The KDIGO Working Group identified no evidence that any given type of ESA was superior to another in terms of efficacy and safety (<LINK REF="REF-KDIGO-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">KDIGO 2012</LINK>). The KDIGO Working Group concluded that differences in efficacy among ESA were unlikely and made no recommendations about specific types of ESA. The Working Group further suggested that ESA choice would depend on patient and country-specific issues such as availability and cost.</P>

<P>Longer-acting ESA are now standard practice for management of anaemia among people with CKD. This review identified evidence to demonstrate that darbepoetin and CERA administered at one to four weekly intervals are non-inferior to rHuEPO given one to three times/week in terms of achieving haemoglobin targets without any significant differences in adverse events.</P>
<P>As well as greater convenience offered by extended dosing intervals for both patients and healthcare providers, longer-acting ESA use may also result in improved cost efficiency. A recent audit of 82 patients (<LINK REF="REF-Summers-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Summers 2005</LINK>) demonstrated that switching from a more frequent rHuEPO dose regimen to once or every two weeks, darbepoetin significantly decreased ESA acquisition costs. The MERCURIUS project assessed costs in 21 haemodialysis centres in eight European countries. Administration of ESA at two weekly intervals resulted in significant reductions in pharmacy and dialysis unit staff and equipment costs (<LINK REF="REF-Burnier-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burnier 2009</LINK>). In many countries, costs of newer longer-acting but more costly ESA would have to be balanced against costs associated with more frequent rHuEPO administration because agents provide similar degrees of efficacy and safety. Less frequent administration could also reduce needle stick injuries potentially further reducing costs. A possible downside of less frequent administration of ESA could be that doses are missed, although there are no data to support or refute this possibility.</P>
