<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-09-08 09:47:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>Fast-track cardiac care involves early removal, within eight hours of heart surgery, of the tube that provides mechanical breathing support (called early tracheal extubation) to enable cardiac surgery. This review examined evidence on the effectiveness and safety of fast-track care compared with conventional (not fast-track) care. We have updated the published evidence that we identified in 2012. It is now current to March 2016.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>In the past, adults were given high-dose opioid-based anaesthesia for cardiac surgery and were provided with mechanical breathing support overnight in an intensive care unit after surgery. Now, many surgical units remove the tube that provides mechanical breathing support when the patient is on the operating table or within hours after cardiac surgery. They use time-directed protocols for removing breathing support. Some patients recover in an intensive care unit (ICU) or in a dedicated unit outside the ICU. It is important to improve hospital efficiency by using safe fast-track interventions.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We found 28 relevant randomized controlled studies, conducted between 1994 and 2015. Most of the 4438 adults who participated in these studies were undergoing first-time elective coronary artery graft bypass or valve replacement surgery, or both. They were at low to moderate risk of death after surgery. Eighteen studies examined the use of low-dose opioid-based general anaesthesia. Sixteen studies assessed how effective the protocols were in guiding staff to remove the tube that provided breathing support within eight hours after surgery.</P>
<P>
<B>Key findings and quality of evidence</B>
</P>
<P>We found no differences in risk of death in the first year after surgery (18 trials, 3796 participants) nor in complications after surgery such as the need to replace the tracheal tube after surgery (17 trials, 1855 participants) and occurrence of myocardial infarction (16 trials, 3061 participants) or stroke (16 trials, 2208 participants), when we examined both types of interventions. Occurrences of acute renal failure, major bleeding, sepsis and wound infection also were not different. We rated the quality of evidence as low for both mortality and postoperative complications.</P>
<P>Tracheal tubes were removed from adults in the fast-track care group up to a half day earlier than for those in the conventional care group. The fast-track group spent less time in the intensive care unit, but length of time spent in the hospital was similar between groups. The quality of evidence was low because of study limitations and unexplained variation in study findings. Large trials were few, and only one trial was designed to study postoperative effects of myocardial infarction, stroke or death.</P>
<P>Our results did not apply to &#8216;high-risk' patients who had multiple concurrent health problems or to settings in which a short-acting opioid (remifentanil) was used for general anaesthesia.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusion</B>
</P>
<P>Fast-track cardiac care is safe in patients considered to be at low to moderate risk of death after surgery.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-09-07 09:53:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Fast-track cardiac care is a complex intervention involving several components of care during cardiac anaesthesia and in the postoperative period, with the ultimate aim of early extubation after surgery, to reduce length of stay in the intensive care unit and in the hospital. Safe and effective fast-track cardiac care may reduce hospital costs. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2003, updated in 2012 and updated now in 2016.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-09-06 07:54:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To determine the safety and effectiveness of fast-track cardiac care compared with conventional (not fast-track) care in adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Fast-track cardiac care intervention includes administration of low-dose opioid-based general anaesthesia or use of a time-directed extubation protocol, or both.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-09-06 07:54:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 5), MEDLINE (January 2012 to May 2015), Embase (January 2012 to May 2015), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; January 2012 to May 2015) and the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Science (January 2012 to May 2015), along with reference lists of articles, to identify additional trials. We applied no language restrictions.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-09-06 07:54:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included all randomized controlled trials of adult cardiac surgical patients (coronary artery bypass grafts, aortic valve replacement, mitral valve replacement) that compared fast-track cardiac care and conventional (not fast-track) care groups. We focused on the following fast-track interventions, which were designed for early extubation after surgery: administration of low-dose opioid-based general anaesthesia during cardiac surgery and use of a time-directed extubation protocol after surgery. The primary outcome was risk of mortality. Secondary outcomes included postoperative complications, reintubation within 24 hours of surgery, time to extubation, length of stay in the intensive care unit and in the hospital, quality of life after surgery and hospital costs.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-09-06 07:54:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted study data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We calculated a Peto odds ratio (OR) for risk of mortality and used a random-effects model to report risk ratio (RR), mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for all secondary outcomes.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-09-06 07:54:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 28 trials (4438 participants) in the updated review. We considered most participants to be at low to moderate risk of death after surgery. We assessed two studies as having low risk of bias and 11 studies high risk of bias. Investigators reported no differences in risk of mortality within the first year after surgery between low-dose versus high-dose opioid-based general anaesthesia groups (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.12; eight trials, 1994 participants, low level of evidence) and between a time-directed extubation protocol versus usual care (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.45; 10 trials, 1802 participants, low level of evidence).</P>
<P>Researchers noted no significant differences between low-dose and high-dose opioid-based anaesthesia groups in the following postoperative complications: myocardial infarction (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.99; eight trials, 1683 participants, low level of evidence), stroke (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.36 to 3.78; five trials, 562 participants, low level of evidence) and tracheal reintubation (RR 1.77, 95% CI 0.38 to 8.27; five trials, 594 participants, low level of evidence).</P>
<P>Comparisons with usual care revealed no significant differences in the risk of postoperative complications associated with a time-directed extubation protocol: myocardial infarction (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.31; eight trials, 1378 participants, low level of evidence), stroke (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.16; 11 trials, 1646 participants, low level of evidence) and tracheal reintubation (RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.74 to 2.41; 12 trials, 1261 participants, low level of evidence).</P>
<P>Although levels of heterogeneity were high, low-dose opioid anaesthesia was associated with reduced time to extubation (reduction of 4.3 to 10.5 hours, 14 trials, 2486 participants, low level of evidence) and length of stay in the intensive care unit (reduction of 0.4 to 7.0 hours, 12 trials, 1394 participants, low level of evidence). Use of a time-directed extubation protocol was associated with reduced time to extubation (reduction of 3.7 to 8.8 hours, 16 trials, 2024 participants, low level of evidence) and length of stay in the intensive care unit (reduction of 3.9 to 10.5 hours, 13 trials, 1888 participants, low level of evidence). However, these two fast-track care interventions were not associated with reduced total length of stay in the hospital (low level of evidence).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-09-06 07:54:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Low-dose opioid-based general anaesthesia and time-directed extubation protocols for fast-track interventions have risks of mortality and major postoperative complications similar to those of conventional (not fast-track) care, and therefore appear to be safe for use in patients considered to be at low to moderate risk. These fast-track interventions reduced time to extubation and shortened length of stay in the intensive care unit but did not reduce length of stay in the hospital.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-09-06 09:06:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In the past, cardiac surgical patients were ventilated overnight following surgery and were given a regimen of high-dose opioid-based anaesthesia and postoperative analgesia (<LINK REF="REF-Hawkes-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawkes 2003</LINK>). However, in the early 1990s, fast-track cardiac anaesthesia (FTCA) was introduced to address the increasing demand for cardiac surgery with limited medical facilities and available resources. Although the volume of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery performed in the United States peaked in 1998, 219,000 patients underwent a total of 397,000 CABG procedures in 2010 (<LINK REF="REF-American-Heart-Association-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">American Heart Association 2016</LINK>). In many units, patients are now extubated (i.e. the tube that allows mechanical breathing support is removed) on the operating table or within hours after cardiac surgery via time-directed formalized weaning protocols, and they recover in a dedicated unit outside the intensive care unit (ICU) setting (<LINK REF="STD-Ender-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ender 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nougarede-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Nougarede 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Probst-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Probst 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salah-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Salah 2015</LINK>) as part of a fast-track programme.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-09-07 09:55:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The label 'fast-track' originally referred to the use of low-dose opioid-based general anaesthesia in cardiac surgical patients to carry connotations of excitement and rapid advancement (<LINK REF="REF-Silbert-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silbert 2009</LINK>). Although no standard definition of FTCA is known, it is generally accepted that it involves the use of a combination of short-acting hypnotic drugs with reduced doses of opioids, or the use of short-acting opioids such as remifentanil (<LINK REF="REF-Myles-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Myles 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Mastrigt-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Mastrigt 2006b</LINK>), with the ultimate aim of extubation within eight hours after cardiac surgery. Several authors arbitrarily defined the criteria for early extubation within eight hours (<LINK REF="STD-Berry-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Berry 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Michalopoulos-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Michalopoulos 1998</LINK>), but no physiological or pathological reasons have been proposed to explain why this time point was adopted.</P>
<P>Normothermic temperature management and use of an extubation protocol with the intention to extubate a patient within a specified time period are considered fast-track strategies (<LINK REF="REF-van-Mastrigt-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Mastrigt 2006b</LINK>).</P>
<P>In this systematic review, fast-track cardiac care is defined as a complex intervention involving several components of care during cardiac anaesthesia and in the postoperative period, with the ultimate aim of early extubation after surgery to reduce length of stay in the ICU and in the hospital. These components of fast-track cardiac care include administration of low-dose opioid-based general anaesthesia, use of a time-directed extubation protocol, or both. Although safe and effective fast-track cardiac care may reduce hospital costs, the incidence of fast-track failure after cardiac surgery ranges from 11% (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2013</LINK>) to 16% (<LINK REF="REF-Constantinides-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Constantinides 2006</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-09-06 09:06:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Early tracheal extubation after surgery is a key component of fast-track cardiac management. Early extubation reduces the patient's length of stay in the ICU and in the hospital, resulting in reduced hospital costs and improved hospital efficiency (<LINK REF="REF-Hawkes-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawkes 2003</LINK>). Although high intraoperative opioid doses are used to suppress hormonal and metabolic stress responses to surgery, the opioids may have cumulative effects and can depress respiration and prolong ventilation times (<LINK REF="STD-Maddali-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Maddali 2006</LINK>), whereas combining a short-acting hypnotic with a low-dose opioid-based anaesthesia can avoid these problems without compromising patient recovery. A time-directed extubation protocol improves efficiency of practice by following an expert consensus guideline to reduce variations in (1) decisions about when the patient is ready for weaning (the process leading to discontinuation of mechanical ventilation support), (2) the process of reducing ventilatory support and (3) criteria for deciding whether patients are ready to be extubated (<LINK REF="REF-Blackwood-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blackwood 2014</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-09-08 09:47:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>In an earlier version of this Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Hawkes-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawkes 2003</LINK>), which included six trials, review authors found no evidence of a difference between early and conventionally late extubated patients for the following outcomes: risk of mortality in ICU (risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42 to 1.52); risk of mortality at 30 days after surgery (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.63 to 2.27); risk of myocardial ischaemia (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.30); and risk of reintubation within 24 hours of surgery (RR 5.93, 95% CI 0.72 to 49.14). Times spent in ICU and in hospital were significantly shorter for patients who were extubated early (-7.02 hours, 95% CI -7.42 to -6.61; -1.08 days, 95% CI -1.35 to -0.82, respectively) (<LINK REF="REF-Hawkes-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawkes 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>In another systematic review of the safety and effectiveness of FTCA in 10 trials (<LINK REF="REF-Myles-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Myles 2003</LINK>), the FTCA group spent less time in ICU (-5.4 hours, 95% CI -10.5 to -0.3) than the conventional group given opioid-based anaesthesia. However, investigators reported no significant reduction in hospital stay (-0.61 days, 95% CI -1.51 to 0.28). Risk of mortality was similar between FTCA (1.2%) and conventional care (2.7%) groups (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.13) (<LINK REF="REF-Myles-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Myles 2003</LINK>). A meta-regression of randomized clinical trials of fast-track treatment in cardiac patients showed that the introduction of an early extubation protocol was an independent predictor of decreased ICU stay and hospital stay (<LINK REF="REF-van-Mastrigt-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Mastrigt 2006b</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the last Cochrane review update of 25 trials (n = 4118) (<LINK REF="REF-Zhu-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhu 2012</LINK>), we found no differences in risk of mortality within the first year after surgery between low-dose and high-dose opioid-based general anaesthesia groups (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.18), and between early extubation protocol versus usual care groups (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.75). We noted no significant differences between low-dose and high-dose opioid-based anaesthesia groups for the following postoperative complications: myocardial infarction (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.99), reintubation (RR 1.77, 95% CI 0.38 to 8.27), acute renal failure (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.33 to 4.33), major bleeding (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.44) and stroke (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.36 to 3.78). Comparison with usual care revealed no significant differences in risk of the following postoperative complications associated with a time-directed extubation protocol: myocardial infarction (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.60), reintubation (RR 1.91, 95% CI 0.90 to 4.07), acute renal failure (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.19 to 3.10), major bleeding (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.44), stroke (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.31 to 2.46), major sepsis (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.08 to 19.75) and wound infection (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.83). Although levels of heterogeneity were high, both low-dose opioid anaesthesia and use of time-directed extubation protocols were associated with reductions in time to extubation (3.0 to 10.5 hours) and in length of stay in the intensive care unit (0.4 to 8.7 hours). However, these fast-track care interventions were not associated with reductions in total length of stay in the hospital. One high-quality cost-effectiveness analysis conducted in a randomized controlled trial showed that early extubation was likely to be cost-effective.</P>
<P>The rationale for conducting this Cochrane review update was to include findings from the most recent trials on risks and benefits of interventions commonly used as part of a fast-track cardiac programme.<BR/>

<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-09-06 09:07:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To determine the safety and effectiveness of fast-track cardiac care compared with conventional (not fast-track) care in adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

<P>We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing fast-track care (interventions with the aim of early extubation within eight hours after surgery) with conventional (not fast-track) care when extubation occurred after eight hours following cardiac surgery.

<P>As in the previous reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Hawkes-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawkes 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhu-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhu 2012</LINK>), we chose eight hours as the defined time limit for early tracheal extubation because this definition was frequently presented in the literature published in the 1990s. As rapid advances and changes in cardiac anaesthesia and surgical techniques have occurred since the 1990s, we did not exclude studies that compared interventions designed for early extubation (within four hours after surgery).</P>
<P>For the purpose of this review, FTCA involves the use of low-dose opiate (fentanyl &#8804; 20 &#956;g/kg or equivalent) (<LINK REF="REF-Myles-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Myles 2003</LINK>) or short-acting opioid supplemented with propofol or etomidate, or volatile anaesthesia with or without a protocol for early extubation within eight hours. Conventional cardiac anaesthesia was defined by the use of high-dose opioids (fentanyl &#8805; 20 &#956;g/kg or equivalent) with propofol or etomidate, or volatile anaesthesia with or without a protocol for extubation within a specified time after surgery. We excluded trials with remifentanil as, unlike other opioids, it has a short half-life and does not accumulate after prolonged administration (<LINK REF="STD-Howie-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Howie 2003</LINK>); its use in cardiac surgery has been reviewed elsewhere (<LINK REF="REF-Greco-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greco 2012</LINK>). We excluded studies that examined major regional blockade (epidural or intrathecal), as the effectiveness of thoracic epidural in cardiac surgery has been reviewed in another Cochrane systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Svircevic-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Svircevic 2013</LINK>). We also excluded studies that compared normothermia and hypothermia during cardiopulmonary bypass in adult cardiac surgery, as the risks and benefits have been reviewed elsewhere (<LINK REF="REF-Ho-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ho 2011</LINK>).<BR/>

<P>Two review authors (VKWL and AL) independently assessed the quality of studies by applying the criteria described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We graded risk of bias for each study in the domains of sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting and comparison of baseline characteristics entered into a &#8216;Risk of bias' table (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We graded each domain as &#8216;yes' (low risk of bias), &#8216;no' (high risk of bias) or &#8216;unclear' (uncertain risk of bias) according to the criteria outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We defined a high-quality trial as one in which all domains were considered to be at low risk of bias, and a low-quality trial as a trial in which one or more of these domains were rated as having high risk of bias.</P>
<P>We used the GRADE approach to rate the overall quality of evidence for seven outcomes (death at any time after surgery, postoperative myocardial infarction, postoperative stroke, postoperative tracheal reintubation, time to extubation, length of intensive care unit stay, length of hospital stay) (Summary of findings table 1; Summary of findings table 2) as high, moderate, low or very low (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011</LINK>). We downgraded the quality of evidence from high if we noted study limitations (risk of bias), indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates and potential publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011</LINK>). We upgraded the quality of evidence when we observed a large effect (RR &lt; 0.5 or RR &gt; 2) in the absence of plausible confounders (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>

<P>We used the principles of the GRADE system to assess the quality of the body of evidence associated with specific outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011</LINK>). The GRADE approach appraises the quality of a body of evidence on the basis of the extent to which one can be confident that an estimate of effect or association reflects the outcome being assessed (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011</LINK>). Assessment of the quality of a body of evidence considers within-study risk of bias (methodological quality), directness of the evidence, heterogeneity of the data, precision of the effect estimates and risk of publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011</LINK>).

<P>Investigators reported short-term (ICU and hospital stay) and long-term (one-year) mortality. Three studies recorded no deaths (<LINK REF="STD-Engoren-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Engoren 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Michalopoulos-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Michalopoulos 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Myles-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Myles 1997</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Berry-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Berry 1998</LINK> showed no significant differences between low-dose and high-dose opioid groups for risk of death in the ICU (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.06). The overall risk of death at hospital discharge was less than 2%, and researchers found no significant differences between low-dose and high-dose opioid groups (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.39; seven trials, 1896 participants) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). At one-year follow-up, risk of death was similar between groups (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.82; two trials, 446 participants) in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Cheng-1996a_x002c_1996b_x002c_-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cheng 1996a,1996b, 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Silbert-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Silbert 2006</LINK>) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>When death was reported at several time periods within a study, we used the data from the longest follow-up.

<P>As the meta-analysis included fewer than 10 studies, we did not construct a contour-enhanced funnel plot graph to examine the presence of publication bias.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-09-07 10:33:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this update, we added to the body of evidence three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Probst-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Probst 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salah-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Salah 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2015</LINK>) - all on the effects of a time-directed extubation protocol. In this systematic review of 28 randomized controlled trials involving 4438 particpants, we found that fast-track cardiac care was associated with a similar risk of mortality after surgery when compared with conventional (not fast-track) care (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>). The incidence of mortality at any time after surgery was generally low (&lt; 5%). We found moderate-quality evidence of reduced risk of death associated with a time-directed protocol intervention when a trial (Reyes 1997) with a high mortality rate of 8% was excluded from the main meta-analysis. This post hoc sensitivity analysis is a new finding of this review.</P>
<P>We noted no increase in risk of myocardial infarction, acute renal failure, stroke, major bleeding, sepsis or wound infection (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>), and found that the overall quality of evidence for postoperative complications was low. We also found evidence of low quality for the reduction in time to extubation (up to 11 hours earlier) and length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) (up to 10 hours earlier). It should be noted that patient transfer out of ICU to the ward is dependent on the availability of beds on the ward in some settings, which may explain the high heterogeneity observed. Clinically important reductions in length of stay in the hospital were not associated with fast-track cardiac care, and we rated this evidence as low quality.</P>
<P>We found limited evidence on the effects of early extubation following a time-directed protocol on hospital cost and on quality of life within one year after cardiac surgery. Nevertheless, a formal cost-effectiveness analysis in one trial showed that early tracheal extubation was cost-effective (<LINK REF="STD-van-Mastrigt-2006a_x002c_-2010" TYPE="STUDY">van Mastrigt 2006a, 2010</LINK>).</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-09-07 10:42:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We considered most of the study participants to be at low to moderate risk of operative mortality (based on the European system for cardiac operative risk evaluation criteria), and most were undergoing elective cardiac surgery. This may explain why low rates of mortality and postoperative complications were found in most trials included in this systematic review. We found few large trials, and all, except one (<LINK REF="STD-Slogoff-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Slogoff 1989</LINK>), were not designed to detect an effect on myocardial infarction, stroke or death. Thus, it is likely that this systematic review was underpowered to detect significant risk reductions. For example, a post hoc power analysis using G*Power software (<LINK REF="REF-Faul-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faul 2014</LINK>) showed that the power to detect a difference in the risk of mortality at any time after surgery with the use of time-directed extubation protocols was 11%.</P>
<P>Results of this review are unlikely to be applicable to high-risk patients, who required significantly longer time to extubation (about one hour) than low-risk patients when the same fast-track cardiac anaesthesia technique was used in a cohort study of 1162 participants (<LINK REF="REF-Alhan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alhan 2003</LINK>). Of note, length of stay in the ICU and in hospital was similar for high-risk patients and low-risk patients (<LINK REF="REF-Alhan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alhan 2003</LINK>). Risk factors associated with fast-track cardiac surgery protocol failure (ICU readmission or failure to directly transfer patients to an intermediate care unit after surgery) include preoperative American Society of Anesthesiologists' Physical Status&#8201;&gt; &#8201;3, New York Heart Association class&#8201;&gt;&#8201;III and operative time &gt; 267 minutes (<LINK REF="REF-Kiessling-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kiessling 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Our systematic review highlights the paucity of high-quality cost-analysis studies on fast-track cardiac care. A propensity-matched cohort study of 652 participants showed that extubation in the operating room was associated with a 23% decrease in overall postoperative costs (mean difference 2014 USD -1013, 95% CI -1597 to -429) compared with extubation in the ICU within 12 hours after surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Badhwar-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Badhwar 2014</LINK>). Reductions in cost were due to shorter length of stay in the ICU and hospital with similar risks of postoperative complications among patients extubated in the operating room (<LINK REF="REF-Badhwar-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Badhwar 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Remifentanil, an opioid with rapid onset and offset of action, is used frequently in fast-track cardiac anaesthesia (<LINK REF="REF-Greco-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greco 2012</LINK>). The trials in this systematic review did not include the use of remifentanil; this limits the applicability of evidence to settings in which remifentanil is used as part of the fast-track cardiac anaesthesia technique. A meta-analysis of remifentanil trials in cardiac surgery showed that remifentanil was associated with reduced time to extubation and length of hospital stay with no increase in risk of mortality when compared with use of fentanyl or sufentanil during general anaesthesia (<LINK REF="REF-Greco-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greco 2012</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-09-08 09:47:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>The quality of evidence as rated by the GRADE approach is shown in <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK> (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011</LINK>). A limitation of this systematic review is that 11 of the 28 trials had one or more high risk of bias domains. Blinding and selective reporting introduced the most common risks of bias. Overall, evidence on the association between fast-track cardiac care and mortality was of low quality.</P>
<P>Evidence on the association between fast-track cardiac care and major postoperative complications was of low quality, as review authors included high risk of bias trials in the various meta-analyses and noted imprecision. Although we observed a clinically important difference between groups in time to extubation, the evidence was of low quality owing to inclusion of high risk of bias trials and large inconsistencies of effect between trials. Only one high-quality trial examined changes in quality of life after cardiac surgery associated with a time-directed extubation protocol (<LINK REF="STD-van-Mastrigt-2006a_x002c_-2010" TYPE="STUDY">van Mastrigt 2006a, 2010</LINK>).</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-09-07 10:44:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We cannot rule out the presence of publication bias in this systematic review. We did not attempt to handsearch conference proceedings. As we identified fewer than 10 trials with risk estimates of mortality after surgery, it was impossible for review authors to assess publication bias using a contour-enhanced funnel plot. Nevertheless, we found no funnel asymmetry for time to extubation outcomes for the comparison of opioid-based general anaesthesia and time-directed protocol interventions.</P>
<P>Caution is required in interpreting results of the post hoc sensitivity analysis on exclusion of a trial (<LINK REF="STD-Reyes-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Reyes 1997</LINK>) from the meta-analysis on risk of death at any time after surgery, and on use of time-directed protocols (odds ratio (OR) 0.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.11 to 0.90). We are unsure why the excluded trial (<LINK REF="STD-Reyes-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Reyes 1997</LINK>) had a higher mortality rate than the other trials considered, irrespective of trial arm.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-09-08 09:47:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Although investigators measured mortality at different time points, the risk of mortality associated with fast-track cardiac care in this systematic review did not change the conclusions reported in previous systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Hawkes-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawkes 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meades-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meades 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Myles-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Myles 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhu-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhu 2012</LINK>). In a retrospective cohort of 7989 participants comparing low-dose and high-dose opioid-based general anaesthesia (<LINK REF="REF-Svircevic-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Svircevic 2009</LINK>), the adjusted odds ratio for mortality was 0.92 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 1.32). The significant post hoc sensitivity analysis result contrasts with findings of a consensus conference on fast-track cardiac anaesthesia (FTCA) that found no significant reduction in risk of mortality in any of the trials screened (<LINK REF="REF-Landoni-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Landoni 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Previous systematic reviews found no evidence of increased risk of major complications after surgery associated with FTCA (<LINK REF="REF-Myles-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Myles 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhu-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhu 2012</LINK>). Our relative risks of myocardial infarction, major sepsis, acute renal failure, stroke and major bleeding were similar, but showed greater precision. Therefore, we conclude that FTCA is safe and comparable with conventional (not fast-track) care.</P>
<P>The time to extubation result in this systematic review was comparable with that in previous systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Meades-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meades 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Myles-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Myles 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhu-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhu 2012</LINK>) and in a large retrospective cohort study of 7989 participants in which the fast-track cardiac anaesthesia group was extubated six hours earlier than the high-dose opioid group (<LINK REF="REF-Svircevic-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Svircevic 2009</LINK>). A previous review suggested that the introduction of an early extubation protocol, in conjunction with low-dose opioid anaesthetic techniques and normothermic temperature management, would be essential for decreasing intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stays (<LINK REF="REF-van-Mastrigt-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Mastrigt 2006b</LINK>).</P>
<P>This systematic review found four studies examining early extubation outside the ICU setting (<LINK REF="STD-Nicholson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Nicholson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nougarede-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Nougarede 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Probst-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Probst 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salah-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Salah 2015</LINK>). Careful selection of patients for immediate extubation in the operating room rarely resulted in tracheal reintubation and was associated with shorter ICU and hospital length of stay in two propensity-matched cohort studies (<LINK REF="REF-Chamchad-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chamchad 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Badhwar-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Badhwar 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>As health-related quality of life instruments and timing of these assessments varied in 10 studies, the authors of a previous review (<LINK REF="REF-van-Mastrigt-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Mastrigt 2006b</LINK>) did not pool the results. The main limitation of the previous review was that pain and cognitive function were the only main dimensions of quality of life considered in the postoperative period to six months after surgery (<LINK REF="REF-van-Mastrigt-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Mastrigt 2006b</LINK>). In contrast, we included a trial that used a valid and reliable generic health-related quality of life tool (<LINK REF="STD-van-Mastrigt-2006a_x002c_-2010" TYPE="STUDY">van Mastrigt 2006a, 2010</LINK>) and found high quality of evidence for a small but non-significant improvement in quality of life at one year after surgery associated with early extubation.</P>
<P>We did not pool our cost analyses but found that early extubation was likely to be cost-effective in one high-quality study (<LINK REF="STD-van-Mastrigt-2006a_x002c_-2010" TYPE="STUDY">van Mastrigt 2006a, 2010</LINK>). A propensity-matched cohort study of 652 participants showed that extubation in the operating room was associated with a 23% decrease in overall postoperative costs (mean difference 2014 USD -1013, 95% CI -1597 to -429) compared with extubation in the ICU within 12 hours after surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Badhwar-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Badhwar 2014</LINK>).</P>

<P>Low quality evidence suggests that adults who are considered to be at low to moderate risk of operative mortality can benefit from fast-track care after undergoing uncomplicated cardiac surgery. The evidence in our review highlights the main benefit associated with fast-track cardiac anaesthesia (FTCA): a clinically important reduction in time to extubation and intensive care unit (ICU) stay without increased risk of mortality or major complications after surgery. Although the risks of morbidity and mortality associated with FTCA are low, the randomized controlled trials included in this systematic review were not usually adequately powered to detect small to moderate group differences. We found no subgroup differences in the risk of reintubation based on the location where extubation occurred. We found limited evidence on the quality of life associated with FTCA and on the cost-effectiveness of FTCA.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-09-07 10:53:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Fast-track cardiac anaesthesia is now the global standard of care (<LINK REF="REF-Silbert-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silbert 2009</LINK>). This review highlights the need for future, adequately powered trials to include long-term cost analyses and health-related quality of life outcomes after cardiac surgery. The results of fast-track treatment provided in a postanaesthetic care unit (&#8220;Leipzig fast-track concept&#8221;), instead of admission to an ICU, are encouraging (<LINK REF="STD-Ender-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ender 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nicholson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Nicholson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Probst-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Probst 2014</LINK>). The need for accurate fast-track failure risk prediction models in cardiac surgery appears to be substantial. If a threshold probability of fast-track failure of between 5% and 20% is used to determine who should be admitted to the ICU or to the fast-track recovery unit, we would expect an increase in ICU bed utilization from 23% to 67%, even after adjustments for the negative consequences of unplanned ICU admissions (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2013</LINK>). An overview of Cochrane and non-Cochrane systematic reviews of common interventions used before, during and after cardiac surgery would be worthwhile, to summarize the effectiveness of perioperative interventions that are included in a well-established fast-track cardiac programme.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Blackwood-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blackwood 2014</LINK> conducted a systematic review on the use of weaning protocols for reducing the duration of mechanical ventilation in critically ill adult patients and identified only one relevant, small, randomized controlled trial (<LINK REF="STD-Simeone-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Simeone 2002</LINK>). Additional trials, similar to <LINK REF="STD-Gruber-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Gruber 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2015</LINK>, are required to address the effects of weaning protocols based on different modes of mechanical ventilation on death, adverse events, duration of mechanical ventilation and length of stay in the ICU and hospital in cardiac surgical patients; these studies would need to be adequately powered and must provide clear descriptions of all aspects of study methods.</P>
