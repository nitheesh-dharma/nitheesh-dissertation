<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-03-29 05:26:07 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>Does the use of prophylactic barbiturate therapy reduce the possibility of dying or having severe developmental problems in term and late preterm infants following birth asphyxia?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Seizures (fits) are common following birth asphyxia (where the infant did not get enough oxygen during birth). These seizures may worsen brain injury caused by birth asphyxia. In theory, treatment with barbiturates (a medicine that causes relaxation and sleepiness and is used to treat seizures) given to babies soon after birth asphyxia may improve outcomes by preventing seizures and protecting the brain. Such treatment is called prophylaxis because it is given to prevent seizures rather than treat them once they have happened. Barbiturate therapy has some side effects and there are concerns that barbiturates might impair brain development.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We identified nine clinical trials for inclusion in this review by searching medical databases in November 2015. We found only low or very low quality evidence of prophylactic barbiturates in infants with perinatal asphyxia. The studies in this review included small numbers of babies and only a few studies looked at the health of infants over a long period of time.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>At present, there is not enough information to recommend giving barbiturate therapy to newborn babies soon after birth asphyxia but before seizures start.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusion</B>
</P>
<P>It is unclear whether giving barbiturates to newborn babies soon after birth asphyxia but before seizures start is safe or effective. More studies are needed.</P>

</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-03-26 07:34:31 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review group to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2015, Issue 11), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 30 November 2015), EMBASE (1980 to 30 November 2015), and CINAHL (1982 to 30 November 2015). We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomized controlled trials (RCT) and quasi-RCTs.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-03-26 07:34:41 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>We included all RCTs or quasi-RCTs of prophylactic barbiturate therapy in term and late preterm infants without clinical or electroencephalographic evidence of seizures compared to controls following perinatal asphyxia.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-03-28 17:10:18 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Three review authors independently selected, assessed the quality of, and extracted data from the included studies. We assessed methodologic quality and validity of studies without consideration of the results. The review authors independently extracted data and performed meta-analyses using risk ratios (RR) and risk differences (RD) for dichotomous data and mean difference for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For significant results, we calculated the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) or for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-04-28 09:16:05 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this updated review, we identified nine RCTs of any barbiturate therapy in term and late preterm infants aged less than three days old with perinatal asphyxia without evidence of seizures. Eight of these studies compared prophylactic barbiturate therapy to conventional treatment (enrolling 439 infants) and one study compared barbiturate therapy to treatment with phenytoin (enrolling 17 infants).</P>
<P>
<B>Prophylactic barbiturate therapy versus conventional treatment:</B> one small trial reported a decreased risk of death or severe neurodevelopmental disability for barbiturate therapy (phenobarbital) versus conventional treatment (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.78; RD -0.55, 95% CI -0.84 to -0.25; NNTB 2, 95% CI 1 to 4; 1 study, 31 infants) (very low quality evidence).</P>
<P>Eight trials comparing prophylactic barbiturate therapy with conventional treatment following perinatal asphyxia demonstrated no significant impact on the risk of death (typical RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.42; typical RD -0.02, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.05; 8 trials, 429 infants) (low quality evidence) and the one small trial noted above reported a significant decrease in the risk of severe neurodevelopmental disability (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.92; RD -0.43, 95% CI -0.73 to -0.13; NNTB 2, 95% CI 1 to 8; 1 study, 31 infants) (very low quality evidence).</P>
<P>A meta-analysis of the six trials reporting on seizures in the neonatal period demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in seizures in the prophylactic barbiturate group versus conventional treatment (typical RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.81; typical RD -0.18, 95% CI -0.27 to -0.09; NNTB 5, 95% CI 4 to 11; 6 studies, 319 infants) (low quality evidence). There were similar results in subgroup analyses based on type of barbiturate and Sarnat score.</P>
<P>
<B>Prophylactic barbiturate therapy versus other prophylactic anticonvulsant therapy: </B>one study reported on prophylactic barbiturate versus prophylactic phenytoin. There was no significant difference in seizure activity in the neonatal period between the two study groups (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.07 to 12.00; 1 trial, 17 infants).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-03-29 04:27:58 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>We found only low or very low quality evidence addressing the use of prophylactic barbiturates in infants with perinatal asphyxia. Although the administration of prophylactic barbiturate therapy to infants following perinatal asphyxia did reduce the risk of seizures, there was no reduction seen in mortality and there were few data addressing long-term outcomes. The administration of prophylactic barbiturate therapy for late preterm and term infants in the immediate period following perinatal asphyxia cannot be recommended for routine clinical practice. If used at all, barbiturates should be reserved for the treatment of seizures. The results of the current review support the use of prophylactic barbiturate therapy as a promising area of research. Future studies should be of sufficient size and duration to detect clinically important reductions in mortality and severe neurodevelopmental disability and should be conducted in the context of the current standard of care, including the use of therapeutic hypothermia.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-03-29 05:21:46 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Seizures are common following perinatal asphyxia and may exacerbate secondary neuronal injury. Barbiturate therapy has been used for infants with perinatal asphyxia in order to prevent seizures. However, barbiturate therapy may adversely affect neurodevelopment leading to concern regarding aggressive use in neonates.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-03-28 17:19:48 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Perinatal asphyxia resulting in hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) remains an important cause of mortality and severe long-term neurologic and developmental disability in children worldwide.</P>
<P>Paramount in the treatment of HIE is the early identification of infants whose encephalopathy may be subject to treatment. The management of these infants has traditionally been supportive, with the goal of restoring and maintaining cerebral perfusion, maintaining glucose homeostasis, treating other organ dysfunction, and treating seizures when present. Currently, there are no targeted neuroprotective interventions that have been shown to be effective in human trials, with the notable exception of therapeutic hypothermia (<LINK REF="REF-Jacobs-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobs 2013</LINK>). Multiple trials have shown that initiation of therapeutic hypothermia, both whole body and selective head cooling, within six hours of age reduces mortality without increasing major morbidity in survivors (<LINK REF="REF-Jacobs-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobs 2013</LINK>). Although there are multiple etiologies for neonatal encephalopathy, the use of therapeutic hypothermia is restricted to infants with HIE due to perinatal asphyxia. Typically, the highest risk infants are able to be identified shortly after birth by a constellation of clinical findings including:</P>
<UL>
<LI>evidence of a sentinel event during labor (i.e. fetal heart rate abnormality);</LI>
<LI>a severely depressed infant (low extended Apgar score);</LI>
<LI>the need for resuscitation in the delivery room (i.e. intubation, chest compressions with or without epinephrine);</LI>
<LI>evidence of severe fetal acidemia (cord umbilical artery pH less than 7.00 or base deficit greater than 16 mEq/L (16 mmol/L), or both);</LI>
<LI>evidence of an early abnormal neurologic examination or abnormal assessment of cerebral function, or both (<LINK REF="REF-Perlman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perlman 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Perlman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perlman 2006</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>The therapeutic window that exists to minimize secondary injury and improve overall outcome is short (thought to be less than six hours) (<LINK REF="REF-Gunn-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gunn 1998</LINK>). Following a reversible hypoxic-ischemic insult, neuronal cell death occurs in two phases (<LINK REF="REF-Gluckman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluckman 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lorek-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lorek 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Penrice-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Penrice 1996</LINK>). Phase one, the initial anoxic event, results in primary neuronal injury and cell death due to cellular hypoxia with exhaustion of cellular energy stores (<LINK REF="REF-Hossman-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hossman 1983</LINK>). Phase two, the reperfusion phase, occurs following a latent period and results in delayed neuronal injury during the recovery period following initial resuscitation (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 1991</LINK>). Mechanisms thought to be important in the second phase of neuronal injury include production of oxygen free radicals (<LINK REF="REF-McCord-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCord 1985</LINK>), intracellular calcium influx (<LINK REF="REF-Siesjo-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siesjo 1992</LINK>), increase in excitatory neurotransmitters, cerebral edema, and active cell death or apoptosis (<LINK REF="REF-Buttke-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buttke 1994</LINK>). Clinically, this second phase of injury is associated with encephalopathy and increased seizure activity. It is the severity of this second phase that correlates with mortality and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes at one and four years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Roth-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roth 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roth-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roth 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>A continuum of severity exists among infants with HIE. In an attempt to help estimate the risk of adverse outcomes, Sarnat and Sarnat developed the original scoring system for categorizing encephalopathy in infants after perinatal distress. This system, with some modifications, is the approach used by most authors/researchers today and includes Stage I (Sarnat 1) - mild, Stage II (Sarnat 2) - moderate, Stage III (Sarnat 3) - severe (<LINK REF="REF-Sarnat-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sarnat 1976</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-03-29 04:28:55 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Seizures are a common feature of HIE (<LINK REF="REF-Sarnat-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sarnat 1976</LINK>), occurring in up to 60% of infants with moderate to severe HIE (<LINK REF="REF-Gluckman-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluckman 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pfister-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pfister 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shankaran-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shankaran 2005</LINK>). When present, seizures substantially increase cerebral metabolic demand (<LINK REF="REF-Younkin-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Younkin 1986</LINK>), cause the release of excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate (<LINK REF="REF-McDonald-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 1990</LINK>), lead to fluctuations in systemic arterial pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Clozel-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clozel 1985</LINK>), and result in hypoxia and hypercapnia. Though the degree to which seizures are associated with an increased risk of death and neurodevelopmental disability in this population is unclear (<LINK REF="REF-Glass-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glass 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kwon-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kwon 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McBride-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McBride 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wyatt-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wyatt 2007</LINK>), seizures are thought to contribute to ongoing neuronal injury following asphyxia (<LINK REF="REF-Wirrell-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wirrell 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yager-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yager 2002</LINK>). The potential benefits of preventing further neuronal injury through the treatment and prevention of seizures following asphyxia has prompted the widespread use of anticonvulsants in this population. Barbiturates, specifically phenobarbital, remain the preferred drugs of choice for the management of neonatal seizures, including seizures that occur following perinatal asphyxia.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-03-29 05:21:46 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Barbiturates are a class of anticonvulsants that facilitate gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated opening of chloride channels and in so doing enhance the effectiveness of GABA. The anticonvulsant effect of barbiturates is seen when GABA activation of the postsynaptic GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor results in an influx of chloride, and thereby an inhibitory effect as seen in mature neurons. However, this effect is less consistent in the developing brain (<LINK REF="REF-Cherubini-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cherubini 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rivera-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rivera 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yamada-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yamada 2004</LINK>). In addition to the potential anticonvulsant effects, barbiturates are also known to decrease central nervous system (CNS) metabolic rate when given in high doses (<LINK REF="REF-Nilsson-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nilsson 1971</LINK>), reduce calcium entry postischemia, and scavenge free radicals (<LINK REF="REF-Demopoulos-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Demopoulos 1977</LINK>). Thus, barbiturates may theoretically attenuate the cascade of damaging processes initiated by the hypoxic-ischemic insult and reduce secondary neuronal injury. For these reasons, many clinicians have used barbiturates, specifically phenobarbital, prophylactically with or without therapeutic hypothermia, in cases of HIE. While there are data to suggest that seizure duration and evidence of brain injury on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be reduced when either clinical or subclinical seizure patterns are treated (<LINK REF="STD-van-Rooij-2010" TYPE="STUDY">van Rooij 2010</LINK>), animal models in the developing brain have been conflicting, demonstrating abnormal neuronal development both following phenobarbital exposure
 
(<LINK REF="REF-Bittigau-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bittigau 2002</LINK>)
 
and seizures (<LINK REF="REF-Holmes-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holmes 1998</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-03-26 08:13:08 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Although therapeutic hypothermia has led to improvement in outcomes for infants with HIE, there remains a significant degree of morbidity and mortality among these infants. The establishment of safe and effective adjunct therapies is important to provide further neuroprotection and improve neurodevelopmental outcomes in this population. While the theoretical benefits of prophylactic phenobarbital administration seem to support its use, the potential risks associated with such use cannot be overlooked. These risks include, potential fluctuations in systemic blood pressure, mainly hypotension following administration, and the potential negative cognitive developmental effects suggested by animal studies.</P>

<P>We used the standard method of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group to assess risk of bias. The review authors independently assessed the risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We resolved any disagreements by discussion. </P>
<P>We assessed methodologic quality of the studies using the following criteria.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias): for each included study, we categorized the method used to generate the allocation sequence as: </LI>
<UL>
<LI>adequate (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator); </LI>
<LI>inadequate (any nonrandom process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number); </LI>
<LI>unclear.</LI>
</UL>
<LI>Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias): for each included study, we categorized the method used to conceal the allocation sequence as: </LI>
<UL>
<LI>adequate (e.g. telephone or central randomization; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes); </LI>
<LI>inadequate (open random allocation; unsealed or nonopaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth); </LI>
<LI>unclear.</LI>
</UL>
<LI>Blinding (checking for possible performance bias): for each included study, we categorized the methods used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We assessed blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes. We categorized the methods as: </LI>
<UL>
<LI>adequate, inadequate, or unclear for participants; </LI>
<LI>adequate, inadequate, or unclear for personnel; </LI>
<LI>adequate, inadequate, or unclear for outcome assessors. </LI>
</UL>
<LI>Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, drop-outs, protocol deviations): for each included study and for each outcome, we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We noted whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomized participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported or supplied by the trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses. We categorized the methods as: </LI>
<UL>
<LI>adequate (less than 20% missing data);</LI>
<LI>inadequate (20% or greater missing data);</LI>
<LI>unclear.</LI>
</UL>
<LI>Selective reporting bias: for each included study, we described how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We assessed the methods as: </LI>
<UL>
<LI>adequate (where it was clear that all of the study's prespecified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review were reported); </LI>
<LI>inadequate (where not all the study's prespecified outcomes were reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not prespecified; outcomes of interest were reported incompletely and so could not be used; study did not include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</LI>
<LI>unclear.</LI>
</UL>
<LI>Other sources of bias: for each included study, we described any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias (e.g. whether there was a potential source of bias related to the specific study design or whether the trial was stopped early due to some data-dependent process).

<P>We examined the treatment effects of individual trials by comparing groups allocated to the treatment under study (prophylactic barbiturate therapy) versus placebo with conventional treatment (including anticonvulsants for the treatment of seizures) or conventional treatment alone. We compared data relating to the primary and secondary outcomes (<LINK TAG="CRIT_OUTCOMES_PRIMARY" TYPE="SECTION">Primary outcomes</LINK>; <LINK TAG="CRIT_OUTCOMES_SECONDARY" TYPE="SECTION">Secondary outcomes</LINK>). Where relevant and if possible, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and risk difference (RD) for dichotomous data and mean difference (MD) for continuous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for all analyses. For significant results, we calculated the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) or additional harmful outcome (NNTH). Analysis of outcome data was by intention to treat.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality of evidence</HEADING>
<P>We assessed the quality of evidence for the main comparison at the outcome level using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011a</LINK>). This methodologic approach considers evidence from RCTs as high quality that may be downgraded based on consideration of any of five areas: design (risk of bias), consistency across studies, directness of the evidence, precision of estimates, and presence of publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011a</LINK>). The GRADE approach results in an assessment of the quality of a body of evidence in one of four grades:</P>
<UL>
<LI>high: we are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect;</LI>
<LI>moderate: we are moderately confident in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different;</LI>
<LI>low: our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect;</LI>
<LI>very low: we have very little confidence in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2013</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>The review authors assessed the quality of the evidence found for outcomes identified as critical or important for clinical decision making. These outcomes were defined post hoc and included: death or major neurodevelopmental disability assessed at 12 months of age or greater (defined as cerebral palsy, developmental delay (Bayley or Griffith assessment more than two SD below the mean) or intellectual impairment (IQ more than two SD below mean), blindness (vision less than 6/60 in both eyes) or sensorineural deafness requiring amplification), as well as death (at any time), major neurodevelopmental disability assessed at 12 months of age or greater, and cerebral palsy or developmental delay. In addition, we included seizures (suspected clinically or identified by EEG or aEEG) and abnormal neurologic exam at discharge.</P>
<P>In cases where we considered the risk of bias arising from inadequate concealment of allocation, randomized assignment, complete follow-up, or blinded outcome assessment to reduce our confidence in the effect estimates, we downgraded the quality of evidence accordingly (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011b</LINK>). We evaluated consistency by similarity of point estimates, extent of overlap of CIs and statistical criteria including measurement of heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic). We downgraded the quality of evidence when large and unexplained inconsistency across studies results was present (i.e. some studies suggested important benefit and other studies suggested no effect or harm without a clinical explanation) (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011c</LINK>). We assessed precision according with the 95% CI around the pooled estimation (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011d" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011d</LINK>). When trials were conducted in populations other than the target population, we downgraded the quality of evidence because of indirectness (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011e" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011e</LINK>).</P>
<P>We entered data (i.e. pooled estimates of the effects and corresponding 95% CI) and explicit judgments for each of the above aspects assessed into the Guideline Development Tool, the software used to create 'Summary of findings' tables (<LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro 2008</LINK>). We explained all judgments involving the assessment of the study characteristics described above in footnotes or comments in the 'Summary of findings' table.<BR/>

Participants were term infants (37 weeks' gestation or greater) with severe perinatal asphyxia who had neurologic signs of HIE (decreased or absent response to noxious stimuli, seizure activity, or increased irritability) and required mechanical ventilation within first hour of life; plus two of the following three criteria: perinatal distress (abnormal fetal heart pattern or requiring prolonged neonatal resuscitation); Apgar score of 4 or less at five minutes; and base deficit 15 mEq/L or greater within first hour of life. Thirty-two infants met the inclusion criteria and were randomized. The RCT excluded six infants prior to randomization for intractable hypotension, congenital intrauterine infection, complex congenital malformations, and maternal chorioamnionitis.</P>
<P>The thiopental treatment group (17 infants) received conventional therapy plus thiopental loading dose (15 mg/kg intravenous (IV) over 30 minutes), followed by a constant infusion of thiopental (10 mg/kg/hour for 90 minutes, 5 mg/kg/hour for 60 minutes, 3 mg/kg/hour for eight hours, 1.5 mg/kg/hour for six hours and 0.75 mg/kg/hour for six hours). The conventional therapy group (15 infants) received fluid restriction, mechanical ventilation, and treatment with phenobarbital or phenytoin for clinical apparent seizure activity. The primary outcome measured was reduction of intracranial pressure to the normal range. Secondary outcomes were hypotension requiring inotropes, overall effect on neurologic outcome, seizure activity over first 72 hours of life, death, and long-term neurodevelopmental outcome. Neurodevelopmental assessments were performed at three, six, nine, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months. Developmental outcome was measured using the Bayley scales of infant development (normal 84 or greater, questionable 68 to 83, abnormal 67 or less) through two years of age, after which Stanford-Binet assessments were performed.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Ruth-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ruth 1991</LINK> reported on death before neurodevelopmental assessment and neurodevelopmental outcome at six years of age for 38 term neonates with evidence of perinatal asphyxia (17 controls randomized to conventional therapy and 21 infants randomized to prophylactic phenobarbital therapy) in a single-center RCT. Eligible infants were term (37 weeks' gestation or greater) with evidence of perinatal asphyxia (five-minute Apgar score 3 or less or need for ventilator assistance beyond 30 minutes of life). Thirty-eight infants met the inclusion criteria and were randomized. The phenobarbital treatment group (21 infants) received conventional therapy plus a phenobarbital loading dose (30 mg/kg IV) prior to four hours of age, followed by a second dose of phenobarbital (15 mg/kg) four hours after the initial dose. These infants then received 5 mg/kg/day for five days. The control group (17 infants) received conventional therapy. Measured outcomes included death before neurodevelopmental assessment and disability (stated as cerebral palsy). Six-year follow-up included cognitive assessment (Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children - revised (WISC-r)), expressed as IQ; neuropsychological tests (copying design (Visual-Motor Integration (VMI) test), attention and confrontation naming (Developmental NEuroPSYchological (NEPSY) assessment)), and quality of life scale.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Hall-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1998</LINK> reported on seizures in the newborn period, death before neurodevelopmental evaluation, neurologic outcome at three years and serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) enzyme levels for 40 severely asphyxiated term and post term infants (20 controls randomized to conventional therapy and 20 infants randomized to prophylactic phenobarbital) in a single-center RCT. Eligible infants were 37 weeks' gestation or greater with severe perinatal asphyxia (initial arterial pH 7 or less with base deficit 15 mEq/L or greater; five-minute Apgar 3 or less; or failure to initiate spontaneous respirations at 10 minutes of life). Infants were excluded if they had any condition that was abnormal unrelated to asphyxia. Forty infants met inclusion criteria and were randomized. Thirty-one infants (15 in the phenobarbital group and 16 in the conventional therapy group) completed the trial. Study failures included inability to obtain successful lumbar puncture, protocol violations, and infants lost to follow-up. All infants were outborn and transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit within the first day of life. The phenobarbital treatment group (n = 20) received conventional therapy plus a single phenobarbital dose (40 mg/kg IV over 60 minutes) immediately following trial entry. The control group (n = 20) received conventional therapy. Conventional therapy for both groups included phenobarbital administration for the treatment of clinical seizures. This trial evaluated reduction in the incidence of clinical seizures as a primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included total lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK) and the presence or absence of CK-BB isoenzymes in CSF obtained day one and day two. Deaths before neurodevelopmental assessment and neurodevelopmental outcomes at three years of age were also evaluated. Neurodevelopmental assessments were completed at six, 12, 24, and 36 months of age using the Gessell, Bayley, or Stanford-Binet tests. Adverse effects of phenobarbital administration were evaluated including hypotension and respiratory depression.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Singh-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 2004</LINK> reported on CSF levels of lipid peroxides, antioxidant enzymes, and serum levels of antioxidant vitamins in relation to adverse outcomes (death or abnormal neurologic exam at discharge) for 45 asphyxiated late preterm and term infants with evidence of HIE (abnormalities in tone or level of consciousness, or both) within the first six hours of life (20 controls randomized to conventional therapy and 25 infants randomized to prophylactic phenobarbital therapy). Singh and colleagues published a follow-up report (Singh 2005, see <LINK REF="STD-Singh-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 2004</LINK>), on adverse outcomes (death or neurologic abnormality at discharge) and secondary outcome variables including seizures, need for ventilation, and multiorgan dysfunction for the same 45 asphyxiated late preterm and term infants with evidence of HIE in this single-center RCT. Eligible infants for this trial were 34 weeks' gestation or greater with perinatal asphyxia and showed evidence of HIE in the first six hours of life. Infants were included if, in the setting of a one-minute Apgar score of 5 or less and evidence of fetal distress (fetal bradycardia, meconium-stained amniotic fluid or arterial cord pH 7.15 or less), they developed abnormalities in tone or level of consciousness (or both) within the first six hours of life. Sixty infants met inclusion criteria and were randomized. Following randomization, 15 infants were excluded because of CSF findings suggestive of meningitis (one infant) or intracranial bleed/traumatic lumbar puncture (14 infants), leaving 45 infants (20 infants in the control group and 25 infants in the phenobarbital group). In addition, infants were excluded if they had major congenital malformations or if their mothers received phenobarbital during the last week prior to delivery. The phenobarbital group received conventional therapy plus phenobarbital (20 mg/kg IV over 20 minutes) within the first six hours of life. The control group received conventional therapy. Conventional therapy was as per unit protocol for management of HIE and included phenobarbital administration for seizures diagnosed clinical. Measured outcomes included primary outcome of death or abnormal neurologic exam at discharge (exam performed as described by Amiel-Tison). Secondary outcomes included seizures, need for ventilation, and multiorgan dysfunction (Singh 2005, see <LINK REF="STD-Singh-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 2004</LINK>). CSF levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and plasma levels of vitamins A and E were also evaluated at 10 to 12 hours of life and evaluated in relation to adverse outcomes (death or abnormal neurologic exam at discharge) (<LINK REF="STD-Singh-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 2004</LINK>). Cranial ultrasounds were also obtained on day one, day three and day seven. Neonatologists who were blinded to group allocation performed discharge neurologic exam and cranial ultrasounds. In addition, evidence of adverse effects of phenobarbital administration included hypotension, need for ventilation, presence myocardial dysfunction, and excessive sleepiness.</P>

Eligible infants were term and post-term infants (37 weeks' gestation or greater) with perinatal asphyxia (cord or arterial pH 7.0 or less within 15 minutes of life plus one or more of the following, base deficit 15 mEq/L or greater, Apgar score 3 or less at five minutes of life, or no spontaneous respiration by 15 minutes of life). Infants were excluded if they died within the first 48 hours of life; had major congenital abnormalities, congenital infection, or trauma during delivery; or exposure to maternal medications that would result in neonatal depression. The phenobarbital group received conventional therapy plus a phenobarbital loading dose (40 mg/kg IV over 60 minutes) administered within the first hour of life. The control group received placebo and conventional therapy, including phenobarbital at standard dosing for clinically evident seizure activity. Short-term neonatal outcomes including clinical seizure activity, neurologic status at discharge, and postasphyxia nonbrain complications (renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and metabolic) were measured. HIE grading according to Sarnat classification was performed to estimate frequency and severity of HIE.</P>

Eligible participants were term infants (37 weeks' gestation or greater) with severe perinatal asphyxia (cord blood pH less than 7 and Apgar score 5 or less at five minutes). Seventy-two infants met the inclusion criteria and were randomized. Four infants were excluded prior to randomization for obvious congenital malformation. The phenobarbital treatment group received conventional therapy per unit protocol for HIE plus a phenobarbital loading dose (40 mg/kg IV infusion over 60 minutes) within the first two hours of life. Heart rate, oxygen saturation, respiration, and mean arterial pressure were monitored continuously during administration. The conventional therapy group received conventional therapy for HIE per unit protocol. Primary outcomes were CSF levels of lipid peroxides (MDA) and antioxidant enzymes (SOD and GPx) at 12 ± 2 hours of life. Additional outcomes included death, seizure activity, neurologic exam at discharge and neurologic outcome at one-month follow-up (based on neurologic exam, MRI, and electroencephalogram (EEG) results) were also evaluated. HIE staging was assessed for each infant according to Sarnat staging. Cranial ultrasounds were also obtained on day three and day seven of life. Adverse effects of phenobarbital administration were evaluated including hypotension and respiratory depression.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Velaphi-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Velaphi 2013</LINK> reported on seizure activity, death, and neurologic outcome at hospital discharge for 94 term and late preterm infants with perinatal asphyxia (44 infants randomized to placebo plus conventional therapy and 50 infants randomized to prophylactic phenobarbital plus conventional therapy) in a single-center RCT. Eligible infants were 34 weeks' gestation or greater or 2000 g or greater (or both) with evidence of perinatal asphyxia (base deficit greater than 16 mEq/L measured within one hour of life and Apgar score 6 or less at five minutes or requiring resuscitation for more than five minutes). Ninety-four infants met the inclusion criteria and were randomized. Exclusion criteria included presence of congenital abnormalities, inability to randomize by six hours of life, or lack of spontaneous respirations within 20 minutes of life with or without bradycardia. The prophylactic phenobarbital group received conventional therapy plus phenobarbital loading dose (40 mg/kg IV infused over 60 minutes) within the first six hours of life. The control group received conventional therapy plus placebo (normal saline 1 mL/kg IV infused over 60 minutes) within the first six hours of life. Conventional therapy for both groups included regular monitoring of vital signs and administration of dextrose containing IV fluids and antibiotics. Clinical seizures were treated with phenytoin with or without clonazepam. If seizures persisted despite treatment with phenytoin and clonazepam, the code was broken and phenobarbital was administered if the infant had been in the control group. If the infant was in the phenobarbital group, a blood phenobarbital level was obtained and phenobarbital was administered if the level was below the therapeutic range. Measured outcomes included seizures, death, and neurologic outcome at discharge (improving or worsening HIE stage as compared to Sarnat stage at time of enrollment). Neonatal consultants uninvolved the care of the study infants performed neurologic exams according to Sarnat staging in all infants as 12 to 24 hours, two to three days, and five to seven days after birth and on discharge. In addition, possible adverse effects of phenobarbital administration were monitored for including hypotension and respiratory depression.</P>

Participants included term infants 37 weeks' gestation or greater with severe perinatal asphyxia. Infants were determined to have perinatal asphyxia when three of the four criteria of the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists were met (umbilical artery blood pH less than 7.0, base deficit 12 mEq/L or greater, Apgar 3 or less at more than five minutes of life, neonatal neurologic sequelae (i.e. seizures, coma, hypotonia), multiple organ involvement (i.e. kidney, lungs, liver, heart, intestines), or a combination of these. Infants less than 37 weeks' gestation, with major congenital malformations, and with hemolytic disease due to rhesus (Rh) incompatibility were excluded from the study. Sixty-seven infants met the inclusion criteria and were randomized. The prophylactic phenobarbital group received conventional supportive therapy plus phenobarbital loading dose (40 mg/kg IV) during the first four hours after birth. The erythropoietin group received conventional supportive therapy plus subcutaneous erythropoietin (1000 IU/kg per day) for three days. The supportive therapy group received conventional supportive therapy including oxygen, volume expanders, inotrope, diuretics, antibiotics, and anticonvulsants for clinically suspected seizures confirmed by aEEG. Serum levels of antioxidant enzymes (SOD and GPx), TAS, and lipid peroxidation (using MDA levels) were measured at four, 24, 48, and 72 hours and at seven days of life. Mortality, presence or absence of seizures (confirmed by aEEG), neurologic abnormalities on exam at greater than 72 hours of life and at the time of discharge (using Amiel-Tison assessment), and long-term neurologic outcome (including assessment for motor disability and disorders of receptive language, expressive language, and cognitive development) at three, six, nine, 12, and 18 months of age (using Bayley II assessment) were evaluated.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2016-03-29 04:46:31 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Outcome of infants with moderate-to-severe HIE has improved with the introduction of mild hypothermia (<LINK REF="REF-Jacobs-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobs 2013</LINK>). Despite these advances, perinatal asphyxia remains an important cause of death and neurodevelopmental disability. The exploration of additional neuroprotective strategies remains an important clinical issue.</P>
<P>In this review, we identified nine RCTs of prophylactic barbiturates for the prevention of morbidity and mortality in full term and late preterm infants with perinatal asphyxia. Eight of these studies compared prophylactic barbiturate therapy to conventional treatment (enrolling 439 infants) and one study compared barbiturate therapy to treatment with phenytoin (enrolling 17 infants).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Prophylactic barbiturate treatment versus conventional treatment</HEADING>
<P>Only one study reported on the composite primary outcome of mortality or severe neurodevelopmental disability (<LINK REF="STD-Hall-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1998</LINK>). This trial, which compared phenobarbital to conventional therapy, was small and did not blind allocation of the intervention. <LINK REF="STD-Hall-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1998</LINK> reported a significant reduction in the combined outcome of death or severe neurodevelopmental disability in infants treated with phenobarbital.</P>
<P>Regarding the components of our primary outcome, eight trials comparing barbiturates with conventional therapy reported death (<LINK REF="STD-Avasiloaiei-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Avasiloaiei 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gathwala-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Gathwala 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goldberg-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Goldberg 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hall-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ruth-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ruth 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singh-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vargas_x002d_Origel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Vargas-Origel 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Velaphi-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Velaphi 2013</LINK>). No studies found a statistically significant difference in mortality rates between the experimental and control groups and the meta-analysis did not support any difference in mortality.</P>
<P>Only one trial reported on major neurodevelopmental disability in survivors (<LINK REF="STD-Hall-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1998</LINK>). There were 31 infants in this trial, of whom 11 had severe neurodevelopmental disability. This study reported a significant reduction in severe neurodevelopmental disability in infants treated with phenobarbital.</P>
<P>In the current review, the outcome of abnormal neurologic exam at the time of discharge was added post hoc. Though not statistically significant, meta-analysis of the four trials that reported on this outcome showed a trend towards a reduction in the risk of an abnormal exam with the use of prophylactic barbiturate therapy compared to conventional therapy. This trend is of interest as an abnormal neurologic exam at discharge has been shown to be associated with a greater risk of death or disability (<LINK REF="REF-Gunn-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gunn 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sarnat-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sarnat 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shankaran-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shankaran 2012</LINK>), and served as a better predictor of death or disability at 18 months of age than did the treatment group allocation (control versus hypothermia) in a secondary analysis of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) trial of whole body hypothermia (<LINK REF="REF-Shankaran-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shankaran 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Most studies included in this review reported seizures within the neonatal period. Meta-analysis of these trials demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of seizures in infants treated with barbiturates soon after perinatal asphyxia when compared to those who received conventional therapy. In the overall analysis, we noted substantial heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 68%); however, this heterogeneity was not noted in the a priori subgroup analysis of the five trials that used phenobarbital.</P>
<P>Though the reduction in seizures was significant, the clinical importance of this remains unclear. This reduction does not appear, from the limited data available in the current review, to translate into a reduction in the risk of developmental delay. In infants with HIE, clinical seizures may be associated with worse neurodevelopmental outcome, independent of HIE severity (<LINK REF="REF-Glass-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glass 2009</LINK>). In addition, post hoc analysis of data from the Cool-Cap trial revealed that absence of seizures represented an independent predictor of better 18-month outcome in asphyxiated neonates (<LINK REF="REF-Wyatt-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wyatt 2007</LINK>). However, it is unknown whether the successful pharmacologic treatment of seizures can lead to improved neurodevelopmental outcome.</P>
<P>The one trial that compared barbiturate therapy to other nonbarbiturate anticonvulsant therapy did not show a significant difference in the risk of seizures.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Prophylactic barbiturate treatment versus other prophylactic nonbarbiturate anticonvulsant treatment</HEADING>
<P>There were no data reported for the primary outcome for the comparison of barbiturate therapy to other nonbarbiturate anticonvulsant therapy. One study reported on prophylactic barbiturate versus prophylactic phenytoin. There was no significant difference in seizure activity in the neonatal period between the two study groups.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Limitations</HEADING>
<P>A sizable limitation to the current review is that none of the available trials included therapeutic hypothermia as part of standard or conventional management of these infants. Therapeutic hypothermia has been proven to decrease the risk of mortality and neurodevelopmental delay in infants with early moderate-to-severe encephalopathy and has become the standard of care (<LINK REF="REF-Jacobs-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobs 2013</LINK>). This limits our ability to generalize to this population of infants who will receive therapeutic hypothermia. Issues to consider are the pharmacokinetics of phenobarbital during therapeutic hypothermia and the potential for exacerbation of the potential negative effects of phenobarbital administration. However, it may also be that phenobarbital, in the context of therapeutic hypothermia, may provide additional benefit. Phenobarbital administration prior to cooling is associated with an altered temperature profile during induction, with infants reaching goal temperature more quickly compared to infants who did not receive phenobarbital (<LINK REF="REF-Sant_x0027_Anna-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sant'Anna 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Only one study utilized newer bedside technologies for the diagnosis and management of seizures (<LINK REF="STD-Avasiloaiei-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Avasiloaiei 2013</LINK>). Use of aEEG has been increasing as it is readily available at the bedside for immediate assessment of infants and is more readily interpreted without specialized expertise. This use is controversial as it is subject to artefact, and has fewer electrodes than full channel EEG, resulting in potential underdiagnosis of seizure burden (<LINK REF="REF-Shellhaas-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shellhaas 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wusthoff-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wusthoff 2009</LINK>). Nonetheless, given that infants with suspected seizure are routinely monitored by aEEG, use of this modality should be included in studies assessing seizure burden and barbiturate use.</P>
<P>In addition, no uniform definition of perinatal asphyxia was used between studies. In the absence of a valid practical single marker of a hypoxic-ischemic insult (with potential to cause significant cerebral injury), researchers should strive to use consensus based diagnostic criteria and endeavor to collect data relating to the markers in the neonatal period known at present to be associated with a poor neurodevelopmental outcome (e.g. MRI, EEG data, etc.). It is also important for future research to identify other early and reliable markers associated with greatest risk of asphyxial cerebral injury, in order that potential neuroprotective strategies, commenced soon after birth, can be assessed.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-03-28 09:38:16 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Although the administration of prophylactic barbiturate therapy to infants following perinatal asphyxia did reduce the risk of seizures, there was no reduction in mortality and there remains a paucity of data for long-term outcomes. At the present time, the administration of prophylactic barbiturate therapy to late preterm and term infants in the immediate period following perinatal asphyxia cannot be recommended for routine clinical practice.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-03-28 09:43:25 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Given the frequent use of phenobarbital in this population, trials of prophylactic barbiturate therapy remain an important area for further investigation. Future trials should be of high quality, randomized controlled trials with blinding of allocation, performance, and outcome assessment. These studies should be sufficient size to detect clinically important reductions in mortality and severe neurodevelopmental disability and should be conducted in the context of therapeutic hypothermia, as there is currently no data for infants in this setting. The next generation of studies should use 'state of the art' diagnosis and management of seizures in neonates, including either use of amplitude-integrated electroencephalography or continuous video monitoring electroencephalography in the management of these high risk infants.</P>
<P>Potential adverse effects, such as hypotension and respiratory depression following barbiturate therapy, should be prospectively defined and reported. Given the relatively low incidence of perinatal asphyxia, future studies should include a collaborative effort between centers.</P>

<P>There are major differences between the original review and this update. We changed the scope to address only prophylactic use of barbiturates. We added the post hoc comparison 'abnormal neurologic exam at discharge'. We added the methodology and plan for 'Summary of findings' tables and GRADE recommendations, which were not included in the original protocol or in the originally published review.</P>

<APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2016-03-28 16:11:35 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group as outlined in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (2007, Issue 2). This included searches of the Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2007, Issue 2), MEDLINE, previous reviews including cross-references, abstracts, conferences, symposia proceedings, expert informants, and journal handsearching. We did not apply any language restrictions.</P>
<P>The original search strategy for MEDLINE and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Registry is given below. We searched the abstracts of the Society for Pediatric Research and European Society for Pediatric Research, published in the <I>Journal of Pediatric Research</I> from January 1980 to January 2007. We searched cited references from retrieved articles for additional studies. We reviewed abstracts and letters to the editor to identify randomized controlled trials that had not been published and editorials, indicating expert opinion, to identify any further studies, not already included in the review.</P>
