<P>No reliable evidence to distinguish between carbamazepine and valproate for partial onset seizures and generalized onset tonic-clonic seizures.</P>
<P>Epilepsy is a disorder where recurrent seizures are caused by abnormal discharges from the brain. Carbamazepine is commonly used to treat partial seizures while valproate is used for generalized seizures. The review of trials found no evidence to support the belief that valproate is superior to carbamazepine for generalized tonic-clonic seizures. While it was found that younger people fared better on valproate and older people on carbamazepine, this may be because generalized epilepsy is more common in childhood and adolescence.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Carbamazepine and valproate are drugs of first choice for epilepsy. Despite the lack of hard evidence from individual randomized controlled trials, there is strong clinical belief that valproate is the drug of choice for generalized epilepsies and carbamazepine for partial epilepsies. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To overview the best evidence comparing carbamazepine and valproate monotherapy</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group's Specialized Register (27 July 2007), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> Issue 3, 2007), and MEDLINE (1966 to July 2007). No language restrictions were imposed. We also contacted pharmaceutical companies and researchers in the field.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomized controlled trials comparing carbamazepine and valproate monotherapy for epilepsy.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>This was an individual patient data review. Outcome measures were time to withdrawal of allocated treatment, time to 12-month remission, and time to first seizure post randomization. Data were analysed using the stratified logrank test with results expressed as hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), where HR &gt; 1 indicates an event is more likely on valproate. A test for an interaction between treatment and epilepsy type (partial versus generalized) was also undertaken.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Results data were available for 1265 participants from five trials, representing 85% of the participants recruited into the eight trials that met our inclusion criteria. The main overall results (HR) were: time to treatment withdrawal 0.97 (95% CI 0.79 to 1.18); 12 month remission 0.87 (95% CI 0.74 to 1.02); first seizure 1.09 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.25) suggesting no overall difference for these outcomes. The test for an interaction between treatment and epilepsy type was non significant for time to treatment withdrawal and 12-month remission, but significant for time to first seizure. The age distribution of adults classified as having a generalized epilepsy indicate that significant numbers of individuals may have had their epilepsy misclassified.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>We have found some evidence to support the policy of using carbamazepine as the first treatment of choice in partial epilepsies, but no evidence to support the choice of valproate in generalized epilepsies, but confidence intervals are too wide to confirm equivalence. Misclassification of people with epilepsy may have confounded our results, and has important implications for the design and conduct of future trials. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2009-08-12 14:14:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Carbamazepine and valproate are considered first line treatments for epilepsy in Europe and the USA, with valproate the treatment of choice for generalized seizures (generalized tonic-clonic, absence and myoclonic seizures) and epilepsy syndromes, and carbamazepine the treatment of choice for partial seizures (simple partial, complex partial and secondary generalized tonic-clonic seizures) (<LINK REF="REF-Chadwick-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chadwick 1994</LINK>) and epilepsy syndromes. Despite this apparent consensus in treatment policy, there is little in the way of evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to support it.</P>
<P>What evidence does exist is anecdotal, predominantly from case reports and case series. There are reports of a dramatic response of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (a common generalized epilepsy syndrome presenting in the mid teens characterised by myoclonic jerks on awakening, tonic-clonic seizures, with or without absence seizures) (<LINK REF="REF-Delgado_x002d_Escueta-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delgado-Escueta 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gr_x00fc_newald-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grünewald 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Penry-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Penry 1989</LINK>) to valproate, and reports of efficacy for valproate against absence seizures (<LINK REF="REF-Bourgeois-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bourgeois 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jeavons-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jeavons 1977</LINK>). Carbamazepine on the other hand is reported to exacerbate myoclonic (<LINK REF="REF-Shields-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shields 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Snead-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Snead 1985</LINK>) and absence seizures (<LINK REF="REF-Liporace-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liporace 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shields-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shields 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Snead-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Snead 1985</LINK>).</P>
<P>The only RCT that has found a significant difference between carbamazepine and valproate was conducted by the Veterans Administration Group (<LINK REF="STD-Mattson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Mattson 1992</LINK>) and recruited 480 individuals with partial onset seizures, making it the largest trial comparing carbamazepine and valproate to date. People with predominantly complex partial seizures treated with carbamazepine did significantly better for the outcome time to first seizure, although by 12 months there was no difference in the proportion remaining seizure free. No significant difference was found for people with predominantly secondary generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Other comparative randomized controlled trials have been relatively small, and although no significant difference has been found, confidence intervals have been wide and the possibility of important differences existing has not been excluded (<LINK REF="STD-Callaghan-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Callaghan 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Loiseau-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Loiseau 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mattson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Mattson 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Richens-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Richens 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Silva 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Verity-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Verity 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>A systematic review of existing randomized evidence with a meta-analysis of data should provide the best summary of existing data, and inform clinicians as to whether differences in efficacy or equivalence (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 1996</LINK>) have been found, and whether further trials are needed. It should also offer the best means of investigating areas of disagreement. Unfortunately lack of uniformity in reporting of outcome measures, and our need to investigate time to event outcomes preclude a meta-analysis using aggregate or reported data. We have therefore proceeded with an individual patient data approach, which allows a thorough investigation of time to event data, and provides a means of overcoming the lack of uniformity in the reporting of outcome measures in individual trials.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To compare the efficacy and tolerability of carbamazepine and valproate when used as monotherapy in people with partial onset seizures or generalised onset tonic-clonic seizures.</P>

<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>

<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>(1) Children or adults with partial onset seizures (simple partial, complex partial, or secondarily generalizing tonic-clonic seizures) or generalised onset tonic-clonic seizures.<BR/>(2) A new diagnosis of epilepsy, or a relapse following antiepileptic drug withdrawal, or who have failed on other therapies.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Carbamazepine or valproate monotherapy.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>(1) Time to withdrawal of allocated treatment (retention time) from randomization was chosen as the primary outcome. Participants achieved this outcome if allocated treatment was withdrawn for poor seizure control or adverse effects or both, or additional add-on treatment was initiated (ie allocated treatment had failed). This is a combined outcome reflecting both efficacy and tolerability as treatment may be withdrawn due to continued seizures, adverse effects or a combination of both. It is an outcome to which the individual contributes his or her views, and is the primary outcome measure recommended by the Commission on Antiepileptic Drugs of the International League Against Epilepsy (<LINK REF="REF-Commission-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Commission 1998</LINK>). Participants on their allocated drug at the end of follow up were censored. For participants whose treatment was withdrawn because they achieved a remission from seizures, this outcome was censored at the time of drug withdrawal.</P>
<P>(2) Secondary outcomes were time to 12-month remission from seizures, and time to first seizure post randomization, regardless of whether the participant remained on allocated treatment or not (intention-to-treat). For these two outcomes, participants were only censored if no event had occurred at the end of follow up. All partial onset seizure types (simple partial, complex partial and secondary generalized tonic-clonic seizures) contributed to these two outcomes, but generalized tonic-clonic seizures are the only generalized seizure type making a contribution, as other seizure types such as myoclonus and absence are difficult to count and were not recorded in the RCTs included in this review.</P>

<P>Trials were assessed for inclusion by two investigators (Tony Marson and David Chadwick).</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Data collected</I>
</B>
<BR/>The following data were requested for all participants randomized into each trial: age at randomization; sex; presence of neurological signs on clinical examination; seizure types; number of seizures prior to randomization (with dates); date of randomization; drug allocated and dose; dates of follow-up; dates of dose changes; dates of seizures post randomization or seizure frequency data; dates of treatment withdrawal and reason for treatment withdrawal. We also requested any EEG and CT/MRI data that had been collected. For two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Silva 1996</LINK>) follow-up data additional to that used for original trial reports were obtained. Censoring these two studies at the original date of last follow up did not affect the conclusions from the meta-analysis.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Data checking</I>
</B>
<BR/>Range and consistency checks were performed for all trial data supplied. Missing data, errors and inconsistencies were followed up with a nominated individual. Trial details were cross-checked against the published report of each trial including the balance of prognostic factors. The chronological randomization sequence was checked. Missing allocation numbers were followed up with the nominated individual.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Data manipulation</I>
</B>
<BR/>For three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Mattson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Mattson 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Richens-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Richens 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Verity-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Verity 1995</LINK>) seizure data were provided in terms of the number of seizures recorded between clinic visits. Linear interpolation was applied to approximate the days on which seizures occurred. Time to 12-month remission was calculated from the date of randomization to the estimated date the individual had been free of seizures for 12 months. Time to first seizure was calculated from the date of randomization to the date that their first seizure was estimated to have occurred. If seizure data were missing for a particular visit, these outcomes were censored at the previous visit. These outcomes were also censored if the individual died or follow up ceased prior to the occurrence of the event of interest. These methods were used for the remaining two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Silva 1996</LINK>) for which outcome data were provided directly.</P>
<P>Data on the reason and date of withdrawal of allocated treatment were provided in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Mattson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Mattson 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Richens-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Richens 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Verity-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Verity 1995</LINK>). For the remaining two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Silva 1996</LINK>) these data were extracted from study case report forms by two of the review authors (Tony Marson and Paula Williamson). Both review authors independently extracted data from all case report forms, and disagreements were resolved by re-reviewing the case report forms at conference. For the analysis of the time to withdrawal of allocated treatment, an event was defined to be either the withdrawal of allocated treatment due to poor seizure control or adverse effects or both, poor participant compliance, or the addition of another antiepileptic drug. The outcome was censored if treatment was withdrawn because the individual achieved a period of remission or if the individual was still on allocated treatment at the end of follow up.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Analysis</I>
</B>
<BR/>The analysis was by intention-to-treat and included all randomized participants as far as possible, analysed in the treatment group to which they were allocated, irrespective of which treatment they actually received. Analyses used the original seizure classifications that were used in the published reports of trials </P>
<P>Stratified logrank tests, stratified by trial (<LINK REF="REF-EBCT-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">EBCT 1990</LINK>) were employed to investigate the main effects of drug and covariates, and drug-covariate interactions. Clinical heterogeneity was assessed by reviewing the differences across trials in characteristics of randomized participants and dosing protocols. Results are expressed as hazard ratios (HR), and by convention a HR &gt; 1 indicates that an event is more likely on valproate. Hence for treatment withdrawal a HR &gt; 1 indicates a clinical advantage for carbamazepine, and for time to 12-month remission (or first seizure) a HR &gt; 1 indicates a clinical advantage for valproate.</P>

<P>Of the five trials for which individual patient data were provided, two recruited children (<LINK REF="STD-Verity-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Verity 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Silva 1996</LINK>) and three recruited adults (<LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mattson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Mattson 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Richens-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Richens 1994</LINK>). All five studies recruited participants with partial onset seizures (simple/complex partial or secondarily generalized seizures). Four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Richens-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Richens 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Silva 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Verity-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Verity 1995</LINK>) recruited participants with generalized tonic-clonic seizures. However, if these people were experiencing other generalized seizure types such as absence or myoclonus, only generalized tonic-clonic seizures were recorded, hence only generalized tonic-clonic seizures contribute to analyses. </P>
<P>Four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Richens-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Richens 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Silva 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Verity-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Verity 1995</LINK>) recruited predominantly newly diagnosed drug naive individuals, whereas the other study (<LINK REF="STD-Mattson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Mattson 1992</LINK>) recruited 50% newly diagnosed and 50% who had either had a relapse following drug withdrawal, or who were considered inadequately treated on existing monotherapy. </P>
<P>Data were available for the following participant factors (percentage of participants with data available): type of epilepsy (100%); sex (100%); number of seizures in the 6 months prior to randomization (95%); age at randomization (99%) and time since first seizure to randomization (71%). EEG data had been recorded for all five studies, but only computerized for three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Mattson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Mattson 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Richens-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Richens 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Verity-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Verity 1995</LINK>). For one of these three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Mattson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Mattson 1992</LINK>), EEG data have been computerized, but are yet to be subjected to data checking procedures by the original trialists. Across the trials, EEG data had not been collected in a uniform way, and we were unable to generate clinically meaningful categories for the purpose of this analysis. Similar difficulties were encountered with CT/MRI data, and neurological examination findings.</P>

<BR/>All five trials used adequate methods of concealment of randomization, two used telephone randomization (<LINK REF="STD-Richens-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Richens 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Verity-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Verity 1995</LINK>) and three used sealed opaque envelopes (<LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mattson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Mattson 1992</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-de-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Silva 1996</LINK>). One trial was double blinded (<LINK REF="STD-Mattson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Mattson 1992</LINK>) and used a 'double dummy technique' (individuals received carbamazepine and placebo valproate, or valproate and placebo carbamazepine).

The test for homogeneity suggests some evidence against this (p = 0.02) (<I>see</I> 'heterogeneity for time to 12-month remission' below').</P>
<P>No difference in overall treatment effect was found and the estimated HR was 0.87 (95% CI 0.74 to 1.02), adjusted for epilepsy type, suggesting a potentially important advantage to carbamazepine. Results stratified for epilepsy type give a summary HR of 0.96 (95% CI 0.75 to 1.24) for generalized epilepsy, and 0.82 (95% CI 0.67 to 1.00) for partial epilepsy. Although this subgroup analysis suggests a statistically significant advantage for carbamazepine in people with partial epilepsy, the test for an interaction between treatment and epilepsy type found no significant interaction, so this result requires cautious interpretation.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>(4) Heterogeneity for time to 12-month remission</I>
</B>
<BR/>Univariate logrank analyses were used in an initial attempt to investigate the heterogeneity for this outcome, and age was the only participant factor to show heterogeneity of effect across trials. The test for an interaction between age and treatment effect was significant (chi squared = 3.21, (df = 1), p = 0.007), but not for any of the other participant factors. We found a significant trend with age (p = 0.007) (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>), with younger individuals faring better on valproate, and older individuals on carbamazepine.</P>
<P>This result is of interest given the clinical belief that valproate is the treatment of choice for people with generalized epilepsies, and the fact that generalized epilepsy syndromes are much more likely to present in childhood and adolescence (<LINK REF="REF-Desguerre-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Desguerre 1994</LINK>). This raises the question as to whether this interaction between age and treatment is a true effect of age, or whether age is acting as a marker for epilepsy syndrome and seizure type, given that generalized epilepsies are more likely to present in childhood and adolescence. In our primary analyses the test for an interaction between treatment and epilepsy type was not significant for time to 12-month remission. It is interesting that close examination of the age distribution of people classified as having generalized tonic-clonic seizures in <LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Richens-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Richens 1994</LINK> shows that 36% and 44% of participants respectively were classified as having a generalized epilepsy with onset over the age of 30 years. This suggests that a significant proportion of people with epilepsy may have had their epilepsy misclassified, and if so, this may have masked an interaction between treatment and epilepsy type.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>(5) Secondary analyses using reclassification rules</I>
</B>
<BR/>To further investigate the effects of misclassification, we have undertaken secondary analyses using three reclassification rules: (a) people classified as having a generalized epilepsy older than a range of ages (25 to 30 years) were reclassified as having a partial epilepsy (results for a cut off at age 30 are presented here, but results were similar for all age cut offs); (b) people reclassified by the original trialists were allocated to their reclassified group and (c) people classified as having a generalized epilepsy but having simple or complex partial seizures during follow up were reclassified as having partial epilepsy. We have also undertaken analyses in which these potentially misclassified participants were analysed in a third 'unclassified' group. Results are similar to those presented below.</P>
<P>The numbers of participants reclassified for each rule were: (a) 105; (b) 66 and (c) 77. Results are shown in <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>. Rule (a) is the only rule that makes material differences to the results, where in contrast to our primary analyses, a significant interaction between treatment and epilepsy type is found for time to 12-month remission. Care is needed in the interpretation of this result, as although this may represent a true interaction between drug and epilepsy type, an alternative interpretation is that we have forced the results to mimic the effect of age which could be an independent prognostic factor. For time to first seizure, the test for an interaction is suggestive for all reclassification rules, lending support to this result being a true finding.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>In this systematic review we have synthesized individual patient data from 1225 individuals, but like the original trials, we have not found an overall difference between carbamazepine and valproate for the primary global outcome time to treatment withdrawal. This outcome may be influenced by both the relative efficacy of the two drugs compared, as well as differences in tolerability and safety. Because a difference in efficacy in one direction may be confounded by a difference in tolerability in the other, it may not be surprising that any estimated differences are small. The confidence intervals for these global outcomes are too wide to confirm equivalence, as clinically important differences have not been excluded, particularly when results for the partial and generalized subgroups are examined. Given the difficulty in demonstrating an interaction between seizure type and treatment effect for 'purer' efficacy outcomes, it is not surprising that we have found no evidence for an interaction for this outcome.</P>
<P>For our efficacy outcomes, the analysis for time to first seizure found a significant interaction between treatment and epilepsy type, where patients with a partial epilepsy do better on carbamazepine. For time to 12-month remission, results for the subgroup of people with a partial epilepsy indicate a significant advantage for carbamazepine, although the test for an interaction between treatment and epilepsy type was not significant. These results do not provide outright evidence in favour of carbamazepine for people with a partial epilepsy, however they are in keeping with prior clinical belief, and support the policy of using carbamazepine as the treatment of choice for patients with a partial epilepsy. We have found no evidence to support the policy of using valproate as the treatment of choice for patients with generalized tonic-clonic seizures as part of a generalized epilepsy. However, the number of people in the generalized epilepsy subgroup was small, and confidence intervals are wide, and we have not been able to exclude the existence of an important therapeutic difference. </P>
<P>So why have we failed to find consistent evidence of a treatment-epilepsy type interaction, despite strong clinical belief to the contrary? Firstly, it may be that there is no interaction. Alternatively, it may be that an interaction does exist but we have failed to detect it. There are several reasons why this might have occurred.</P>
<P>(1) Our meta-analysis may not have the statistical power needed to detect an interaction.</P>
<P>(2) Generalized tonic-clonic seizures were the only generalized seizure type contributing to analyses. It may be that there is no difference between carbamazepine and valproate for control of this seizure type, but important differences could exist for absence and myoclonus. However, were this the case, we might have expected to see a treatment-epilepsy type interaction for the outcome time to treatment withdrawal if treatment were being withdrawn or added to combat other seizure types. </P>
<P>(3) Due to the strong clinical belief that valproate is the treatment of choice for people with myoclonus and absence seizures, physicians may have been reluctant to randomize people with epilepsy syndromes particularly responsive to valproate in to these studies, (eg. juvenile myoclonic epilepsy). This seems unlikely given that the recruitment for those studies recruiting individuals with generalized tonic-clonic seizures took place some time before such beliefs became widely held in the UK.</P>
<P>(4) The results of the original studies and hence this meta-analysis may have been confounded by classification bias, ie. people with partial epilepsy have been misclassified as having generalized epilepsy and possibly vice versa. These studies were initiated before the publication of the International League Against Epilepsy Classification of Epileptic Syndromes in 1989 (<LINK REF="REF-Commission-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Commission 1989</LINK>). However, they did use the International League Against Epilepsy Classification of Epileptic Seizures that was published in 1981(<LINK REF="REF-Commission-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Commission 1981</LINK>), which does allow individuals to be classified in to those with partial or generalized epilepsies. Two studies attempted to combat classification problems by having an expert committee (<LINK REF="STD-Verity-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Verity 1995</LINK>) or individual (<LINK REF="STD-Richens-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Richens 1994</LINK>) reassess the classification of each individual by reviewing case histories and EEGs, however this information was not used for the original trial reports. For the two MRC studies (<LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Silva 1996</LINK>), clinicians were allowed to reclassify participants, but reclassification data was not sought in a systematic way. The age distribution of participants classified as having generalized tonic-clonic seizures, along with our results based on reclassifying potentially misclassified participants, indicate that classification bias is a potentially important confounder of the results of this study. This issue must be addressed in future trials.<BR/> </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The results of this systematic review do not provide unequivocal evidence on which a choice between carbamazepine and valproate for the global outcome time to treatment withdrawal. For time to 12-month remission and time to first seizure, results support the policy of using carbamazepine as the treatment of first choice in people with a partial epilepsy. The belief that valproate is superior to carbamazepine for generalized tonic-clonic seizures as part of a generalized epilepsy is not supported by this data. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Finding overall differences between these standard antiepileptic drugs has proved elusive. If overall differences do exist across heterogeneous populations of individuals such as those studied here, those differences are likely to be small, and in order to be clinically useful, future comparative antiepileptic drug studies will need to be powered accordingly. It has been argued that future comparative antiepileptic drug studies should be powered to establish equivalence (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 1996</LINK>), and therefore be capable of detecting what is considered the smallest important clinical difference.</P>
<P>If future studies are to detect whether particular antiepileptic drugs are to be preferred for certain epilepsy syndromes they will need to be designed and powered accordingly. One approach would be to conduct trials that recruit only patients with specific epilepsy syndromes. However, an approach more likely to reflect and inform clinical practice, as well as being statistically more powerful would be to recruit heterogeneous populations for whom epilepsy syndromes have been adequately defined, with testing for interaction between treatment and epilepsy syndrome. In view of potential problems of misclassification, syndromes will have to be well defined, adequate checking mechanisms will be required to ensure that classifications are accurate, and a system to recognize uncertainty is necessary for individuals about whom this exists. </P>
<P>Clinical uncertainty about seizure and syndrome classification is often present at the time of diagnosis and initial treatment of epilepsy, and significant numbers of people with newly diagnosed epilepsy cannot be classified (<LINK REF="REF-Bodensteiner-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bodensteiner 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ottman-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ottman 1993</LINK>). Seizures may have been few and unwitnessed, and investigations are commonly unhelpful, but nevertheless, there is no doubt that seizures have occurred and should be treated. This most commonly applies to tonic-clonic seizures that may be generalized at onset, or which may be secondarily generalized. In any study such unclassified individuals need to be clearly identified. If they are not, they may confound interpretation of results for well classified individuals. We need to know how to manage those whom we find difficult to classify, as well as those whose classification we find more difficult.</P>
