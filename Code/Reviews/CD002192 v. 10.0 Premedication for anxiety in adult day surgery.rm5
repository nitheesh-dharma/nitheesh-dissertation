<TITLE>Premedication for anxiety in adult day surgery does not delay discharge of patients.</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-08-03 09:46:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Day case surgery, where patients are sent home on the same day as the operation, is a common clinical practice which is no longer confined to simple procedures. Premedication with drugs to reduce anxiety prior to general anaesthesia may be withheld from patients due to concerns that they may delay recovery after surgery. This may reduce the efficiency of day surgery units and has important economic considerations. It may also lead to unanticipated hospital admission which can be unacceptable for patients. However, some patients would still like the option of anxiety reducing medication.</P>
<P>We identified 17 studies which compared premedication with a placebo prior to day case surgery. Twelve studies involved benzodiazepines (sedatives), two involved opioids (painkillers), two involved beta-blockers, one compared a benzodiazepine with a beta-blocker and one involved a herbal medication. In general, the studies were of poor quality and many used anaesthetic techniques which are no longer common. Only seven studies directly measured time to ambulation or discharge and found that this was not affected by the use of premedication. Some studies used specific tests to assess for residual effects of the premedication. Although these were often impaired after surgery, this did not appear to delay discharge.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-08-10 15:10:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Since the early 1980s, it has become more and more common to carry out surgical procedures on a day case basis. Many patients are anxious before surgery yet there is sometimes a reluctance to provide sedative medication because it is believed to delay discharge from hospital.This is an updated version of the review first published in 2000 (previous updates 2003; 2006).</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effect of anxiolytic premedication on time to discharge in adult patients undergoing day case surgery under general anaesthesia.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2009-08-10 15:10:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>We identified trials by computerized searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I>, 2009 Issue 1 ); MEDLINE (1980 to January 2009); EMBASE (1980 to January 2009). We also checked the reference lists of trials and review articles and handsearched three main anaesthesia journals.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2009-07-30 13:49:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included all identified randomized controlled trials comparing anxiolytic drug(s) with placebo before general anaesthesia in adult day case surgical patients.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-08-10 15:10:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>We collected data on anaesthetic drugs used; results of psychomotor function tests where these were used to assess residual effect of premedication; and on times from end of anaesthesia to ability to walk unaided or readiness for discharge from hospital. Formal statistical synthesis of individual trials was not performed in view of the variety of drugs studied.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-08-10 15:10:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>We included 17 studies. Methodological quality of included studies was poor. Of these 17, only seven studies specifically addressed the discharge question; none found any delay in premedicated patients. Two other studies used clinical criteria to assess fitness for discharge, though times were not given. Again, there was no difference from placebo. Eleven studies used tests of psychomotor function with or without clinical measures as indicators of recovery from anaesthesia. In none of these studies did the premedication appear to delay discharge, although performance on tests of psychomotor function was sometimes still impaired. Three studies showed no impairment in psychomotor function, six showed some impairment which had resolved by three hours or time of discharge and two showed significant impairment.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-08-10 15:10:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>We found no evidence of a difference in time to discharge from hospital, assessed by clinical criteria, in patients who received anxiolytic premedication. However, in view of the age and variety of anaesthetic techniques used and clinical heterogeneity between studies, inferences for current day case practice should be made with caution.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2009-08-10 15:10:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-03-31 22:06:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Day case surgery is now an established and integral part of modern healthcare. Maximizing the potential for day case procedures may be a priority for health care providers (for instance <LINK REF="REF-NHS-Scotland-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHS Scotland 2006</LINK>). As anaesthesia for day case surgery has developed, there has been an incentive to provide a quick recovery time (<LINK REF="REF-Narula-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Narula 2008</LINK>). This has been aided by modern anaesthetic drugs with a shorter duration of action and less side effects. In some centres the concept of 'fast tracking' is popular, where time in a recovery area is bypassed entirely (<LINK REF="REF-Millar-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Millar 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is common practice in many day case surgical units to withhold anxiolytic premedication. There are two reasons for this. First, it has been deemed unnecessary; patients undergo minor procedures and in the past may have been selected, amongst other things, for their psychological suitability for this type of admission. However, a large proportion of surgery is now performed on outpatients, and therefore this is unlikely to still be true. <LINK REF="REF-Mackenzie-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mackenzie 1989</LINK>, found that 19% of pre-operative day case patients would have liked something to relieve their anxiety. Second, it is commonly believed that sedative premedication makes patients too sleepy postoperatively to be discharged on time. If correct, this would be even more troublesome nowadays as day case units must run efficiently to allow greater numbers of patients to be treated.</P>

<ELECTRONIC_SEARCHES MODIFIED="2009-08-10 15:10:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library, </I>2009, Issue 1); MEDLINE (1980 to January 2009); EMBASE (1980 to January 2009). Our electronic search terms from the original review (Smith 2000) can be found in <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>.

<P>We chose 1980 as the earliest year for searching because preliminary searches had suggested that patients were seldom anaesthetized on a day case basis earlier than this. Furthermore, in reports from 1981 and 1982, the premedicants and anaesthetic drugs used were irrelevant to present-day anaesthetic practice.</P>

<P>We examined the bibliographies of identified articles to look for further references. We also used standard textbooks and monographs to identify relevant material.</P>
<P>We contacted the Product Information Departments of the five drug companies which make the most commonly-used premedicants reported in the identified studies. We also contacted five well-known researchers in the field to see if they too were aware of unpublished reports.</P>
<P>In the original review <LINK REF="REF-Smith-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2000</LINK> we hand-searched three journals <I>(British Journal of Anaesthesia</I>, <I>Canadian Journal of Anaesthesia</I> and <I>Anesthesia and Analgesia</I>: issues from 1984 to the end of 1997); in case some papers had not been indexed under the search terms used.</P>

<P>We identified 45 potentially relevant studies, 17 of which were included (see table '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>'); 28 studies did not meet the inclusion criteria and were excluded from the review (see table '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>').

<P>Many reports identified had other flaws which might affect the validity of their findings. These are further described under '<LINK TAG="INTERVENTION_EFFECTS" TYPE="SECTION">Effects of interventions</LINK>'.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2009-08-10 15:10:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>The studies use a large number of different premedicant drugs, and many make multiple comparisons. Further, because of the variety of anaesthetic techniques and possible outcomes, it was not possible to combine any two studies even when the same premedicant was used. Consequently the data have not been presented numerically.</P>
<P>In all but two studies the anaesthetic technique was standardized; in <LINK REF="STD-Jakobsen-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Jakobsen 1985</LINK> some patients received halothane and some a muscle relaxant and in <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1981</LINK> where some patients received fentanyl and enflurane in addition to thiopentone.</P>
<P>We have presented results by outcome measure of study, rather than by pharmacological group of premedicant. The three main groups of drugs were benzodiazepines, beta-adrenoceptor blockers and opioids. One study used a herbal medication (passiflora incarnata).<BR/>Studies used a number of different ways of assessing postoperative recovery:</P>
<P>1. Clinical measures only (for instance, walking unaided or readiness for discharge) either (a) with or (b) without exact times.</P>
<P>2. Tests of psychomotor function only (most commonly digit-symbol substitution, Trieger dot test, letter deletion test and tests of memory).</P>
<P>3. Both clinical and psychomotor function.</P>
<P>4. Others.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1a. Studies using clinical measures of recovery and stating times to discharge</HEADING>
<P>These three studies were the only ones which could be used to answer our review question directly. (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pandit-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pandit 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shafer-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Shafer 1989</LINK> ) gave times, for instance, time spent in the post-anaesthesia recovery area or time to discharge; there was no evidence of a difference from placebo.</P>
<P>In Clark's (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1981</LINK>) practice patients were not discharged until they could walk, retain oral fluids and pass urine, maintaining stable vital signs throughout. Recovery time (not explicitly defined, but implied time from end of anaesthesia to discharge) was slightly prolonged in patients who had received pethidine and atropine, but this difference did not reach statistical significance. Mean times (with standard deviation) in the enflurane arm were 187 (43 minutes) in premedicated patients and 176 (36 minutes) in unpremedicated. The corresponding figures for the thiopentone group were 193 (29 minutes) and 179 (37 minutes). There is thus a trend towards prolonged time to discharge, but this did not reach statistical significance. As there is no report of a power calculation for the numbers needed to reach statistical significance, this result must be interpreted with caution.</P>
<P>In the study of <LINK REF="STD-Pandit-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pandit 1989</LINK>, all four intravenous opioids (see table '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>') were effective at relieving anxiety when given 30 minutes before the induction of anaesthesia. Times to ambulation and discharge showed no evidence of a difference between groups (including placebo). Mean time to ambulation was greater than two hours in all groups. Mean time to discharge was 181 minutes in the sufentanil group and longer again in the other groups. There was no evidence of a significant difference between groups, and again patient numbers were small (five groups of 20 patients each) with no report of a power calculation.<BR/>

<LINK REF="STD-Shafer-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Shafer 1989</LINK> randomized patients to receive an intramuscular injection (midazolam 5 mg or saline) 30 to 60 minutes before surgery, followed by an intravenous injection (saline, fentanyl 100 microg or oxymorphone 1 mg) three to five minutes before induction. Times to ambulation and discharge were shorter than times reported in other studies, mean (with standard deviation) time to discharge being 84 (20 minutes) in the placebo group and 94 (38 minutes) in the midazolam/fentanyl group. As there were six possible treatment combinations, it is perhaps not surprising that analysis of those patients who had received midazolam showed results similar to those from all patients. Indeed, the authors cite an earlier study of midazolam premedication (<LINK REF="REF-Artru-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Artru 1986</LINK>) suggesting that larger numbers than they recruited would be needed to reliably detect a significant difference between groups.</P>

<P>Again, these two studies found no evidence of a difference from placebo. <LINK REF="STD-Beechey-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Beechey 1981</LINK> used temazepam 20 mg or 30 mg depending on patient weight. One hour after operation, there was no evidence of difference from placebo in patients' ability to walk unaided, but seven patients in the treatment group and eight in the placebo group were still incapable of walking without help and could not have been discharged.<BR/>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Jakobsen-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Jakobsen 1985</LINK> compared diazepam 10 mg with placebo. Patients had to satisfy the following criteria for discharge - (a) be fully awake; (b) be able to stand without discomfort; and (c) be willing to go home. All but two of their 202 patients were discharged 'on time', although a number of them were still deemed to be 'slightly affected' by the anaesthetic. This was related to duration of anaesthesia (greater than 45 minutes) rather than premedication. Exact timings are not given, but patients did not appear to have been assessed for discharge until the evening, though most underwent surgery in the morning. This would be unusual in current day case practice.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Ahmed-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ahmed 1995</LINK> found that, one hour after the end of anaesthesia, memory and letter deletion were significantly impaired in those patients who had received midazolam, but three hours thereafter there was no evidence of differences between the groups.</P>
<P>Dyck and Chung (<LINK REF="STD-Dyck-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dyck 1991</LINK>) tested their patients with digit span repetition and Trieger Dot Tests two hours after anaesthesia; patients who had been premedicated with propranolol 80 mg performed better than those who had received placebo, whilst diazepam 10 mg impaired performance after one and two, but not three hours. They conclude: 'Diazepam causes postoperative psychomotor impairment and offers no clear anxiolytic advantage. Propranolol is not a superior anxiolytic to diazepam or placebo but does offer a faster return of cognitive function postoperatively'.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Raybould-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Raybould 1987</LINK> found significant impairment of function in patients who had received midazolam 15 mg preoperatively. The authors conclude: 'Midazolam 15mg . . . .did prolong recovery to a degree unacceptable in day case surgical patients'.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Turner-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Turner 1991</LINK> compared midazolam 10 mg, temazepam 20 mg and placebo.

<LINK REF="STD-Movafegh-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Movafegh 2008</LINK> found that following passiflora incarnata there was no difference from baseline psychomotor testing at 90 minutes following extubation and there was no difference in discharge times.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Forrest-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Forrest 1987</LINK> demonstrated that many patients who had received the active treatments (midazolam 15 mg, triazolam 0.25 mg, diazepam 10 mg (90 minutes before surgery) still had impaired psychomotor function four hours after emergence. Some patients in all groups showed sway on Romberg's test also. The authors conclude: 'The doses of triazolam and midazolam were too high for routine use. The duration of action of 0.25mg triazolam was excessive and a dose of 15mg of midazolam was to sedative at the time of induction'. However, none of these observations prevented all patients being discharged from hospital four hours after anaesthesia<BR/>

<LINK REF="STD-Obey-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Obey 1988</LINK> found that all patients who received temazepam either 10 mg or 20 mg were fit for discharge three hours following a brief (six to eight minute) methohexitone anaesthetic in accordance with their unit's policy, though their discharge criteria were not specified.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-08-10 15:10:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Our review has found little evidence to support the idea that anxiolytic premedication delays discharge after day case anaesthesia. This finding appears to hold for a range of premedicant drugs in a variety of settings. However, the diversity of drugs, doses and contexts means that comparing studies is difficult and formal statistical meta-analysis would be inappropriate. However, the results should be interpreted with caution in view of the following factors.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Methodological quality of included studies</HEADING>
<P>The validity of a systematic review is influenced greatly by the validity of its component studies. The quality of blinding and allocation concealment of included studies was variable. In general, the quality of methodological reporting was poor. The oldest study achieved the lowest score, and it appears that more attention has been paid to reducing bias in more recent work. However, apparent discrepancies in validity may simply be due to differences in reporting the studies. Although anaesthetic techniques were well standardized in all but two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1981</LINK> ;<LINK REF="STD-Jakobsen-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Jakobsen 1985</LINK>), some trials identified by our search did not compare active treatments with placebo. As these studies could not therefore address our review question, they were not included in our analysis. Furthermore, power analyses were seldom conducted to determine adequate sample sizes. Consequently, even studies with high-quality blinding and allocation concealment may still not provide reliable results. No attempt has been made to weight the results of different studies according to their methodological quality.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Although the question we want to answer in clinical practice is 'Does anxiolytic premedication delay discharge after adult day case surgery?', few studies used this outcome. In fact, this outcome is still a rather crude measure, as actual discharge is affected by many other factors apart from the possible residual effect of the premedication. Pain, nausea and vomiting may cause delay, for instance. However, logistics and organization of the unit may be even more important. The time at which discharge becomes possible would be a more meaningful measure, but this was not used in any of the studies we found. A further problem is that, whilst emergence, early recovery and time to discharge are end-points often referred to in studies, definitions may differ between institutions.</P>
<P>Considering how effective a drug is in reducing anxiety may influence choice or decision to use. Comparing the clinical effectiveness of different anxiolytic regimes was beyond the scope of this review and we are unable to comment on which anxiolytic medications are the most effective in reducing anxiety or have the least adverse risks.</P>
<P>Tests of psychomotor function are valuable when studying subtle drug effects, and there were instances where premedicant drugs were demonstrated to be still active. The critical flicker fusion threshold and letter deletion tests, for instance, are claimed to detect the effects of minor degrees of sedation (<LINK REF="STD-Cashman-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Cashman 1989</LINK>), but no relationship has been established between performance on these tests and gross motor functions such as time to being able to walk or the clinical state of readiness for discharge. Indeed, the critical flicker fusion threshold test can detect residual drug effect 19 hours after anaesthesia (<LINK REF="REF-Moss-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moss 1987</LINK>) and it would be unrealistic to wait until it had returned to normal before discharging a patient. In the context of recovery from anaesthesia, tests of memory may be the most useful (<LINK REF="REF-Bethune-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bethune 1981</LINK>).</P>
<P>Not only might these be the best tool for the purpose, but memory function has practical relevance in that, although patients may be given written and spoken information pre-operatively, it may be necessary to tell them more after anaesthesia. It may be that the limiting factor for premedication is not the delay it may have on walking or discharge but rather the time until the patients regains the capacity to handle new information.</P>
<P>Many of the studies located were designed primarily to test the pre-operative action of anxiolytic drugs. Most of these assessed the drugs' effects using tests of psychomotor function. Only five studies used purely clinical measures of recovery from anaesthesia. This point is important because it appears that the answers to the two questions posed in the '<LINK TAG="OBJECTIVES" TYPE="SECTION">Objectives</LINK>' section above depend not only on the drugs used, but also on how postoperative recovery is assessed. Those which used both clinical measures and tests of psychomotor function often found a discrepancy between test performance and clinical readiness for discharge. Patients were discharged in the studies of <LINK REF="STD-Forrest-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Forrest 1987</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Richardson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Richardson 1997</LINK> despite impairment of test performance, although this finding was not shared by <LINK REF="STD-Abdul_x002d_Latif-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Abdul-Latif 2001</LINK>. Since the aim of day case anaesthesia is to return patients as rapidly as possible to a condition where they can be allowed home into the care of a responsible adult, an objective clinical scoring system to determine this might be the most appropriate measure to use. One such system has been proposed (<LINK REF="REF-Chung-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chung 1995</LINK>) and might be incorporated as a clinically meaningful end-point for future studies addressing this review's question. This would complement tests of memory function in detecting residual drug effects.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Changes in practice</HEADING>
<P>Day case anaesthesia has changed considerably within the time period covered by the review. The reports identified, published from 1981 to 2005, are likely to reflect clinical practice from 1978 to 2002. Techniques, drugs and more especially the organization of day case units have changed. Many of the studies used anaesthetic drugs which are either not now in routine use or are known to delay recovery. Consequently many reports identified cannot be applied to current practice. We feel that it is still useful to identify them as one of the functions of a systematic review is to act as an archive of all the studies published on a particular issue. Furthermore, not all countries in the world are able to afford the drugs commonly used for day case anaesthesia in affluent nations, and so older Western studies may still be relevant. The practice of premedication has changed too.</P>
<P>Giving a drug one to two hours before anaesthesia may not always be feasible, and in some institutions the use of intravenous pre-treatment or 'co-induction' may be more usual. The studies of <LINK REF="STD-Shafer-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Shafer 1989</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Pandit-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pandit 1989</LINK> illustrate this trend. The effects of drugs given in this way may be different from earlier administration.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Statistical manipulation of data</HEADING>
<P>Due to the variety of drugs, doses and routes of administration used even in the seven studies mentioning discharge times, there are no two groups which could be compared directly by formal meta-analysis.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-05-25 19:12:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review suggests that certain anxiolytic premedicants used in specified doses do not delay discharge. However, caution is advised in applying the findings of the studies in this review outside the organizational contexts where the research was conducted.</P>
<P>An important practical point, though not directly related to our outcome measures, is that patients who are significantly sedated before anaesthesia may pose a problem in that they may need to be nursed on beds or trolleys and require closer attention than those who are alert. This may have consequences for staffing on the day case unit. In contrast, as all patients will be sleepy after anaesthesia, any sedation from the residual effect of the premedication will not demand any change in practical management. The beta-adrenoceptor blockers therefore offer both practical as well as theoretical advantages over the other premedicants studied. In one study the herbal medication Passiflora incarnata reduced anxiety with no difference in sedation or discharge time. However, due to a small sample size, this requires clarification in further studies.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-05-25 19:06:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Future work in this area would benefit from greater attention to methods of randomization, allocation concealment and sample size calculation. Further studies are required in the context of up to date anaesthetic techniques. Wider use of clinical measures of recovery from anaesthesia would make assessment of readiness for discharge more straightforward, and tests of memory function may offer advantages over tests of other aspects of psychomotor function.</P>
<P>Reporting data in dichotomous form (for instance, were patients ready for discharge at 60 minutes [yes/no], 90 minutes [yes/no],120 minutes [yes/no]) would enable direct comparisons to be made between patients in different studies.</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY MODIFIED="2008-02-07 16:10:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is disappointing that this review did not include any outcomes of efficacy of anxiolytic premedication so that some sort of an assessment could be made of risk-benefit. The conclusions may suggest to the lay reader that premedication for day surgery is safe (and it is implied that it is effective). This has not been shown to be the case in this review where methodology of included studies was poor and outcomes of interest of this review were not the primary outcomes being investigated by many of the included studies.</P>
</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2008-02-08 11:26:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We would like to thank Dr Cyna for his interest in, and comment on, our review. His statement that many studies were of poor quality and used primary outcomes other than the one of interest to us is of course correct. Our aim was not to prove or disprove the efficacy of the drugs for the purposes they are used, though we agree that without this it is not possible to make a balanced judgement about risk and benefit. We would be happy to include a comment in the next version of the review about safety and effectiveness.</P>
