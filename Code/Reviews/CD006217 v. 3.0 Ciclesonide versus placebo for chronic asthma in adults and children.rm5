What strikes me on reading through this review again is the lack of exacerbation data (which is not surprising in view of the short duration of the studies). I have emphasised this more as it is the first primary outcome.&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;In more severe asthma treated with oral steroids, ciclesonide was more effective than placebo in one study.&amp;quot; I have removed the single study outcome from the abstract and added the beneficial effects on symptoms and rescue inhaler use.&lt;br&gt;I noted that SMD was not selected for symptoms in the 100mcg comparison and changed this. The point estimates and CI for symptoms did not match the forest plots so I have changed them to do so. Please check this!&lt;br&gt;Changes are shown in red.&lt;br&gt;I have removed the advice on low doses for new asthmatics as the trials were not on new asthmatics!&lt;br&gt;Spell check run.&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;br&gt;++++++++++++++++&lt;br&gt;CJC Feb 14&lt;br&gt;Please change 16#2 so both placebo entries are 8 for Gelfand and adjust GIV entries to reflect this.&lt;br&gt;Chris&lt;br&gt;+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;br&gt;CJC Editing Feb 11&lt;br&gt;Authors' Contribution - fine&lt;br&gt;Objectives&lt;br&gt;ACTION: This review compares CIC to placebo, and includes different doses. I have amended the title to reflect this and the objectives in the abstract. I have also changed to past tense. See track changes.&lt;br&gt;References&lt;br&gt;ACTION: checked by Liz.&lt;br&gt;Table of included studies&lt;br&gt;ACTION: Very thorough but please harmonise all the doses to be ex-valve throughout. Can you do the same for the labelling of the graphs. Does this move Gelfand 80 to the 100 section, and 160 to the 200 section or not?&lt;br&gt;Metaview Labels&lt;br&gt;ACTION: Checking data for Gelfand the WMD needs amendment in 16#1 sections 2 and 5, for the 160 dose to 0.29 in the Treatment mean column (identical to its SD as it happens). Also the AM and PM PEF in the active treatment arms need to be changed to match Table 3 (for PM) and the graph for AM. The amended results will then need to go into the GIV analysis corrected where they appear. In 16#2 part 1 the Gelfand placebo arms should both be 8 (not 5) from the figure in the paper. Again this needs alteration in the GIV analyses (eg 2#2). I have cross checked the Adachi and Pearlman data entries and they look fine.&lt;br&gt;2#28,29 has the graph labels the wrong way around.&lt;br&gt;Synopsis&lt;br&gt;ACTION: minor edits made&lt;br&gt;Abstract&lt;br&gt;ACTION: minor edits made. Why are doses above 200mcg not given a mention in the results? There is plenty of data in the 400mcg v placebo comparison?&lt;br&gt;Methods&lt;br&gt;ACTION: fine&lt;br&gt;Results&lt;br&gt;ACTION: See changes in green. Please amend the result for Change in FEV1 for children 100 v placebo and 80 v 160.......&lt;br&gt;Why are the high dose results not mentioned in the results section (if only to say there was a single study looking at 1600mcg).&lt;br&gt;Discussion&lt;br&gt;ACTION: Please see the changes I have made. &lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Study withdrawal &amp;amp; adverse event data&lt;br&gt;***This paragraph does not make sense at present***Study withdrawal mainly due to lack of efficacy occurred less frequently on low doses ciclesonide (CIC200 or less) compared to placebo and at higher doses (400mcg), this effect was observed from studies in adults, but not from paediatric trials. However, study withdrawals due to lack of efficacy was more likely at low doses of ciclesonide in adults and at higher doses of ciclesonide in adults or children. Specific adverse events did not differ between placebo or CIC. &amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;Contentious issues&lt;br&gt;ACTION: 7 primary outcomes including an Asthma Control measure in the protocol......... the latter is not in the review. Do you want to mention that this was not feasible?&lt;br&gt;Spellchecked&lt;br&gt;ACTION: not yet.&lt;br&gt;Next action&lt;br&gt;Back to Toby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;br&gt;hi toby&lt;br&gt;sorry for the delay&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;i have had a look at CIC vs placebo&lt;br&gt;basically its fine and well done&lt;br&gt;some comments:&lt;br&gt;metaview 6.01, 6.02 : are the labels the wrong way around? effect size in text is different to the figs&lt;br&gt;6.10 unexpected result ? check&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL CHECKED - THE LABELS HAVE BEEN CHANGED NOW AND THE DATA FOR CANDIDIASIS ARE VERIFIED. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;things to comment on in discussion:&lt;br&gt;how was candidiasis assessed? may be worth commenting on this&lt;br&gt;was is by oral swab and isolation of candida, or by patient self report, or by inspection by study coordinator?&lt;br&gt;this is an important point since they make a big thing of less oral side effects, which doesnt sem to come out in the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;the effect size is smaller than i would have expected compared to placebo&lt;br&gt;no data on exacerbations. i would comment on this as a significant negative, ie it is not known whether cic can prevent asthma exacerbations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;peter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;-------------------&lt;br&gt;Hi Pat,&lt;br&gt; Thanks for the email - sorry not to have responded sooner. I have added the text to the background section. However, I think that we need to clarify the amendment to Peter's suggested 'composite' control score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My suggestion is that we tabluate the following outcomes as effect sizes expressed in SMD:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;am PEF&lt;br&gt;FEV1&lt;br&gt;Symptoms&lt;br&gt;Rescue medication usage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We should retain them in the analyses as discreet outcomes, but the compromise solution is that we are able to give a narrative overview of whether they appear to be in agreement in terms of their 'effect size'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attached is the protocol - if this is OK with you I will send this back to Chris Cates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Best wishes,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toby &lt;br&gt;--------------------------&lt;br&gt;cjc Editing May 12 06&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors' Contribution: very concise. Will need more detail when we come to the review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives : Fine, but this is really two reviews (one versus placebo and second versus other ICS). Are you happy to take on and update both? Also how long do you consider the minimum duration for studies. I am aware that there are published short term studies that concentrate on side effects but I do not think these are helpful unless considered against efficacy in the same patients and efficacy needs longer term studies for ICS. Three months minimum perhaps. Please consider this and add to the objectives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How will you establish the validity of the composite outcome measure and how will you avoid post hoc decisions about combining and weighting the different domains. I think you will need to specify this in advance in the protocol as this is a new departure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References : checked by Liz - thanks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods : fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contentious issues : will the studies be powered to show important differences. There are once daily budesonide studies published too so how does this fit with once daily ciclesonide? Cost should be considered somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next action : back to authors for consideration of the duration and combined outcome issues please Toby.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2008-07-22 10:51:22 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson" REVIEW_NO="CIC1-AST" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.0.14" REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="3.0">

<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>In asthma, inflammation (swelling in the wall) narrows the airway and is the main factor giving rise to asthmatic symptoms of cough, wheeze, shortness of breath and chest tightness. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) which are given usually more than once daily are now recommended as first line therapy for most people with asthma. The currently available ICS, such as budesonide (BUD), beclomethasone (BDP) or fluticasone (FP), have been available for many years and have proven to be an important therapy for controlling inflammation and symptoms. However, these drugs can be associated with significant side-effects, especially local effects in the upper airways such as hoarseness and oral candida (thrush infection). The main reputed advantage of ciclesonide (CIC, a new generation of ICS), is its ability not only (as with other ICS) to be delivered locally by inhalation but specifically to the lower airways of the lung in a form which potentially minimises local side-effects. Overall this advantage of CIC could lead to a reduction of local airway side-effects with once daily therapy and thereby improving adherence to therapy. The results from this review indicate that CIC at low to moderate doses improves lung function and reduces asthma symptoms compared to placebo, but the short duration of the studies means that there is a lack of information about the impact on asthma exacerbations. Thus the currently recommended doses of CIC of 100-200 mcg daily would seem appropriate. However, the number of studies in the higher dose range are low and further studies are therefore required in adults and children to determine whether higher CIC doses will give significant benefit without increasing adverse events. It will also be important to determine in clinical studies how CIC compares to the other currently available ICS in terms of efficacy and safety in asthmatic adults and children in order to determine the precise role of CIC therapy in asthma. The published data are insufficient to assess the reputed safety advantage of ciclesonide, and better assessment and reporting in studies is required to address this important question. </P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Inhaled corticosteroids are an integral part of asthma management, and act as an anti-inflammatory agent in the airways of the lung. These agents confer significant benefit in terms of symptom management and improvement in lung function, but may also cause harm in terms of local and systemic side-effects. Ciclesonide is a novel steroid that has efficient distribution and release properties that mean it can be taken once daily, making it potentially useful in ongoing asthma management. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the efficacy of inhaled ciclesonide in adults and children with chronic asthma. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Airways Group register of trials with pre-defined terms. Additional searches of CENTRAL and PubMed were undertaken. The literature searches for this review are current up to June 2007. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised parallel or crossover studies were eligible for the review. We included studies comparing ciclesonide with placebo, and we also included studies comparing ciclesonide at different doses. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors assessed studies for inclusion in the review, extracted data independently and checked each others' work. We contacted study investigators in order to obtain additional data. Extracted data were entered into RevMan 4.2 and analysed as fixed effect mean differences for continuous data, and fixed effect risk ratios for dichotomous data. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Eighteen trials (reporting 20 study comparisons) met the review entry criteria. We report findings from 18 group comparisons where data were available (6343 participants, of whom 1692 were children). </P>
<P>Ciclesonide versus placebo: The short duration of the included studies means that there is a lack of data with respect to the impact of ciclesonide on asthma exacerbations. At doses of 100 mcg/d or less up to 400 mcg/d in mild to moderate asthma, ciclesonide improved lung function, asthma symptoms and rescue inhaler use, compared with placebo. </P>
<P>Dose response outcomes: Comparisons of 100 versus 200 mcg/d, 100 versus 400 mcg/d and 400 versus 800 mcg/d did not yield significant differences in lung function outcomes. <BR/>Adverse event data were not available in sufficient detail to permit assessment of the safety profile of this drug. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Ciclesonide was more effective than placebo, in the short term, in improving lung function in patients with mild to moderate asthma previously treated with inhaled corticosteroids. There remain questions as to dose response, and the lack of data on the longer term impact on exacerbations and safety profile should be addressed in future studies. <BR/>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-07-22 10:48:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>On a worldwide basis asthma is a common chronic disease in clinical practice affecting over 300 million people. It is responsible for one in 250 deaths per year and 15 million disability adjusted life years (DALYs) lost worldwide. It is a condition which can develop in early childhood and generally persists into adulthood (<LINK REF="REF-Gerritsen-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerritsen 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Martin-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 1969</LINK>). Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways involving a complex interaction between airway structural cells and specific allergic inflammatory cells including mast cells, eosinophils and T-lymphocytes, and the release of specific cytokines and mediators of inflammation. This inflammatory response is associated with airway narrowing, especially in smaller airways, which cause patients to complain of symptoms such as cough and wheeze (<LINK REF="REF-Tattersfield-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tattersfield 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-GINA-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 1998</LINK>). The anti-inflammatory corticosteroids have been an effective therapy for asthma for over 30 years and are now the main therapy for asthma control currently for those with persistent asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Adams-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Powell-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powell 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-BGAM-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">BGAM 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-BTS_x002f_SIGN-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS/SIGN 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Consensus-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Consensus 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Consensus-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Consensus 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-GINA-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 1998</LINK>). </P>
<P>Corticosteroids deal effectively with the asthma inflammatory process through interaction with the glucocorticoid receptor, thus leading to the amelioration in asthma symptoms and control of the disease. The main advantage of the inhaled route is to bring the therapy directly to the disease location and at a reduced dose and hence less systemic side-effects compared to higher dose oral steroid therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Mash-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mash 2001</LINK>). There are different types of inhaled corticosteroids available on the market given either by multi-dose dry powder or aerosol inhaler devices (e.g. beclomethasone, fluticasone, budesonide, and mometasone). Inhaled corticosteroids significantly reduce the hospitalisation rate for asthma (and hence reduce cost associated with the disease) and the mortality from the condition when taken on a regular basis (<LINK REF="REF-Suissa-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suissa 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Suissa-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suissa 2002</LINK>). Non-compliance is a significant problem with inhaled corticosteroid therapy due to a number of factors including increased dosing frequency and local or systemic side effects (<LINK REF="REF-Buston-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buston 2000</LINK>). However, while inhaled steroids may be effective when used morning and evening, reducing dosing to a once daily dosing regimen can give also effective control (<LINK REF="REF-Malo-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malo 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Toogood-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toogood 1982</LINK>). Compliance with increased dosing frequency of inhaled steroids in asthmatics, especially four times daily can be poor (<LINK REF="REF-Coutts-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coutts 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eisen-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eisen 1990</LINK>). The novel inhaled corticosteroid ciclesonide (CIC) has recently been approved in Europe. Research from clinical trials has shown the drug to be an effective therapy in persistent asthma in improving lung function, and in reducing asthma symptoms. This therapy has novel release and distribution properties, reported to result in better targeting of the anti-inflammatory effects in the airways especially to the small airways. It is inhaled as a pro-drug, which is converted to an active metabolite (des CIC) in the airways, reportedly with reduced systemic and local (e.g. oropharyngeal) side effects. In addition, ciclesonide can also be given once daily, and may lead to better compliance with inhaled corticosteroids.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objectives of this review were to compare the efficacy and safety of ciclesonide in adults (aged 18 years and older) and children (less than 18 years) who have persistent asthma of any severity compared with placebo therapy, and with ciclesonide at alternative doses.</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCT) comparing the inhaled ciclesonide with placebo were considered for inclusion. Trials that use parallel group designs or cross-over design with a washout period of two weeks or more were eligible. Studies published in abstract form and unpublished data were also eligible for inclusion. </P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Adults (aged 18 years and older) and children (less than 18 years) were eligible for inclusion. All study subjects had a diagnosis of chronic asthma, including those with intermittent and chronic symptoms. Studies that base the diagnosis of asthma on physician opinion or on objective criteria related to symptoms, airway reversibility to an inhaled short-acting 2-agonist or airway hyper-responsiveness in keeping with international asthma guidelines such as <LINK REF="REF-GINA-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 1998</LINK> (Global Initiative On Asthma) / National Institutes of Health (NIH) or <LINK REF="REF-BTS_x002f_SIGN-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS/SIGN 2003</LINK>) or evidenced based guidelines were included. Studies that delivered interventions to patients in the community/family practice setting or hospital-based settings were included. Studies with subjects with pulmonary diagnosis other than asthma (e.g. COPD) were excluded.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Studies that included inhaled ciclesonide at any dose versus placebo, or compared different doses of ciclesonide were considered. A second review of ciclesonide in comparison with other inhaled corticosteroids, such as budesonide, beclomethasone, fluticasone, triamcinolone, flunisolide has been undertaken separately. Therapy should be for at least 4 weeks. Concomitant therapies for asthma, such as short-acting beta2-agonists (rescue therapy), theophyllines, long-acting 2-agonists (Serevent or formoterol), inhaled anti-cholinergics were allowed provided that patient's asthma is stable. </P>

<P>Literature searches current up to June 2007 identified a total of 148 citations and 18 trials representing 53 of these citations, and reporting 20 study comparisons, met the review entry criteria (see <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>).

<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>Thirteen studies were described as randomised and double-blinded. The method of blinding was known in two studies. One dose-comparison study was open label (<LINK REF="STD-Adachi-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Adachi 2007b</LINK>). Methodological quality, as assessed by the Jadad scoring system, was variable. Only one of the studies achieved a score of 5 (high quality), three studies a score of 4 (good quality), six a score of 3 (fair quality) and the remaining four studies a score of 2 (poor quality). Three of the low quality studies were published in abstract form for presentation at international respiratory or allergy conferences and we had only limited details about patient withdrawals from study, methods of randomisation and blinding. It is therefore possible that these scores represent an underestimation of the true methodological quality.</P>

The two parallel group studies which did not yield any data remain unpublished in full text form as of August 2007 (<LINK REF="STD-Baena-Cagnani-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Baena Cagnani 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bernstein-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bernstein 2004</LINK>). The studies did not provide information on asthma exacerbations, but in comparison with placebo, lung function assessments favoured ciclesonide in studies of up to 12 weeks duration. The evidence available on adverse events is insufficient to draw reliable inferences regarding its safety and tolerability.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Placebo comparison</HEADING>
<P>Although the doses assessed indicated favourable effects of ciclesonide, the effect sizes were somewhat smaller than those established by similar reviews of beclomethasone, budesonide and fluticasone (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Adams-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Adams-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2005b</LINK>). However, indirect comparison between these preparations may not be reliable, since it assumes that the populations recruited to the efficacy studies of the respective preparations were pre-treated with similar doses of inhaled steroids. Nevertheless it is noteworthy that ciclesonide studies conducted in adults and adolescents yielded a difference in FEV1 of between 0.13 to 0.17 against placebo in the ranges from 100 to 400 mcg/d. Studies conducted in pre-trial maintenance inhaled steroid users from meta-analysis of fluticasone studies gave a larger effect size of 0.33 L (personal communication). The eligibility criteria of the trials stipulated a requirement for maintenance inhaled corticosteroid treatment as a maximum BDP equivalent of 800-1000 mcg/d (<LINK REF="STD-Adachi-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Adachi 2007a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chapman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chapman 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-EFC6163a" TYPE="STUDY">EFC6163a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-EFC6163b" TYPE="STUDY">EFC6163b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Langdon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Langdon 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pearlman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Pearlman 2005</LINK>), and group mean airway obstruction was lower than 80% in the studies. Thus, requirement for pre-baseline steroid treatment was indicative of a more severe patient population in the ciclesonide studies than those of fluticasone trials.</P>
<P>In OCS users, (i.e. subjects on lowest maintenance oral steroids for 12 months), a single study found that ciclesonide permitted a reduction in the oral maintenance steroid dosage and prevented falls in FEV1 while improving morning PEF (daily dose of 800 and 1600 mcg). This was also associated with a greater likelihood of oral candidiasis in the combined ciclesonide group, but the increase was not statistically significant. Pharyngitis was not a problem in these high doses of ciclesonide. A similar finding was reported for high dose FP 1000-1500 in <LINK REF="REF-Adams-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2005b</LINK>, whereby FP was associated not only with a greater likelihood of oral candidiasis, but also sore throat and symptoms of hoarseness.</P>
<P>Adverse event data did not yield findings that provide firm guidance on the effects of ciclesonide. The studies available may not been conducted over a sufficient period of time in order to provide useful data to this end. The reputed benefits of ciclesonide in terms of fewer local side-effects remain to be shown by additional trials of longer duration, that assess for oral candida using microbiological confirmation of infection.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Dose response analysis</HEADING>
<P>The analyses of the dose ranging studies was limited, with inconclusive effects on FEV1 found in adults between 100 and 200 mcg/d, and also between doses of 100 and 400 mcg/d. In terms of am and pm PEF no significant changes were found between low and higher doses of ciclesonide. This highlights some uncertainty in the lower dose ranges of ciclesonide, and reinforces the requirement for more work in this area. Currently the effect estimates do not provide evidence that increasing the dose of ciclesonide confers significant benefit, but the confidence intervals are too wide to draw any conclusions.</P>
<P>Since the number of studies and participants is low, the evidence base may be underpowered to identify a dose response curve in ciclesonide. The confidence limits do not exclude the possibility of a meaningful effect in favour of higher doses. The data from placebo groups are also noteworthy with baseline details of <LINK REF="STD-Gelfand-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Gelfand 2006a</LINK> indicating that participants had moderate airway obstruction (around 69% predicted of FEV1), and placebo-treated children saw FEV1 improve by 0.22 L over baseline values.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Quality of Life, exacerbations and asthma symptoms</HEADING>
<P>Data from studies conducted in adults indicated that ciclesonide led to significant improvements in both quality of life (QoL) and asthma symptoms at low doses compared with placebo. Currently the effect estimates do not provide evidence that increasing the dose of ciclesonide confers significant benefit; as with the lung function endpoints in the confidence limits do not exclude the possibility of a meaningful effect in favour of higher doses.</P>
<P>There is a lack of evidence regarding the impact of ciclesonide on the prevention of exacerbations of asthma which prompt additional treatment with steroids or presentation in acute care settings. Studies reporting outcome data which are defined adequately in terms of the required treatment strategy would help to establish the role of ciclesonide in the management of asthma better.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Effect size overview (Table 1)</HEADING>
<P>Since the number of studies in the medium and high dose ranges were low, we tabulated effect sizes (given as standard deviation units) for FEV1, am PEF, symptoms and rescue medication use for the low dose comparison with placebo. This indicated that the effect size was stronger for symptoms and rescue medication use than for lung function outcomes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Limitations of the review</HEADING>
<P>One large parallel group trial only available as a conference abstract has not contributed data to this review, which is a safety study conducted over 12 months (<LINK REF="STD-Baena-Cagnani-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Baena Cagnani 2006</LINK>). Given the relatively low numbers of studies contributing data to primary outcomes analysed in this review, the absence of published data could leave the effect estimates open to the threat of publication bias. We could not reliably detect this since the most number of studies available for analysis was for any one outcome was six, meaning that funnel plot asymmetry may not be a sensitive instrument for assessing this.</P>
<P>In summary, the evidence from this review indicates that in short term studies at low and moderate doses (50-800 mcg/d), ciclesonide is effective in improving lung function, and reducing symptoms compared with placebo in patients previously treated with regular inhaled steroids. There is a lack of evidence regarding the impact of ciclesonide on exacerbations. Effects from dose response studies have been conflicting and do not yet show how the dose response curve of ciclesonide compares with that of other steroid preparations such as fluticasone or beclomethasone. It is feasible that differing characteristics of the participants recruited to the studies in this review may have affected the behaviour of outcomes in the dose response comparisons, since placebo controlled trials with low attrition rates likely reflect a response to inhaled therapy in people with mild asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2006</LINK>). In view of the limited evidence available on the effects of increasing the dose of ciclesonide this review cannot make firm recommendations regarding the dose response curve of ciclesonide.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The results of this review clearly show a short-term benefit of ciclesonide compared to placebo, in terms of lung function, symptoms and rescue inhaler use. The results have not identified an apparent dose-response effect of ciclesonide across a wide range of doses. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The included studies are of short duration and the number of studies in the medium and high dose range are low; thus further longer term studies in adults and children at higher doses are required to determine the impact of ciclesonide on exacerbations and to assess whether increasing the doses of ciclesonide confers significant benefit and to evaluate, as yet, unidentified safety issues with this strategy. In <LINK REF="STD-Bateman-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bateman 2006</LINK>, CIC at higher doses allowed a reduction in oral steroid doses in steroid dependant asthmatics . Further studies are needed to identify the usefulness and safety of recommending this strategy on a wider basis for such patients. Finally, it will be important to evaluate and compare the efficacy and safety of ciclesonide with currently available inhaled corticosteroids. </P>
