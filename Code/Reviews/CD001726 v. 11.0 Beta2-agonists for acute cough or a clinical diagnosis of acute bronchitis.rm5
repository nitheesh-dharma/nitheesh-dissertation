<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-08-31 09:16:44 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz  Dooley">
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Acute bronchitis is a chest infection, with cough and sometimes sputum production, chest pain and fever. People affected feel unwell and for those who do not have asthma or chronic lung disease there is no clear treatment. Viruses cause most cases of bronchitis, so antibiotics usually do not help. Beta2-agonists (such as albuterol or salbutamol) are drugs that relieve asthma by relaxing muscles that cause narrowing in the passages to the lungs. They are sometimes used to relieve the cough in acute bronchitis, even in people who do not have asthma.</P>
<P>
<B>Review question </B>
</P>
<P>What are the benefits and harms of beta2-agonist drugs for children or adults with a cough from acute bronchitis, and with no other lung disease?</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>Our searches are current to May 2015. We found no new trials. In previous searches, we found seven randomised controlled trials that used beta2-agonist drugs for people with acute bronchitis. Two trials studied children aged one to 10 years (134 participants) and five were conducted in adults (418 participants). None of the studies reported receiving grants from drug-making companies to conduct the study, but people who work for a drug maker were listed as authors on reports from two trials and study drugs were supplied free of charge by the company in three trials.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Daily cough scores were no different between children given oral beta2-agonists and children in the placebo control groups. Daily cough scores, or the number of people still coughing after seven days, did not change in the adult trials either.</P>
<P>However, the results were mixed. Some trials show a benefit and some show no benefit. This may be because some participants also had wheezing or other signs of narrowed airways, in which case beta2-agonists may be helpful only for them. More of the adults taking beta2-agonists had tremor, shakiness or nervousness.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>We rated this as low or moderate. There were few trials, with small numbers of people with acute bronchitis or cough. The trials were of short duration (three to seven days) and only two used inhaled beta2-agonists, which is now the usual way the drug is taken by adults and older children. Some important information about how the trial was done was not mentioned in the papers giving results for many of the trials.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-08-06 17:35:07 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The diagnosis of acute bronchitis is made on clinical grounds and a variety of clinical definitions have been used. There are no clearly effective treatments for the cough of acute bronchitis. Beta2-agonists are often prescribed, perhaps because clinicians suspect many patients also have reversible airflow restriction (as seen in asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)) contributing to the symptoms.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-08-31 09:16:18 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz  Dooley">
<P>Two trials of moderate quality in children (n = 134) with no evidence of airflow restriction did not find any benefits from oral beta2-agonists. Five trials in adults (n = 418) had mixed results but overall summary statistics did not reveal any significant benefits from oral (three trials) nor from inhaled (two trials) beta2-agonists. Three studies with low-quality evidence demonstrated no significant differences in daily cough scores, nor in the percentage of adults still coughing after seven days (control group 71%; risk ratio (RR) 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63 to 1.18; 220 participants). In one trial, subgroups with evidence of airflow limitation had lower symptom scores if given beta2-agonists. The trials that noted quicker resolution of cough with beta2-agonists were those with a higher proportion of people wheezing at baseline. Low-quality evidence suggests that adults given beta2-agonists were more likely to report tremor, shakiness or nervousness (RR 7.94, 95% CI 1.17 to 53.94; 211 participants; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 2).</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-08-06 17:51:23 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is no evidence to support the use of beta2-agonists in children with acute cough who do not have evidence of airflow restriction. There is also little evidence that the routine use of beta2-agonists is helpful for adults with acute cough. These agents may reduce symptoms, including cough, in people with evidence of airflow restriction. However, this potential benefit is not well supported by the available data and must be weighed against the adverse effects associated with their use.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-08-07 20:44:38 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-08-06 18:51:06 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Acute bronchitis is a clinical syndrome characterised by cough in association with, or preceded by, other symptoms of upper respiratory infection. Affected individuals may also have sputum production, dyspnoea, chest pain and fever. Acute bronchitis is a common illness and leads to about 10 ambulatory care visits per 1000 people per year (<LINK REF="REF-Armstrong-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armstrong 1999</LINK>). Although acute bronchitis is a self-limiting condition, most patients feel ill and many do not perform their usual activities. Unfortunately, in those who do not have underlying pulmonary disease there is no clear optimal treatment for this common condition. Clinicians often prescribe antibiotics in spite of the fact that most cases of bronchitis are believed to be caused by viral infections (<LINK REF="REF-Gonzales-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gonzales 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mainous-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mainous 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meza-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meza 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oeffinger-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oeffinger 1998</LINK>). A Cochrane review has determined that antibiotics are of little overall benefit (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2014</LINK> ). It is important, therefore, to examine the possible effectiveness of alternative therapeutic approaches to treat symptoms.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-08-06 18:51:24 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>One potentially effective treatment may be beta2-agonists, which can be administered either orally or via metered dose inhaler, and are used to relieve bronchoconstriction in people with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-08-07 20:44:38 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Indirect evidence to support the use of beta2-agonists in acute bronchitis comes from two camps. First, people have been shown to have impaired airflow from bronchial reactivity when infected with pathogens (such as viruses and the bacteria <I>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</I> (<I>M. pneumoniae</I>) and <I>Chlamydia pneumonia </I>(<I>C. pneumonia</I>)) known to cause acute bronchitis (<LINK REF="REF-Hahn-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hahn 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Melbye-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Melbye 1994</LINK>). In one study, 41% of people diagnosed with acute bronchitis had less than 80% of the predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV-1) (<LINK REF="REF-Williamson-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williamson 1987</LINK>). Second, cough is the primary symptom in some people who have asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1991</LINK>) and a majority of such people may have total resolution of symptoms with beta2-agonist therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Ellul_x002d_Micallef-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ellul-Micallef 1983</LINK>). It is therefore possible that bronchial reactivity may lead not only to the dyspnoea of which some people with acute bronchitis complain, but to the cough, which is also the hallmark of the illness. These symptoms may both respond well to beta2-agonists. These agents have been shown to be effective in reducing cough due to other acute causes such as bronchoscopy (<LINK REF="REF-Vesco-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vesco 1988</LINK>) and intravenous fentanyl (<LINK REF="REF-Lui-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lui 1996</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-08-06 18:53:45 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>If beta2-agonists are effective for acute bronchitis then they should be more widely used. Surveys of US family physicians reported that only a small minority routinely prescribe beta2-agonists for this condition (<LINK REF="REF-Mainous-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mainous 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oeffinger-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oeffinger 1998</LINK>). However, these agents can cause adverse effects, such as skeletal muscle tremor, tachycardia, or other cardiac arrhythmias, and should clearly not be used if there is no good evidence for their effectiveness.</P>

<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of participants with acute cough or a diagnosis of acute bronchitis, allocated either to a beta2-agonist group or to a no-beta2-agonist group.</P>
<P>Although the pathophysiological definition of acute bronchitis seems clear (an inflammation of the tracheobronchial tree in association with a generalised respiratory infection), the clinical definition of acute bronchitis is not standardised. The third edition of the International Classification of Health Problems in Primary Care (<LINK REF="REF-ICHPPC_x002d_2-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICHPPC-2 1983</LINK>) defines acute bronchitis as cough with scattered or generalised abnormal chest signs (wheeze, coarse or moist sounds). However, textbooks describe a variety of clinical presentations. Some texts state that abnormal chest signs (for example, wheezing, rhonchi, rales or coarse breath sounds) should be heard (<LINK REF="REF-Stern-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stern 1996</LINK>), and other texts state that abnormal signs may be heard (<LINK REF="REF-Gwaltney-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gwaltney 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marrie-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marrie 1998</LINK>) but that examination of the chest may also be normal (<LINK REF="REF-Weller-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weller 1996</LINK>). There are similar conflicting statements regarding whether sputum must be present and what the character of the sputum, if present, should be. Studies (chart reviews and surveys) of clinicians have also revealed a variety of clinical definitions of acute bronchitis (<LINK REF="REF-Dunlay-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dunlay 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oeffinger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oeffinger 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Verheij-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verheij 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vinson-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinson 1991</LINK>). Although cough is universally described, there is wide variation regarding the need for abnormal chest findings or sputum to make this diagnosis. In this meta-analysis we therefore included studies that enrolled participants who received a clinical diagnosis of acute bronchitis or acute cough, unless the cough was felt to be clearly due to another aetiology, such as pneumonia or sinusitis. We realise that some of these participants may have had an upper respiratory infection (that is to say, the common cold) and not inflammation of the tracheobronchial tree. However, many clinicians do indeed call this condition acute bronchitis. Through subgroup analyses, we attempted to determine whether such participants might respond differently to beta2-agonist treatment from those who have other signs which more clearly suggest lower respiratory tract involvement.</P>

<P>The primary outcome measures are symptoms that we believe would be important to patients.</P>
<P>Our methodology for including the specific outcomes was as follows: after we selected the studies that would be included in our review, one review author listed all of the outcomes reported in the various studies. The other three review authors, who were blinded to the results for each outcome in each of the studies, then determined which outcomes we would include in the review based on the criteria mentioned above. We used this approach to minimise selective reporting bias in our choice of outcomes.</P>
<P>The studies reported a variety of outcomes, most of which were not reported in every study we included. Our decision to include an outcome was not determined by the number of studies that reported that outcome, because we believe that important outcomes should be included in our review even if they are not reported in all or even most of the studies.</P>

<P>Two review authors (CF, JS) independently reviewed all the retrieved titles and abstracts to determine which studies appeared to meet the inclusion criteria for the initial review (<LINK REF="REF-Smucny-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smucny 2001</LINK>). This initial screen was sensitive; we selected studies for potential inclusion unless a study clearly did not meet our inclusion criteria. We retrieved selected studies identified by either author in their entirety. Two review authors (RG, JS) reviewed the results of the first updated search that was conducted in July 2003 (<LINK REF="REF-Smucny-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smucny 2004</LINK>). Three review authors (LB, RG, JS) assessed the results of the second updated search that was conducted in November 2005 (<LINK REF="REF-Smucny-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smucny 2006</LINK>).

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2015-08-10 08:50:23 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz  Dooley">
<P>The review authors of the initial version of this review extracted the data. We did not repeat the data extraction or analyses as we identified no additional studies for this update. One of the review authors (JS) deleted the journal of publication, title, author(s), affiliation(s) and results sections of each study; and compiled a list of the outcomes measured in each study for the initial version of this review. The other three review authors (LB, CF, RG) determined which outcomes would be included in our review, first independently and then through discussion. The same three review authors then reviewed all of the articles that had passed the initial study selection screen and excluded any article that all three review authors agreed did not meet our inclusion criteria. We then distributed the remaining articles in their entirety to all review authors, each of whom independently extracted the data from each study for every selected outcome. Again, we resolved any disagreements by discussion and consensus.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2015-08-10 08:50:41 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz  Dooley">
<P>In the initial version of the review, we assessed risk of bias using the Jadad scale (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>). For the 2011 update, we reassessed the methodological quality of included studies using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We used one article to discuss issues and standardise our approach (<LINK REF="STD-Bernard-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bernard 1999</LINK>). Each of the four review authors of this update independently assessed the article. We then discussed each item and arrived at a consensus for each item. Two review authors (either LB and MK or JW and JH) independently assessed each of the remaining studies using a standardised form that included a section for each of the risk of bias domains and explicitly addressed co-interventions, compliance, timing of outcome assessments and trial sponsorship by a manufacturer as 'Other' sources of bias (<LINK REF="APP-06" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 6</LINK>). The same two review authors then compared their results for each item and resolved disagreements by consensus.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2015-08-06 19:31:48 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We calculated summary statistics with Review Manager 5 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>) software. We reported risk ratios (RR), absolute risk differences (RD), and numbers needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) or harmful outcome (NNTH) for dichotomous outcomes (such as the presence or absence of a symptom at the time of follow-up). In calculating RRs, RevMan adds 0.5 to cells with zero values. We reported mean differences (MD) for continuous linear outcomes, such as duration of symptoms in days; and standardised mean differences (SMD) for continuous ordinal outcomes, such as cough symptom scores. We considered a level of P less than 0.05 as being statistically significant.</P>

<P>Seven trials (with a total of 552 participants) met our inclusion criteria in our original search (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). We identified no additional trials in the updated searches (<LINK REF="REF-Becker-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Becker 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smucny-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smucny 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smucny-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smucny 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smucny-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smucny 2006</LINK>) or for this 2015 update. Four studies were performed in the United States, two in Finland and one in Norway. Six RCTs compared beta2-agonists with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Bernard-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bernard 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hueston-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hueston 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Korppi-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Korppi 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Littenberg-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Littenberg 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Melbye-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Melbye 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tukiainen-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Tukiainen 1986</LINK>) and one RCT compared a beta2-agonist (oral albuterol) with an antibiotic (erythromycin) (<LINK REF="STD-Hueston-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hueston 1991</LINK>). The beta2-agonists used in the randomised placebo-controlled trials were oral albuterol (or salbutamol) (<LINK REF="STD-Bernard-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bernard 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Korppi-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Korppi 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Littenberg-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Littenberg 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tukiainen-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Tukiainen 1986</LINK>), inhaled albuterol (<LINK REF="STD-Hueston-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hueston 1994</LINK>) and inhaled fenoterol (<LINK REF="STD-Melbye-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Melbye 1991</LINK>). Two of the randomised placebo-controlled trials had three groups: salbutamol plus dextromethorphan, dextromethorphan only and placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Korppi-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Korppi 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tukiainen-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Tukiainen 1986</LINK>). We limited our analyses of these studies to only the salbutamol plus dextromethorphan group versus the dextromethorphan only group. <LINK REF="STD-Hueston-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hueston 1994</LINK> had a factorial design with four groups: albuterol inhaler plus erythromycin, albuterol inhaler plus placebo, placebo plus erythromycin and placebo plus placebo. The published paper from this trial reported only the combined data for the two groups given albuterol versus the two groups not given albuterol. The trial author stated that there was no statistical interaction between albuterol and erythromycin, so we believe that it is valid to use the combined data in this review.</P>
<P>Regarding other co-interventions, three trials prohibited other antitussives (<LINK REF="STD-Bernard-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bernard 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Korppi-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Korppi 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tukiainen-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Tukiainen 1986</LINK>); two trials allowed them and recorded their use as an outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Hueston-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hueston 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Littenberg-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Littenberg 1996</LINK>); one allowed them, but did not record this use (<LINK REF="STD-Hueston-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hueston 1991</LINK>); and the last did not mention co-interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Melbye-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Melbye 1991</LINK>). Only one trial prohibited the use of antibiotics (<LINK REF="STD-Tukiainen-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Tukiainen 1986</LINK>); all other trials comparing beta2-agonists with placebo or dextromethorphan allowed the use of antibiotics at the discretion of the clinician (except as noted above for <LINK REF="STD-Hueston-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hueston 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two trials were limited to children (age range one to 10 years, means 3.3 and 3.8 years); and the rest enrolled only adults. One of the studies in children excluded those with abnormal lung examinations (<LINK REF="STD-Bernard-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bernard 1999</LINK>) and the other excluded those with bronchial obstruction requiring bronchodilating medication (<LINK REF="STD-Korppi-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Korppi 1991</LINK>). None of the adult trials excluded people with wheezing and the percentage of participants with this finding ranged from 20% to 44% in the four trials that mentioned it (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). All adult trials included both smokers and non-smokers. The duration of illness was less than four weeks in all trials. All trials enrolled participants who initially presented to primary care settings.</P>
<P>The duration of treatment was seven days in five trials, four days in one and three days in the last. Participants or their parents kept daily diaries of symptoms and other items. In three trials, participants were re-evaluated after seven days of treatment.</P>
<P>The only trial that mentioned how well participants adhered to study medications reported more than 95% compliance for both groups (<LINK REF="STD-Hueston-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hueston 1991</LINK>).</P>

Studies reported data in a variety of ways: as average duration of symptoms; presence or absence of symptoms daily or after a specified time period, or both; or as symptom scores. Studies that used symptom scores each had unique scoring systems that incorporated subjective measures of the frequency or severity of the symptoms, or both. Higher scores indicated more frequent or severe symptoms, or both.</P>

<P>Neither trial involving children demonstrated any benefits from albuterol. In <LINK REF="STD-Bernard-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bernard 1999</LINK>, there was no difference in daily cough impact scores, daily proportion of children with cough or in median duration of cough (three days) between the albuterol and placebo groups. In <LINK REF="STD-Korppi-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Korppi 1991</LINK>, albuterol plus dextromethorphan was compared with dextromethorphan alone. There was a significant difference in favour of dextromethorphan alone on day one (lower cough score reflects less coughing), but otherwise no significant differences were apparent in daily cough symptom scores on other days, in daily general condition or in overall symptom relief after three days, between the albuterol plus dextromethorphan group and the dextromethorphan-only group. Combining the daily cough scores for days one to three for these two trials (96 participants) revealed no statistically significant difference in the scores for the group receiving albuterol versus the comparison group (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>).

<P>Participants given beta2-agonists were more likely to report tremor, shaking or nervousness in the four trials in adults that mentioned specific side effects. The overall percentage of participants having these side effects in the three trials (211 participants) with explicit data ranged from 35% to 67% (versus a summary control rate of 11%; RR 7.94, 95% CI 1.17 to 53.94; NNTH 2 (<LINK REF="CMP-002.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.12</LINK>).

However, in <LINK REF="STD-Hueston-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hueston 1994</LINK> only 9% of the participants given inhaled albuterol reported any side effects (the specific side effects were not mentioned in the paper and the data were not available from the trial author). There were no significant differences regarding other adverse effects between the beta2-agonist groups and control groups as a whole, but the trial comparing albuterol with erythromycin noted more gastrointestinal side effects in the erythromycin group (RD 0.35, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.59; NNTH 3, 95% CI 2 to 8) <LINK REF="STD-Hueston-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hueston 1991</LINK> (6 of 17 in the erythromycin group versus 0 of 17 in the albuterol group).</P>

Those who were given fenoterol had significantly lower symptom scores, beginning at day two, than those in this subgroup who were given placebo.

<P>The findings from this review do not support the routine use of beta2-agonists for people who do not have underlying pulmonary disease and who present with an acute cough or a clinical diagnosis of acute bronchitis. However, these generally negative results must be interpreted in light of the participants who were enrolled in the trials. The two trials in children excluded those who were either wheezing or who had evidence of airflow restriction for which bronchodilator therapy was clinically indicated. There were therefore no data in children who had clinical signs of airflow restriction at the initial examination. The utility of beta2-agonists is unknown in children over the age of two and who have evidence of airflow restriction. A meta-analysis of the effectiveness of beta2-agonists in bronchiolitis (defined as an acute lower respiratory tract infection with wheezing) in children less than two years old showed that these agents do produce modest short-term improvements in clinical scores in this younger population (<LINK REF="REF-Gadomski-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gadomski 2014</LINK>).</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-08-06 21:16:43 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The discordant results seen in the trials of adults may reflect different patient populations. More participants were wheezing on initial examination in <LINK REF="STD-Hueston-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hueston 1994</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hueston-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hueston 1991</LINK> than in <LINK REF="STD-Littenberg-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Littenberg 1996</LINK> or <LINK REF="STD-Melbye-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Melbye 1991</LINK>. The latter's subgroup analysis demonstrated that people with evidence of airflow restriction (wheezing, bronchial hyper responsiveness or decreased FEV-1 values) had lower average symptom scores when treated with beta2-agonists than placebo, but that there was no difference in participants without these characteristics. Wheezing in unforced expiration is a sign of airflow restriction (<LINK REF="REF-Holleman-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holleman 1995</LINK>); therefore, more participants in Hueston's trials were likely to have had airflow restriction than in the other trials.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Melbye-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Melbye 1991</LINK> subgroup analysis of participants with evidence of airflow restriction, all components of the symptom score (including both cough and dyspnoea) were improved in the beta2-agonist group compared with the placebo group. Beta2-agonists have been shown to improve symptoms of cough in people with asthma (both in typical asthma as well as in the minority with cough-variant asthma). This improvement is not believed to be due to a direct effect on the cough reflex (<LINK REF="REF-Karlsson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karlsson 1999</LINK>) but is perhaps due to increased mucociliary clearance or other non-smooth muscle effects. Interestingly, the trials that noted improvements in cough with beta2-agonists were also the trials that enrolled more participants with a productive cough. It may be that these participant characteristics (wheezing or a productive cough, or both) can be used to identify a subgroup of people with acute cough who might benefit from beta2-agonists.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-08-07 23:16:08 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are limitations to this review. The number of studies and total number of participants included (especially children) are small. The review therefore has limited power to detect differences between those who were given beta2-agonists and those who were not. In the combined data of trials in adults, there was a trend towards improvements regarding cough, productive cough and night cough as well as in daily cough severity scores in participants randomised to the beta2-agonists. While these differences did not reach statistical significance, the confidence intervals were quite broad and include the possibility of clinically significant beneficial effects. For example, the possibility of up to a 46% reduction in cough after seven days for adults cannot be excluded, given the low power of the combined results.</P>
<P>The studies were also all of a short duration (three to seven days). There is therefore no information as to whether treatment with beta2-agonists would alter outcomes beyond this time. This is an important omission because many participants in these studies were still bothered by symptoms at the end of the trials.</P>
<P>We were able to find only two studies that evaluated inhaled beta2-agonists, which would currently be the most likely formulation used in adults and older children. Neither of these studies used spacing devices and therefore the delivery of the medicine may have been suboptimal.</P>
<P>Overall, the quality of evidence was low or moderate for individual interventions (see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). However, there may have been additional biases because most of the trials had unequal distribution of co-interventions and did not record compliance with study medications.</P>
<P>We were able to include data on our outcomes from the majority of the studies. The summary statistics therefore do reflect the available evidence (including unpublished data from three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bernard-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bernard 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Littenberg-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Littenberg 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Melbye-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Melbye 1991</LINK>)).</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2011-02-14 16:38:56 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We may have missed relevant studies, either because these were unpublished or because they were not published in journals covered by the databases we searched. All the studies we found stem from the previous century, when registration of new trials was not mandatory. However, as we also searched conference proceedings and contacted manufacturers, we think the chance of having missed studies is low.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-08-06 21:20:47 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is no evidence that beta2-agonists are useful in healthy children who have an acute cough, particularly if their lung examination is normal. These children are more likely to have adverse effects than to derive any clinical benefit. Overall, there does not seem to be a clear benefit to adults either, although there is a trend toward some improvement in cough, especially in people who have evidence of airflow restriction. This benefit, however, is not well supported by the available evidence and must be weighed against the adverse effects of these medications, such as shaking, tremor and nervousness. These conclusions for both children and adults are based on a relatively small number of trials, and the confidence intervals in our analyses could not completely rule out the possibility of clinically significant beneficial effects of beta2-agonists.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-08-06 21:22:42 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a need for additional study of the utility of beta2-agonists in the treatment of acute bronchitis in people without underlying pulmonary disease. There is a particular need for identifying clinical characteristics that can predict who might benefit. For example, data are lacking in children older than two years who have signs of airflow restriction. More evidence is also necessary on the risk-benefit ratio of beta2-agonists in adults with clinical signs of airflow limitation. This should include further examination of other indicators of illness, such as generally feeling ill, as well as cough. Additional areas of useful research would be the evaluation of long-acting beta2-agonists (because of ease of adherence), evaluating the benefits of inhaled beta2-agonists with spacing devices, and comparing beta2-agonists with other symptomatic treatments. Because of the reported adverse effects seen in the trials thus far, studies of short-acting beta2-agonists should use inhaled albuterol (salbutamol) or another inhaled agent with a low incidence of adverse effects instead of oral albuterol or inhaled fenoterol.</P>

<APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2015-08-07 19:40:36 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For the first publication of this review, we searched the entire Cochrane Library (August 2000), MEDLINE (1966 to 2000) and EMBASE (1974 to 2000) using the keywords "bronchitis" or "cough" (both as MeSH terms and text words), together with the terms "adrenergic beta-agonist (exp)", "bronchodilator agents (exp)", or "sympathomimetic (exp)" (as well as the individual generic names for all approved beta2-agonists: albuterol, salbutamol, bitolterol, isoetharine, metaproterenol, pirbuterol, salmeterol, terbutaline, fenoterol, formoterol and procaterol). Albuterol and salbutamol are the same drug; in North America it is known as albuterol and in many other countries it is known as salbutamol. For MEDLINE and EMBASE searches we used a sensitive strategy for finding controlled trials: "clinical trials (exp)" or "comparative study/ or placebo" or "controlled or clinical or randomised trial (PT)".</P>
<P>We also searched for trials in conference proceedings databases Inside Conferences (1993 to 1999); Conference Papers Index (1973 to 1999); in the reference lists of retrieved articles, review articles and textbooks; and in the Science Citation Index (1990 to 2000) using the key studies we retrieved. Finally, we wrote to all US manufacturers of currently approved brand-name beta2-agonists.</P>
<P>The review was updated in the Cochrane Library, 2002, issue 2, when we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library, 2003, Issue 3), MEDLINE (January 1966 to July 2003), and EMBASE (1974 to July 2003).</P>
<P>When the review was next updated in 2005, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library<I>, </I>2005, issue 4) which contains the Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (January 1966 to November 2005) and EMBASE (1974 to November 2005).</P>
<P>The search was updated again in 2011. For the 2011 update, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) 2011, Issue 1 which contains the Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (November 2005 to February week 1, 2011) and EMBASE (November 2005 to February 2011)</P>
