<P>Surgical site infection is a serious complication of surgery and is usually associated with increased length of hospital stay for the patient, and also higher hospital costs. The use of an antiseptic solution for preoperative bathing or showering is widely practiced in the belief that it will help to prevent surgical site infections from developing. This review identified seven trials, with over 10,000 patients, that tested skin antiseptics (chlorhexidine solution) against normal soap or no presurgical washing. The review of these trials did not show clear evidence that the use of chlorhexidine solution before surgery was better than other wash products at preventing surgical site infections from developing after surgery.</P>

<P>Surgical site infections (SSIs) are wound infections that occur after invasive (surgical) procedures.

<P>We did not identify any new trials for inclusion in this fifth update. Seven trials involving a total of 10,157 participants were included. Four of the included trials had three comparison groups. The antiseptic used in all trials was 4% chlorhexidine gluconate (Hibiscrub/Riohex). Three trials involving 7791 participants compared chlorhexidine with a placebo. Bathing with chlorhexidine compared with placebo did not result in a statistically significant reduction in SSIs; the relative risk of SSI (RR) was 0.91 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 1.04). When only trials of high quality were included in this comparison, the RR of SSI was 0.95 (95%CI 0.82 to 1.10). Three trials of 1443 participants compared bar soap with chlorhexidine; when combined there was no difference in the risk of SSIs (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.84). Three trials of 1192 patients compared bathing with chlorhexidine with no washing, one large study found a statistically significant difference in favour of bathing with chlorhexidine (RR 0.36, 95%CI 0.17 to 0.79). The smaller studies found no difference between patients who washed with chlorhexidine and those who did not wash preoperatively.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>This review provides no clear evidence of benefit for preoperative showering or bathing with chlorhexidine over other wash products, to reduce surgical site infection. Efforts to reduce the incidence of nosocomial surgical site infection should focus on interventions where effect has been demonstrated. </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-02-19 12:13:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Surgical site infections (SSIs) are wound infections that occur after invasive (surgical) procedures. SSI is the third most frequently hospital-acquired (nosocomial) infection amongst hospital patients (<LINK REF="REF-Smyth-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smyth 2008</LINK>). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have used the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance system (NNIS) to monitor nosocomial infections in acute care hospitals in the United States since 1970. Between 1986 and 1996 the CDC studied approximately 600,000 operations. Surgical site infections developed after three per cent (15,523) of these operations. During the period of data collection, 551 of the 15,523 patients who developed an SSI died, and 77% of deaths were attributed to the infection (<LINK REF="REF-Mangram-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mangram 1999</LINK>). More recently, summary of data from 30 hospitals in America, Asia, Africa and Europe found an overall SSI incidence of 2.3% (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenthal-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenthal 2013</LINK>). Apart from the morbidity and mortality associated with surgical site infections, there are significant cost implications. A study, using the NNIS system found that it cost over USD 3000 more to treat a patient with an SSI than a non-infected patient . These costs were attributable to a greater likelihood of admission to an intensive care unit, a longer than usual post-operative stay, and an increased rate of hospital re-admission (<LINK REF="REF-Kirkland-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirkland 1999</LINK>). In Britain a study over a 2-year period found the additional median cost attributed to a SSI was £5,239 (UKP)(<LINK REF="REF-Jenks-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jenks 2014</LINK>). Potential litigation is also a concern (<LINK REF="REF-Rubinstein-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubinstein 1999</LINK>). Consequently, prevention of surgical site infection has become a priority for health care facilities.</P>
<P>An SSI is defined as an infection occurring within 30 days after an operation, and involves either a discharge of pus (purulent discharge), with or without laboratory confirmation; an organism isolated from an aseptically obtained culture; or signs and symptoms of infection, such as localised swelling, redness, or tenderness (<LINK REF="REF-Mangram-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mangram 1999</LINK>). The CDC have developed a set of standardised criteria for defining SSI in an attempt to make surveillance and rate calculation more accurate and amenable to comparison (<LINK REF="REF-Mangram-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mangram 1999</LINK>). SSIs are classified as being: superficial incisional (involving only skin or subcutaneous tissues); deep incisional (involving deeper soft tissue and fascia); or organ/space (involving any other part of the anatomy that was opened or manipulated). To help predict the likelihood, or SSI risk, surgical sites can be assessed preoperatively and classified into one of four categories with clear definitions: Class 1 (clean), Class II (clean-contaminated), Class III (contaminated) and Class IV (dirty/infected) (<LINK REF="REF-Mangram-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mangram 1999</LINK>). Clean wounds are defined as uninfected surgical wounds in which the respiratory, alimentary, genital or uninfected urinary tract are not present and in which no inflammation is encountered. Non-clean wounds are defined according to the anatomical area of operation, cause (aetiology) of wound, presence of existing clinical infection, and intra-operative contamination. Since clean wounds are less likely to become infected, SSIs following clean surgery are usually associated with either: (1) patient risk factors, such as age, nutritional status, diabetes and obesity; (2) risk factors related to the procedure: including incomplete preoperative hand and forearm antisepsis by one of the surgical team, length of surgical procedure and surgical technique; or (3) risk factors associated with preoperative preparation of the patient: for example, antimicrobial prophylaxis, preoperative hair removal and preoperative antiseptic showering (<LINK REF="REF-Mangram-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mangram 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Skin is not sterile. Indeed, thousands of bacteria live permanently on skin and contribute to health by maintaining a steady colony that inhibits establishment of harmful yeast and fungal infections. These bacterial populations are referred to as the 'resident flora'. A number of bacteria are present on the skin for a short period due to transfer from other people or the environment, and these constitute the 'transient flora'. At present, whole body bathing or showering with skin antiseptic to prevent SSIs is a widespread practice before surgery. The aim of washing is to make the skin as clean as possible by removing transient flora and some resident flora. Chlorhexidine 4% in detergent ('Hibiscrub' or 'Hibiclens') or a triclosan preparation is usually used for this purpose, and there is evidence that the numbers of bacteria on the skin are reduced when it is applied (<LINK REF="REF-Derde-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derde 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koburger-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koburger 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaiser-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser 1988</LINK>). Moreover, use of a skin antiseptic on consecutive days not only reduces microbial counts from baseline measurements, but also reduces the counts progressively over time (<LINK REF="STD-Paulson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Paulson 1993</LINK>). Although this body of evidence demonstrates the effectiveness of antiseptics as skin cleansing agents, the more important question is whether preoperative bathing or showering with an antiseptic reduces the incidence of SSI. In a 10-year prospective surveillance study, the SSI rate was lower amongst patients showering with hexachlorophene before surgery than in those who either did not shower or showered using a non-medicated soap (<LINK REF="REF-Cruse-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cruse 1980</LINK>). In addition, at least two studies have used a before-and-after design to test the effect of introducing preoperative showering with triclosan to control methicillin-resistant <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I> (MRSA) SSIs. In the first of these, showering before and after surgery was introduced to reduce the MRSA SSI rate. This intervention, however, was only one of a battery of measures introduced, so it was not possible to determine the independent effect of preoperative showering (<LINK REF="REF-Brady-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brady 1990</LINK>). In the second, the incidence of MRSA SSI was reduced amongst orthopaedic patients after presurgical showering with triclosan was introduced, however, the patients were also treated with nasal mupirocin for five days before surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Wilcox-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilcox 2003</LINK>). Finally, a retrospective analysis of the incidence of SSI following a total hip or knee arthroplasty, over a two year period in two hospitals was undertaken (<LINK REF="STD-Colling-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Colling 2014</LINK>). In one hospital, patients were required to shower or bathe with an antiseptic on the night before and morning of surgery. There was no similar policy in the second hospital. Although there was no difference in the overall SSI incidence during the study, there was a reduction in <I>Staphylococcus</I> <I>aureus</I> and methicillin-resistant <I>Staphylococcus</I> <I>aureus </I>SSI<I> (</I>
<LINK REF="STD-Colling-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Colling 2014</LINK>). While these observational studies provide some support for the practice of preoperative showering with an antiseptic, the evidence is not definitive.</P>
<P>Patterns of resistance have developed with some antiseptics (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2000</LINK>), leading to calls to restrict their use to situations where effectiveness can be demonstrated. In addition, hypersensitivity to chlorhexidine on the part of the patient is not uncommon. Consequently, the potential benefit of bathing or showering with antiseptics needs to be assessed alongside their potential for harm (<LINK REF="REF-Beaudounin-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beaudounin 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Krautheim-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krautheim 2004</LINK>). As it is unclear whether the use of antiseptics for preoperative bathing or showering leads to lower rates of SSIs, a systematic review is justified to guide practice in this area.</P>

Blinding and completeness of outcome data were assessed for each outcome separately. We completed a risk of bias table for each eligible study.

<P>Analyses were performed using RevMan 5 software. Relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for dichotomous outcomes, and mean differences (MD) and 95% CI calculated for continuous outcomes. Results of comparable trials were pooled using the fixed-effect model and 95% CI. Heterogeneity was investigated by calculating the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2002</LINK>). If evidence of significant heterogeneity was identified (i.e. a value greater than 50%), potential sources of heterogeneity were explored and a random-effects approach to the analysis undertaken. A narrative review of eligible studies was conducted where statistical synthesis of data from more than one study was not possible, or considered inappropriate.</P>
<P>One trial used a multi-centre design, but patients were allocated individually to the treatment or control arm (<LINK REF="STD-Rotter-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Rotter 1988</LINK>).

In this review results were not analysed using the number of clusters as the unit of analysis but analysed as if the allocation was by individual. This was necessary because the authors of the trial did not use the cluster as the unit of analysis. Analysing cluster trials in this way has the potential to over-estimate the effect of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Mollison-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mollison 2000</LINK>).</P>

These included 1443 participants and reported on two outcomes (SSI and mortality). Due to small numbers in two of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Earnshaw-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Earnshaw 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Randall-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Randall 1983</LINK>), and methodological inconsistencies in the <LINK REF="STD-Hayek-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Hayek 1987</LINK> trial, estimates of effect are imprecise and need to be interpreted with caution. Heterogeneity was high for this comparison (P value 0.08, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 60%), so we used a random-effects model for the meta-analysis. There are two possible explanations for heterogeneity. First, different types of surgery were conducted in each trial; <LINK REF="STD-Earnshaw-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Earnshaw 1989</LINK> included patients undergoing vascular reconstruction, while <LINK REF="STD-Hayek-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Hayek 1987</LINK> included patients booked for routine elective surgery and <LINK REF="STD-Randall-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Randall 1983</LINK> included only vasectomy patients.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2015-01-13 01:30:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Widespread use of preoperative antiseptic washing agents to prevent SSI continues. This review summarises trial data from over 10,000 patients, that compared washing with chlorhexidine with either a placebo solution, or a bar soap, or no preoperative washing at all. There was no clear evidence that washing with chlorhexidine reduced the incidence of SSI. The results of the review are strengthened by the heterogeneous nature of the participants; the trials included men, women and children undergoing a range of surgeries that were either clean or potentially infected, and undertaken in both inpatient and outpatient settings. These studies were published over a 26-year period between 1983 and 2009. The product used in the trials (chlorhexidine 0.4%) remains unchanged and the quality of the two largest trials (that included over 6,000 participants) was high, concealing the randomisation process and blinding the interventions. Both of these trials also included community follow-up.</P>
<P>One of the limitations of the review was the quality of some of the studies. Community follow-up was attempted in only four studies, only one of the authors provided justification for their sample sizes (<LINK REF="STD-Byrne-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Byrne 1992</LINK>), and in both studies where a cluster design was used, analysis was conducted as if participants had been allocated individually. Nonetheless, the high quality trials and trials where participants were allocated individually, showed no statistically significant reduction in SSIs when chlorhexidine was used for preoperative washing.</P>
<P>Only one of the trials provided data for other important outcomes. <LINK REF="STD-Byrne-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Byrne 1992</LINK> assessed complications or undesirable effects attributable to the use of an antiseptic. In this trial patients assigned to chlorhexidine use were no more likely to suffer an adverse reaction than those assigned to the placebo group. There were no comparisons with bar soap for this outcome. <LINK REF="STD-Byrne-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Byrne 1992</LINK> also assessed the cost of washing with chlorhexidine compared with placebo and found a non-significant cost reduction in the placebo group. Costs included length of hospital stay, so, even though the SSI rate was 1.1% higher in the placebo group, using a placebo still resulted in an overall cost benefit.</P>
<P>Our findings are consistent with two recent reviews of preoperative skin antiseptics for preventing surgical site infection. The first, which investigated any type of antiseptic preparation, included a section on pre-operative body washing. The authors accepted both RCTs and non-randomised comparative studies and found that showering with an antiseptic reduced skin flora but the effect on SSIs remained inconclusive (<LINK REF="REF-Kamel-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kamel 2012</LINK>). In the second review, <LINK REF="REF-Chlebicki-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chlebicki 2013</LINK> included RCTs, quasi RCTs and pre/post intervention studies. A total of 16 clinical trials met their inclusion criteria and were incorporated in a meta analysis with two subgroups (clean surgery and clean contaminated/contaminated surgery). No benefit for chlorhexidine showering was found in either of the subgroups or in the overall estimate of effect; RR 0.90 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.05) (<LINK REF="REF-Chlebicki-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chlebicki 2013</LINK>).<BR/>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Response of J Webster and S Osborne to Comments received from Mölynlycke Healthcare</HEADING>
<P>Firstly we would like to thank Mölynlycke Healthcare and Mr P N Lee for submitting comments and for helping to improve the contents of the Cochrane Library.</P>
<P>We have carefully considered the Comments made and respond to each individually below; we also consulted with Gill Worthy, recently appointed Statistical Editor of the Cochrane Wounds Group in compiling our response.</P>
<P>In summary whilst on reflection we feel that several of the points raised have merit and we have amended the review accordingly (by amending the conclusion to "no clear evidence of benefit", by removing the subgroup analyses, and by not synthesising the data from the "no wash" comparison) we do not agree with many of the points raised, including several of those raised in the letter from Mölynlycke.</P>

<P>"the conclusion [of the review] is inaccurate"<BR/>We agree that the conclusion that there is "evidence of no benefit for preoperative showering or bathing with chlorhexidine&#8230;" is badly worded and in the next update of the Library this has been changed to read "no clear evidence of benefit for preoperative showering or bathing with chlorhexidine over other wash products".</P>
<P>"in our view, the erroneous conclusion was reached by reliance on data of poor quality and diversity, and statistical analysis errors and omissions. For example the study states that antibiotic prophylaxis routinely was used in Earnshaw study (n = 66), but the antibiotic prophylaxis was not administered using a standardized protocol"<BR/>The quality of the many of the studies reviewed was poor and this was clearly acknowledged in the review (e.g. Discussion, paragraph 2) and is typical of research quality in many areas of medical and health care. Unfortunately reviewers can only deal with the data that exists and this is frequently different from the data one would wish to have. Nevertheless, it is highly worthwhile to review even poor quality data as it allows identification of unanswered research questions.</P>
<P>As you have not referenced specifics, we are not sure what you mean by statistical analysis errors and omissions. This statement does not reflect the critique of the review made by your statistician, Mr Lee who did not highlight major statistical analysis errors and omissions. We do not understand the point being made about the Earnshaw study nor how you think this affected the results and conclusions. All participants in the Earnshaw study received antibiotic prophylaxis irrespective of which arm they were allocated to and therefore no bias is introduced as both arms received the same co-interventions. They did in fact receive standardized prophylaxis, viz. 3 perioperative doses of intravenous amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (or erythromycin in the case of sensitivity to the former). Since many patients do receive antibiotic prophylaxis in real life, inclusion of this study, if anything, increases external validity.</P>
<P>"in the Byrne (n = 3733) , Rotter (n = 2813), and Wihlborg (n = 1530) studies the prophylaxis rate was only 1-15%. Hayek (n = 1989) and Randall (n = 94) studies did not mention antibiotic usage. One cannot pool these study patients when it is known that antibiotic prophylaxis can have an effect on surgical site infections (SSI)".<BR/>The decision about which studies are pooled together is a matter of judgment, not fact. Byrne, Hayek and Rotter were pooled together and the amount of statistical heterogeneity was low at only 4.6%. There was more heterogeneity evident when Earnshaw, Hayek and Randall were pooled (60%) and therefore a more conservative random-effects model was applied, which takes account of between-study as well as within-study variance. Pooling studies which may have different antibiotic usage rates is not "wrong" nor does it introduce bias, since both arms within trials were treated the same; the only impact may be to reduce precision.</P>
<P>"&#8230;the omission of the SSI rate for the different types of surgeries at each institution makes it impossible to understand the significance of the data. A lower SSI rate requires a greater number of subjects to discern the differences between antiseptic and placebo. The placebo effect needs better explanation, because review of the clinical outcomes of SSI for the placebo controlled studies shows that the SSI rate for placebo ranges from 2.4 to 33.3%. The great variation in the SSI rate for placebo calls into question the sensitivity of the method in the hands of the authors and the ability of the method to detect differences between antiseptic and placebo".<BR/>Again, if we understand the point being made here correctly, it is the same one as in the previous paragraph, and our response is the same; whilst there may be variation in the baseline infection rates, pooling these studies does not introduce bias and does not therefore threaten internal validity. The rates quoted are not placebo rates since the 33.3% figure relates to the "shower with normal soap" arm of the Randall study. Furthermore we have reported a relative measure of outcome rather than absolute differences (which are more greatly affected by variations in baseline event rates).</P>
<P>"&#8230;many of the studies are underpowered to detect differences between antiseptic and placebo&#8230;Few of the studies provided information about calculation of sample size. For this reason it appears that they pooled data from multiple references to try and provide a sufficient sample size to draw inferences of effect".<BR/>This paragraph succinctly explains the whole rationale of meta-analysis.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Response of J Webster and S Osborne to Comments received from Mr PN Lee (Independent Statistician) forwarded by Mölynlycke Healthcare</HEADING>
<P>Much of Mr Lee's 15 page document is merely a description of the review so we will confine our response to his substantive criticisms:</P>
<P>"It should be noted that in the <LINK REF="STD-Hayek-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Hayek 1987</LINK> study the placebo used was found, 5 months into the 2 year study, to have some antimicrobial activity and was subsequently changed&#8230; in the Cochrane review, both the discussion on chlorhexidine vs bar soap and the detail of the characteristics of the Hayek study wrongly state that the soap, and not the placebo, originally used&#8230; was changed". (p3)<BR/>Thank you for spotting this error. We have amended this and drawn attention to it, although it does not materially change anything and we cannot amend the analysis as we do not know how many participants were affected.</P>
<P>"&#8230;it certainly seems that many of the studies will be considerably underpowered to detect any plausible true level of risk reduction". (p5)<BR/>We agree and the small sample sizes and frequent lack of sample size calculations were discussed in the review.</P>
<P>"There is uncertainty as to how valid either estimate is, given the heterogeneity. The dubious nature of the random effects estimate&#8230;together with its wide CI, provides little evidence against chlorhexidine actually reducing risk of SSI" (p6)<BR/>We agree, there is a great deal of uncertainty around the individual study estimates and hence the pooled estimates however we are not claiming that chlorhexidine increases the risk of SSI. We believe that amending the review conclusions to "no clear evidence of benefit" from "evidence of no benefit" will deal with this issue.</P>
<P>"For the two studies where the comparison is with no wash both (pooled) estimates&#8230; show a non significant reduction in risk of SSI&#8230; the data are difficult to interpret, because there are two widely differing estimates&#8230;both with very wide CIs". (p7)<BR/>We agree that there is great heterogeneity here and it is probably not sensible to pool these studies; we have amended the review and removed the pooling. This does not, however, materially affect the overall conclusions.</P>
<P>"It would seem not unreasonable to carry out an additional analysis using data for each study comparing the chlorhexidine whole body group with the combined results for each study with no chlorhexidine&#8230;" (p7)<BR/>We don't see the rationale for this additional analysis; it was not pre-planned in the protocol (unlike all the analyses presented) and it would not alter the conclusions.</P>
<P>"I find the conclusions of the authors of the Cochrane review &#8230; to be surprising and misleading&#8230; even if they did mean "evidence of no benefit" it does not seem justified bearing in mind that<BR/>i) two of the six studies showed a statistically significant advantage to chlorhexidine<BR/>ii) all the meta analyses (with the minor exception of the dubious random effects analysis for soap) provided estimates less than 1.00 i.e., an advantage to chlorhexidine, and<BR/>iii) the meta analyses based on the largest numbers of SSIs showed a near significant advantage to chlorhexidine.. My own conclusion is that the data suggest a possible advantage to chlorhexidine but that more studies are needed." (p8)<BR/>We agree that the conclusions are erroneously worded and have been amended to "no clear evidence of benefit for preoperative showering or bathing with chlorhexidine&#8230;" We note that:<BR/>i) the two studies that showed a statistically significant advantage associated with chlorhexidine were not of high quality (by pre-specified quality criteria).<BR/>ii) none of the meta analyses showed a statistically significant advantage in favour of chlorhexidine.<BR/>iii) Mr Lee's own analysis (which is post hoc unlike the pre-planned analyses presented in the Cochrane review) is the most favourable to chlorhexidine but still not significant.</P>
<P>Other issues:</P>
<P>"It is stated on page 5 that for four of the included trials (<LINK REF="STD-Byrne-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Byrne 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Earnshaw-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Earnshaw 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Randall-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Randall 1983</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wihlborg-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Wihlborg 1987</LINK>) the authors 'responded to queries about study methods and/or requests for additional unpublished information.' It is interesting to note that in various places in the review there is reference to information from some of these studies as unknown or unclear. Were the original authors not asked about this, or did they no longer remember or have records of the relevant details?"<BR/>The authors were unable to recall or obtain these details.</P>
<P>"The assessment of quality is in fact inconsistently described. In the section 'Methodological quality assessment' on p4 it is stated that trials were coded on six criteria&#8230;it is then stated that trials were defined as "high quality" based only on receiving an A rating for criteria 2 and 3, making one wonder why criteria 1, 4, 5 and 6 were coded at all&#8230; However, in the 'Data synthesis' section on p5 it was stated that the effect of trial quality was carried out based on excluding those trials most susceptible to bias based on three criteria; two (2 and 4) essentially as defined above and another not mentioned before&#8230; the fact that the authors have been inconsistent in their definitions is not crucial to the selection of which studies are considered to be of high quality."<BR/>The other criteria were coded to facilitate full discussion of all aspects of quality. We have amended the inconsistency in the explanation of how trial quality was used in sensitivity analysis and agree that this does not affect the results or conclusions.</P>
<P>"On page 15, comparison 05 'More than one wash versus one wash' is stated to have an effect size of 0.92 (95% CI 0.80-1.04). This is totally misleading and the relative risk has nothing whatsoever to do with how risk of SSI depends on the number of washes! Similar problems relate to the comparison of individual versus cluster randomisation."<BR/>We agree and have removed these subgroup analyses, however, this does not materially affect the overall results or conclusions.</P>
