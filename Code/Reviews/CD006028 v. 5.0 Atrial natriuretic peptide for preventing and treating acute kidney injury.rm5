<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-08-08 10:12:55 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a generic term for an abrupt and sustained decrease in kidney function resulting in retention of nitrogenous (urea and creatinine) and a fall in urine output. Sepsis (infection), shock, trauma, kidney stones, kidney infection, drug toxicity or drug abuse are common causes of AKI. AKI is common in hospitalised patients, with the overall incidence of AKI estimated to be around 24-30 cases/1000 hospital discharges and 6% of those are critically ill. Sepsis, hypovolaemia, drug toxicity, major surgery and diagnostic investigations using radiocontrast dyes are some of the most common associated causes of hospital-acquired AKI. Restoration of kidney function is the goal of any treatment and can involve drug interventions or kidney dialysis. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) has been shown to increase urine production and to reduce kidney inflammation. The aim of this review was to investigate the use of ANP in preventing AKI and treating established AKI. We identified 19 studies (11 prevention and 8 treatment) using low or high dose ANP, enrolling 1,861 patients. There was no difference in the number of deaths between ANP and control for studies preventing or treating AKI. The need for dialysis was significantly lower in both the low dose ANP treatment and prevention studies as well as for patients undergoing major surgery. The length of time spend in hospital and ICU was shorter for patients receiving low dose ANP. High dose ANP was associated with more hypotension and cardiac arrhythmias in patients with established AKI. ANP may be associated with improved outcomes when used in low doses for preventing AKI and in managing postsurgery AKI. There were no significant adverse events in the prevention studies, however in the high dose ANP treatment studies there were significant increases in hypotension and arrhythmias.<B> </B>

Length of hospital and ICU stay were significantly shorter in the low dose ANP group. For established AKI, there was no difference in mortality with either low or high dose ANP. Low (but not high) dose ANP was associated with a reduction in the need for RRT (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.98). High dose ANP was associated with more adverse events (hypotension, arrhythmias). After major surgery there was a significant reduction in RRT requirement with ANP in the prevention studies (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.99), but not in the treatment studies.

<P>Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a generic term for an abrupt and sustained decrease in kidney function resulting in retention of nitrogenous (urea and creatinine) and non-nitrogenous waste products (<LINK REF="REF-Lameire-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lameire 2005</LINK>). Commonly used definitions are "an increase in serum creatinine of more than 0.5 mg/dL (44 µmol/L) over the baseline value". "an increase of more than 50 percent over the baseline value", "a reduction in the calculated creatinine clearance of more than 50 percent", or "a decrease in renal function that results in the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT)" (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1984</LINK>;<B> </B>
<LINK REF="REF-Solomon-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Solomon 1994</LINK>;<B> </B>
<LINK REF="REF-Zanardo-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zanardo 1994</LINK>). More recently the Acute Kidney Injury Network has defined AKI as an abrupt (within 48 hours) reduction in kidney function defined as an absolute increase in serum creatinine (SCr) &#8805; 0.3 mg/dL (&#8805; 26.4 µmol/L), a percentage increase in SCr &#8805; 50% (1.5-fold from baseline), or a reduction in urine output (documented oliguria &lt; 0.5 mL/kg/h for more than six hours) (<LINK REF="REF-Mehta-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mehta 2007</LINK>). AKI can be caused by a variety of conditions, which can be broadly divided into three categories- pre-renal, post-renal and intrinsic renal (<LINK REF="REF-Lameire-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lameire 2005</LINK>). The pre-renal form accounts for approximately 70% of community-acquired AKI (<LINK REF="REF-Kaufman-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaufman 1991</LINK>) and 21% of hospital-acquired AKI (<LINK REF="REF-Liano-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liano 1996</LINK>) and results from decreased renal perfusion. In post-renal AKI, which constitutes around 10% of AKI (<LINK REF="REF-Liano-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liano 1996</LINK>), there is obstruction of the urinary collection system by either intrinsic or extrinsic causes. In the intrinsic renal form, which constitutes about 70% of AKI (<LINK REF="REF-Liano-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liano 1996</LINK>), structures of the nephron such as the glomeruli, tubules, vessels, or the interstitium, are primarily affected. ischaemia-reperfusion injury, a major cause of AKI, has been recently thought to be immunologically mediated with evidence supporting involvement of both innate and adaptive immunity (<LINK REF="REF-Kinsey-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kinsey 2008</LINK>). Sepsis, hypovolaemia, drug toxicity, and major surgery are some of the most common associated conditions with hospital-acquired AKI (<LINK REF="REF-Mehta-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mehta 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Uchino-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uchino 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The overall incidence rate of AKI has been estimated to be around 24-30 cases/1000 hospital discharges (<LINK REF="REF-Waikar-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waikar 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Xue-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xue 2006</LINK>) and it affects approximately 6% of critically ill patients (<LINK REF="REF-Guerin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guerin 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Uchino-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uchino 2005</LINK>). The mortality rate from AKI is approximately 40% to 80%; with higher rates associated with concomitant sepsis, hypotension and multiple organ failure (<LINK REF="REF-Brivet-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brivet 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mehta-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mehta 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Uchino-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uchino 2005</LINK>). Another way of classifying AKI is oliguric (urine output &lt; 400 mL/d) versus non-oliguric (urine output &gt; 400 mL/d); oliguria is considered a risk factor for mortality in various studies (<LINK REF="REF-Chertow-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chertow 1998</LINK>;<B> </B>
<LINK REF="REF-Liano-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liano 1996</LINK>;<B> </B>
<LINK REF="REF-Mehta-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mehta 2002</LINK>). The percentage of patients requiring dialysis is between 20% and 65% (<LINK REF="REF-Liano-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liano 1989</LINK>;<B> </B>
<LINK REF="REF-Mehta-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mehta 2004</LINK>;<B> </B>
<LINK REF="REF-Pascual-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pascual 1990</LINK>). Of these, less than 25% of patients who survive initial dialysis go on to require long-term dialysis indicating that AKI is a potentially reversible condition (<LINK REF="REF-Hou-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hou 1983</LINK>;<B> </B>
<LINK REF="REF-Spurney-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spurney 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite recent advances in treatment, outcomes from AKI have not substantially changed in the last four decades and the incidence of AKI is on the rise (<LINK REF="REF-Jo-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jo 2007</LINK>). There is an urgent need to explore novel therapeutic agents and revisit some older agents to review their role in the management of AKI.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-08-07 11:11:18 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Atrial natriuretic peptides (ANPs) is a family of peptides predominantly synthesized in the atrial myocyte and then stored as three different pro-hormones; 126-amino acid ANP, 108-amino acid brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and 126-amino acid C-natriuretic peptide (CNP) (<LINK REF="REF-Vesely-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vesely 2003</LINK>). ANP pro-hormone is then converted into ANP which is a 28-amino acid peptide. Urodilatin, another member of the natriuretic peptide family, is secreted by the kidneys and is a product of different post-translational processing of pro-ANP that takes place in the distal tubule cells (<LINK REF="REF-Vesely-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vesely 2003</LINK>). </P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-08-07 16:13:13 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>ANP has an interesting role during the initiation phase of AKI by causing vasodilatation of the pre-glomerular artery, inhibition of the renin-angiotensin axis and prostaglandin release. It also has a role during the reflow period of AKI as its natriuretic effect could be useful in preventing tubular obstruction (<LINK REF="REF-Gianello-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gianello 1990</LINK>). In animal studies, ANP has been shown to directly increase glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (<LINK REF="REF-Conger-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conger 1991</LINK>), to have direct diuretic and natriuretic effects on the distal nephron (<LINK REF="REF-Roy-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roy 1986</LINK>), and to reduce renal inflammation (<LINK REF="REF-Roson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roson 2006</LINK>). ANP is an ideal substance to counteract the two proposed pathophysiological mechanisms of decreased GFR in AKI, namely reduced glomerular perfusion and tubular obstruction (<LINK REF="REF-Edelstein-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edelstein 1997</LINK>). It has thought to have no role in correcting the pathophysiology of postobstructive AKI. Urodilatin has even stronger diuretic and natriuretic properties when compared to other natriuretic peptides (<LINK REF="REF-Forssmann-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forssmann 2001</LINK>) and this is thought to be due to its higher stability against the enzymatic degradation by neutral endoproteases (<LINK REF="REF-Forssmann-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forssmann 2001</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-08-08 10:20:20 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There have been multiple clinical studies involving the experimental use of ANP or one of its synthetic analogues in AKI. These prevention and treatment studies, were done in different settings (medical or surgical), used different doses (high doses such as ANP infusion at rates more than 100 ng/kg/min or urodilatin infusion at rates &gt; 20 ng/kg/min and low doses such as ANP infusion at rates as low as 10 ng/kg/min) and different analogues of ANP (e.g. synthetic human ANP, urodilatin) and have demonstrated conflicting results. There has been no systematic review to address the safety, efficacy and role of ANP in preventing and treating AKI.</P>
<P>The purpose of this review was to undertake a systematic analysis of clinical studies to ascertain the therapeutic potential of ANP in preventing and treating AKI.</P>
<P>The terminology used when referring to ANP or one of its synthetic analogues is not standardised. For this systematic review the term ANP was used to refer to the circulating peptide and its synthetic analogues used in the clinical studies.</P>

<P>Adult hospitalised patients (&gt; 18 years) with or at risk of AKI. AKI for the purpose of this review was defined as per the modified Acute Kidney Injury Network criteria as an abrupt (within 48 hours) reduction in kidney function defined as an absolute increase in SCr &#8805; 0.3 mg/dL (&#8805; 26.4 µmol/L), a percentage increase in SCr &#8805; 50% (1.5-fold from baseline), or a reduction in creatinine clearance (CrCl) &#8805; 50%, or a decrease in kidney function that results in the need for RRT (<LINK REF="REF-Mehta-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mehta 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>To determine whether the use of ANP is associated with prevention of development of AKI we defined patients &#8220;at risk for AKI&#8221; as those patients undergoing procedures or major surgeries that are associated with AKI (e.g. procedures involving radiocontrast administration, cardiovascular surgeries) or those with proteinuria or abnormal SCr or CrCl but not fulfilling the definition of AKI.</P>

<P>Optimal dose of ANP with respect to renal blood flow and GFR is thought to be 50-100 ng/kg/min (<LINK REF="STD-Valsson-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Valsson 1994</LINK>). At a dose of &gt; 100 ng/kg/min, both GFR and renal blood flow decline with a decrease in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP). A dose finding study (<LINK REF="REF-Dorner-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dorner 1998</LINK>) on urodilatin has reported that the therapeutic window for urodilatin is narrow and the dose of &gt; 20 ng/kg/min is associated with detrimental side effects. Thus in our review, studies that involved administration of ANP at &gt; 100 ng/kg/min or urodilatin at &gt; 20 ng/kg/min were considered as high dose category studies.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-08-08 10:55:47 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Beneficial effects seen in animal models of AKI led researchers to conduct clinical studies with different ANP preparations. Early clinical studies were underpowered and showed mixed results. Subsequently, <LINK REF="STD-Allgren-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Allgren 1997</LINK> conducted a large study of ANP in critically ill patients with acute tubular necrosis. The administration of ANP in this study did not improve the overall rate of dialysis-free survival, however, some benefits were observed in a subgroup of patients with oliguria. Since the publication of this study, there have been multiple clinical studies evaluating ANP for the prevention and treatment of AKI. We conducted a comprehensive review of the existing literature on this topic. Our results show that there are a too few large, high quality studies to make any consensus statement regarding efficacy of ANP in the management of AKI. However, analysis of the existing studies shows that when used for the prevention of AKI, ANP was well tolerated and may be associated with some improvement in clinical outcomes (requirement of RRT, lengths of ICU stay and hospitalisation). Its effects appear to be robust when analysed in a major surgery setting (such as cardiovascular surgery). When used in high doses for the treatment of established AKI, ANP was not associated with any significant clinical improvements, was not well tolerated and was associated with more adverse events and a trend towards increased mortality. For the low dose treatment studies, ANP was well tolerated with significant clinical improvement.</P>
<P>Optimal dose of ANP with respect to renal blood flow and GFR is thought to be 50-100 ng/kg/min (<LINK REF="STD-Valsson-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Valsson 1994</LINK>). For doses &gt; 100 ng/kg/min, both GFR and renal blood flow decline with a decrease in MAP. A dose finding study (<LINK REF="REF-Dorner-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dorner 1998</LINK>) on urodilatin has reported that the therapeutic window for urodilatin is narrow and doses &gt; 20 ng/kg/min are associated with detrimental side effects. Thus in our review, studies that involved administration of ANP &gt; 100 ng/kg/min or urodilatin &gt; 20 ng/kg/min were considered as high dose studies. High dose ANP preparations, by causing hypotension, may jeopardise renal perfusion, particularly in AKI that is characterised by loss of auto regulatory capacity, and further negate the possible benefits of ANP. </P>
<P>Benefits of ANP observed in animal models (<LINK REF="REF-Conger-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conger 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roy-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roy 1986</LINK>) have not been consistently translated into clinical benefits. Experimental animal models of AKI are simplified, controlled and often restricted to a single identifiable mechanism of injury. Such characteristics are difficult to reproduce in clinical studies since pathogenesis of clinical AKI is very complex (<LINK REF="REF-Jo-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jo 2007</LINK>). It can be argued that studies performed in major surgical settings are more similar to experimental models. The timing of the potential renal insult is often known and the setting is one in which careful observation, administration of therapy, and data gathering is possible. This is in contrast to studies of established AKI in an unselected population of critically ill patients who may come to medical attention at times different from the initial renal insult and thus may be at different stages of renal injury.</P>
<P>Postoperative AKI is a recognised cause of significant morbidity and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Zacharias-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zacharias 2005</LINK>). A recent systematic review did not find any reliable evidence from available literature to suggest that interventions during surgery can protect the kidneys (<LINK REF="REF-Zacharias-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zacharias 2005</LINK>). This review analysed dopamine, diuretics, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and hydration fluids, but did not address the role of ANP. In our review, a subgroup analysis looking at the surgical setting showed that the use of ANP might be associated with reduction in RRT requirement. Several factors including uniform definition of AKI, a predictable injury setting, and high incidence of AKI are needed to study the role of any intervention for management of AKI (<LINK REF="REF-Chertow-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chertow 2006</LINK>). Major surgical settings, in particular cardiovascular surgery, provides one such opportunity and given the possible benefit from ANP that our review shows, its role needs to be further explored in this setting. </P>
<P>Our systematic review has significant strengths and limitations. Strengths include a systematic search of medical databases as well as data extraction, analysis and study quality assessment by two independent authors based on a pre-specified protocol (<LINK REF="REF-Nigwekar-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nigwekar 2006</LINK>). However, paucity of high quality and adequately powered studies in our review necessitates confirmation of these findings by future better-conducted studies. Prevention studies reported AKI requiring RRT, however, most of these studies did not report milder AKI events and hence we could not comment on prevention of overall AKI in our review. Included studies had populations with different AKI risk levels and severity of AKI and differed significantly in terms of timing of initiation and duration of ANP treatments. Such factors limit comparing these studies to one another and validity of our findings. Our online search of clinical study registries (<A HREF="http://clinicaltrials.gov/">http://clinicaltrials.gov</A>) identified one phase II, ongoing non-randomised study looking at ANP for the prevention of AKI following bone marrow transplantation (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00390624" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00390624</LINK>). Further research is needed to establish the safety and efficacy of ANP in the management of AKI. There were no uniform indications for RRT in most of the included studies since the decision to initiate RRT was left to the participating physicians. This may partly explain a wide variation in the incidence of RRT in the prevention studies. It is possible that the use of ANP may have differential effects in different Acute Kidney Injury Network proposed stages. Unfortunately, we could not analyse the effects of ANP for these different stages without potentially misclassifying studies. Though reasons such as poor methodological quality and small size of the included studies can explain asymmetrical funnel plots, publication bias seems to be the most likely explanation for asymmetry. Despite these limitations, our results provide the most comprehensive review of benefits and harms of ANP administration in the management of AKI to date.</P>

<P>There are a limited number of high quality studies to make any consensus statement about the role of ANP in the management of AKI. Current evidence suggests that the use of ANP may have beneficial clinical effects when administered in patients undergoing major surgery such as cardiovascular surgery. It appears to be safe when used in low doses.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-08-08 10:57:55 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Based on our results, we suggest that future clinical studies should consider assessing the safety and efficacy of ANP in the cardiovascular surgical setting and should analyse the efficacy by outcomes such as the standard AKI definition suggested by the Acute Kidney Injury Network (<LINK REF="REF-Mehta-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mehta 2007</LINK>). Investigators should also consider prospectively classifying the study patients into different stages of AKI to evaluate the differential effects of ANP. Mortality and RRT can be competing outcomes in the critically ill population with or &#8220;at risk&#8221; of AKI, and it is possible that some patients with AKI did not survive to require RRT. Hence, a composite outcome such as dialysis-free survival may be more meaningful and should be considered in future studies. Researchers should, instead of proceeding with more small-scale studies, form the collaborative networks needed for a definitive large study and should also consider studying a population that is at a higher risk of postsurgery AKI such as those with pre-existing CKD. Novel biomarkers such as NGAL, IL-18 and others may help in earlier identification of established AKI compared to SCr (<LINK REF="REF-Coca-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coca 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parikh-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parikh 2006</LINK>) and these biomarkers may be used as enrolment criteria for future clinical studies.</P>
