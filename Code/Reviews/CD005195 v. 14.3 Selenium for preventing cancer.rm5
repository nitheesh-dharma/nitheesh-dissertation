This review updates the most recent Cochrane review on this topic (<A HREF="Vinceti 2014">Vinceti 2014)</A>, which was an update of <A HREF="Dennert 2011">Dennert 2011</A>.</P><P><B>Background</B><BR/>Selenium is a naturally occurring element that individuals are exposed to mainly through food consumption, although exposure can also occur through air, drinking water, and dietary supplements. Small amounts of selenium are essential for certain biological functions in humans, but slightly higher amounts can pose a toxicity risk, making selenium an element with a narrow, but as yet not well-defined, safe range of exposure. Selenium occurs in many different chemical forms with different biological activity. From the late 1960s, a few observational studies reported that people with high levels of selenium in their diet or in their body tissues had lower risk of cancer, and some laboratory studies showed that selenium could inhibit the growth of cancer cells. This led to widespread interest in selenium supplements and claims that taking such supplements could prevent cancer. Since that time, many more observational studies have been conducted to compare cancer rates among individuals with high and low selenium exposure. More recently, several randomised controlled trials designed to assess whether selenium supplementation can prevent cancer have been carried out. These trials played a major role in enhancing our understanding of the relation between selenium and cancer risk as a result of their stronger study design as compared with observational studies. The most recent trials in particular have shown high methodological quality and statistical power. Several trials focused on whether selenium could prevent prostate cancer.</P><P><B>Study characteristics</B><BR/>This review includes 10 trials in which adults were randomly assigned to receive selenium supplements or placebo, and 70 observational studies in which adults were followed over time to determine whether their baseline selenium status was associated with their risk of cancer. The evidence is current to January 2017.</P><P><B>Key results</B><BR/>All of the high-quality randomised trials reported no effect of selenium on reducing overall risk of cancer or risk of particular cancers, including the most investigated outcome - prostate cancer. Some trials unexpectedly suggested that selenium may increase risks of high-grade prostate cancer, type 2 diabetes, and dermatological abnormalities.</P><P>Observational studies have yielded inconsistent evidence of a possible effect of selenium exposure on cancer risk, with no evidence of a dose-response relation. When we pooled results of these studies, overall they suggested an inverse relation between cancer exposure and subsequent incidence of any cancer or some specific cancers, such as colon and prostate cancer. However, observational studies have major weaknesses. The selenium exposure status of participants could have been misclassified owing to limitations of the indicators of selenium exposure used, as well as to uncertainty regarding the particular selenium species contributing to overall exposure. In addition, unmeasured confounding from lifestyle or nutritional factors - a major and well-known source of bias in nutritional epidemiology studies of observational design - could have been present. Therefore, the internal validity of these studies is limited.</P><P>Currently, the hypothesis that increasing selenium intake may reduce cancer risk is not supported by epidemiological evidence. Additional research is needed to assess whether selenium may affect the risk of cancer in individuals with specific genetic backgrounds or nutritional status, and to determine how the various chemical forms of selenium compounds may have different effects on cancer risk.</P></SUMMARY_BODY></SUMMARY><ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2018-01-18 13:14:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn"><ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2018-01-18 13:03:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn"><P>This review is the third update of the Cochrane review "Selenium for preventing cancer".

We conducted RE meta-analyses when five or more observational studies were available for a specific outcome. We assessed risk of bias in RCTs and in observational studies using Cochrane's risk assessment tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, respectively. We considered in the primary analysis data pooled from RCTs with low risk of bias. We assessed the certainty of evidence by using the GRADE approach.</P></ABS_DATA_COLLECTION><ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2018-01-18 13:14:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn"><P>We included 83 studies in this updated review: two additional RCTs (10 in total) and a few additional trial reports for previously included studies. RCTs involved 27,232 participants allocated to either selenium supplements or placebo. For analyses of RCTs with low risk of bias, the summary risk ratio (RR) for any cancer incidence was 1.01 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.10; 3 studies, 19,475 participants; high-certainty evidence). The RR for estimated cancer mortality was 1.02 (95% CI 0.80 to 1.30; 1 study, 17,444 participants). For the most frequently investigated site-specific cancers, investigators provided little evidence of any effect of selenium supplementation. Two RCTs with 19,009 participants indicated that colorectal cancer was unaffected by selenium administration (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.43), as were non-melanoma skin cancer (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.30 to 4.42; 2 studies, 2027 participants), lung cancer (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.50; 2 studies, 19,009 participants), breast cancer (RR 2.04, 95% CI 0.44 to 9.55; 1 study, 802 participants), bladder cancer (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.52; 2 studies, 19,009 participants), and prostate cancer (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.14; 4 studies, 18,942 participants). Certainty of the evidence was high for all of these cancer sites, except for breast cancer, which was of moderate certainty owing to imprecision, and non-melanoma skin cancer, which we judged as moderate certainty owing to high heterogeneity. RCTs with low risk of bias suggested increased melanoma risk.</P><P>Results for most outcomes were similar when we included all RCTs in the meta-analysis, regardless of risk of bias. Selenium supplementation did not reduce overall cancer incidence (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.14; 5 studies, 21,860 participants) nor mortality (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.32; 2 studies, 18,698 participants). Summary RRs for site-specific cancers showed limited changes compared with estimates from high-quality studies alone, except for liver cancer, for which results were reversed.</P><P>In the largest trial, the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Trial, selenium supplementation increased risks of alopecia and dermatitis, and for participants with highest background selenium status, supplementation also increased risk of high-grade prostate cancer. RCTs showed a slightly increased risk of type 2 diabetes associated with supplementation. A hypothesis generated by the Nutritional Prevention of Cancer Trial - that individuals with low blood selenium levels could reduce their risk of cancer (particularly prostate cancer) by increasing selenium intake - has not been confirmed. As RCT participants have been overwhelmingly male (88%), we could not assess the potential influence of sex or gender.</P><P>We included 15 additional observational cohort studies (70 in total; over 2,360,000 participants). We found that lower cancer incidence (summary odds ratio (OR) 0.72, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.93; 7 studies, 76,239 participants) and lower cancer mortality (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.97; 7 studies, 183,863 participants) were associated with the highest category of selenium exposure compared with the lowest. Cancer incidence was lower in men (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.14, 4 studies, 29,365 men) than in women (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.77, 2 studies, 18,244 women). Data show a decrease in risk of site-specific cancers for stomach, colorectal, lung, breast, bladder, and prostate cancers. However, these studies have major weaknesses due to study design, exposure misclassification, and potential unmeasured confounding due to lifestyle or nutritional factors covarying with selenium exposure beyond those taken into account in multi-variable analyses. In addition, no evidence of a dose-response relation between selenium status and cancer risk emerged. Certainty of evidence was very low for each outcome.

Selenium is recognised as nutritionally essential for humans, but it is toxic at levels slightly higher than those required for health, with a narrow and still not well-defined safe range of intake (<LINK REF="REF-Jablonska-2015a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jablonska 2015a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vinceti-2017a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinceti 2017a</LINK>).

Humans usually ingest this trace element with crop, animal products, fish, and seafood, and sometimes in supplements (<LINK REF="REF-Hurst-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hurst 2013a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vinceti-2017a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinceti 2017a</LINK>).</P><P>Chemical forms and concentrations of selenium in environmental matrices, foods, drinking water, and other sources of exposure vary considerably (<LINK REF="REF-Fairweather_x002d_Tait-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fairweather-Tait 2011</LINK>). Selenium species can be classified into organically bound selenium forms (e.g. selenomethionine, selenocysteine) and inorganic forms (e.g. selenate, selenite) (<LINK REF="REF-Gammelgaard-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gammelgaard 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weekley-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weekley 2013</LINK>). Organically bound selenium is present in the large number of selenoproteins identified in living organisms including humans, although the exact activity of some of these proteins remains to be identified (<LINK REF="REF-Brigelius_x002d_Flohe-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brigelius-Flohe 2017</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hatfield-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hatfield 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Labunskyy-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Labunskyy 2014</LINK>). Selenium yeast refers to a selenium-enriched yeast medium that usually contains selenium that is almost entirely organically bound, along with a high proportion of selenomethionine (<LINK REF="REF-Block-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Block 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rayman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rayman 2004</LINK>).</P><P>Recommended intake of selenium varies considerably among different regulatory agencies and scientific authorities (<LINK REF="REF-Vinceti-2017a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinceti 2017a</LINK>). For example, the USA Institute of Medicine recommends daily intake of 55 µg/d for adults (<LINK REF="REF-Institute-of-Medicine-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Institute of Medicine 2009</LINK>), whereas the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends amounts ranging from 25 to 34 µg/d, depending on age and sex (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2004</LINK>). More generally, international bodies have recommended amounts ranging from 25 to 70 µg/d for the adult population (<LINK REF="REF-Vinceti-2017a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinceti 2017a</LINK>). The main reason for these differences in recommendations is the differing value and weight given to the proteomic effects of selenium, in particular whether or not selenoproteins sensitive to selenium supply must be up regulated to their maximal level, and whether any adverse health effects may arise at lower selenium intakes than those required to maximise selenoprotein expression (<LINK REF="REF-Jablonska-2015a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jablonska 2015a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vinceti-2017a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinceti 2017a</LINK>). In addition, these standards generally do not take into account the chemical forms nor the source of selenium (diet, drinking water, air, etc.), despite established relevance of selenium speciation in addressing and assessing the health effects of this element (<LINK REF="REF-Vinceti-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinceti 2013a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vinceti-2013c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinceti 2013c</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weekley-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weekley 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vinceti-2017d" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinceti 2017d</LINK>).</P><P>To prevent adverse effects due to excessive selenium intake, the USA Institute of Medicine has set the tolerable upper intake level at 400 µg/d for adults (<LINK REF="REF-Office-of-Dietary-Supplements-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Office of Dietary Supplements 2009</LINK>). However, recent epidemiological studies suggest overt human toxicity at lower intake levels (Lippman 2009, in: <LINK REF="STD-SELECT-2009" TYPE="STUDY">SELECT 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stranges-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stranges 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vinceti-2017a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinceti 2017a</LINK>), and lower upper safe levels have already been proposed (<LINK REF="REF-Tsubota_x002d_Utsugi-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tsubota-Utsugi 2012</LINK>). In addition to the acute and chronic toxicity of high selenium exposure, possible harmful effects of long-term overexposure to lower dosages have been a matter of concern. However, these effects, such as those affecting the endocrine system, remain inadequately investigated (<LINK REF="REF-Vinceti-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinceti 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vinceti-2017a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinceti 2017a</LINK>). Furthermore, evidence shows different biological activities of the various organic and inorganic forms of selenium (<LINK REF="REF-Hazane_x002d_Puch-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hazane-Puch 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mandrioli-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mandrioli 2017</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vinceti-2013c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinceti 2013c</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vinceti-2017d" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinceti 2017d</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weekley-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weekley 2013</LINK>), emphasising the need to better characterise the specific toxicological and nutritional properties of each selenium species in humans, in animals, and in the environment. Recent publications have questioned the adequacy of the current upper safe limit of intake (<LINK REF="REF-Jablonska-2015a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jablonska 2015a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jerome_x002d_Morais-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jerome-Morais 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marschall-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marschall 2017</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morris-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moyad-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moyad 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rocourt-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rocourt 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sacco-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sacco 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vinceti-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinceti 2013b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vinceti-2017a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinceti 2017a</LINK>) and have espoused the need to set different limits for the many different sources of organic and inorganic selenium. On the other hand, other investigators have described claims of widespread deficient intake of selenium (<LINK REF="STD-Hughes-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Hughes 2016</LINK>).</P><P>Accurate estimation of selenium exposure in epidemiological studies presents several challenges. Individual exposure is typically assessed by using peripheral biomarkers of exposure, such as blood (usually plasma or serum) or nail concentrations, or by estimating dietary intake (<LINK REF="REF-Ashton-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ashton 2009</LINK>). Each of these methods has strengths and limitations and has had its validity questioned (<LINK REF="REF-Ashton-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ashton 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haldimann-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haldimann 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vinceti-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinceti 2013b</LINK>). However, levels of selenium in peripheral biomarkers such as blood, toenail, and hair have been found to correlate to a moderate degree with dietary intake as assessed through self-reported consumption of supplements, food frequency questionnaires, and dietary records (<LINK REF="REF-Hurst-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hurst 2013a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Longnecker-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Longnecker 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ovaskainen-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ovaskainen 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pestitschek-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pestitschek 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-den-Brandt-1993" TYPE="STUDY">van den Brandt 1993</LINK>). Stronger correlation has been seen at high intake levels (<LINK REF="REF-Morris-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 2013</LINK>), although results of some studies were not consistent (<LINK REF="REF-Hunter-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hunter 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Karita-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karita 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Satia-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Satia 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vinceti-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinceti 2012</LINK>). Assessment of selenium levels in specific body tissues is extremely complex, as these levels are not necessarily homogeneously reflected by all biomarkers because overall selenium exposure, as well as its chemical forms and other factors, influences distribution of the metalloid into various body compartments (<LINK REF="REF-Behne-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Behne 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Behne-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Behne 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Panter-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Panter 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vinceti-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinceti 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vinceti-2013c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinceti 2013c</LINK>). For example, circulating levels of some selenium species and of total selenium did not correlate with selenium content in the central nervous system as assessed by cerebrospinal fluid concentrations (<LINK REF="REF-Solovyev-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Solovyev 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vinceti-2013c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinceti 2013c</LINK>), indicating both the tissue-specific significance of biomarkers and the importance of selenium speciation when the distribution of selenium in different body compartments, representing target organs for different diseases, is assessed.</P><P>Selenium levels found in human specimens and characterising intake of selenium show high global variability due to variation in factors such as dietary habits, food and soil selenium content, ethnicity, sex, age, individual metabolism, occupational exposure, exposure to coal and other sources of combustion, and smoking (<LINK REF="REF-Fairweather_x002d_Tait-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fairweather-Tait 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haldimann-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haldimann 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jablonska-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jablonska 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rayman-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rayman 2008</LINK>). It is interesting to note that smoking tends to lower selenium biomarker concentrations, even though smoking is a source of selenium exposure - a phenomenon that might be related to increased excretion of the metalloid due to interaction with cadmium or other heavy metals (<LINK REF="REF-Jossa-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jossa 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kafai-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kafai 2003</LINK>). Globally, inconsistencies have been noted as to how these factors are associated with selenium levels (<LINK REF="REF-Haldimann-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haldimann 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vinceti-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinceti 2000</LINK>). For example, selenium levels increased with age in women, but not in men, in the French SU.VI.M.AX cohort study (<LINK REF="REF-Arnaud-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arnaud 2007</LINK>), but decreased with age in a female population in Ohio (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2000</LINK>); however, two studies in Switzerland and Austria could not find an association between age and selenium status among individuals of either sex (<LINK REF="REF-Burri-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burri 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gundacker-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gundacker 2006</LINK>). Sex-specific nutritional and health behaviours, as well as sex-specific differences in selenium metabolism and distribution across various body compartments, may contribute to observed discrepancies in selenium levels between men and women (<LINK REF="REF-Combs-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Combs 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rodriguez-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodriguez 1995</LINK>).</P></INTERVENTION><THEORY MODIFIED="2018-01-18 13:15:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn"><P>The ability of selenium to counteract cancer cell growth as observed in a large number of laboratory studies may be due to its effects on DNA stability, cell proliferation, necrotic and apoptotic cell death in healthy and malignant cells, and/or regulation of oxidative stress and the immune system (for reviews, see: <LINK REF="REF-Fernandes-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fernandes 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Misra-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Misra 2015</LINK>).

Both forms must be adapted a priori for use in a systematic review according to the research questions examined and the review topic explored. The NOS uses a star system by which studies are judged on key domains pertaining to selection and comparability of study groups, ascertainment of exposure and outcomes, and duration of follow-up. For each domain, we assigned either a 'star' or 'no star', with a star indicating that study design element was considered adequate and was less likely to introduce bias.

When more than one publication from the same trial was available and reported different periods of follow-up for the same cancer site, we included in the meta-analysis only the longest period of follow-up, provided that the experimental protocol was ongoing at the time of follow-up (i.e. that selenium supplementation was still actively supplied). We assessed the stability of effect estimates through their 95% or 99% confidence intervals. We included lack of precision of effect estimates among the factors used to downgrade the certainty (quality) of evidence generated by studies via the GRADE approach (<A HREF="http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org">www.gradeworkinggroup.org</A>). For RCTs, we considered pooled data from studies with low risk of bias as the primary analysis.</P><P>For observational studies, the minimum number of studies for inclusion in the meta-analysis was five, as in the previous version of the review. We applied this latter restriction not only to limit the number of analyses performed, but also because results were largely expected to be heterogeneous, and heterogeneity cannot be described and quantified adequately if too few studies are available (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>).</P><P>We calculated RRs and 95% CIs using numbers of participants and cases when these were provided in the publication and the meta-analysis tool provided by <LINK REF="REF-Review-Manager-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Review Manager 2014</LINK>; otherwise, we used RRs reported in the original publication, and, in particular, we selected RRs with the least adjustment for potential confounders. We used the same approach in calculating the RRs of adverse outcomes. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses of summary statistics for both observational studies and RCTs. For observational studies, we used the OR or RR comparing highest and lowest selenium exposure categories. We entered effect estimates as the natural logarithm of the OR or RR, and we used the squared standard error of the natural logarithm of the OR or RR as a weight. We calculated the latter from reported upper and lower boundaries of the 95% CI of the OR or RR. If a 95% CI was not reported, we used the total number of cases and the total number of controls, as well as the number of categories of selenium exposure, to estimate numbers of cases and controls per exposure category. We then used the standard normal approximation formula to calculate the standard error of the OR, comparing the highest versus the lowest exposure category (lnOR = (1/a + 1/b + 1/c + 1/d), where a, b, c, and d are the four counts needed to calculate the OR via (a*d)/(b*c)). For experimental studies, we computed the RR of cancer in the intervention group compared with that in the placebo group. For one study, which included more than one treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Algotar-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Algotar 2013</LINK>), we used only results for the lowest dose (200 µg/d) for consistency with other studies. We conducted all meta-analyses by using Review Manager 5.3.5 and Stata-15 statistical tools. To do this, we copied logarithmic data for the OR and the standard error from Stata into Review Manager, then double-checked results for errors.</P></DATA_SYNTHESIS><SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2018-01-06 14:45:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare E Jess"><P>We carried out a subgroup meta-analysis for high-quality RCTs while excluding from analysis all trials showing high or uncertain risk of bias.</P><P>For observational studies, we used sex-disaggregated data from mixed-sex studies, together with data from single-sex cohorts, to conduct subgroup analyses by sex.

This study was a very large phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled trial, activated in June 2001 and originally designed for a 7- to 12-year period of follow-up, carried out at 427 sites in the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico. However, the independent Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) recommended on 15 September 2008, discontinuation of study supplements based on absence of benefit from vitamin E or selenium and no possibility of benefit to the planned degree with additional follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-SELECT-2009" TYPE="STUDY">SELECT 2009</LINK>). The Committee also expressed concern about increased prostate cancer risk among vitamin E&#8211;treated participants and increased diabetes risk among selenium-supplemented participants (<LINK REF="STD-SELECT-2009" TYPE="STUDY">SELECT 2009</LINK>) (RR 1.07, 99% CI 0.94 to 1.22). Therefore, investigators discontinued administration of these supplements on 23 October 2008, in spite of the planned supplementation period of 12 years. Results of SELECT are based on follow-up provided at the end of the blinded supplementation period, which included 117,660 person-years of follow-up - not on an extended period of follow-up, which encompassed an additional 32 months of surveillance (144,846 person-years in total) after the end of the supplementation period (Klein 2011, in: <LINK REF="STD-SELECT-2009" TYPE="STUDY">SELECT 2009</LINK>). Endpoints were prostate cancer (the 'primary' endpoint) and colorectal cancer, lung cancer, all other cancers, and all cancers overall. A subsequent study from SELECT also evaluated the risk of bladder cancer, adding to standard follow-up an additional post supplementation period of 32 months (Lotan 2012, in: <LINK REF="STD-SELECT-2009" TYPE="STUDY">SELECT 2009</LINK>).</P><P>Three phase III trials published in 2011 - <LINK REF="STD-Marshall-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Marshall 2011</LINK> - and in 2013 - <LINK REF="STD-Algotar-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Algotar 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karp-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Karp 2013</LINK> - also evaluated the effect of selenium supplementation on prostate cancer. In <LINK REF="STD-Marshall-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Marshall 2011</LINK> (trial code SWOG S9917), investigators randomly assigned 423 men with high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, and therefore considered to be at very high risk of prostate cancer, to selenium (200 µg/d as selenomethionine) or placebo. <LINK REF="STD-Algotar-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Algotar 2013</LINK> evaluated whether supplementation with 200 or 400 µg/d of selenium as selenised yeast reduced the risk of prostate cancer among men at high risk of the disease, based on a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level exceeding 4 ng/L, suspicious digital rectal examination. and PSA velocity greater than 0.75 ng/mL/y. This trial, called the Negative Biopsy Trial (NBT), followed study participants in the United States (where both supplementation and follow-up were completed for such period) for five years, and in New Zealand for no longer than three years, and was discontinued after an external DSMC issued a recommendation to stop the trial. <LINK REF="STD-Karp-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Karp 2013</LINK> investigated the effect of supplementation of 200 µg/d selenium as selenised yeast in 1561 individuals with resected stage I non&#8211;small-cell lung cancer (trial code ECOG 5597). The primary outcome was the incidence of second primary tumours. Investigators enrolled both men and women in the study and investigated all cancer types and a few major side effects during follow-up. Follow-up included the period of active supplementation and some additional follow-up after the trial anticipated discontinuation. This decision was made by the trial DSMC, which, on October 21, 2009, reviewed the first planned interim analysis of the primary endpoint and recommended that the study should be terminated for futility. Based on that DSMC recommendation, on November 5, 2009, accrual for the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) trial was interrupted, and all current participants were invited to discontinue selenium/placebo tablets and were monitored only for follow-up of cancer incidence and survival. In accordance with recommendations by the trial DSMC concerning possible adverse effects of selenium supplementation, the incidence of basal and squamous cell skin cancers, as well as type 2 diabetes, was monitored. The main paper reported follow-up until June 2011 (<LINK REF="STD-Karp-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Karp 2013</LINK>), and results for only second primary lung tumours were updated as of January 2014, including a longer post supplementation period of follow-up (Pillai 2014, in: <LINK REF="STD-Karp-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Karp 2013)</LINK>.</P><P>Investigators conducted a trial in Poland that included a female population of carriers of a breast cancer-related mutation, <I>BRCA1</I> (<LINK REF="STD-Lubinski-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lubinski 2011</LINK>). Trial authors randomised 1135 women carrying that mutation to 250 µg/d of selenium in its inorganic tetravalent form (selenite), or to placebo, in a double-blind trial. Median follow-up lasted 35 months (ranging from 6 to 62 months), and final analysis was based on 105 incident cases diagnosed during follow-up - 60 cases in the selenium-supplemented arm and 45 cases in the placebo arm.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">Observational studies</HEADING><P>We included in this review 70 completed observational studies. Forty-five studies were nested case-control studies, the others were subcohort-controlled or cohort studies, and one study used a cohort together with a nested case-control design. Subcohort-controlled studies used (random) samples of the cohort as controls. The original papers were published between 1983 and 2017. Eight studies were conducted in Asia (China, Iran, Japan, and Taiwan), one in Australia, 30 in Europe (Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Channel Islands, Finland, France, and UK), 30 in the United States, and one in Canada. Overall, studies included more than 2,300,000 participants. Study populations in Europe made up 42.9%, North America 44.3%, Asia 11.4%, and Australia 1.4% of all study participants. The median size of study populations was 11,457. Forty-one studies included men and women, one did not report sex, 22 included only men, and six included only women. Eleven studies with mixed-sex populations reported results stratified by sex. Study populations were derived from 55 different cohorts. Twenty-four cohorts were non-randomly recruited (e.g. included volunteers), and 31 cohorts consisted of a random sample of the population of interest. Fifty-two studies reported mean or median age, 12 studies reported only age range, and six studies did not report this information on study participants. Most studies included adults older than 40 years of age.</P><P>Sixteen studies investigated nutritional and/or supplemental selenium intake by using food frequency questionnaires or interviews.

Generally, study authors grouped cases according to the version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) that was up-to-date at the inception of the cohort observation. The level of disaggregation of data varied markedly between studies. Although some studies reported cancer risk according to organ system (e.g. urinary tract, respiratory tract), others reported cancer risk for one or two organs (e.g. female breast, urinary bladder). Only in the case of skin cancer did studies also differentiate according to histological type (e.g. melanoma, basal cell carcinoma).</P><P>For the following outcomes, we included five or more studies in the review and meta-analysed observational data.</P><OL><LI>Any cancer (16 studies).</LI><LI>Female breast cancer (8 studies).</LI><LI>Urinary bladder cancer (6 studies).</LI><LI>Lung cancer (15 studies).</LI><LI>Prostate cancer (21 studies).</LI><LI>Stomach cancer (5 studies).</LI><LI>Colorectal cancer (6 studies) and colon cancer (5 studies).</LI></OL><P><LINK REF="STD-Goyal-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Goyal 2013</LINK> updated results of <LINK REF="STD-Bleys-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bleys 2008</LINK>, which reported longer follow-up for the same population.</P><P><LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> provides an overview of the studies examining each outcome.

These trials did not report generation of allocation sequence and allocation concealment. One study mentioned that the dropout rate was similar in intervention and control groups; the remaining three studies did not report the completeness of outcome data. We judged blinding as adequate in three studies, as investigators reported the use of placebo supplements. We inferred from this procedure that at least the study participants and the physicians directly involved were blinded towards treatment status.</P><P>In addition, it is unclear whether <LINK REF="STD-Li-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2000</LINK> was an individually randomised controlled trial. Study investigators used the phrase "randomisation based on the residence area" and did not describe the randomisation procedure any further. As participants were recruited from 17 villages, these villages - not individual participants - may have been randomly assigned to intervention and control groups. However, we could not make contact with study investigators to clarify these questions. Randomisation of villages instead of individuals could have introduced bias into the study results, as the incidence of liver cancer is known to differ between geographical areas as a result of lifestyle and environmental factors.</P><P>It has been found that RCTs with inadequate or unclear allocation concealment, especially those with subjective outcomes, may overestimate the benefit of interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Pildal-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pildal 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wood-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 2008</LINK>). All three RCTs on liver cancer did not report follow-up and case detection procedures, so the influence of subjective factors on case detection, such as interpretation of bodily symptoms as triggers of further diagnostic tests, is unknown. Although we judged blinding as 'adequate' in all three liver cancer trials, we do not know whether blinding was successful in practice for participants, healthcare providers, and outcome assessors.</P><P>These uncertainties about study methods seriously weaken our confidence in reported RCT results on liver cancer risk.</P><P>We considered <LINK REF="STD-Algotar-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Algotar 2013</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Karp-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Karp 2013</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Marshall-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Marshall 2011</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-SELECT-2009" TYPE="STUDY">SELECT 2009</LINK> to have low risk of bias because they reported adequate generation of allocation sequence, allocation concealment, blinding, and completeness of outcome data.</P><P>We judged <LINK REF="STD-Dreno-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Dreno 2007</LINK> and Duffield-Lillico 2002 to 2003, in: <LINK REF="STD-NPCT-2002" TYPE="STUDY">NPCT 2002</LINK> to have unclear risk of bias. <LINK REF="STD-Dreno-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Dreno 2007</LINK> provided unclear generation of allocation sequence, allocation concealment, and blinding; only completeness of outcome data was adequate. We considered NPCT to be at unclear risk of bias because of exposure-related detection bias for its primary outcome, as the percentage of study participants with an abnormal PSA (&gt; 4 ng/mL) who underwent biopsy varied according to selenium treatment group, at 35% in the placebo group and 14% in the selenium-treated group (Duffield-Lillico 2003b, in: <LINK REF="STD-NPCT-2002" TYPE="STUDY">NPCT 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marshall-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Marshall 2011</LINK>). As reported by the trial authors themselves in analyses stratified by baseline selenium concentration, the difference was greatest among participants in the lowest tertile, in whom the inverse association between selenium administration and prostate cancer risk was strongest. The difference in biopsy rates could not be accounted for by factors such as PSA concentration, age at which abnormal PSA was detected, or alternative diagnostic procedures. Although a difference this large could have occurred by chance, this finding raises concerns about possible disruption of blinding. Investigators provided no information as to the prostate biopsy rate among participants with lower PSA levels or biopsy rates for the primary outcome of non-melanoma skin cancer, which also requires pathological confirmation, nor for the secondary outcomes examined in this trial.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Observational studies</HEADING><P>We presented in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> a summary of study ratings according to the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). The median number of assigned stars was eight for both (nested) case-control and cohort study assessments, out of a maximum of nine stars each.</P><P>All but one cohort study received five to nine stars on the NOS. The exception (two stars) was an early investigation that was available only in abstract form for assessment (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1985</LINK>). In the NOS cohort assessment, we considered representativeness of the cohort for the target population to be adequate in 59% of studies, which received a star; 79% of studies provided evidence that cancer was not present at study commencement; we considered completeness of follow-up (&#8805; 95%) data to be adequate in 93% of studies. The representativeness of the cohort for the target population is a matter of external validity and generalisability of study results, but a systematic deviation of participants from the target population might also introduce bias into study results. The target population of included studies varied with study objectives and could have been the general population, as well as special occupational groups. We did not assign a star for this question to studies that did not identify their target population or to studies that recruited volunteers. Differential selection of study participants (e.g. volunteers) from the target population can lead to confounding by factors associated with selenium status and cancer incidence (e.g. nutritional behaviour, socioeconomic position). All included studies chose comparison groups (cases/controls or exposed/non-exposed) from the same study population. This approach enhanced comparability between groups.</P><P>We considered follow-up data as complete or as missing data unlikely to introduce bias to study results in 47% of included observational studies. In the other cohorts, losses to follow-up were greater than 5% and trial authors did not provide a description of losses to follow-up. A high attrition rate may alter the characteristics of the population under investigation and may impede the generalisability of study results to the intended target population (external validity). The presence of attrition does not necessarily mean that study results are biased. However, given the possibility that selenium status may be linked to sociodemographic variables and socioeconomic position, which may also influence participation in follow-up procedures, a differential effect of attrition may introduce bias towards underestimation or overestimation of the true exposure effect.</P><P>Forty-five included observational studies were nested case-control studies; therefore we assessed them by using the NOS case-control form. The number of stars in the NOS assessment of case-control studies ranged from five to nine, with 87% of studies receiving eight or nine stars. Although we generally assessed included prospective case-control studies as having low risk of bias, we had concerns regarding case definition and the question of the representativeness of cases in some studies.</P><P>We considered the definition of cases as inadequate in 24% of nested case-control studies, as cases were identified by self-reporting; investigators did not describe linkage to databases with unclear validity or procedures. The magnitude and direction of bias that might have been introduced to the study results remain unclear.</P><P>In 16% of studies, investigators did not include all identified cases (or an appropriate sample of them) in the trial analyses, or they did not report selection procedures for analysed cases. Some studies lost blood specimens as the result of technical problems (e.g. cooler breakdown at one study centre); other studies reported that material available for analysis was insufficient; and others selected cases for analysis in a non-random manner. This might bias the estimates of association in either direction.</P><P>We noted no obvious asymmetry (as an indicator of publication bias) in the funnel plots of studies on total cancer risk (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>) and selected cancer types (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>).</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Ethical criteria</HEADING><P>All trials fulfilled informed consent and ethics board approval criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Algotar-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Algotar 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dreno-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Dreno 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karp-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Karp 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marshall-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Marshall 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NPCT-2002" TYPE="STUDY">NPCT 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reid-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Reid 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SELECT-2009" TYPE="STUDY">SELECT 2009</LINK>), except for <LINK REF="STD-Li-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Yu-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Yu 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Yu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Yu 1997</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Lubinski-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lubinski 2011</LINK>, which did not mention these criteria.</P></SUBSECTION></STUDY_QUALITY><INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2018-01-18 13:18:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn"><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">1.

In the arm of the NPCT that was carried out in a single location - Macon, Georgia, USA - and included both 200 and 400 µg/d selenium supplementation (<LINK REF="STD-Reid-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Reid 2008</LINK>), non-melanoma skin cancer risk increased in the 200-µg/d arm after adjustment for age, sex, and smoking (unadjusted RR 1.49, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.03; adjusted HR 1.50, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.04) but not in the 400-µg/d arm (unadjusted RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.16; adjusted HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.20). At the remaining sites, where only 200 µg/d of supplemental selenium was given, the RR was 1.24 (95% CI 1.07 to 1.45) and the HR was 1.18 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.37). Distribution of baseline plasma selenium levels was similar in this substudy to that in the NPCT main study, and no evidence of effect modification according to baseline selenium exposure emerged. Overall, the NPCT did not support preventive efficacy of selenium yeast supplementation against non-melanoma skin cancer in these populations; on the contrary, investigators reported a cancer-promoting effect of selenium for this cancer type, which was the primary trial endpoint, raising concern about potentially harmful effects of such selenium supplementation (<LINK REF="STD-NPCT-2002" TYPE="STUDY">NPCT 2002</LINK>).</P><P>SELECT, which is the largest selenium supplementation trial conducted to date (Lippman 2009 and Klein 2011, in: <LINK REF="STD-SELECT-2009" TYPE="STUDY">SELECT 2009</LINK>), thus far has not investigated the incidence of non-melanoma skin cancer.

Analyses stratified by baseline plasma selenium category showed greatly reduced risk associated with active treatment among participants with baseline plasma selenium &#8804; 106.4 µg/L (HR 0.14, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.61) in the intermediate category (106.8 to 123.2 µg/L; HR 0.33, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.82), while in the upper category (&gt; 123.2 µg/L), the HR was 1.14 (95% CI 0.51 to 2.59).

However, interpretation of these NPCT findings is complicated by a potentially serious source of bias.

Differences in biopsy rates were greatest among participants with the lowest baseline selenium concentrations - the subgroup that appeared to derive the greatest beneficial effects of selenium administration. This may have contributed to substantial overestimation of the effects of selenium supplementation in the NPCT.</P><P>The SELECT trial found no evidence of benefit derived from selenium supplementation (compared with placebo) over a median of 5.5 years in terms of prostate cancer incidence (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.18, 99% CI 0.87 to 1.24) (<LINK REF="STD-SELECT-2009" TYPE="STUDY">SELECT 2009</LINK>). The adjusted HR for prostate cancer in the selenium plus vitamin E group compared with the placebo group was 1.05 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.20, 99% CI 0.88 to 1.25). The original report of the trial provided no specific RR estimate according to disease severity, but during an extended follow-up of this cohort after selenium supplementation had ceased (Klein 2011, in: <LINK REF="STD-SELECT-2009" TYPE="STUDY">SELECT 2009</LINK>), investigators found increased risk of Gleason 7 or greater disease (HR 1.21, 99% CI 0.90 to 1.63). It is interesting to note that the SELECT trial included only participants with PSA &#8804; 4 ng/mL - the group in the NPCT that showed greatest apparent benefit. During this further follow-up of the SELECT cohort, risk of prostate cancer in the selenium arm also slightly increased compared with that described in the first report, which had included only the active supplementation period (Lippman 2009, in: <LINK REF="STD-SELECT-2009" TYPE="STUDY">SELECT 2009</LINK>).

Administration of selenium (both selenium only and selenium combined with vitamin E) had no effect on prostate cancer risk among men with low baseline selenium status (&lt; 60th percentile of toenail selenium), but among participants in the two upper quintiles of baseline selenium exposure, risk of prostate cancer was increased (HR 1.20, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.81), particularly high-grade prostate cancer (HR 1.62, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.77). HRs were even higher when any selenium supplementation (alone or with vitamin E) was considered because such supplementation increased the risk of any prostate cancer (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.74) and high-grade disease (RR 1.91, 95% CI 1.20 to 3.05).</P><P><LINK REF="STD-Martinez-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Martinez 2014</LINK> investigated the effect of selenium supplementation on prostate cancer risk among participants in SELECT who had genotypes associated with altered mRNA expression of the androgen-regulated prostate tumour suppressor protein NKX3.1.

Although average baseline selenium status, as assessed through plasma selenium, was higher than in the NPCT (median value 126.1 vs 115.0 µg/L), the lowest tertile of plasma selenium levels had a median value (101.1 µg/L) well below the apparent threshold of around 120 µg/L, at which a beneficial effect of selenium seemed to occur in the NPCT. Furthermore, as noted by study authors, 45% of participants enrolled in this study had baseline plasma selenium levels &lt; 123 µg/L, which is the upper threshold for a protective effect of selenium supplementation according to results of the NPCT. Trial authors also stated: "None of the baseline variables modified the effect of selenium on the primary endpoint", and plasma selenium concentration at baseline was among these variables (<LINK REF="STD-Algotar-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Algotar 2013</LINK>).</P><P><LINK REF="STD-Karp-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Karp 2013</LINK>, the ECOG trial, carried out in subjects with resected non-small-cell lung cancer, reported nine and 16 cases of newly diagnosed prostate cancer among 250 and 509 male participants in the placebo and selenium groups, respectively. This allowed us to compute an RR of 0.87 (95% CI 0.39 to 1.45) for prostate cancer in the selenium-supplemented arm.</P><P>Following the NPCT, none of the subsequent, high-quality RCTs provided evidence suggesting that baseline selenium status could modify the effect of selenium supplementation on subsequent prostate cancer occurrence. In the NBT, the bottom category (tertile) of baseline plasma selenium levels in this trial population was 101.1 µg/L, i.e. lower than the upper bound of the bottom category (106.4 µg/L) and the middle category (106.8 to 123.2 µg/L) in the NPCT, both of which had shown a strongly decreased subsequent prostate cancer occurrence (<LINK REF="STD-Algotar-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Algotar 2013</LINK>). In the SWOG S9917 study, results of selenium supplementation were also made available for four categories (quartiles) of baseline plasma selenium and showed no effect of treatment in any categories (<LINK REF="STD-Marshall-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Marshall 2011</LINK>). These categories were &lt; 106, 106&#8211;132, 132&#8211;162, and &gt; 162 µg/L, and corresponding RRs of prostate cancer in the selenium-supplemented group were 0.82 (95% CI 0.40 to 1.69), 1.38 (95% CI 0.68 to 2.78), 0.98 (95% CI 0.58 to 1.68), and 0.91 (95% CI 0.45 to 1.84), respectively, versus an overall study RR of 0.97 (95% CI 0.68 to 1.39). Therefore, also in this high-quality trial, the bottom category of baseline selenium exposure was entirely similar to the corresponding one in the NPCT, but in contrast to NPCT, no effect of selenium supplementation emerged and no evidence showed risk of bias. Finally, a case-cohort study carried out within SELECT and published in 2014 provided data showing the relation between baseline selenium exposure and effects of selenium supplementation (<LINK REF="STD-Kristal-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Kristal 2014</LINK>). In that study, whose average selenium exposure was higher than that characterising the NPCT and the NBT, investigators reported no effect of selenium supplementation on both overall prostate cancer and low-grade and high-grade prostate cancer in the three quintiles of baseline toenail selenium levels, but enhanced risk of high-grade prostate cancer emerged for the two upper quintiles (alone and combined). Quintile cutpoints for these categories of the trial population were 0.758, 0.832, 0.901, and 1.003 µg/g. Overall, these results clearly indicate that even in subgroups with the lowest baseline selenium status in these Western populations, selenium provided no protective effect for prevention of prostate cancer, although this is the cancer type that once was thought to be most strongly associated with a beneficial effect of selenium supplementation.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">1.1.12.

Increased risk of diabetes associated with selenium supplementation was independent of baseline age, sex, smoking status, and body mass index (BMI), with the exception of participants in the top tertile of BMI. SELECT reported a slight increase in the incidence of type 2 diabetes in the selenium-alone group (RR 1.07, 99% CI 0.94 to 1.22).

In this study, the RR of diabetes was 1.04 (99% CI 0.93 to 1.17), thus supporting a short-term effect of selenium supplementation on diabetes risk.</P><P>Although the three trials on liver cancer and <LINK REF="STD-Reid-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Reid 2008</LINK> did not mention the occurrence of adverse effects, and <LINK REF="STD-Dreno-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Dreno 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Marshall-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Marshall 2011</LINK> (the SWOG 2011 trial) apparently performed no assessment of diabetes incidence, three recent phase 3 RCTs have investigated the occurrence of diabetes after selenium supplementation for prevention of malignant and non-malignant cancer. In the NBT, during five years of follow-up of 699 participants at high risk for prostate cancer supplemented with 200 or 400 µg/d of selenium or placebo, <LINK REF="STD-Algotar-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Algotar 2013</LINK> reported the occurrence of diabetes in 12, 12, and 7 participants, respectively. This allowed us to compute an incidence rate ratio of 1.70 (95% CI 0.62 to 5.10) and 1.71 (95% CI 0.62 to 5.12) among 200- and 400-µg/d selenium-supplemented participants, respectively, compared with those given placebo. The ECOG trial, which was carried out in 1561 participants with resected stage I non&#8211;small-cell lung cancer, trial authors did not explicitly report the RR of diabetes during follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Karp-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Karp 2013</LINK>). However, occurrence during four years of follow-up (2007 to 2011) was stated as 26 new diagnoses of diabetes in the selenium arm (1040 participants at baseline, of whom 865 underwent toxicity assessment) and 12 new diagnoses among placebo-treated participants (521/477). On the basis of these numbers, we could compute an RR of 1.09 (95% CI 0.55 to 2.13) or, for participants with toxicity assessment, 1.19 (95% CI 0.61 to 2.35) - values comparable with those observed in the other trials, except for NPCT. Most recently, in an intervention study investigating the effect of selenium supplementation for prevention of colorectal adenoma recurrence compared with placebo (the SELCEL trial), 31 cases of diabetes occurred in the selenium-treated group and 25 in the placebo group during follow-up, with an RR of 1.25 (95% CI 0.74 to 2.11) (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 2016</LINK>).

Using this approach, we identified a total of 10 RCTs that investigated monoselenium supplements for prevention of non-melanoma skin cancer, prostate cancer, any cancer, and other site-specific cancers. Overall, clear and consistent evidence indicates that selenium supplementation did not reduce subsequent cancer incidence, whether this endpoint was considered a primary or secondary outcome. Most of these trials raised concerns about possible harmful effects of selenium supplements, including increased incidence of non-melanoma skin cancer in the Nutritional Prevention of Cancer Trial (NPCT), dermatological effects in the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT), and type 2 diabetes in all RCTs, although with generally limited and statistically imprecise risk ratios (RRs).</P><P>Of the three liver cancer prevention trials, one reported a strongly reduced risk of liver cancer for male carriers of the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs-Ag) taking inorganic selenium supplements (sodium selenite) for three years, and the other two studies reported little effect of organic selenium supplements (selenium yeast) for the same cancer site (<LINK REF="STD-Li-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yu-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Yu 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Yu 1997</LINK>). Owing to several methodological concerns related to randomisation and completeness of outcome data, we judged the risk of bias as unclear for all three of these RCTs. Therefore, we could not conclude that we found strong support for selenium supplements as agents for prevention of liver cancer. Unfortunately, the other trials did not include liver cancer among their secondary outcomes, with the exception of ECOG 5597 (<LINK REF="STD-Karp-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Karp 2013</LINK>). In this RCT, investigators reported new cases of liver, gallbladder, and bile duct cancer only among selenium-treated participants; however, trial authors observed a total of only six cases, making risk estimates highly statistically unstable. In addition, the population included in this trial, which comprised patients with a history of resected non-small-cell lung cancer, was rather different from the general population.</P><P>The NPCT (<LINK REF="STD-NPCT-2002" TYPE="STUDY">NPCT 2002</LINK>) reported strongly decreased risk for all cancers (-22%), and for oesophageal (-59%), colorectal (-52%), lung (-28%), and prostate (-46%) cancers, showing lesser decreases compared with the ad interim report (Clark 1996, in: <LINK REF="STD-NPCT-2002" TYPE="STUDY">NPCT 2002</LINK>), but still indicative of a strong cancer preventive effect. In addition, when participants were categorised into tertiles according to baseline serum selenium, evidence suggested an inverse relationship between selenium status and effects of supplementation for all cancers and for prostate cancer in the lower two tertiles, and no effect in the upper tertile. However, interpretation of these results is difficult because in 2003, the trial authors acknowledged the occurrence of a detection bias, namely, a considerably higher rate of prostate biopsy in the placebo group, whose cause was not specified. It is unclear whether this detection bias applied only to prostate cancer or applied more generally to other outcomes (as would be the case if the bias was due to unblinding, for example). This major detection bias forced us to downgrade the reliability of this study. Data show an increase in the incidence of its primary outcome - non-melanoma skin cancer - in selenium-supplemented participants, as well as in the incidence of five other cancer types, including melanoma, bladder cancer, breast cancer, head and neck cancer, and lymphoma and leukaemia. Trial authors stated: "These results, although non-significant and based on small case numbers, may indicate potential increased risk with selenium supplementation"; these authors also relied on previous observational studies to provide some support for these positive associations (Duffield-Lillico 2002, in: <LINK REF="STD-NPCT-2002" TYPE="STUDY">NPCT 2002</LINK>).</P><P>The turning point of research on selenium and cancer was the SELECT trial (<LINK REF="STD-SELECT-2009" TYPE="STUDY">SELECT 2009</LINK>), a large, well-conducted prostate cancer prevention trial carried out in the male general population of North America not at high risk of prostate cancer (&#8804; 4 ng/mL in serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and digital rectal examination not suspicious for cancer). This trial, widely considered a milestone in cancer prevention and research, found no difference in prostate cancer incidence for selenium&#8211;supplemented participants as compared with placebo participants after a median follow-up of 5.5 years (hazard ratio (HR) 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90 to 1.18), and no effect of selenium on risk of overall cancer or on risk of other cancers (as well as cardiovascular disease). Median selenium at baseline (135 µg/L in serum in the selenium arm vs 137.6 µg/L in the placebo arm) was higher than in the NPCT (average plasma selenium 114 µg/L). The intervention used in this trial was different from that used in the NPCT (selenomethionine in SELECT, and selenised yeast in the former), although this is unlikely to have been responsible for observed differences (<LINK REF="REF-Waters-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waters 2013</LINK>); in both cases, the intervention comprised organic selenium species (<LINK REF="REF-Block-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Block 2004</LINK>).</P><P>In a small study of organ transplant recipients (<LINK REF="STD-Dreno-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Dreno 2007</LINK>), an unexpected increase in non-melanoma skin cancer incidence emerged; this was a matter of concern in the light of results of the NPCT. In the Polish trial <LINK REF="STD-Lubinski-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lubinski 2011</LINK>, which included 1135 women with high genetic susceptibility to breast cancer due to <I>BRCA1</I> mutations, evidence was more consistent with increased risk of both all cancers and primary breast cancer than with decreased risk, although with statistically unstable HRs (1.4, 95% CI 0.9 to 2.0; and 1.3, 95% CI 0.7 to 2.5, respectively). In this trial, the intervention consisted of administration of 250 µg/d of inorganic tetravalent selenium (selenite).</P><P>More recently, results of three well-conducted phase 3 trials in participants at higher risk for prostate cancer than the general male population indicated that 200 µg/d of selenium (as selenomethionine in one study - <LINK REF="STD-Marshall-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Marshall 2011</LINK> - and as selenised yeast in the other two - <LINK REF="STD-Algotar-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Algotar 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karp-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Karp 2013</LINK>) did not decrease subsequent cancer incidence compared with placebo. The baseline selenium status of populations included in these RCTs was comparable with that in SELECT for Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) S9917 (135 to 138 µg/L in the two arms) (<LINK REF="STD-Marshall-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Marshall 2011</LINK>), slightly lower in the Negative Biopsy Trial (NBT) (126.1 µg/L) (<LINK REF="STD-Algotar-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Algotar 2013</LINK>), and unfortunately unspecified for Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 5597 (<LINK REF="STD-Karp-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Karp 2013</LINK>). Results of these high-quality RCTs, all characterised by low risk of bias and two of which were discontinued before their planned end for futility, were consistent and showed no beneficial effect of selenium treatment on cancer risk.</P><P>Although not eligible for our meta-analyses because their outcome was non-malignant neoplasms rather than cancer, two recently published RCTs on colorectal adenoma risk in participants receiving selenium are worth noting. One of these trials was embedded in SELECT (<LINK REF="REF-Lance-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lance 2017</LINK>), and the other, the SELCEL trial (an intervention study investigating the effect of selenium supplementation or celecoxib for prevention of colorectal adenoma recurrence), allocated 1374 men and women who had undergone removal of colorectal adenomas to either 200 µg/d selenium as selenised yeast, or placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 2016</LINK>). Both RCTs did not find a beneficial effect of selenium for prevention of colorectal adenoma.</P><P>The RCTs carried out on selenium have generated clear evidence of adverse effects associated with selenium exposure, showing both the health effects related to overexposure and the amount at which these effects become evident, thus providing much more reliable evidence than that generated by environmental studies such as <LINK REF="REF-Vinceti-2017a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinceti 2017a</LINK> for use in risk assessments of the safe upper limit of selenium exposure in humans. The trial that provided the most evidence about selenium-associated adverse effects was SELECT. These effects include an excess risk of dermatitis and alopecia, non-melanoma skin cancer, high-grade prostate cancer, and type 2 diabetes. The excess risk of dermatological effects was anticipated as a potential side effect based on previous knowledge of health consequences of human overexposure to this element (<LINK REF="REF-Vinceti-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinceti 2001</LINK>), although such effects had been predicted to occur at higher amounts of selenium exposure than those experienced by SELECT supplemented participants, thus calling for reassessment of the upper limit of selenium exposure. The increased incidence of non-melanoma skin cancer in NPCT and of advanced prostate cancer in SELECT was extremely disappointing, as they were the primary endpoints in these studies, and the expectation was that they would be reduced. The excess risk of diabetes in selenium-supplemented NPCT participants, which was also an unanticipated finding, was mostly limited to participants in the two highest tertiles of baseline plasma selenium (&gt; 105.2 µg/L), raising concern about the safety of selenium amounts that thus far had been considered entirely safe (i.e. on the order of 200 µg/d) (<LINK REF="REF-Stranges-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stranges 2007</LINK>). Therefore, subsequent RCTs added this endpoint to monitored adverse effects that contributed to interruption of the SELECT trial, together with the null effect on cancer mortality and adverse effects of vitamin E on prostate cancer risk (Lippman 2009, in: <LINK REF="STD-SELECT-2009" TYPE="STUDY">SELECT 2009</LINK>). So far, all RCTs that included diabetes among trial endpoints, including trials investigating risk of colorectal adenoma, have shown an increased incidence of type 2 diabetes among selenium-allocated participants, with RRs ranging from 1.08 to 1.71, although most estimates were statistically imprecise (<LINK REF="REF-Vinceti-2017b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinceti 2017b</LINK>). In addition, in SELECT, a slight decrease in excess risk of diabetes in the intervention arm followed completion of selenium supplementation, further suggesting a causal relation between selenium administration and the disease (Lippman 2009 and Klein 2011, in: <LINK REF="STD-SELECT-2009" TYPE="STUDY">SELECT 2009</LINK>). Currently, an excess risk of type 2 diabetes appears to be one of the adverse effects of selenium of greatest concern, and its plausibility is supported by the results of observational human studies (cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional), as well as by some biological plausibility (<LINK REF="REF-Galan_x002d_Chilet-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Galan-Chilet 2017</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Su-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Su 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thompson-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vinceti-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinceti 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vinceti-2017b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinceti 2017b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhou-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhou 2013</LINK>). These side effects, in addition to the null results of RCTs, particularly of those of the highest quality, make implementation of new trials very unlikely owing to ethical concerns.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Observational studies and aetiological association</HEADING><P>From our meta-analyses of 16 prospective observational studies on overall cancer risk, we found lower cancer risk associated with highest selenium exposure compared with lowest exposure. Risk of cancer was 28% (95% CI 7% to 45%) lower in the highest category of selenium exposure than in the lowest, and risk of death from cancer was 24% (95% CI 3% to 41%) lower. Subgroup analyses by sex yielded increased evidence of this inverse association between selenium exposure and cancer risk in men compared with women.</P><P>The inverse association between overall cancer risk and baseline selenium levels was mainly attributable to lower risks of gastrointestinal, lung, and bladder cancer, and for men also prostate cancer. No association was seen between selenium and risk of breast cancer in women. However, when the amount of baseline exposure was taken into consideration, no clear and consistent trend between baseline selenium exposure and risk emerged for any of the major outcomes investigated in observational studies. Lack of lower risk of cancer in the highest versus the lowest selenium category among participants with the lowest baseline exposure levels compared with those with intermediate or high levels, for overall cancer, lung cancer, and prostate cancer, argues against a causal association between selenium exposure and cancer risk. This is supported by lack of a relation between differences in the highest and lowest categories of selenium exposure and the corresponding RR, further suggesting that larger differences in exposure are not associated with large and consistent decreases in RR. Finally, further uncertainty of the evidence generated by observational studies arises from the inconsistent and sometimes sharply conflicting results on the same cancer type that emerged from different studies.</P><P>We saw little evidence of any effect of modification on the relation of selenium and cancer by geographical area of residence. It should however be noted that most of the observational cohort studies that we examined were conducted in Europe and in the USA, and none were conducted in Africa or South America. This regional distribution seems to reflect the under representation of non-Western and resource-poor countries in epidemiological research (<LINK REF="REF-Pearce-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pearce 2004</LINK>). Differential regional representation in epidemiological studies is of special interest for this review, as selenium levels in humans around the world vary significantly. Even if selenium levels measured in included cohorts reflect a broad range of naturally occurring selenium exposure, investigators have reported some of the lowest and highest levels of selenium exposure in populations from South America (<LINK REF="REF-Jaff_x00e9_-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jaffé 1992</LINK>), Africa (<LINK REF="REF-Hurst-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hurst 2013b</LINK>), China (<LINK REF="REF-Li-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 2012</LINK>), and India (<LINK REF="REF-Chawla-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chawla 2016</LINK>) - regions not investigated by any of the reviewed observational studies, with the exception of three Chinese trials. Concerning sex-related effects, our meta-analysis of longitudinal studies revealed an inverse association between RR of cancer and selenium status in some cases in men but not in women for the same cancer type. Unfortunately, although more than half of reviewed studies included mixed-sex populations, most did not report sex-disaggregated results. In available sex-specific results, men are over represented - a fact that may potentially hamper assessment of the relation between selenium exposure and cancer risk in women. Theoretically, factors such as variations in body composition between men and women, including lean body mass versus fat composition, or differences in metabolism or in nutritional requirements (e.g. higher antioxidant requirements, particularly for the urological system) between the two sexes might be associated with differential effects of selenium for prevention of cancer.</P><P>Concerning the indicator used to assess selenium exposure and its relation with cancer risk, we observed generally null associations when evaluating selenium status through assessment of dietary intake, although some inverse associations at specific cancer sites emerged when we used biomarkers such as blood or toenail selenium levels. We extensively reviewed in the previous version of this review the characteristics and limitations of indicators of selenium exposure, with particular reference to dietary assessment methods and biomarkers, and inconsistencies across studies assessing the validity of different indicators (<LINK REF="REF-Ashton-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ashton 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fairweather_x002d_Tait-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fairweather-Tait 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jablonska-2015a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jablonska 2015a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vinceti-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinceti 2014</LINK>). In particular, a large body of literature concerns the limitations of dietary assessment methods, mainly linked to large variations of selenium content in single food types, and the limitations of biomarkers of exposure. Concerning the latter, a major source of exposure misclassification consists of the different behaviours of inorganic and organic selenium species, whose tendency to be retained in the body and to accumulate in specific body tissues greatly varies, although this does not necessarily correlate with their biological activity (<LINK REF="REF-Behne-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Behne 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Behne-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Behne 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kim-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Michalke-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michalke 2017</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Panter-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Panter 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Slavik-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Slavik 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Solovyev-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Solovyev 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steen 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tiwary-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tiwary 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vinceti-2013c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinceti 2013c</LINK>). Investigators have frequently proposed that selenoprotein activity may be an indicator of selenium status and may be tested in association with cancer risk (<LINK REF="REF-Vinceti-2017b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinceti 2017b</LINK>), but this relation has been questioned because different sources of oxidative stress, paradoxically including pro-oxidant selenium species themselves, may upregulate selenoprotein activity (<LINK REF="REF-Jablonska-2015a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jablonska 2015a</LINK>). Furthermore, intake of heavy metals and other dietary factors such as vitamins, metalloids, and amino acids (e.g. methionine) may modify the health effects of selenium, or the relations between selenium exposure and biomarkers (<LINK REF="REF-Jablonska-2015a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jablonska 2015a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vinceti-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinceti 2000</LINK>), owing to metabolic interactions or changes in tissue-specific deposition and retention of selenium (<LINK REF="REF-Behne-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Behne 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zeng-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zeng 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zwolak-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zwolak 2012</LINK>).</P><P>Overall, available evidence indicates the potential for exposure misclassification in observational studies on selenium, as well as the pitfalls associated with an approach based on assessment of total selenium content in peripheral biomarkers, suggesting that in some instances, measurements of nutritional intake might provide better exposure estimates than are provided by biomarkers, particularly in the light of relative exposure to inorganic and organic species of the element. In general, observational cohort studies on selenium and cancer are expected to have been characterised by random exposure misclassification, thus shifting RRs towards the unity and reducing the ability to detect real associations. However, some exposure misclassification may have been non-random, such as that induced by smoking, which although it is a source of selenium exposure also induces lower body selenium levels, possibly owing to an effect of cadmium in increasing selenium excretion (<LINK REF="REF-Vinceti-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinceti 2000</LINK>). In such cases, exposure misclassification based on biomarkers (serum/plasma selenium levels) may have substantially biased risk estimates and may have been associated with some degree of confounding due to the well-known effect of smoking on cancer risk, which could not have been adequately captured and controlled for. Inadequate control for smoking has been suggested to be a major confounder inducing spurious associations between low selenium levels and enhanced cancer risk in observational studies (<LINK REF="REF-Beane-Freeman-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beane Freeman 2015</LINK>).</P><P>In addition to exposure misclassification, and probably more important than this, a major issue affecting observational studies is unmeasured confounding (<LINK REF="REF-Vinceti-2016a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinceti 2016a</LINK>). This potential bias is a matter of greater concern than exposure misclassification because it may have systematically biased RRs in one direction, particularly for some cancer types. Moreover, detection (and control) of this bias is extremely difficult and nearly impossible, given the hundreds of nutritional and non-nutritional lifestyle variables that may be associated with both variations in selenium intake and cancer risk. Among these factors are smoking (<LINK REF="REF-Beane-Freeman-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beane Freeman 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vinceti-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinceti 2013b</LINK>), socioeconomic status - which appears to be positively associated with socioeconomic position in both men and women (<LINK REF="REF-Gundacker-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gundacker 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Niskar-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Niskar 2003</LINK>) -and most likely hundreds of nutritional and toxicological factors that may vary in the diet, together with selenium intake. An approach that would reduce the risk of unmeasured confounding in observational studies might include investigation of dietary patterns rather than single nutrients, but these investigations seem not to have made adjustments for diet quality. Finally, it should be noted that most studies did not take into account the role of genetic factors (related to selenoproteins or otherwise) in the relation between selenium exposure and cancer risk, although some studies have suggested the importance of such relations (<LINK REF="REF-Jablonska-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jablonska 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meplan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meplan 2014</LINK>); the true relevance of genetic factors has not yet been well defined. Some studies examining selenoprotein-related single-nucleotide polymorphisms have suggested a role for genetic variants among genes coding for selenoproteins in modifying cancer risk, or in determining the relation between selenium exposure and subsequent cancer risk, although results have not been consistent (<LINK REF="STD-Geybels-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Geybels 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meplan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meplan 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Penney-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Penney 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Penney-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Penney 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Slattery-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Slattery 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Takata-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Takata 2011</LINK>).</P><P>With awareness of the fundamental limitations of observational studies, even of those of longitudinal design, which may avoid selection bias or reverse causality, investigators designed and carried out in the 1990s and the 2000s several experimental studies as RCTs investigating the effect of selenium supplements on cancer risk. The evidence base from these intervention studies has become so large and complete as to allow a comprehensive evaluation of cancer risk associated with selenium supplementation for some specific cancer types. It is interesting to note that major interest in the cancer preventive activity of selenium originated not just from observational studies (mainly of ecological and cohort design) (<LINK REF="REF-Vinceti-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinceti 2013b</LINK>), but from a randomised trial - the ad interim analysis of the NPCT, which was published in 1996 and attracted great interest from both the scientific community and the general public because of the apparently large beneficial effect that it reported (Clark 1996, in: <LINK REF="STD-NPCT-2002" TYPE="STUDY">NPCT 2002</LINK>). Null results of the most recent low-bias RCTs - <LINK REF="STD-Algotar-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Algotar 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marshall-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Marshall 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SELECT-2009" TYPE="STUDY">SELECT 2009</LINK> - also do not suggest a major or strong role of genetic factors in modifying selenium and cancer relations, given their generally null or troubling results. An exception can be seen in recent data from SELECT, which suggest that a genetic variant of the NKX3.1 androgen-regulated prostate tumour suppressor protein may modify, or increase, the risk of prostate cancer associated with selenium supplementation (<LINK REF="STD-Martinez-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Martinez 2014</LINK>).</P><P>From a methodological perspective, we acknowledge that comparison of risks between highest and lowest exposure categories in observational studies, as performed in the present meta-analysis, is most suitable for identifying an effect when a consistent decrease or increase is seen across absolute exposure levels. Other associations (e.g. threshold effects, U-shaped relations) may have been missed by this method of meta-analysis, or their true effect might have been diminished.</P></SUBSECTION></SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS><APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2018-01-18 13:19:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn"><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">RCTs and preventive efficacy</HEADING><P>This review investigated a diverse range of cancers, substantially extending the analysis compared with that performed in previous reviews. However, cancer is not a uniform condition, and malignant neoplasms show great differences in tumour biology. Only non-melanoma skin cancer, liver cancer, and prostate cancer have been investigated as primary outcomes in the included prevention trials, and, regarding these main outcomes, specific characteristics of study populations may limit the generalisability of results. Participants in included RCTs on skin and liver cancer belonged to populations at high risk for the outcome under investigation, and participants in high-quality prostate cancer trials were at average risk (<LINK REF="STD-Karp-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Karp 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SELECT-2009" TYPE="STUDY">SELECT 2009</LINK>), or at high risk (<LINK REF="STD-Algotar-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Algotar 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marshall-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Marshall 2011</LINK>), for this disease. Most participants in the NPCT were older and white, predominantly male inhabitants of the United States, and the most recent trials were limited to the USA male population.</P><P>Average baseline selenium exposure in the NPCT was less than that characterising subsequent trials carried out in the United States, although it was more similar to that seen in some European populations. Although the NPCT suggested that selenium supplementation was beneficial only at the lowest range of baseline selenium exposure, the most recent studies, carried out in populations generally characterised by higher average selenium exposure, did not confirm such an interaction. The NPCT also found an indication of strong effect modification for sex, as demonstrated, for example, by the HR for all cancers associated with selenium supplementation - 0.67 (95% CI 0.50 to 0.89) in men and 1.20 (95% CI 0.66 to 2.20) in women (<LINK REF="STD-NPCT-2002" TYPE="STUDY">NPCT 2002</LINK>).</P><P>Participants in the SELECT study on prostate cancer prevention were apparently healthy men over 50 years of age from the general population of North America (<LINK REF="STD-SELECT-2009" TYPE="STUDY">SELECT 2009</LINK>). A large sample size and inclusion of non-white participants from different socioeconomic backgrounds support the generalisability of study findings to other adequately nourished populations.</P><P>Selenium supplements generally contain organic or inorganic species of selenium, or a mixture of both (e.g. in the form of selenised yeast). Different species of selenium may exhibit different effects on human health. High-quality RCTs using selenised yeast supplements, almost entirely comprising organic selenium forms (<LINK REF="REF-Block-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Block 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Waters-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waters 2013</LINK>), found no effect of supplementation on the main study outcome and an indication of a harmful effect (i.e. an excess diabetes risk) (<LINK REF="REF-Vinceti-2017b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinceti 2017b</LINK>). The SELECT trial used supplements of L-selenomethionine, which is the major component of selenised yeast, and also found no preventive efficacy. The only two RCTs investigating sodium selenite supplements found a protective effect against liver cancer, and null or adverse effects on breast cancer risk, but we considered these trials to have unclear risk of bias. It is unclear how applicable these results are in other settings and in populations with a different nutritional status. Interpretation of the results of clinical trials using selenium supplements should consider the different chemical forms of selenium, as well as their potentially different health effects when used as supplements (<LINK REF="REF-Vinceti-2013c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinceti 2013c</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weekley-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weekley 2013</LINK>). Most studies used organic selenium as selenised yeast (<LINK REF="STD-Algotar-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Algotar 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NPCT-2002" TYPE="STUDY">NPCT 2002</LINK>), or as selenomethionine (<LINK REF="STD-Marshall-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Marshall 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SELECT-2009" TYPE="STUDY">SELECT 2009</LINK>). However, the chemical form used is unlikely to explain the differences in results between NPCT and the other trials (<LINK REF="REF-Waters-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waters 2013</LINK>). With reference to this issue, of interest are the results of a 'natural experiment' that occurred in Northern Italy, wherein a small population unintentionally consumed for several years drinking water with an unusually high content of selenium in its inorganic hexavalent form - selenate (<LINK REF="REF-Vinceti-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinceti 2000</LINK>). Follow-up of that population revealed increased risk of neurodegenerative disease - a not entirely unexpected finding owing to the potential neurotoxicity of inorganic selenium (<LINK REF="REF-Vinceti-2014a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinceti 2014a</LINK>), along with a slightly increased risk of cancer, mainly due to excess risk of oropharyngeal cancer, melanoma, kidney cancer, and lymphoid malignancies (<LINK REF="REF-Vinceti-2016b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinceti 2016b</LINK>).</P><P>An important issue is the possibility that participants with low baseline selenium status may experience an inverse association between selenium exposure and cancer risk, as suggested by some trial authors (<LINK REF="REF-Lu-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lu 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rayman-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rayman 2009</LINK>). This has been suggested to explain the different results of SELECT and the NPCT, and could also hypothetically explain, at least in part, the different relations found in experimental as compared with observational studies. NPCT found a strong beneficial effect of selenium supplementation among participants at the lowest tertiles of baseline selenium levels; however, the risk of cancer changed abruptly from an apparently protective effect in the two lower tertiles (HR 0.51 and 0.70) to an excess risk in the highest tertile of plasma selenium (HR 1.20, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.86). This occurred despite a difference of only 16.4 µg/L between lowest and highest tertiles, corresponding to a change in dietary selenium intake as low as around 10 µg. This would imply that such a small a change in selenium dietary intake would change a strongly protective effect of the element on cancer risk into a possibly detrimental effect - an implausible scenario given the wide range of selenium intake (from about 20 to several hundred micrograms) characterising Western populations. Moreover, the intermediate tertile of baseline plasma selenium in the NPCT (105.6 to 122.0 µg/L) appeared to be associated not only with reduced overall cancer risk but also with an excess risk of squamous cell skin carcinoma (HR 1.49, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.12) and overall non-melanoma skin cancer (<LINK REF="STD-NPCT-2002" TYPE="STUDY">NPCT 2002</LINK>), as well as diabetes (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.60 to 3.09), whose risk also considerably increased at the highest tertile of baseline selenium (<LINK REF="REF-Stranges-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stranges 2007</LINK>). Overall, this occurrence of both adverse and beneficial effects is unlikely if the selenium supplementation was serving to remedy a selenium deficiency. In addition, the strongest effect of selenium on overall cancer risk at lower levels of baseline selenium status was due to a considerable decrease in prostate cancer, but this finding was subject to detection bias because of a decreased biopsy rate in selenium-supplemented participants, particularly in those with lowest baseline selenium status, as recognised by investigators of the NPCT (<LINK REF="STD-NPCT-2002" TYPE="STUDY">NPCT 2002</LINK>).</P><P>In addition, after NPCT, three of the four high-quality RCTs on selenium supplementation for cancer prevention investigated the possible modifying effect of baseline selenium exposure and found no evidence of a beneficial effect of the intervention even in the lowest baseline exposure category. For instance, in NBT (<LINK REF="STD-Algotar-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Algotar 2013</LINK>), the average baseline plasma selenium level at the lowest tertile of the study population was 101.1 µg/L - much lower than the corresponding level at the middle tertile of NPCT (114.6 µg/L), in which the HR of prostate cancer had been as low as 0.33 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.82). However, in this &#8216;low&#8217; NBT subgroup, investigators found no evidence of a beneficial effect of selenium supplementation on prostate cancer risk. In the SWOG S9917 trial (<LINK REF="STD-Marshall-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Marshall 2011</LINK>), data show no change in the null effect of selenium in the two lowest categories (quartiles) of selenium intake, whose boundaries were &lt; 106 and 106 to132 µg/L - similar to cutpoints of the two bottom NPCT tertiles and of the bottom category of NBT. In these two subgroups of the SWOG population with the lowest baseline selenium status, the RR of prostate cancer was 0.82 (95% CI 0.40 to 1.69) and 1.38 (95% CI 0.68 to 2.78), and in the third upper quartile, the RR was 0.98 (95% CI 0.58 to 1.68), suggesting no consistent trend of an inverse relation between antecedent selenium exposure and effects of supplementation (as was also shown by analysis for trend in this study). Investigators in SELECT reported no reduction in cancer risk among selenium-supplemented participants, although they did not provide specific RRs according to baseline selenium status. Calculation of blood selenium content distribution in SELECT, as well as in the three other RCTs (NPCT, NBT, SWOG), showed substantial overlap of plasma and serum selenium levels between this large trial population and the other study populations (<LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK>). In addition, a more recent case-cohort study carried out within SELECT assessed the effect of selenium supplementation on prostate cancer risk, taking into consideration baseline selenium exposure, as assessed through toenail selenium levels. The study, which involved 1739 prostate cancer cases and 3117 controls, was unable to find a beneficial effect of selenium supplementation in the lowest categories (quintiles) of baseline toenail selenium (<LINK REF="STD-Kristal-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Kristal 2014</LINK>). Actually, a dose-response effect in that SELECT population emerged, but it favoured an increased risk of (high-grade) prostate cancer induced by selenium supplementation among participants belonging to the two upper quintiles of baseline selenium exposure (<LINK REF="STD-Kristal-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Kristal 2014</LINK>). Therefore, it seems reasonable to agree with this SELECT statement: &#8220;The analysis of our data using lower cut points for baseline toenail Se categories, in an attempt to replicate findings from the NPCT, also showed no evidence of benefit from supplementation among men with low baseline Se status (data given in Results). Given these findings, we believe it reasonable to conclude that Se supplementation of men at the low range of Se intake common in USA men will not reduce PCa risk&#8221; (<LINK REF="STD-Kristal-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Kristal 2014</LINK>).</P><P>Overall, results of recent high-quality RCTs do not support the hypothesis that differing baseline selenium status may explain conflicting results between NPCT and SELECT (<LINK REF="REF-Lu-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lu 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rayman-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rayman 2009</LINK>). Results of the most recent RCTs seem therefore to be applicable to populations with various degrees of background selenium exposure, with the exception of populations characterised by extremely low (&lt; 20 µg) or high selenium intake.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Observational studies and aetiological association</HEADING><P>We reviewed data from prospective observational studies in which investigators measured selenium exposure in populations without evidence of cancer, who were then followed up for a specified period of time. We limited our systematic review to cohort studies to avoid or decrease two major sources of bias in observational investigations, particularly in case-control and cross-sectional studies (i.e. selection bias and risk of reverse causality). Data continue to show important differences among included studies in terms of selenium exposure assessment, types of outcomes, and study populations, which may affect their interpretation. The small number of studies that examined most of the meta-analysed types of cancers prevented a thorough investigation of sources of heterogeneity between study results. In particular, we had limited opportunity to explore the influence of specific sources of bias or the methodological quality of epidemiological studies on heterogeneity.</P><P>Participants examined in this review update include more than 2,300,000 individuals, predominantly from Europe and North America, and, to a much lesser extent, from Asia and Australia. We were able to identify no prospective observational studies on selenium and cancer risk from Africa or South America. This regional distribution reflects the under representation of non-Western and resource-poor countries in epidemiological research (<LINK REF="REF-Pearce-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pearce 2004</LINK>). Differential regional representation in epidemiological studies is of special interest for this review, as selenium levels in humans around the world vary significantly. Selenium levels measured in the included cohorts reflect a broad range of naturally occurring selenium exposure, as documented by several epidemiological studies worldwide. However, some of the lowest and highest selenium levels in humans have been reported in populations in South America (<LINK REF="REF-Jaff_x00e9_-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jaffé 1992</LINK>) - a region not investigated by any of the reviewed observational studies.</P><P>More than half of the included studies enrolled mixed-sex populations, but most did not report sex-disaggregated results. In available sex-specific results, men are over represented - a fact that could hamper potential assessment of the relation between selenium exposure and cancer risk in women. Despite this sex imbalance, we systematically saw stronger (inverse) associations with cancer risk among men than among women, for whom such associations with antecedent selenium status was nearly absent. This was true for stomach, colorectal, and lung cancer, and, when added to the inverse association for prostate cancer, led to an impact on overall cancer risk that was clearly lacking in women that could be due to potential confounders (such as smoking, occupational exposures, or other dietary factors) or to a real change in the association between selenium exposure and cancer risk in the two sexes.</P><P>The range of selenium exposure experienced by members of cohorts investigated in the observational studies was generally lower than that experienced by participants in RCTs, who added supplemental selenium, generally 200 µg/d and in its organic forms, to their usual background intake, which ranged from about 70 to 90 µg/d as organic selenium, although some RCTs provided no estimate (<LINK REF="REF-Jablonska-2015a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jablonska 2015a</LINK>). It is theoretically possible that a preventive effect of selenium against cancer exists only at low (&lt; 30 to 50 µg/d) intake of the element, and that it disappears at higher intakes, when &#8216;saturation&#8217; or &#8216;maximisation&#8217; of selenoprotein expression driven by selenium occurs. Investigations have frequently chosen this proteomic endpoint as a reference point for deriving dietary reference values for selenium (<LINK REF="REF-Jablonska-2015a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jablonska 2015a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vinceti-2017a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinceti 2017a</LINK>). Selenium exposure in the range of around 50 to 200 µg of daily selenium intake has not been tested by intervention studies, which have used larger amounts of supplemental selenium, and is unlikely to be tested in RCTs in the future, given the termination of past trials for futility or safety concerns. This possibility must be considered, but within the context of the two fundamental limitations of observational studies - exposure misclassification and unmeasured confounding, which limit the reliability of the evidence they generate and its applicability in terms of cancer prevention.</P><P>A few lines of evidence suggest that even at low levels of selenium exposure, it is unlikely that such an inverse association with cancer risk exists. First, inconsistencies in the results found in our meta-analysis for most cancer sites and lack of a dose-response relation between cancer risk and selenium at varying levels of background selenium exposure, or of a difference between highest and lowest exposure categories, argue against a real relation between selenium and cancer risk. Limited differences between highest and lowest categories of selenium intake, often amounting to a difference of only 20 to 30 µg per day, compared with large variations in selenium intake worldwide (from 10 to 15 µg in low-selenium areas up to several hundred µg in seleniferous areas), also argue against a true relation. Finally, as previously described, some recent high-quality RCTs investigated the effect of baseline selenium status on cancer risk associated with selenium supplementation and found no beneficial effect of selenium supplementation, even among participants with the lowest amounts of baseline exposure. Overall, these findings do not support an association between higher selenium status and lower cancer risk independently from factors such as sex, baseline selenium exposure, and cancer type. One additional observational cohort study, which could not be meta-analysed in this review because it was released in PubMed in July 2017, appears to confirm these conclusions (<LINK REF="REF-Sandsveden-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandsveden 2017</LINK>).</P></SUBSECTION></APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS><QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2018-01-18 13:19:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn"><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">RCTs and preventive efficacy</HEADING><P>SELECT (<LINK REF="STD-SELECT-2009" TYPE="STUDY">SELECT 2009</LINK>), SWOG S9917 (<LINK REF="STD-Marshall-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Marshall 2011</LINK>), NBT (<LINK REF="STD-Algotar-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Algotar 2013</LINK>), and ECOG 5597 (<LINK REF="STD-Karp-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Karp 2013</LINK>) were the only trials considered to have low risk of bias with adequate sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, and reporting of findings, and the consistency of their findings for prostate cancer, as well as for other cancer types for the two trials investigating them (SELECT and ECOG 5597), added to the statistical power of the major trial (SELECT), making their overall results highly reliable and suitable for yielding useful evidence to assess the relation between selenium supplementation and cancer prevention. These trials are also of major importance because (with one exception) they have provided information about baseline selenium exposure and its possible modifying role and about the effect of selenium supplementation on subsequent cancer incidence. Another important feature of these trials has been their ability to address the issue of selenium overexposure and related adverse effects owing to a systematic surveillance system for adverse effects, as well as their ability to extend the monitoring programme to additional effects, if suggested by new analyses targeting previously unplanned secondary endpoints, as was the case for diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Stranges-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stranges 2007</LINK>). This is particularly relevant because all of these trials were planned under the hypothesis, later found to be erroneous but at that time endorsed by regulatory agencies, that the supplemental selenium dose administered to intervention arms (200 µg/d in almost all RCTs) was entirely safe and was well below the upper safe limit of the element, even with consideration of background selenium exposure.</P><P>These trials may continue to yield important results. Secondary analysis of additional endpoints, or based on genetic and non-genetic biomarkers of exposure to selenium and other factors, is still possible. For example, major contributions were yielded by SELECT in 2017, concerning outcomes such as prevention of colorectal adenoma and of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease by selenium supplementation, in both cases with null results (<LINK REF="REF-Kryscio-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kryscio 2017</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lance-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lance 2017</LINK>).</P><P>We assessed the certainty of evidence from high-quality RCTs using the GRADE approach (<A HREF="http://gdt.guidelinedevelopment.org/app/handbook/handbook.html#h.svwngs6pm0f2">http://gdt.guidelinedevelopment.org/app/handbook/handbook.html#h.svwngs6pm0f2</A>) and reported the results of this assessment in the 'Summary of findings' table (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). From preliminary assignment to a high level of certainty due to the experimental study design, we did not identify reasons to downgrade trial quality according to standard GRADE guidelines for risk of all cancers, or for risk of colorectal, lung, bladder, or prostate cancer. In contrast, meta-analysis for breast cancer risk yielded a statistically imprecise result mainly reflecting the small number of cases, and meta-analysis for non-melanoma skin cancer showed high statistical heterogeneity across studies. When addressing factors possibly increasing the certainty of evidence assessment, we considered as non-applicable the GRADE item &#8220;<I>All plausible confounding would reduce the demonstrated effect or increase the effect if no effect was observed</I>&#8221;, neither could we evaluate possible dose-response gradients because unfortunately they were not tested in these RCTs. We therefore rated the certainty of evidence as &#8216;high&#8217; if it indicates no effect of selenium supplementation on all cancers overall, nor on colorectal, lung, bladder, and prostate cancer, and we considered certainty of the evidence as &#8216;moderate&#8217; if it indicates no effect on non-melanoma skin cancer and breast cancer, with downgrades due to heterogeneity and imprecision, respectively. However, stating that the evidence supporting no effect of selenium on cancer prevention at these sites is of moderate rather than high certainty does not mean that the only alternative hypothesis is necessarily that selenium decreases risk of cancer at these sites. Actually, the overall results of high-quality RCTs, when available, suggest a slight to moderate although statistically imprecise increase in the risk of some of these specific cancers following selenium supplementation.</P><P>Concerning the RCTs that we downgraded in our appraisal of risk of bias, we considered the quality of reporting to be an issue in the three trials on liver cancer prevention, thus leading to their classification as having unknown risk of bias. Several papers reported the individual trials, in some cases discrepantly, and essential questions regarding sequence generation, allocation concealment, handling of dropouts and withdrawals, and detection of outcomes remain unanswered. This might be due to inadequate reporting but might also hint at flaws in trial design and implementation. We were uncertain about whether the only trial that reported positive results for selenium supplements in liver cancer prevention randomly assigned participants individually. Cluster randomisation of participants who lived in the same area/village, which may have been the procedure used in this investigation, might have introduced additional bias to the study results (e.g. as the result of different environmental factors contributing to liver cancer development or detection) and might have led to an overestimation of the protective efficacy of selenium. Duplication of results of trials based on a rigorous study design would be necessary to assess the effects of sodium selenite on liver cancer incidence. With regard to the NPCT (<LINK REF="STD-NPCT-2002" TYPE="STUDY">NPCT 2002</LINK>) and the trial of <LINK REF="STD-Dreno-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Dreno 2007</LINK>, indications of serious detection bias for the USA study and of unclear methodological details (such as blinding) for the French investigation led us to consider these experimental studies to be at unclear risk of bias, as discussed in greater detail elsewhere in this review. As far as the trial on breast cancer is concerned (<LINK REF="STD-Lubinski-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lubinski 2011</LINK>), our downgrade of evidence certainty was based on incomplete information provided in the only report that we could retrieve (an abstract), although we acknowledge the relevance of that trial - the only trial specifically targeting breast cancer and a genetically specific population - and the fact that complete reporting of trial procedures may lead to reassessment of trial quality and its upgrade.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Observational studies and aetiological association</HEADING><P>The 70 observational studies were heterogeneous, not only in methodology, but also in the quality and level of detail of reporting and in their potential biases. We assessed our confidence in the evidence from these studies using the GRADE approach and reported our findings in <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>; we reported judgements only for those outcomes evaluated in the 'Summary of findings' table for RCTs with low risk of bias.</P><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">Confounding and other biases</HEADING><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">Selenium measurement and exposure misclassification</HEADING><P>All studies on total cancer risk identified cases by using registry links or a combination of several methods, and losses to follow-up were generally very low. One study on cancer incidence and two studies on cancer mortality analysed less than 80% of all identified cases (incidence: <LINK REF="STD-Coates-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Coates 1988</LINK>: 79%; mortality: <LINK REF="STD-Kok-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Kok 1987a</LINK>: 71%; <LINK REF="STD-Kornitzer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kornitzer 2004</LINK>: 57%). The main reason for this loss of sample was missing selenium measurements. Not all studies that assessed mortality as a measure of cancer risk excluded people with cancer at study inception. This might have led to overestimation of a protective effect if selenium levels were lowered by the presence of cancer. We therefore consider the results for cancer incidence to be more valid than the cancer mortality results.</P><P>Concerning the outcome most frequently investigated - prostate cancer - all but two of the included studies identified cases by using links to cancer registries or a combination of personal follow-up interviews with PSA screening. Two studies with health professionals used self-reporting for case identification, followed by confirmation through medical records. The number of people lost to follow-up was low in all included studies. However, two studies included less than 80% of all identified cases in their analyses because samples were not available for selenium measurement, or diagnosis was not confirmed (<LINK REF="STD-Brooks-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Brooks 2001</LINK>: 39%; van den Brandt 2003, in: <LINK REF="STD-van-den-Brandt-1993" TYPE="STUDY">van den Brandt 1993</LINK>: 77%). In <LINK REF="STD-Brooks-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Brooks 2001</LINK>, bias might have been introduced to the results to some extent, as demographic variables differed between identified and analysed cases.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">Residual confounding and effect modification</HEADING><P>Most of the included studies used controls for smoking and age by matching or using multi-variate techniques. However, the control for self-declared smoking habits may be inadequate, and this may occur particularly in people with a diagnosis of cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Connor-Gorber-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Connor Gorber 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gerritsen-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerritsen 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morales-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morales 2013</LINK>). Control for smoking as a known risk factor for several types of cancer is an important issue in epidemiological studies on cancer risk, and inadequate control for this cancer risk factor has been recognised as a major methodological issue affecting observational research on selenium and cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Beane-Freeman-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beane Freeman 2015</LINK>). This possible bias may be particularly relevant for research on selenium biomarkers and cancer. Cigarette smokers tend to have lower selenium biomarker levels, although cigarette smoking in itself is a source of selenium exposure. In addition to this source of non-random exposure misclassification, it is well recognised that smoking is a powerful cancer risk factor, thus qualifying it also as a major confounder when the selenium and cancer relation is investigated. Therefore, an inverse association between low baseline selenium status and lung cancer risk might be the result of residual confounding and effect modification by smoking, and this may also be true for other cancer types (<LINK REF="REF-Beane-Freeman-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beane Freeman 2015</LINK>). Exposure to environmental and household smoking, which has been shown to be associated with increased risk of cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Gorlova-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gorlova 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nishino-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nishino 2001</LINK>), might be associated with selenium status due to differential nutritional behaviours or other mechanisms.</P><P>Several other factors may act as effect modifiers or confounders. Possible confounding factors could consist of another food nutrient or a certain behaviour that exhibits cancer protective effects and may be associated with higher intake of selenium-rich foods. The number of candidates for such a role is so large that no observational study can measure all of these factors nor account for them. Furthermore, it is well known that intake of heavy metals (such as arsenic, cadmium, and mercury) and other dietary factors such as methionine may substantially modify selenium health effects or relations between selenium exposure and biomarkers (overview, in: <LINK REF="REF-Vinceti-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinceti 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zeng-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zeng 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zwolak-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zwolak 2012</LINK>), and may potentially confound the association between selenium and cancer.</P><P>Some potential confounders cluster in population groups according to socioeconomic position (SEP), and this factor has been shown to vary together with selenium status in both men and women (<LINK REF="REF-Gundacker-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gundacker 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Niskar-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Niskar 2003</LINK>). Only a few studies attempted to control for indicators of adult SEP as potential confounders (e.g. education, occupation, income). None used a composite index of indicators or considered childhood SEP. Some studies restricted their cohorts to certain subgroups of a population, such as occupational groups, and were likely to include only people of a similar adult socioeconomic background.<BR/><BR/>It has been claimed that associations between vitamins and diseases are the result of confounding by social and behavioural factors acting over the course of a lifetime (<LINK REF="REF-Lawlor-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawlor 2004</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Lawlor-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawlor 2004</LINK> argued that divergent results from epidemiological and randomised controlled studies on prevention of cardiovascular disease can be explained by unmeasured confounding due to SEP. Risk of most cancers is known to decrease with higher SEP. Research also indicates a positive association between higher SEP and selenium biomarkers (<LINK REF="REF-Barany-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barany 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Niskar-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Niskar 2003</LINK>). However, other investigations have not confirmed these findings: <LINK REF="REF-Kant-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kant 2007</LINK>, for example, did not find an association between a measure of household poverty and selenium status.<BR/><BR/>The hypothesis of possible confounding due to SEP leading to an indirect association between selenium and cancer would be consistent with results of observational studies for all types of cancers in this review, with the exception of prostate cancer. <LINK REF="REF-Dalton-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dalton 2008</LINK> found that prostate cancer has been diagnosed more often in men of a higher SEP, and we saw a protective association of higher selenium exposure with this cancer type. It remains unclear whether the more frequent diagnosis of prostate cancer in men with a higher SEP actually reflects an excess of prostate cancer incidence in this population. It might also result from differential health and screening behaviours leading to detection of otherwise symptom-free cases, while men with a lower SEP tend to be over represented in diagnoses of the disease at advanced stages (<LINK REF="REF-Rapiti-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rapiti 2009</LINK>). More information on screening and diagnostic behaviours of male cohort participants would be necessary to further elucidate these issues.</P><P>Another consideration is genetic factors, which may both confound and modify the role of selenium in cancer prevention and causation. Recent observational studies examining selenoprotein-related single-nucleotide polymorphisms have suggested a role for genetic variants in genes coding for selenoproteins or other proteins in modifying cancer risk, or even the relation itself between selenium and cancer risk, although results have not been consistent (<LINK REF="REF-Gerstenberger-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerstenberger 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Geybels-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Geybels 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jablonska-2015b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jablonska 2015b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meplan-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meplan 2015</LINK>). Null results of the most recent low-bias RCTs do not suggest that at least the most frequent genotypes strongly influence the selenium and cancer relation (<LINK REF="STD-Algotar-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Algotar 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marshall-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Marshall 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SELECT-2009" TYPE="STUDY">SELECT 2009</LINK>), although such hypotheses cannot be ruled out for more rare genetic variants of selenoproteins or other proteins. Hypothetically, different genetic factors could increase and decrease the risk of cancer associated with selenium exposure, cancelling each other out and resulting in an overall null effect. Additional data from SELECT based on genotyping of study participants, if available, might be extremely useful for assessing hypotheses regarding genetic variants of selenoenzymes and their interaction with selenium status. So far, the only evidence derived from SELECT indicates that single-nucleotide polymorphisms related to the prostate tumour suppressor protein <I>NKX3.1</I> gene (CC genotype at rs11781886) may increase cancer risk following selenium supplementation (<LINK REF="STD-Martinez-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Martinez 2014</LINK>). Recent observational evidence also suggests that polymorphisms of selenoproteins and other antioxidant proteins in men with non-metastatic prostate cancer may be associated with increased risk of high-grade disease and subsequent prostate cancer recurrence (<LINK REF="REF-Gerstenberger-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerstenberger 2015</LINK>).</P></SUBSECTION></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">Summary</HEADING><P>In observational studies, factors that may have accounted for inter-study heterogeneity and that may have biased study results include type of outcome measure, exposure assessment, sex, incomplete control for confounding (smoking and socioeconomic position), and unmeasured confounding, linked to both dietary and non-dietary factors. Given the high risk of bias due to these factors, particularly to the unmeasured confounding inherent in observational studies, along with conflicting results of several studies and lack of any modification of the selenium and cancer relation by level of baseline selenium exposure and by the difference between highest and lowest selenium categories, we consider the evidence provided by observational studies to have very low certainty (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>); therefore these results must be interpreted with great caution and do not allow firm conclusions about a possible cancer-preventive effect of selenium intake. Meta-analyses of spurious findings in observational studies enhance the precision of a summary risk estimate, which does not itself get nearer to the true value and may suggest a non-existent association (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1998</LINK>).</P></SUBSECTION></SUBSECTION></QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE><POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2018-01-08 11:11:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess"><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">RCTs and preventive efficacy and observational studies and aetiological association</HEADING><P>The literature search included major international databases in the English and German languages, and we applied a broad search strategy supplemented by handsearching for references. We assume that we identified all randomised controlled studies and prospective observational studies relevant to our review questions. As we did not search databases in other languages (e.g. Chinese, Russian), we cannot rule out that we might have missed smaller studies that were not published in international journals. However, we consider it unlikely that we could have missed major sources of evidence through our approach. We also might have missed observational studies whose results on selenium exposure and cancer were reported in the body of a paper but were not mentioned in the paper's title or abstract, even if the paper is indexed in the searched databases. However, our systematic use of backward and forward citation chasing and our search for relevant abstracts in conference proceedings or related material should have substantially decreased the risk of missing literature that could have been relevant for our assessment.</P><P>When needed because of lack of complete or appropriate participant data (e.g. when cohorts including cancer and non-cancer participants were mixed in data analysis), we contacted study investigators to ask for data missing from their studies. We also did this when we did not have enough data from published reports to adequately appraise study risk of bias. Sometimes we were unable to obtain answers to questions that we had regarding methods or outcomes, but frequently investigators kindly gave us the information we needed. We were sometimes unable to obtain answers, particularly for earlier epidemiological studies from which primary investigators may have relocated or died, or we found that data were not available in a current electronic format. Similarly, we could not make contact with primary investigators of Chinese RCTs.</P><P>We based our risk of bias assessment on information included in the original publications, unless the trial authors that we contacted gave us additional details. This means that in some instances, we may have overestimated the true risk of bias of studies that did not adequately describe their design in the original publications, such as <LINK REF="STD-Lubinski-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lubinski 2011</LINK>.</P><P>Another concern, especially with epidemiological studies, is publication bias. Cohort and nested case-control studies often are not exclusively designed to test for a specific exposure-outcome association but enable investigators to investigate a range of questions. It is conceivable that unfavourable results were less likely to be published, although we could not find evidence supporting such a hypothesis. Our analysis of this issue through use of a funnel plot gave some support to publication bias for prostate cancer.</P><P>We systematically meta-analysed RCTs even when only two studies were available (<LINK REF="STD-Karp-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Karp 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NPCT-2002" TYPE="STUDY">NPCT 2002</LINK>). Finally, we carried out two meta-analyses of intervention studies - one on all studies, and another on RCTs assessed through a standard appraisal tool as being at low risk of bias - and we emphasised results of the latter, as derived from high-quality experimental studies. For observational studies, we decided a priori to conduct meta-analyses only when five or more studies were available for a study outcome, thus excluding from meta-analysis the few endpoints for which up to four studies were available (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Our primary intention was to facilitate the investigation of heterogeneity between studies included in meta-analyses, to avoid producing more precise, but still unexplainably biased, results. However, our emphasis was clearly given to experimental studies because this trial design is widely recognised as the only one that may provide convincing evidence of an association between a factor and disease risk, or more generally biological endpoints, and this may be particularly true in nutritional epidemiology (<LINK REF="REF-Vinceti-2016a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinceti 2016a</LINK>).</P><P>Finally, the authors of this review, as already noted in the previous version of the review, came from different disciplines and have different areas of focus (e.g. epidemiology, biostatistics, clinical medicine, nutrition). We continue to consider such variety of expertise to be a strength of this review, and we made use of it by applying multiple checking procedures during the entire review process whenever possible.</P></SUBSECTION></POTENTIAL_BIASES><AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2018-01-16 19:10:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Recent reviews that have investigated the relation between selenium and cancer prevention have generally concluded that this trace element has no clear beneficial effect(<LINK REF="REF-Bjelakovic-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bjelakovic 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cortes_x002d_Jofre-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cortes-Jofre 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cui-2017a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cui 2017a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fortmann-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fortmann 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kushi-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kushi 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moyer-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moyer 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Posadzki-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Posadzki 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schwingshackl-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwingshackl 2017</LINK>), although updated systematic reviews and meta-analyses on selenium encompassing all of the most recent intervention studies are lacking. These results are true for both all cancers and prostate cancer, and for other specific cancers, such as lung cancer. The turning point in the evaluation of the effect of selenium on cancer risk is generally acknowledged to have been SELECT, and the other trials, although their findings are consistent with SELECT, have received less attention, probably mainly because of their smaller size. It is understandable that most of the selenium trials under way during the 2000s and the 2010s and originally implemented mainly as the result of the promising results of the original NPCT, particularly its ad interim 1996 report, were eventually discontinued owing to the results of SELECT (which was discontinued too) and the null results of ad interim futility analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Vinceti-2017b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinceti 2017b</LINK>). This seems also to be true for <LINK REF="REF-Brodin-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brodin 2015</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Chen-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2013</LINK>, and <LINK REF="REF-Vinceti-2017a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinceti 2017a</LINK> - planned RCTs on the possible utility of selenium for cancer therapy - and is an issue of considerable interest that has been investigated so far in very few phase 2 and phase 3 trials (<LINK REF="REF-Goossens-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goossens 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Karamali-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karamali 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Muecke-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muecke 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stratton-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stratton 2010</LINK>) (although other trials appear to be under way such as <LINK REF="REF-Vinceti-2017b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinceti 2017b</LINK>).</P><P>Concerning observational studies, very few recent reviews have investigated the selenium and cancer relation, and they have focused on only a few cancer sites. These reviews have generally yielded results consistent with ours. For prostate cancer, a recent review found no association between baseline serum selenium and risk in cohort studies (<LINK REF="REF-Cui-2017b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cui 2017b</LINK>), as was reported by <LINK REF="REF-Allen-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allen 2016</LINK>, which conducted a pooled analysis using individual data from 15 cohort studies. However, in the latter review, baseline serum selenium status was determined to be inversely associated with high-grade prostate cancer risk, as was toenail selenium and subsequent prostate cancer incidence. <LINK REF="REF-Gong-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gong 2016</LINK> also found reduced risk of gastric cancer among participants in the highest baseline selenium exposure category. Other reviews and meta-analyses considered other cancer types such as liver, pancreatic, lung, and breast cancer, but these reviews generally incorporated case-control and cross-sectional studies in addition to cohort studies, further increasing the risk of bias due to heterogeneity of study designs. Most reviews on observational studies have acknowledged the key methodological issues noted in this type of study, namely, risk of unmeasured confounding and potential biases associated with this limitation.</P></AGREEMENT></DISCUSSION><CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2018-01-18 13:19:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn"><IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2018-01-18 13:19:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn"><P>A large body of evidence is now available from high-quality randomised controlled trials on effects of selenium supplementation on cancer risk, with two new studies published since the last version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Vinceti-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinceti 2014</LINK>). None of the new relevant studies have provided information to change the conclusions of the previous version of this review. Overall, results of these studies have consistently shown no effect of selenium in preventing the type of cancer most consistently and strongly associated with antecedent selenium exposure - prostate cancer - or in preventing cancer overall, even when assessment focused on participants with the lowest selenium status at baseline. These intervention studies have suggested that selenium administration on the order of 200 µg/d increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer, advanced prostate cancer (in individuals with highest baseline exposure), dermatological abnormalities, and type 2 diabetes. No trial involving administration of low doses of selenium, on the order of 50 to 100 µg/d, has been performed so far.</P><P>An update of the meta-analysis of observational cohort studies continues to show lower risk of cancer and of some specific cancers (colorectal, prostate, and breast) in participants with highest exposure levels at baseline, but these studies are at substantial risk of bias from exposure misclassification and unmeasured confounding. In addition, results of these observational studies are inconsistent and sometimes are strongly conflicting, and no evidence of any dose-response relation emerged from our analysis when we considered background selenium status or differences in baseline selenium exposure.</P><P>Overall, findings of our review do not provide evidence supporting a cancer&#8211;preventive effect of selenium in humans.</P></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2018-01-06 17:04:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare E Jess"><P>Some questions regarding selenium, such as whether selenium might influence cancer risk in individuals with very low or very high baseline exposure to this element, or in individuals with different genotypes, have not been fully resolved, although currently available evidence from randomised trials offers little support for such hypotheses. For ethical reasons, in the light of potential toxicity of selenium supplementation and failure of the most recent and well-conducted experimental cohort studies to find beneficial effects, new randomised trials on the selenium and cancer relation are unlikely to be undertaken in the future. Therefore expanding results of the SELECT trial and of other high-quality trials to examine additional outcomes such as liver cancer and non-melanoma skin cancer, as recently happened for other outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Kryscio-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kryscio 2017</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lance-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lance 2017</LINK>), and to analyse subgroups with specific characteristics (baseline selenium exposure and genetic factors), continues to appear to be the best available option for clarifying these issues. Unfortunately, most of these randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT), could not address possible sex differences because they enrolled only men.</P><P>Finally, when interpreting the results of both intervention and observational studies, it must be taken into account that various chemical forms of selenium have very different nutritional and toxicological properties, and that almost all observational studies have assessed only total selenium exposure. Future observational studies would contribute to a better understanding of the selenium and cancer relation by including selenium speciation among their exposure assessment methods when evaluating cancer risk.</P></IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH></CONCLUSIONS></BODY><ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS MODIFIED="2018-01-18 13:20:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn"><P>We thank the Cochrane Gynaecological, Neuro-oncology and Orphan Cancer Group Editorial Team for their advice, in particular, Clare Jess, for her wisdom, kindness, and professionalism in overseeing the entire editorial process, and Joanne Platt, for designing the strategy and implementing the literature search.

R, Del Giovane C</P><P>We are pleased to see that a revised version of the review has now been published though it has taken longer than we would have wished. In the updated review, the authors have remedied some of the shortcomings which we pointed out, but not all. I have attached detailed comments on what we think still needs to be changed and hope that these points can be remedied in the very near future.</P><P>Comments by section are given below.</P><P>Abstract<BR/>1. Selection criteria refer to including RCTs with &#8220;healthy adult participants&#8221;. However, it is clear that SELECT was the only trial that included &#8220;healthy adult participants&#8221;, all other trials included participants with a high risk of cancer (Li, <LINK REF="STD-Yu-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Yu 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Yu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Yu 1997</LINK>, Marshall, Algotar, Dreno) or a previous history of cancer (<LINK REF="STD-NPCT-2002" TYPE="STUDY">NPCT 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Reid-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Reid 2008</LINK>). The word &#8220;healthy&#8221; should be removed and the statement should be modified to reflect the high proportion of participants at high risk of cancer.</P><P>2. The main results of the pooled analysis of RCTs overwhelmingly reflect the results of by far the largest trial, SELECT. However, SELECT was carried out in a population of high selenium status. This needs to be mentioned either under &#8220;Main results&#8221; or under &#8220;Authors&#8217; conclusions&#8221;. Not to mention it is to ignore a fact that is likely to be highly relevant to the outcome.</P><P>3. The &#8220;Authors&#8217; conclusions&#8221; assert that there is &#8220;little evidence of any influence of baseline selenium status&#8221;, but that lack of evidence all relates to trials in populations of much higher baseline selenium status than the NPCT where such an effect was seen: baseline plasma Se was 114 µg/L in the NPCT compared to 126.1 µg/L in Algotar and 135.2-138.1 µg/L in Marshall. [No such effect was seen in SELECT, but baseline selenium status was also high - 136 µg/L (Kristal et al. 2014).]</P><P>Plain language summary<BR/>The sentence that begins &#8220;Recent trials that were judged to be well conducted and reliable&#8230; &#8220; should be modified to read &#8220;Recent trials that were judged to be well conducted and reliable, though conducted in high-selenium populations, have found no effects of selenium supplementation on reducing the overall risk of cancer or on reducing the risk of particular cancers, including prostate cancer&#8221;.</P><P>Main text<BR/>Page 5 column 2: We previously pointed out that having inclusion criteria that allowed RCTs of only four-weeks&#8217; length to be included is unjustifiable. While no studies as short as that were included, clearly a four-week intervention with Se is insufficient to alter cancer risk so what is the justification retaining this inclusion criterion?</P><P>Page 21 column 1: We previously objected to the description of an increased risk of diabetes mellitus type 2 being found in SELECT yet such a description is there again: &#8220;An increase in diabetes mellitus type 2 was seen in the selenium-alone group (RR 1.07, 99% CI 0.94 to 1.22)&#8221;, despite the confidence interval spanning 1. The only trial in which an increased risk of type-2 diabetes was seen was the NPCT. The authors also refer to a short-term effect of selenium supplementation on type-2 diabetes risk. However, there is no mention, either here or elsewhere, of our RCT that found no increased risk of type-2 diabetes in 500 people treated with 100, 200 or 300 µg selenium or placebo for a period of six months (Rayman et al. A randomized trial of selenium supplementation and risk of type-2 diabetes, as assessed by plasma adiponectin. PLoS One. 2012;7:e45269).</P><P>Page 20-21: There should have been some mention of baseline selenium status in this section. Clearly SELECT was showing evidence of toxicity, which is unsurprising given the high baseline status and substantial level of supplementation.</P><P>Page 23 column 2: In discussing the change from a protective to a possibly detrimental effect, the authors should be aware of the possibility of a threshold effect that may relate to a mechanism dependent on selenoprotein concentration/activity. Furthermore, discussing the relationship between selenium status and the risk of non-melanoma skin cancer and type-2 diabetes in the same breath ignores the likelihood of totally different mechanisms applying.</P><P>Page 23 column 2: The sentence &#8220;Little evidence of a beneficial effect of selenium supplementation was noted among participants with the lowest baseline selenium exposure (plasma selenium &lt; 106 &#956;g/L) in either the prostate cancer trial of Marshall et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Marshall-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Marshall 2011</LINK>) or the prostate cancer trial of Algotar et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Algotar-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Algotar 2013</LINK>), despite the fact that 45% of the participants in that study had baseline plasma selenium levels &lt; 123 &#956;g/L &#8211; the suggested threshold for beneficial effects of selenium supplementation according to the NPCT (<LINK REF="STD-NPCT-2002" TYPE="STUDY">NPCT 2002</LINK>)&#8221;, should be qualified by pointing out that both the Marshall and Algotar trials were in men at high risk for prostate cancer and in whom prostate cancer was probably already initiated. Thus this is not an appropriate test for evidence of benefit of selenium supplementation for primary prevention in those with low selenium status.</P><P>Page 24 column 2: SNPs could be mentioned as a potential explanation of &#8220;the &#8230; unexplained heterogeneity in the reaction of participants&#8217; plasma selenium levels to selenium supplementation&#8221;.</P><P>Page 25 column 1: As explained in our criticisms of the primary review, we and others profoundly disagree with the statement that &#8220;measurements of nutritional intake might provide better exposure estimates than do biomarkers, which may considerably mis-classify the exposure to inorganic and organic selenium sources&#8221;. This is particularly true of exposure to selenium where food concentration data differ very considerably from one part of the world to another and many countries have no such data.</P><P>Page 28 column 1: The paragraph that contains the sentence &#8220;These ideas stimulated the largest ever cancer prevention trial, SELECT, which failed to provide support for this hypothesis, and two additional prostate cancer trials (<LINK REF="STD-Algotar-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Algotar 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marshall-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Marshall 2011</LINK>),whose results were in line with the SELECT findings in failing to find a beneficial effect of selenium&#8221;, needs to point out that SELECT, <LINK REF="STD-Algotar-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Algotar 2013</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Marshall-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Marshall 2011</LINK> were all carried out in high-selenium populations and that <LINK REF="STD-Algotar-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Algotar 2013</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Marshall-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Marshall 2011</LINK> were both in men at high risk of prostate cancer.</P><P>Page 29 column 2: It is not especially accurate or informative to say that the Blot and Hercberg trials produced divergent results. Although they were both RCTs, they used very different designs in hugely different populations with different baseline selenium levels. It could equally fairly be said that they produced comparable results in that they both saw beneficial effects (of one sort or another).</P><P>Page 30 column 1: Karp was a secondary prevention trial in lung-cancer patients. In relation to that trial, there should be some mention of the likely difference in mechanisms of primary prevention and those relevant to prevention of secondary tumours in already initiated patients.</P><P>Page 30 column 1: the previous RCT that found no increased risk of type-2 diabetes in 500 people treated with 100, 200 or 300 µg selenium or placebo for a period of six months should be mentioned (Rayman et al.

Being at high, low or intermediate risk of cancer, or affected by any other disease, or previously affected by another cancer, was not considered to be an exclusion criteria and did not preclude the term &#8216;healthy&#8217; with respect to the trial outcome(s), which in all cases consisted of the incidence of a primary cancer. In our review, we specifically listed in detail the enrolment criteria for the trials, and before performing the meta-analysis we excluded studies retrieved with our literature search that were not based on healthy adults (397 studies removed &#8211; see <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK> of our review). Being &#8216;totally&#8217; healthy&#8211; i.e., apparently free from any disease and at a low risk for cancer or other chronic disease, was not a selection criteria for any of the selenium (Se) trials, including SELECT itself (for example, we used the term &#8216;apparently healthy men&#8217; for the SELECT population in page 23).</P><P>As noted by Brigelius-Flohé et al., the pooled analysis is obviously influenced by the largest trial, SELECT, and this is even more true when we limited the analysis, as recommended by the Cochrane review guidelines, to the trials at low risk of bias. SELECT has been of fundamental importance in selenium (Se) research for its large size, long follow-up, and broad range of outcomes, all of which are important for defining the so far uncertain relation between Se and primary prevention of cancer and the adverse health effects of the metalloid. Results from SELECT, which are continuing to emerge in the literature (Kristal et al., JNCI; Martinez et al., Cancer Prev Res; Albanes et al., Cancer Prev Res 2014), in addition to other recent relevant trials (Karp et al., 2013), have been systematically confirmed by all the high-quality, low-bias trials so far carried out (some of which could unfortunately not be included in our review, having been published after our literature search deadline), with the exception of the excess high-grade prostate cancer risk in the Se-supplemented individuals with the highest baseline selenium status recently reported in SELECT (Kristal et al., JNCI 2014), an unexpected and concerning finding so far not investigated in the other trials with the partial exception of Marshall et al. (Cancer Prev Res 2011).</P><P>Assuming that the SELECT population was a group with &#8216;high Se status&#8217; while NPC subjects had a low Se status, and suggesting that their different results were likely due to this, as claimed by Brigelius-Flohé et al., is not well-founded. Defining a low-Se status and a high-Se status is very subjective and debatable, but whatever approach is chosen, no such difference between these two trial populations emerges. We would argue that the more important distinctions between the two trials are that one had low risk of bias and high statistical power (SELECT), while the other one had high risk of bias and much lower power (NPC). The two trials also used different Se preparations. In fact, if we estimate Se intake though its relation with serum/plasma level computed with the rule of thumb proposed by Haldimann et al. (J Trace Elem Med Biol 1996) in the 30-120 µg/l of plasma or serum Se, average baseline dietary exposure corresponding to their blood Se levels was around 90 µg/day for SELECT participants, and 76 for NPC subjects. If we compare these values to the Se recommended dietary intake (or comparable indexes defined as &#8216;recommended intake level&#8217;, &#8216;dietary reference value&#8217;, &#8216;average nutrient requirement&#8217; etc.), both are well above these reference values for Se, whether using the 26-34 µg/day recommended intake of the World Health Organization and Food Agriculture Organization (WHO-FAO 2004), the 25-35 µg/day range of the Japanese Ministry of Health Labour and Welfare (2005), the 55 µg/day of the US Institute of Medicine and Food Nutrition Board (2000), the 70 µg/day of European Food Safety Authority (EFSA 2014) or the 55 µg/day of the Italian Human Nutrition Society (SINU, Milan 2014). For a comprehensive review of this issue we refer to among other sources the Eurreca database at <A HREF="http://www.eurreca.org">www.eurreca.org</A>, Cavellaars et al., Eur J Clin Nutr 2010, Vinceti et al. 2013 Sci Total Environ, and to the EFSA journal, 2014. Thus, according to all of these standards, both the SELECT and NPC populations should be defined as having a &#8216;high Se status&#8217;. This would be further strengthened should we use the 110 µg/L serum Se cutpoint for Se toxicity (increased prevalence of depressive symptoms and higher levels of urinary 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine) recently suggested by two observational studies (Galan-Chilet et al., Free Rad Biol Med 2014 and Conner et al., J Nutr 2014): according to such threshold values, all the RCTs included in our review including SELECT and NPC, with the exception of the Chinese ones, should be considered as carried out in populations with &#8216;very high&#8217; Se status.</P><P>In our review, given the uncertainties and complexity of the issue, we consciously avoided labelling the populations in RCTs as low or high Se status, preferring instead to report baseline exposure levels and to use relative measures for their comparison (such as &#8216;lower status&#8217;, &#8216;the lowest exposure category&#8217; instead of &#8216;low Se status&#8217;, and the converse for higher exposures). This was done particularly for the most influential studies in the review, the RCTs, to facilitate assessment of whether baseline Se exposure may influence the response to Se supplementation in terms of cancer risk and comparison of distributions of baseline Se exposure. We refer Brigelius-Flohé et al. to our analysis in the review (pages 22/24), which found the following points, among others: the marginal difference in intake of around 15 µg/day between the SELECT and NPC populations, in contrast with usual differences of Se intake at the population and the individual level, which span hundreds of micrograms; the occurrence of adverse effects even in the trials with the lowest baseline exposure level, such as the increased incidence of skin cancer in NPC and of type 2 diabetes in all trials which so far investigated this outcome; and the considerable overlap of Se exposure levels between the various RCTs. Finally, in our review we had to state that &#8216;analyses stratified by baseline Se status are not available for SELECT: Such analyses would greatly help to elucidate this issue.&#8217; Fortunately, such evaluation (though so far only for prostate cancer) has been subsequently published (Kristal et al., JNCI 2014, and specifically its table 4). As it happens, their finding based on quintiles of baseline Se exposure is consistent with our previous assessment. In fact, the abstract of that paper reported that &#8216;Se supplementation did not benefit men with low Se status but increased the risk of high-grade PCa among men with high Se status.&#8217;</P><P>When programming the update of this Cochrane review, we decided not to further restrict the inclusion criteria for studies compared with the 2011 review, but rather to relax them somewhat. For example, meta-analysis was carried out for site-specific cancer types when only 2 randomised trials were available. We even discussed whether to include trials reported only as abstracts and not <I>in extenso</I>, but decided against this due to lack of consensus, even though this precluded consideration of at least two possible relevant RCTs, the Karp et al. trial for prevention of second primary tumours in patients with resected lung cancer (Karp et al., J Clin Oncol 2010) and a trial on the risk of cancer in <I>BRCA1</I> carriers (Lubinski et al., Hered Cancer Clin Pract 2011). We agree with Dr. Brigelius-Flohé et al. that a trial with only 4 weeks of supplementation would be very unsatisfactory, even in case of &#8216;mega-dose&#8217; Se administration, and such a dosage scheme would not have passed un-remarked upon in our literature review, had we found such a study.</P><P>As far as Brigelius-Flohé et al. comments about the excess diabetes incidence in SELECT among subjects allocated to Se administration, we are surprised to see this objection: reporting and commenting on the adverse effects of RCTs is mandatory according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins JPT and Green S, Chapter 4 &#8216;Adverse effects&#8217;) and more generally according to ethical and scientific issues. We also note that Brigelius-Flohé et al. when commenting on the excess diabetes incidence rely entirely on statistical significance testing (&#8216;..despite the confidence interval spanning 1&#8217;), an approach generally considered to be inappropriate for evaluating findings from epidemiologic studies (Sterne and Davey Smith, BMJ 2001; Rothman, Greenland and Lash, Modern Epidemiology 2008; Stang, Poole and Kuss, Eur J Epidemiol 2010), especially for adverse effects that the studies were not necessarily powered to detect. The excess diabetes risk was one of the concerning findings yielded by SELECT (Vinceti et al., Rev Environ Health 2009), mirroring the observation of an increased diabetes incidence detected in the previous NPC trial (Stranges et al., 2007). We also noted that such excess risk was found in all four RCTs that investigated this outcome, and this was also supported by some biological plausibility, though we did not carry out an in-depth investigation of the diabetes &amp; Se relation, for which we refer to recent literature (<LINK REF="REF-Steinbrenner-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steinbrenner 2013</LINK>; Vinceti et al., J Trace Elem Med Biol 2015). Contrary to the claims of Brigelius-Flohé et al., we did not mention the 2012 Rayman et al. trial published in PLoS One for the obvious reason that it did not include cancer nor diabetes among the outcomes under investigation.</P><P>The comment by Brigelius-Flohé et al. stating that &#8216;Clearly SELECT was showing evidence of toxicity, which is unsurprising given the high baseline Se status and substantial level of supplementation&#8217; is also unfounded. Being ourselves among the few investigators who have systematically reviewed the human health risks of chronic low-dose Se overexposure, (Vinceti et al., Rev Environ Health 2001 and 2009; Vinceti et al., Sci Total Environ 2013; Vinceti et al., Toxicol Lett 2014), we must point out that the upper limit of &#8216;safe&#8217; Se exposure was and is set at a higher level than that of the SELECT study groups allocated to Se administration, i.e. at 400 µg/day (US Institute of Medicine 2000; World Health Organization Food Agriculture Organization 2004, and the Office of Dietary Supplements of the National Institute of Health accessed at ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Selenium-HealthProfessional/ on January 20, 2015).</P><P>Brigelius-Flohè et al. challenge discussing the excess risk of diabetes and of non-melanoma risk cancer &#8216;in the same breath&#8217; since this would &#8216;ignore the likelihood of totally different mechanisms&#8217;. This misrepresents the review, which makes no claim that risk of non-melanoma skin cancer and diabetes operate through the same mechanisms.</P><P>Brigelius-Flohè et al. state that the participants in the Marshall et al. and Algotar et al. studies were at high risk for prostate cancer (as we mentioned in our review) and that prostate cancer was probably already initiated in them. The participants in these trials were biopsy-negative for prostate cancer, and therefore the latter statement by Brigelius-Flohè et al. is speculation not supported by the available evidence. Contrary to the claims of Brigelius-Flohè et al., the Marshall et al. 2011 trial and the Algotar et al. 2013 trial were important, not only since they confirmed key results of SELECT trial, but also since they addressed the issue of influence of baseline Se status on the effect of Se supplementation on (prostate) cancer risk. We refer Brigelius-Flohè et al. to pages 23 and 24 of our review where we analyzed this issue in-depth, and specifically to the following text: &#8220;Little evidence of a beneficial effect of Se supplementation was noted among participants with the lowest baseline Se exposure (plasma Se &lt; 106 &#956;g/L) in either the prostate cancer trial of Marshall et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Marshall-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Marshall 2011</LINK>) or the prostate cancer trial of Algotar et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Algotar-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Algotar 2013</LINK>), despite the fact that 45% of the participants in that study had baseline plasma Se levels &lt; 123 &#956;g/L-the suggested threshold for beneficial effects of Se supplementation according to the NPCT (<LINK REF="STD-NPCT-2002" TYPE="STUDY">NPCT 2002</LINK>)&#8221;. In addition, as previously mentioned, a 2014 report published after final submission of our review showed that SELECT subjects in the lowest baseline status categories did not benefit from Se supplementation with regard to (prostate) cancer risk, though they did not experience the increased risk of high-grade prostate cancer induced by the Se supplementation observed in the highest exposure groups (Kristal et al. JNCI 2014).</P><P>We did not mention SNPs as a potential explanation of &#8220;the ... unexplained heterogeneity in the reaction of participants&#8221; since we were specifically reporting the comments of Ashton et al. Am J Clin Nutr 2009, who did not primarily focus on this possibility. However, as Brigelius-Flohè et al. may note from several statements within our review, we agree about the potential importance of SNPs, and this is why we frequently mention the potential role of genetic factors in our review.</P><P>Page 25, column 1 (assessment of Se exposure): though we could not review in-depth all studies concerning methods for assessing Se exposure and related issues, we wanted to mention the human studies finding an association between dietary and biomarker Se, those unable to find it, and the advantages and limitations of all these approaches. We refer Brigelius-Flohè et al. to specific reviews or research papers on this important issue, which show that inadequate Se exposure classification made on the basis of dietary intake or of hair, blood, urine and toenail levels may have had a major role in the inconsistencies among various observational studies and between the observational and the experimental investigations. We stand behind the brief statement in our review concerning Se exposure assessment methods in the human body.</P><P>Contrary to the claims of Brigelius-Flohé et al., the Blot and Hercberg trials indeed produced divergent results, and the statement about these two trials that &#8216;both saw beneficial effects&#8217; is untrue. Though the effects of these trials administering (different) mixtures of vitamins and minerals and carried out in very different populations cannot be adequately summarized in few words, it can be easily appreciated that the Chinese trial found beneficial effects on decreased mortality, mainly due to reduced cancer rates (especially for stomach cancer) (Blot et al., JNCI 1993 and Am J Clin Nutr 1995) while the second trial found beneficial, null and adverse effects of supplementation overall as well as specifically for cancer (Hercberg et al., Arch Intern Med 2004 and Br J Nutr 2006). Among the adverse effects following supplementation, Hercberg et al. found an alteration of the lipid profile (Hercberg et al., Lipids 2005) and an increase in melanoma incidence (Hercberg et al., J Nutr 2007), later shown to decrease during the post-intervention follow-up, further supporting a causative role of the treatment (Ezzedine et al., Eur J Cancer 2010). However, since these two trials did not include an intervention arm receiving Se alone, they were excluded from our meta-analysis as were all trials that administered Se together with other substances. They were included in a different Cochrane review (Bjelakovic et al. <A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22419320">Cochrane Database Syst Rev</A> 2012).</P><P>Page 30, column 1: contrary to the statements of Brigelius-Flohé et al., the Karp et al. trial, published <I>in extenso</I> in J Clin Oncol 2014, was not a secondary prevention trial, but a primary prevention trial, as we indicated in our review. As literally abstracted from the Karp paper, study objectives were &#8220;<I>to evaluate the efficacy of Se supplementation in reducing the incidence of lung second primary tumors in patients who had been treated for stage I non&#8211;small-cell lung cancer; to evaluate the qualitative and quantitative toxicity of daily Se supplementation; and to compare the incidence of specific cancers, mortality from cancer, and overall survival of patients treated with Se supplementation versus placebo</I>&#8221;. The study population was therefore comparable to that of the NPC trial in the sense that both included participants with a recent history of cancer: the first trial comprised 1561 individuals who had been treated for stage I non&#8211;small-cell lung cancer with complete surgical resection, while the second RCT included 1312 individuals with a history of two or more basal cell carcinomas or one squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, with one of these occurring within the year prior to randomization. We note that the results of the low-bias Karp et al. trial, which could not be meta-analyzed in our review having been published <I>in extenso</I> beyond the literature search deadline, were fully consistent with the conclusions of our review.</P><P>Brigelius-Flohé et al. state that &#8216;A question that remains ignored by this review, by design, is whether Se in combination with other agents may be beneficial in cancer&#8217;. As they correctly recognize, this was not included among the objectives of our review. However, we agree with Brigelius-Flohé et al. concerning the use of selenium compounds in cancer therapy warranting strong attention and in-depth investigation, as stated in our section &#8216;Se as a potential cancer therapeutic agent&#8217; in Vinceti et al., J Environ Sci Health C Environ Carcinog Ecotoxicol Rev 2013. However, caution must be used when addressing this issue, also due to the concerning results of a recent study in patients affected by nonmetastatic prostate cancer, where supplementation of &#8805;140 µg/day Se was found to be associated with excess mortality from prostate cancer (Kenfield et al., JNCI 2015).</P><P>We wish to thank Brigelius-Flohé et al. for their search for typos and mistakes in our 193 page review. They claim that three errors were found; however, these were not errors. The acronym SU.VI.M.AX was sometimes used by the authors of that trial, and we used it in our review only when citing a reference titled with that form of the acronym (Arnaud et al., J Trace Elem Med Biol 2007), while we used the more common &#8216;SU.VI.MAX&#8217; for the remaining papers. As far as the 78.96 &#8216;molecular weight&#8217; of Se is concerned, we recognize that the adjective &#8216;atomic&#8217; is more commonly used than &#8216;molecular&#8217;, but the latter may also be used in connection with &#8216;weight&#8217; for Se, as it may be observed at the PubChem Open Chemistry database of the US National Institute of Health (<A HREF="http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/selenium">http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Se</A>, accessed January 20, 2015) or the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention - <A HREF="http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/">National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health</A> website (<A HREF="http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/81-123/pdfs/0550.pdf">http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/81-123/pdfs/0550.pdf</A>, accessed January 20, 2015). Finally, aggressive marketing of Se supplements for breast cancer can be detected through a simple Google Internet search. Admittedly, this is also true for other cancers, including of course prostate cancer, and more generally for chronic disease or conditions claimed to be due to oxidative stress and alleged to be prevented by Se. However, such marketing approaches differed depending on the diseases, populations, sources of information, strategies, and periods involved, and were not analyzed because they were outside the scope of our current review.</P></FEEDBACK_REPLY><FEEDBACK_CONTRIBUTORS MODIFIED="2015-02-03 12:30:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Marco Vinceti, Gabriele Dennert, Catherine M Crespi, Marcel Zwahlen, Maree Brinkman, Maurice PA Zeegers, Markus Horneber, Roberto D&#8217;Amico, Cinzia Del Giovane</P></FEEDBACK_CONTRIBUTORS></FEEDBACK_ITEM><FEEDBACK_ITEM ID="FBK-02" MODIFIED="2018-01-18 11:10:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare E Jess" NO="2"><TITLE MODIFIED="2012-03-08 15:53:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">Selenium for preventing cancer</TITLE><DATE_SUBMITTED><DATE DAY="23" MONTH="11" YEAR="2011"/></DATE_SUBMITTED><FEEDBACK_SUMMARY MODIFIED="2017-08-01 16:41:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Re: Dennert et al., Selenium for preventing cancer, <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, 2011, Issue 5. As selenium scientists with considerable knowledge of the selenium-cancer field, we wish to draw to the attention of The Cochrane Collaboration the shortcomings of the recent review cited above. We contend that the quality of this review is not up to the expected standard of Cochrane systematic reviews.<BR/><BR/>We are not criticising the way in which the analyses were performed, but rather the ways they were interpreted and summarised, which we believe to be overly negative and rather biased. For these reasons, we find the resulting report to be misleading to the reader. Some of the weaknesses are listed below.<BR/><BR/>Abstract and Plain Language Summary:<BR/>These sections do not fairly represent the findings of the review. Contrary to the impression given in these summaries, the review itself demonstrates that there is in fact a considerable body of evidence, much of it from prospective observational studies, for a beneficial effect of selenium on a number of cancers. The stated summary of RCT findings is more conclusive than it should be, given the very small number of published clinical trials with selenium alone and the limited trial data that the review authors arbitrarily chose to consider. Furthermore, the NPCT is treated very harshly, and its secondary findings (lung, colorectal and prostate cancers) are more or less discounted.<BR/><BR/>Body of the Paper:<BR/>1. Lack of appreciation of the importance of baseline selenium status in influencing trial outcomes (i.e. the fact that only people with a low selenium status profited from supplementation). For example, no acknowledgement was made of the fact that lack of benefit of a 200 &#956;g/d dose of selenium for cancer risk in SELECT occurred in participants with relatively high baseline serum selenium concentrations&#8212;well above those found to confer benefit from selenium supplementation in the NPC trial (NPCT). This point was raised by us previously (Rayman et al. JAMA 2010).<BR/>2. Lack of discrimination between trials in which supplementation with selenium had the capacity to maximise selenoprotein expression/concentration (e.g., NPCT) and those (e.g., SELECT) in which selenoprotein expression/concentration would already have been maximised at baseline.<BR/>3. Lack of appreciation that, despite the high selenium status of SELECT men, the effects of selenium supplementation on type 2 diabetes risk were not significant.<BR/>4. Failure to understand that biomarkers of selenium status are considerably more reliable than dietary data, which we know to be much more error-prone.<BR/>5. Frequent failure to distinguish between significant and non-significant findings.<BR/>6. Lack of familiarity with the relevant selenium literature.<BR/>7. No mention of oesophageal or gastric cardia cancer results (although RCT results for these are not based on selenium alone) and, in relation to colorectal cancer, no mention of adenoma data.<BR/>8. In 'Implications for research', no mention is made of the need to carry out randomised controlled trials in low-selenium populations, nor to take into consideration selenoprotein genotype, which has been shown to affect selenium metabolism. The relevance of the species of selenium administered in various trials is not mentioned.<BR/></P></FEEDBACK_SUMMARY><FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2018-01-18 11:10:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare E Jess"><P>The authors wish to thank the colleagues Doctors Brigelius-Flohé, Combs, Davis, Green, Hesketh, Köhrle, Kristal, Rayman, Schomburg, Taylor, van den Brandt, Waters and Whanger for their detailed commentary on the selenium review. </P><P>Their comments captured some of the same concerns that we had regarding the methodological challenges associated with conducting a systematic review in the field of selenium and cancer. </P><P>In response to the commentary, we will first address concerns related to the specific setting of this review as a Cochrane review and will then respond to concerns regarding the content of the review. </P><P>We strongly agree with the concerns that it is difficult to capture all differentiations elaborated on by the review in the abstract and summary, which are limited to a certain length. Similarly, length limitations were applied to the background section. We also share the opinion that some headings in the review do not adequately reflect the content of the text that follows. For readers who have not authored Cochrane reviews themselves, we wish to explain that Cochrane reviews are submitted in an electronic format that does not allow for all adaptations authors might wish to make. The headings, for example, cannot be changed. This electronic format is optimised for reviews on intervention studies. Our review included both RCTs and epidemiological studies, and so we encountered several structural challenges throughout the review process. We hope that both the commentary of our colleagues and our experiences will contribute to the continuing work of advancing the structural processes of The Cochrane Collaboration, including the electronic software Review Manager, and to developing a more inclusive format for reviews, which encompasses epidemiological studies. </P><P>Has the condensation of information in the abstract and the plain text summary led to a distortion in the presentation of the review results?</P><P>The abstract and the plain text summary present to readers the body of evidence that was reviewed as the main results for both study questions. Our aim was to report the answers to our research questions, and although space was a limitation for the abstract and summary results sections, we have endeavoured to provide across the entire review all the best available evidence for the role of selenium in preventing cancer.</P><P>We agree with our colleagues that no studies can be found on the association of selenium with cancer in children or on the preventive efficacy of selenium supplements in children. Hence, as stated in the abstract, there is currently no convincing evidence that selenium supplementation may prevent cancer in children. However, we are completely happy not to mention children in the abstract if this may be considered misleading. </P><P>We agree with our colleagues that long-term supplementation is more likely than short-term supplementation to influence cancer risk, if any effect exists. The minimum of four weeks has been chosen arbitrarily. However, no consistent current agreement has indicated where to draw the line between short-term and long-term selenium supplementation, so any cutoff would be arbitrary to some extent. In addition, we wished to avoid making assumptions about supplementation effects in our inclusion criteria and decided rather to address the question of the effect of shorter supplementation periods in the review discussion, if any trial would have been identified. </P><P>To our knowledge, there is currently no universal recommended daily allowance for selenium intake or upper tolerable level; therefore recommending a selenium dose or level of safe intake would not be appropriate in this instance. This is clearly an area for further research, taking into account some of the potential influencing factors cited in our review (e.g., baseline levels, gender, population, source). We would like to thank the commentators for the hint to the RNI (reference nutrient intake) values for selenium in the UK, which we are happy to include in a future update of the review. Nevertheless, regarding the RNI, we would like to draw attention to the latest draft of a position paper on selenium by the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (2011), which notes &#8220;that the selenium dietary reference value was set on very limited data and could be set too high&#8221; (p74).</P><P>Dr Brigelius-Flohé and colleagues commented that &#8220;Quoted recommendations such as 30 and 40 &#956;g/d for men and women (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2004</LINK>) are no longer credible to anyone with up-to-date knowledge of the endpoints and biomarkers (SePP, GPx activity) that we have in 2011. There is no justification for quoting the <LINK REF="REF-Vinceti-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinceti 2009</LINK>a opinion that 20 &#956;g/day organic selenium should be the maximum safe level.&#8221;</P><P>The suggestion of an upper safe limit of organic selenium of 20 µg/d was made by Vinceti et al. on the basis of preliminary results of the ORDET study (<LINK REF="REF-Vinceti-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinceti 2009</LINK>b), published in 2010 (<LINK REF="REF-Stranges-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stranges 2010</LINK>), and of other studies (please see for a review <LINK REF="REF-Vinceti-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinceti 2009</LINK>a). The recent availability of new data on endocrine (Lippman 2009; <LINK REF="REF-Stranges-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stranges 2007</LINK>) and dermatological (Lippman 2009) toxicity of low doses of organic selenium adds new findings supporting the recommendations by the WHO Group. We would like to draw attention to other recent studies on selenium toxicity (reviewed by <LINK REF="REF-Vinceti-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinceti 2009</LINK>a and Nogueira/Rocha 2011) and the issue of risk assessment of selenium (including the use of uncertainty factors (UF) or alternative approaches) (Aggett 2010; Douron 2010; Renwick 2006; Renwick/Walker 2008). </P><P>The diverse recommendations and the controversial discussions clearly underline the need for a systematic review in this field. </P><P>To address our research question&#8212;What evidence exists on the efficacy of selenium supplementation for cancer prevention?&#8212;we restricted our focus to RCTs with mono-selenium supplementation. Multicomponent interventions, such as those chosen in the SU.VI.MAX, involve several nutritional/antioxidant supplements (e.g., 120 mg of ascorbic acid, 30 mg of vitamin E, 6 mg of beta carotene, 100 µg of selenium, and 20 mg of zinc in SU.VI.MAX), some of which are reportedly thought to have a potentially synergistic effect with selenium (<LINK REF="STD-Willett-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Willett 1983</LINK>); others may act as antagonists (Schrauzer/White/Schneider 1977) or may have an unknown biological interaction. Although all these factors are important considerations for the overall efficacy of selenium in the long term, we thought that inclusion of these studies in attempts to elucidate an actual anticarcinogenic role for selenium in its own right could potentially conceal the true effects (positive or negative) of selenium. By including the four studies that were mentioned in the commentary, which used multicomponent interventions, we may have gained numbers but lost out in trying to elucidate the actual effects of selenium. Therefore, these RCTs, which use selenium in combination with other nutritional factors, were outside the scope of the current review process but have been addressed in the background and discussions and could be the focus of future valuable investigations. </P><P>To avoid any potential preferential and non-systematic selection of studies and hence results, we established a set of <I>a priori</I> inclusion criteria during the initial stages of the study design. These were outlined in the protocol of the review, which has been available on <I>The Cochrane Library</I> website and for comment since 2005. </P><P>The details of all selenium supplementation have been reported for each RCT, including the form of selenium when available, and we emphasised the importance of carefully evaluating the different biological activity and toxicity of each selenium compound. Please refer to the plain language summary: &#8220;In general there are two types of selenium supplements: one type uses the salt of selenium as the main ingredient, the other type uses organic selenium. These two types may act differently in the human body when ingested,&#8221; and in the RCTs and preventive efficacy section: &#8220;Interpretation of the results of clinical trials using selenium supplements should consider the different biological forms as well as their potential differential health effects when supplemented&#8221;; and please refer to the table <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>, for details on each RCT. </P><P>References are made throughout the review text to the baseline selenium status of study participants and potential interactions with study results. Please refer to Section 2.3. Adverse effects, &#8220;The RR for developing type II diabetes mellitus was higher in the participants in the upper two tertiles of plasma selenium levels, indicating a possible interaction with baseline exposure status&#8221;, for instance, or page 38 in our review: &#8220;SELECT participants had a higher selenium level at randomisation than men in the NPCT. While the mean plasma selenium concentration was 113 to 114 &#956;g/L in the NPCT, median serum concentration was 135 to 138 &#956;g/L in the different study arms in SELECT. Lower prostate cancer incidence in the NPCT trial was confined to men with baseline selenium levels in the lower two thirds (below 121 &#956;g/L). Subgroup analyses of the SELECT trial are underway to investigate a possible modification by pre-intervention selenium levels&#8220;. </P><P>Regarding the findings of NPCT and SELECT for type 2 diabetes, we would like to refer our readers to Section 2.3. Adverse effects, &#8220;A statistically non-significant increase in diabetes mellitus type II in the selenium-alone group (HR 1.07 (99% CI 0.94: 1.22)) was seen. An increased risk for diabetes mellitus type II was also observed in the NPCT (<LINK REF="REF-Stranges-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stranges 2007</LINK>, in: NPCT 1996). A secondary analysis of participants who did not have diabetes at start of the study revealed an excess risk in the selenium group (adjusted HR 1.55 (95% CI 1.03 to 2.33))&#8221;. We have previously outlined the section that referred to the fact that selenium baseline levels were higher in this group and would like to cite the original paper by Stranges et al. (2007), which stated: &#8220;Despite the lack of statistically significant interactions between treatment group and baseline co-variates, the risk for type 2 diabetes was consistently higher in the selenium group within all subgroups of baseline age, sex, smoking</P><P>status, and BMI.&#8221; (p220). Regarding the issue of a potential diabetogenic effect of selenium supplements and gender, we would like to draw attention to a recent observational cohort study by Stranges (2010), which documented an excess risk of diabetes among a large cohort of women from Varese, Northern Italy. Such a diabetogenic effect of selenium is also supported by suggestive laboratory evidence, recently reviewed by Steinbrenner al. (2011).</P><P>Lippman et al. (2009) stated in their publication about the SELECT trial: &#8220;The data and safety monitoring committee had some concern over the statistically non-significant increase in prostate cancer in the vitamin E-alone group (<I>P</I>=.09 per interim data of August 1, 2008) and over a non-significant increase in diabetes mellitus associated with selenium (<I>P</I>=.08 per interim data of August 1, 2008)&#8221; (p45).</P><P>The observation from SELECT (Klein 2011) that the effect diminished over time may suggest exactly the opposite to that hypothesised by Dr Brigelius-Flohé and colleagues. A decrease in the diabetogenic effect of selenium administration over time after interruption of such administration may well indicate a decreasing adverse effect over time, as expected, of a causal association. This was what occurred in the SU.VI.MAX study, in which administration of selenium/vitamins C-E/beta-carotene/zinc led to an excess incidence of skin cancer, including melanoma (<LINK REF="REF-Hercberg-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hercberg 2004</LINK>), which entirely disappeared after interruption of the intervention (Ezzedine 2010). The investigators interpreted such decreasing risk as an indication of the causal effect of the treatment of skin cancer and the origin of melanoma (Ezzedine 2010). </P><P>Regarding the interaction of baseline PSA levels with selenium effects in the NPCT, we would like to quote the original publication: &#8220;The protective effect of SS [selenium supplements; GD] appeared to be confined to those with a baseline PSA level of &lt;= 4 ng/mL (0.35, 0.13&#8211;0.87), although the interaction of baseline PSA and treatment was not statistically significant&#8220; (p608, Duffield-Lillico 2003a). To summarise, no statistically significant interaction was noted between baseline PSA levels and prostate cancer incidence, as reported by the study authors. </P><P>Dr Brigelius-Flohé highlighted a sentence on page 4 that might be misunderstood if taken out of its context (&#8220;risk ratios (RRs) with confidence intervals (CIs) were not calculated because of low numbers&#8221;). Our colleagues rightly stated that Hercberg et al. (2004) provided hazard ratios for cancer incidence by gender. However, the sentence our colleagues quoted from our review reads in the context as follows: &#8220;In the more recent French SU.VI.M.AX trial (<LINK REF="REF-Hercberg-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hercberg 2004</LINK>), a supplementation with beta-carotene, vitamin C, vitamin E and 100 &#956;g selenium-enriched yeast did not alter the incidence of cancer of the digestive tract after a median period of 7.5 years in women. In men, the incidence rate was lower in the intervention group than in the placebo group, but risk ratios (RRs) with confidence intervals (CIs) were not calculated because of low numbers&#8221;. The part of the sentence our colleagues cited about the men&#8217;s incidence rate refers to cancer of the digestive tract. Site-specific cancer rates were not calculated or reported by gender: &#8220;We were not able to analyze differences in site-specific cancers between men and women because of low statistical power&#8221; (p2340, <LINK REF="REF-Hercberg-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hercberg 2004</LINK>). </P><P>Our colleagues highlighted another sentence on page 39: &#8220;Results from two randomised controlled trials (NPCT and SELECT) have failed to provide evidence that non-melanoma skin cancer or prostate cancer can be prevented by selenium supplementation in men&#8221;. This statement refers to the primary study outcomes of both investigations, which were non-melanoma skin cancer in NPCT and prostate cancer in SELECT, and is correct. Contrary to what was stated by Dr Brigelius-Flohé and colleagues, the outcome measures in the NPCT were incident basal cell carcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas, and recurrent skin tumors were excluded from analysis, as summarised in the report of the primary NPCT endpoint by Duffield-Lillico et al. (2003b). We clearly stated in our review that the NPCT was carried out among non-melanoma skin cancer participants at baseline. </P><P>Our conclusions have been based on the available evidence, and we have highlighted the paucity of literature and data available from RCTs. Please refer to the 'Implications for research' section: &#8220;Potential differential effects of sex/gender and the use of selenium supplements in populations with a high burden of specific types of cancer diseases and differing selenium exposure levels, e.g., known low nutritional selenium intake, require further examination&#8221;. </P><P>Dr Brigelius-Flohé and colleagues have also expressed concerns regarding our inclusion criteria for epidemiological studies and the ways results of epidemiological studies were included and presented in the systematic review. </P><P>In reply to their concern, we might have omitted three relevant studies for gastrointestinal cancers; we would like to refer them to the detailed references to both studies, Mark 2000 and <LINK REF="STD-Wei-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wei 2004</LINK>, throughout the review. The Steevens (2010) study has not been included, as it was not available at the time of our review process and submission to The Cochrane Collaboration Group (please refer to Methods section, Search strategy). As reported in Section 1.1.6 of the review, the strength of association varied according to what was included in analyses (e.g., cardia vs non-cardia cancers, gender), thus preventing any clear and concise conclusion to be drawn between selenium levels and upper gastrointestinal cancers in the observational summary results.</P><P>As we understood the publications <LINK REF="STD-Wei-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wei 2004</LINK> and Mark 2000, <LINK REF="STD-Wei-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wei 2004</LINK> reports on a population that was part of the population at risk in Mark 2000. Participants in <LINK REF="STD-Wei-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wei 2004</LINK> were the disease-free controls for the cases of Mark 2000. Because of this overlap, we decided to report the papers jointly and put emphasis on the detailed description of both papers and their study populations (please refer to the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). </P><P>Dr Brigelius-Flohé and colleagues criticised inclusion in the review of observational studies assessing selenium exposure as intake (e.g., with food frequency questionnaires).</P><P>Regarding the problems associated with dietary assessment, please refer to the section 'Bias and confounding': &#8220;Assessment of total selenium intake from food-frequency questionnaires (FFQ) or interviews has proven difficult in other investigations because of the lack of food composition data which adequately reflects regional and seasonal variations in selenium concentration&#8221;. Additionally, &#8220;The FFQ overestimated the mean selenium intake in study participants when compared with laboratory analyses of duplicate meals&#8221; and &#8221;Validity problems, possibly leading to misclassification, have also been reported when questionnaires are used to assess supplement use&#8221;.</P><P>However, studies using dietary assessment add a valuable perspective to the discussion of the relationship between selenium exposure and cancer risk. Furthermore, in addition to the literature cited by Dr Brigelius-Flohé, other studies (van den Brandt PA et al, 1993; Longnecker et al., 1996; Haldimann et al., 1996) have reported a direct correlation between dietary and body selenium (please also see for a review of this topic Vinceti et al. 2000b and Vinceti et al. in press).</P><P>We consider the issue of selenium exposure assessment to be more complex than has been implicated by our colleagues´ comments. Assessment of selenium intake, despite the difficulties associated with its variability and possible individual variability in absorption, in some cases might even yield better estimates of actual exposure compared with biomarkers. This adds an important perspective to the discussion of why several observational studies have suggested a protective effect of higher selenium exposure towards cancer risk and others have not. </P><P>With regard to toxicity, animal studies have demonstrated that the intake of equivalent amounts of selenium, when administered in different species, might induce a stronger effect even when retained to a lesser extent (Panter et al., 1996), as shown for the inorganic compounds. The wealth of toxicological data from laboratory studies is clearly and, for obvious ethical reasons, much greater than those yielded by human studies. The same is true for studies investigating tissue distribution and biological activity of the different selenium compounds (see: Hatfield/Berry/Gladyshev 2012). We consider references to laboratory and animal studies as a necessary and valuable contribution to the understanding of selenium effects in humans. </P><P>Dr Brigelius-Flohé and colleagues asked why our summary of the findings of the review of Ashton (2009) on the use of biomarkers for selenium measurement did not mention singular nucleotide polymorphisms (p34 in our review). We summarised the findings of <LINK REF="REF-Ashton-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ashton 2009</LINK> that were relevant for the discussion of bias and confounding in our review. Genetic polymorphisms were not included in the analyses of heterogeneity between study results by Ashton (2009). Instead, Ashton et al. proposed singular nucleotide polymorphisms in their discussion as an area for future research and stated: &#8220;Also, for all potential biomarkers, more information is needed to understand the limitations of applicability for different population groups, the possible effects of genotype, supplementation doses, duration, baseline status, etc&#8221; (p2037S). </P><P>The criticism that we failed to distinguish between significant and non-significant findings in epidemiological studies points to a fundamental difference in the interpretation of epidemiological study results. Indeed, we consider &#8216;statistical&#8217; significance as an inappropriate approach to data analysis and interpretation with regard to observational studies, as has been long recognised (Rothman KJ 1978; Sterne/Davey Smith 2001; Greenland 2011), with no connection with &#8216;biological significance&#8217;. Pitfalls of statistical significance testing encompass dismissing so called `non-significant values´ in small studies or putting undue emphasis on &#8216;statistically significant&#8217; results without attempting to integrate potential biases for a study finding that would affect the estimates from that study (see: e.g., Rothman, Greenland &amp; Lash 2008; Stang/Poole/Kuss 2010). This may lead to confusion between the validity of an investigation and its statistical stability.   </P><P>Analysis and interpretation of results in biomedical research must be based on a number of considerations, comprising both study design and data analysis. We made a conscious effort in our selenium review to avoid use of an approach that dichotomised study results according to which were statistically significant and which were not. We consider this effort a major strength of our review.   </P><P>We have attempted to be prudent with our conclusions by highlighting important considerations associated with the results of epidemiological studies that we reported. Both the current literature and our review indicate that although some associations have been noted between selenium levels and risk of cancer at certain body sites (e.g., prostate, bladder), more research and information are clearly required before it can be concluded that these results are &#8220;convincing&#8221; for a protective effect of selenium. The World Cancer Research Fund&#8217;s Second Expert Report (2007) also suggests the possibility of residual confounding between selenium levels and healthy lifestyles (p109). </P><P>We admit that the sentence about the marketing situation of selenium in our discussion section expresses a valuation, and we acknowledge that other colleagues might assess the marketing situation differently and as such might disagree with this sentence.  </P><P>In the last part of our reply, we will address the concerns by Dr Brigelius-Flohé and colleagues regarding the content of the background section of the review.</P><P>The reference <LINK REF="REF-Rodriguez-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodriguez 1995</LINK>, which is listed in the MEDLINE database, in contrast to what our colleagues stated (please refer to PubMed ID 7605824), is an early study that investigated urinary selenium in healthy men and women and addressed the study question of the relationship between factors such as gender/sex, etc., and urinary selenium. It found gender/sex differences in urinary selenium excretion, as well as influences of health behaviours (physical activity), as stated in our background text.</P><P>We do not agree that studies investigating primarily the relationship between selenium status, thyroid volume and gland echostructure (Derumeaux 2003) or the relationship between baseline plasma selenium concentration and occurrence of dysglycaemia (Akbaraly 2010) would have been more suitable references for the statement that we made regarding gender differences. </P><P>We also would like to recapitulate the Vinceti et al. (2000a) paper because we feel that Dr Brigelius-Flohé and colleagues misreported the methods and findings of this study. The Vinceti et al. studies in an unusual Northern Italy setting evaluated the health effects of selenium in its inorganic hexavalent form&#8212;the one usually found in underground and drinking water&#8212;together with the tetravalent species (Vinceti 2010). This study was a &#8216;natural experiment&#8217;, considered to be &#8216;the paradigm of non-experimental epidemiologic research&#8217;, as in this type of study, &#8216;nature emulates the sort of experiment the investigator might have conducted, but for ethical and cost constraints&#8217; (p94, Rothman/Greenland/Lash 2008). Study authors assessed the potential for confounding by lifestyle by assessing the socioeconomic status of exposed and unexposed cohorts, and labeling this study as a natural experiment was allowed only after the similarity of the two populations was confirmed. Dr Brigelius-Flohé stated that Vinceti et al. admitted that their results are consistent with &#8220;no effect&#8221;, as standardised mortality ratios were generally inconsistent between men and women at most sites, and most site-specific estimates had limited precision. The citation in the original publication reads: &#8220;The results of our study are consistent with either no effect or, particularly among the elderly, unfavourable effects of long-term exposure to inorganic selenium on cancer mortality&#8221;. Then Vinceti et al. analyzed the strengths and limitations of their study, both for the melanoma association and more generally for the effects on cancer risk. Excess melanoma risk, despite different study designs and strengths of association, has been documented to be associated with selenium exposure in a number of studies (<LINK REF="STD-Garland-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Garland 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vinceti-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinceti 1998</LINK>; Duffield-Lillico 2002; Vinceti et al., in press) and has been causally associated with administration of selenium in combination with zinc and vitamins in SU.VI.MAX (Hercberg 2007). In general, we would like to propose caution when dealing with the possible selenium-melanoma association. </P><P>In conclusion, we express our appreciation to our commentators for scrutinising our review, offering their criticisms and supporting the scientific endeavour of enclosing epidemiological as well as intervention studies in a Cochrane review. We are hopeful that the review and the commentary of our colleagues will contribute to the important and continuing discussion about the health effects of selenium and selenium supplements globally and in diverse populations. </P><OL><LI>Aggett PJ.

Based on that same study (p4), the authors refer to &#8220;Such a diabetogenic effect of selenium&#8230;&#8221;.  A prospective study, especially one with a very weak study design such as ORDET, can only show an association&#8212;hardly a good basis for making such a statement in a Cochrane review. Furthermore, an upper safe limit of organic selenium of 20 &#956;g/d would be just above that at which Keshan disease is seen&#8212;11 &#956;g/d in a Chinese man, which translates to 14 &#956;g/d in a man of Western body weight.[1]</LI><LI>p2: The authors say, &#8220;The recent availability of new data about endocrine (Lippman 2009; <LINK REF="REF-Stranges-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stranges 2007</LINK>) and dermatologic (Lippman 2009) toxicity of low doses of organic selenium adds new findings which support the recommendations by the WHO group.&#8221; The authors seem still not to have taken on board the fact that Lippman et al. 2009 does<I> not</I> show any endocrine toxicity of selenium. Furthermore, the dose given&#8212;200 &#956;g/d&#8212;was not low.</LI><LI>p4: Diminution of the effect on type 2 diabetes over time. Proper interpretation of SELECT is that there was a null result during the trial (RR 1.07, P value 0.16) and a similarly null result with postintervention follow-up time included (RR 1.04, P value 0.34). If trial-only data versus post-trial-only data were compared, it is probably unlikely that there would be any difference statistically. However, we do understand the point the review authors make: Interpretation depends on how one thinks selenium acts. If we were talking about an effect that occurred immediately after starting a drug (e.g. platelet effect of aspirin, blood pressure reduction from antihypertensive) and stopped more or less immediately after cessation of the drug, then the review authors&#8217; interpretation would have better credibility.  </LI><LI>In contrast to the week or so that the effect of aspirin on platelets lasts, selenomethionine has a long half-life of 252 d [363 d (turnover time) × 0.693 (from kinetic modelling)] (Swanson et al. AJCN 1991, 54:917-26). In medicine, when calculating dosing intervals for drugs, it is typical to give doses every five to six half-lives. When first-order kinetics is applied, five half-lives for total body selenium is 1260 days (3.45 years), and six half-lives is 1512 days (4.14 years). Although it is true that the amount of the original dose still remaining is small after five (6.25%) or six (3.13%) half-lives, excess residual selenium remains from the supplementation. So, on the basis of both observed effects with cancer and pharmacokinetic data, the events that occurred in the post-trial period for SELECT participants (34 additional months) should still be considered a period of selenium exposure and thereforeincompatible with the review authors&#8217; hypothesis.</LI><LI>p6: We hotly dispute the assertion of the review authors (none of whom is a nutritionist) that &#8220;The assessment of selenium intake, despite the difficulties associated to its variability and the possible individual variability in absorption, in some cases might even yield better estimates of actual exposure compared with biomarkers&#8221;.  </LI><LI>p7: Gender differences: The Schomburg references would have been preferable; Schomburg is the accepted authority in this area.</LI></UL><P>We very much hope that our original comments and those contained in this letter will help the review authors, guided by the editors, to revise the review, so that it sits more comfortably with the opinion of experienced investigators in the selenium-cancer field. </P><P>Yours sincerely, </P><P>Professor Regina Brigelius-Flohé, University of Potsdam, German Institute of Human Nutrition<BR/>Professor GF Combs Jr, Grand Forks Human Nutrition Research Center, ARS/USDA, USA<BR/>Dr Cindy D Davis, Office of Dietary Supplements, NIH, USA<BR/>Dr Fiona R Green, Reader in Functional Genomics, University of Surrey, UK<BR/>Professor John Hesketh, Institute for Cell &amp; Molecular Biosciences, University of Newcastle, UK<BR/>Professor Josef Köhrle, Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Germany<BR/>Dr Alan Kristal, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, USA<BR/>Professor Margaret P Rayman, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Surrey, UK<BR/>Professor Lutz Schomburg, Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Germany<BR/>Dr Phil Taylor, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, NCI, USA<BR/>Professor Piet van den Brandt, Department of Epidemiology, Maastricht University, The Netherlands<BR/>Professor David J Waters, Purdue University, USA<BR/>Professor Phil Whanger, Oregon State University, USA<BR/>[1] National Academy of Sciences, Institute of Medicine&#8217;s Food and Nutrition Board, Dietary Reference Intakes for Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Selenium and Carotenoids.<BR/>http://fnic.nal.usda.gov/nal_display/index.php?info_center=4&amp;tax_level=4&amp;tax_subject=256&amp;topic_id=1342&amp;level3_id=5141&amp;level4_id=10591.</P></FEEDBACK_SUMMARY><FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2018-01-18 11:10:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare E Jess"><P>We would like to thank Drs Brigelius-Flohé and colleagues for their continuing interest in our research activity on selenium. </P><P>We decided to shortly respond to some of their discussion points (citations from Dr Brigelius-Flohé et al are provided in italics): </P><UL><LI><I>&#8220;more careful use of language in relation to statistical significance as, for instance, in the two examples you cite in your letter. The preferred form you quote is much better than the misleading use of &#8220;lower&#8221; or &#8220;higher&#8221; for &#8220;non-significant&#8221; effects as occurred frequently in the review</I>&#8221;</LI></UL><P>Dr Brigelius-Flohé and colleagues do not acknowledge the limitations of their approach based on &#8216;statistical significance&#8217; (please refer to the references provided in our previous reply). Their approach appears to have had major consequences for a number of considerations and statements in their two letters. It is of interest to note that even the SELECT &#8220;Data and Safety Monitoring Committee&#8221; expressed its concern &#8220;over a non-significant increase in diabetes mellitus associated with selenium (P = 0.08 per interim data of August 1, 2008)&#8221; (cited from Lippman et al., JAMA 2009), which we consider a very correct approach given the decision-making responsibility of such a Committee. </P><P><I>&#8220;The authors have replied with a number of points that we would like to challenge"</I></P><UL><LI><I>p2: "Re the suggestion of an upper safe limit of organic selenium of 20 &#956;g/d by Vinceti et al., the authors now justify the original inclusion of that statement on the basis of a study (ORDET) based on a semi-quantitative FFQ at baseline and follow-up for development of type-2 diabetes 16 years later. Based on that same study (p4), the authors refer to &#8220;Such a diabetogenic effect of selenium&#8230;.&#8221;.  A prospective study, especially one with a very weak study design such as ORDET, can only show an association</I>&#8212;<I>hardly a good basis for making such a statement in a Cochrane review. Furthermore, an upper safe limit of organic selenium of 20 &#956;g/d would be just above that at which Keshan Disease is seen</I>&#8212;<I>11 mg/d in a Chinese man, which translates to 14 &#956;g/d in a man of Western body weight.</I></LI></UL><P>As written in our original response, the suggestion of a safe upper limit of 20 µg/L was based on the ORDET study results already availableand published as an abstract in <I>Epidemiology </I>in 2009. Stating that the ORDET study, one of the first and most methodologically sound European prospective studies, started in the 1980s by the Italian National Cancer Institute in Milan, was &#8216;weak&#8217; is unacceptable. Its methodological value has been largely recognised in the scientific community and in the epidemiological literature.<BR/></P><P>Our review, however, never aimed at summarising the large epidemiological and laboratory literature addressing the issue of safe upper limit of Se exposure in humans, particularly the most recent studies. </P><UL><LI><I>p2: The authors say, &#8220;The recent availability of new data about endocrine (</I><LINK REF="REF-Stranges-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stranges 2007</LINK><I>; Lippman 2009) and dermatologic (Lippman 2009) toxicity of low doses of organic selenium adds new findings which support the recommendations by the WHO group.&#8221; The authors seem still not to have taken on board the fact that Lippman et al. 2009 shows no endocrine toxicity of selenium. Furthermore, the dose given</I>&#8212;<I>200 mg/d</I>&#8212;<I>was not low.</I></LI></UL><P>The relation between selenium and excess diabetes risk is an extremely important issue that clearly would require extensive review, but this was not the aim of our Cochrane review;therefore we would like to refer Dr Brigelius-Flohé and colleagues to the most recent studies and reviews on the topic. It would also be useful to remind Dr Brigelius-Flohé and colleagues that the SELECT trial found an excess risk of diabetes, which understandably caused concern for its &#8220;Data and safety monitoring Committee&#8221; (see above) and contributed to the anticipated ending of the trial. We took note that Dr Brigelius-Flohé and colleagues do not consider the SELECT supplemental dose of 200 mg/Se/d to be a &#8216;low&#8217; dose; actually, it was so high that it could be toxic. </P><UL><LI><I>p6: "We hotly dispute the assertion of the authors (none of whom is a nutritionist) that &#8220;The assessment of selenium intake, despite the difficulties associated to its variability and the possible individual variability in absorption, in some cases might even yield better estimates of actual exposure compared with biomarkers&#8221;.</I></LI></UL><P>Different exposure assessment methods have different advantages and disadvantages. What we stated in our review was, &#8220;A concern, which we cannot clarify to date, is that biomarkers do not adequately reflect intake of both organic and inorganic selenium species&#8221;. We still think there is currently no way of clarifying this. </P><P>We were very surprised in reading comments such as &#8216;None of the authors is a nutritionist&#8217;, not just because this is incorrect (one of the review authors, MB, is an accredited and practicing dietician and nutritionist), but also for the underlying and clearly &#8216;biased&#8217; concept: that the right to conduct independent research should be determined by subjective value judgements by one&#8217;s peers. </P><P>Despite the detailed comments made by Dr Brigelius-Flohé et al regarding key statements we have made and details of the studies we have identified in preparing the review, we remain convinced that the conclusions drawn from the original version of the review remain valid: We have not demonstrated a protective effect of selenium against cancer in men, women or children.</P></FEEDBACK_REPLY><FEEDBACK_CONTRIBUTORS MODIFIED="2014-03-18 14:47:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty
