<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-12-08 13:45:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>The incidence of twins varies considerably between communities and families and has recently increased because of the number of older mothers and the use of fertility treatments and assisted conception. Infants from a twin pregnancy are at a higher risk of death around the time of birth than are infants from a singleton pregnancy. Some of this is due to a higher risk of preterm birth. The second-born twin has an increased risk of a poor perinatal outcome compared with the first-born twin.</P>
<P>A policy of planned vaginal birth for women with a twin pregnancy in a hospital setting is associated with a 30% to 40% rate of emergency caesarean section. When the first twin is born vaginally, there is still a risk of emergency section for the birth of the second twin. It is possible that some of the adverse outcomes may be avoided by appropriately timed delivery by caesarean section but the risks of caesarean section for the mother in the current and subsequent pregnancies must be taken into account.</P>
<P>In this review we included two randomised trials comparing planned caesarean versus planned vaginal birth for twin pregnancies which together included 2864 women. For important outcomes the evidence was assessed as being of moderate quality.</P>
<P>For maternal mortality no events were reported in one trial and two deaths (one in each group) in the other. There was no clear evidence of differences between women randomised to planned caesarean or planned vaginal birth for death or serous illness in either the mothers or babies. No studies reported childhood disability.</P>
<P>The number of women undergoing caesarean section was reported in both trials. Most women in the planned caesarean group had treatment as planned (90.9%), whereas in the planned vaginal birth group 42.9% had caesarean section for at least one twin. There were no significant differences between groups for failure to breastfeed or for postnatal depression.</P>
<P>There is very little clear research evidence to provide guidance on the method of birth for twin pregnancies. The benefits and risks should be made available to women, including short-term and long-term consequences for both mother and babies. Future research should aim to provide more clarity on this issue as medical interventions in the birth process should be avoided unless there is reasonable clinical certainty that they will be of long-term benefit.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-12-15 11:25:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Twin pregnancies are associated with increased perinatal mortality, mainly related to prematurity, but complications during birth may contribute to perinatal loss or morbidity. The option of planned caesarean section to avoid such complications must therefore be considered. On the other hand, randomised trials of other clinical interventions in the birth process to avoid problems related to labour and birth (planned caesarean section for breech, and continuous electronic fetal heart rate monitoring), have shown an unexpected discordance between short-term perinatal morbidity and long-term neurological outcome. The risks of caesarean section for the mother in the current and subsequent pregnancies must also be taken into account.</P>

<P>We included two trials comparing planned caesarean section versus planned vaginal birth for twin pregnancies.</P>
<P>Most of the data included in the review were from a multicentre trial where 2804 women were randomised in 106 centres in 25 countries. All centres had facilities to perform emergency caesarean section and had anaesthetic, obstetrical, and nursing staff available in the hospital at the time of planned vaginal delivery. In the second trial carried out in Israel, 60 women were randomised. We judged the risk of bias to be low for all categories except performance (<I>high</I>) and outcome assessment bias (<I>unclear</I>).</P>
<P>There was no clear evidence of differences between women randomised to planned caesarean section or planned vaginal birth for maternal death or serious morbidity (risk ratio (RR) 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67 to 1.11; 2844 women; two studies; <I>moderate quality evidence</I>). There was no significant difference between groups for perinatal or neonatal death or serious neonatal morbidity (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.67; data for 5565 babies, one study, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>). No studies reported childhood disability.</P>
<P>For secondary outcomes there was no clear evidence of differences between groups for perinatal or neonatal mortality (RR 1.41, 95% CI 0.76 to 2.62; 5685 babies; two studies, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>), serious neonatal morbidity (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.64; 5644 babies; two studies, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>) or any of the other neonatal outcomes reported.</P>
<P>The number of women undergoing caesarean section was reported in both trials.

There were no significant differences between groups for serious maternal morbidity overall (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.11; 2844 women; two studies) or for different types of short-term morbidity. There were no significant differences between groups for failure to breastfeed (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.38; 2570 women, one study; <I>moderate quality evidence</I>) or the number of women with scores greater than 12 on the Edinbugh postnatal depression scale (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.14; 2570 women, one study; <I>moderate quality evidence</I>).</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-12-15 11:12:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Data mainly from one large, multicentre study found no clear evidence of benefit from planned caesarean section for term twin pregnancies with leading cephalic presentation. Data on long-term infant outcomes are awaited. Women should be informed of possible risks and benefits of labour and vaginal birth pertinent to their specific clinical presentation and the current and long-term effects of caesarean section for both mother and babies. There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of planned caesarean section for term twin pregnancy with leading cephalic presentation, except in the context of further randomised trials.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-12-15 11:34:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Twin pregnancy results from one of two distinct biological processes. The more common process is fertilisation of more than one ovum following multiple ovulation. Here the offspring may be of the same gender or not, are genetically no more similar than siblings, and have separate placental circulations and gestational sacs (dizygotic, diamniotic, dichorionic). The less common process is splitting of a single developing embryo. The offspring are of the same gender and genetically identical. The degree of separation depends on the developmental stage at which the separation takes place, and can be anything from separate circulations (monozygotic, dichorionic, diamniotic) to conjoined twins.</P>
<P>The incidence of monozygotic twins is fairly constant, but that of dizygotic twins varies considerably between communities and families, and has recently increased in many well-resourced health services because of the use of fertility treatments and assisted conception and the increase in the number of older-aged mothers (<LINK REF="REF-Anonymous-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anonymous 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Laws-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laws 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilcox-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilcox 1996</LINK>). The rate of multiple birth varies from country to country. In Canada, the rate of multiple births increased from 1.9% in 1981 to 2.5% in 1997 (<LINK REF="REF-Anonymous-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anonymous 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Joseph-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joseph 2001a</LINK>). In Australia, the rate in 2008 was 3.1% of all births (<LINK REF="REF-Laws-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laws 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Over 97% of all multiple pregnancies are twin pregnancies (<LINK REF="REF-Joseph-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joseph 1998</LINK>). Approximately 40% of twins present as vertex/vertex, 35% as vertex/non-vertex and the remaining 25% of twins present with the leading baby in a non-vertex presentation at birth (<LINK REF="REF-Blickstein-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blickstein 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grisaru-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grisaru 2000</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Mortality and morbidity for twins versus singletons</HEADING>
<P>Infants from a twin pregnancy are at a higher risk of perinatal/neonatal mortality than infants from a singleton pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Cheung-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheung 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fabre-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fabre 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ghai-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ghai 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Joseph-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joseph 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kiely-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kiely 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lie-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lie 2000</LINK>). Some of this is due to a higher risk of preterm birth (<LINK REF="REF-Joseph-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joseph 2001b</LINK>). However, even among twin babies that are greater than 2500 g at birth, there is a higher risk of death than among singletons of the same birthweight. Again, the absolute rates of perinatal mortality and morbidity will vary by population. In Australia, the perinatal death rate for twins for 2008 was 6.8 times higher and for higher multiple births 18.1 times higher than for singleton births (<LINK REF="REF-Laws-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laws 2010</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Kiely-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kiely 1990</LINK> reviewed the data on 16,831 multiple births from the New York City Department of Health's computerised vital records for the period 1978 to 1984. The perinatal mortality rate for twins versus singletons at 2501 to 3000 g was 4.3/1000 versus 3.8/1000 (risk ratio (RR) 1.12) and at 3001 g or more, 7.4/1000 versus 2.2/1000 (RR 3.32), respectively. The intrapartum fetal death rate for twins versus singletons at 2501 to 3000 g was 1.22/1000 versus 0.34/1000 (RR 3.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.82 to 6.88). Other studies have confirmed this higher risk of fetal and neonatal death in twins versus singletons if the pregnancy is at or near term or above 2500 g in birthweight (<LINK REF="REF-Cheung-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheung 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fabre-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fabre 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ghai-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ghai 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lie-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lie 2000</LINK>). Neonatal seizures, respiratory morbidity, and low Apgar scores at one and five minutes have also been shown to be higher for twins versus singleton infants at birthweights greater than 1500 g and greater than 3000 g (<LINK REF="REF-Ghai-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ghai 1988</LINK>).</P>
<P>Some of the higher risk of adverse perinatal outcome in twins compared with singletons may be due to restricted fetal growth which, in turn, may result in a higher risk of adverse events occurring during pregnancy, during labour or during birth. The higher risk may be due to trauma and asphyxia associated with the birth of the second twin. It is possible that some of these adverse outcomes may be avoided by an appropriately timed delivery by caesarean section. The timing of birth for women with a twin pregnancy is the subject of another Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Dodd-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dodd 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>In a multicentre randomised controlled trial comparing planned caesarean section and planned vaginal birth for the singleton breech fetus at term, planned caesarean section reduced the risk of perinatal death or serious neonatal morbidity three-fold (from 5.0% to 1.6%, P less than 0.001) (<LINK REF="REF-Hannah-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hannah 2000</LINK>). Although some of the deaths in the planned vaginal birth group in this study were due to difficulties associated with the actual birth, some were associated with problems that occurred during labour. Thus, a policy of planned caesarean section may be beneficial for women with a pregnancy at risk of complications during labour because it reduces the exposure of the pregnancy to labour.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcome for second twin compared with first twin</HEADING>
<P>In a study of 1305 twin pairs at 1500 g or more birthweight delivered between 1988 and 1999 in Nova Scotia, the risk of adverse perinatal outcome (intrapartum fetal death, neonatal death, moderate-severe respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), asphyxia, trauma and complications of prematurity) was significantly increased for second-born compared with first-born twins (RR 2.1, 95% CI 1.4 to 3.1) (<LINK REF="REF-Persad-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Persad 2001b</LINK>). However, it should be noted that in the Term Breech Trial, short-term neonatal morbidity was not associated with any long-term impairment (<LINK REF="REF-Whyte-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whyte 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is also evidence that the second twin is at greater risk of adverse perinatal outcome, compared to the first twin if delivery is vaginal but the same has not been shown if delivery is by caesarean section. Arnold and colleagues undertook a matched case-control study of preterm twin pairs (<LINK REF="REF-Arnold-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arnold 1987</LINK>). The risk of RDS was increased for the second twin compared to the first if delivery was vaginal (odds ratio (OR) 14.2, 95% CI 2.5 to 81.1), but not if delivery was by caesarean section (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0 to 17.8). This could be due to a greater protective effect of vaginal birth for the leading twin.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcomes for twins born vaginally versus by caesarean section</HEADING>
<P>Higher rates of adverse perinatal outcome have been reported for the twin pregnancy at or near term if birth is vaginal versus by caesarean section (<LINK REF="REF-Barrett-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barrett 2004</LINK>). In the <LINK REF="REF-Kiely-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kiely 1990</LINK> review, for twins in vertex presentation weighing more than 3000 g at birth, the perinatal mortality rate was 12.3/1000 versus 2.9/1000 (RR 4.22) if birth was vaginal versus caesarean. However, comparisons of actual as opposed to planned method of delivery are subject to considerable bias. In a retrospective study of women with previous caesarean section and a current twin pregnancy, perinatal mortality was more common following trial of labour than repeat caesarean section, but there was no difference in outcome after adjusting for confounding variables (<LINK REF="REF-Aaronson-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aaronson 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is increasing evidence for perinatal benefits related to vaginal birth. In a cross-sectional study of 6929 inborn infants without congenital anomalies, with gestational ages from 37 to 41 (6/7) weeks with vertex presentation, non-urgent caesarean delivery under regional anaesthesia compared to vaginal birth under local or no anaesthesia increased the risk of bag and mask ventilation (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.89) when adjusted for number of gestations, maternal hypertension and birthweight (<LINK REF="REF-De-Almeida-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Almeida 2010</LINK>). However, another retrospective study found no significant increase in transient tachypnoea of the newborn associated with increasing rates of elective caesarean section for twin pregnancies over time (<LINK REF="REF-Suzuki-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suzuki 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>In a retrospective study of twin births at 37 or more weeks' gestation, elective but not emergency caesarean section was associated with an increased risk of transfusion in the neonate (<LINK REF="REF-Suzuki-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suzuki 2008</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcomes for twins delivered by planned vaginal birth (actual vaginal birth plus emergency caesarean section) versus planned caesarean section</HEADING>
<P>A systematic review of non-randomised studies that compared the policies of planned vaginal birth and planned caesarean section for the delivery of twins weighing at least 1500 g or reaching at least 32 weeks' gestation (<LINK REF="REF-Hogle-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hogle 2002</LINK>) found four small studies that were eligible for inclusion in the review (<LINK REF="REF-Blickstein-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blickstein 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grisaru-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grisaru 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rabinovici-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Rabinovici 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wells-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wells 1991</LINK>). A meta-analysis of the data from the four studies did not find significant differences between the two approaches to delivery in terms of mortality or neonatal morbidity, although low Apgar score at five minutes was reduced with a policy of caesarean section. This finding, however, was confined to twins in which the first twin presented as a breech. A subsequent retrospective comparison of planned vaginal birth versus planned caesarean section for twin pregnancies with a leading breech found no significant differences in perinatal or maternal morbidity, other than an increase in thromboembolic disease in the planned caesarean section group (<LINK REF="REF-Sentilhes-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sentilhes 2007</LINK>). Two large retrospective studies of women with previous caesarean section and a current twin pregnancy comparing planned vaginal birth with elective caesarean section (<LINK REF="REF-Ford-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ford 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Varner-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Varner 2005</LINK>), found no difference in maternal or perinatal outcome, other than an incidence of uterine rupture of 0.9% in the planned vaginal birth group in one study (<LINK REF="REF-Ford-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ford 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>A comparison of outcomes in two Danish counties with high (57%) and low (28%) caesarean rates for twin pregnancy found no difference in perinatal outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Henriksen-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henriksen 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>The previously published versions of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Crowther-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowther 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr--2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2011</LINK>) found only one randomised controlled trial of planned caesarean section versus planned vaginal birth for twins, in which 60 pairs of twins were enrolled (<LINK REF="STD-Rabinovici-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Rabinovici 1987</LINK>). There were no perinatal deaths or cases of serious neonatal morbidity in either group. The sample size was too small to provide evidence of the better approach to delivery.</P>
<P>In low-resourced settings with limited facilities and personnel, high post-caesarean section complication rates and uncertain access for the mother to caesarean section facilities in future pregnancies, the benefit to the mother of avoiding caesarean section is greater than in well-resourced settings.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcomes for second twin born by caesarean section following vaginal birth of twin one, compared with caesarean section for both twins</HEADING>
<P>A prospective multicentre cohort study compared the outcome for second twins born by caesarean section following vaginal birth of twin one, compared with caesarean section for both twins. There was no difference in low Apgar scores, low cord blood pH, or neonatal encephalopathy. Neonatal infection was increased in the group with caesarean section following vaginal birth of twin one, but this difference was not statistically significant after logistic regression analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Alexander-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alexander 2008</LINK>). In a large retrospective study of planned vaginal birth for twin pregnancies, caesarean section for the second twin occurred in 9% of cases and was more common when the presentation of the second twin was non-vertex, and in pregnancies with other complications, and less common when the vaginal birth of the first twin was operative (<LINK REF="REF-Wen-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wen 2004a</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Importance of fetal presentation</HEADING>
<P>If the first twin presents as breech, the current trend in well-resourced health systems, as for singleton breech presentation, is to recommend caesarean section as being safer for the babies. This approach may be influenced by extrapolation of evidence from randomised trials of planned caesarean section for singleton breech presentation (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2015</LINK>), though the interpretation of this evidence is the subject of considerable debate. The approach to the delivery of vertex/non-vertex twins is controversial (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Barrett-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barrett 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Crowther-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowther 1996</LINK>). For twins presenting vertex/vertex, most clinicians recommend a planned vaginal birth (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Crowther-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowther 1996</LINK>). However, planned caesarean section may benefit twins in which the first twin is presenting vertex for a number of reasons. As many as 20% of vertex presenting second twins will change presentation spontaneously after the first twin is born (<LINK REF="REF-Houlihan-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Houlihan 1996</LINK>). A substantial number of those presenting vertex/vertex will present with serious acute intrapartum problems following the birth of the first twin (for example, conversion to transverse lie, cord prolapse, prolonged interval to delivery of the second twin), which may lead to emergency caesarean section, perinatal death, and neonatal morbidity. Lastly, if there are benefits to avoiding labour, both twins regardless of presentation should benefit.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Maternal outcomes</HEADING>
<P>A policy of planned vaginal birth for women with a twin pregnancy in a hospital setting is associated with a 30% to 40% rate of emergency caesarean section. Among those twins in which the first twin is born vaginally, there is still a risk of emergency caesarean section for the birth of the second twin, ranging from 4% (<LINK REF="REF-Suzuki-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suzuki 2009</LINK>) to 7% (<LINK REF="REF-Persad-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Persad 2001a</LINK>). In a retrospective case-control study, the risk of caesarean section for the second twin after vaginal birth of the first was increased in association with a history of infertility therapy, gestational age equal to or greater than 39 weeks, non-vertex presentation, operative delivery of the first twin and inter-twin delivery time interval greater than 30 minutes (<LINK REF="REF-Suzuki-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suzuki 2009</LINK>). As the risk of maternal death is highest if delivery is by emergency caesarean section, lowest following a vaginal birth, and intermediate following an elective caesarean section (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 1999</LINK>), increasing numbers of emergency caesarean section may reduce the mortality benefits of planned vaginal births.</P>
<P>A relatively small case-control study found no increased maternal morbidity for caesarean section for twins compared with singleton pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Simoes-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simoes 2007</LINK>). However, in a large population-based, matched case-control study using the United Kingdom Obstetric Surveillance System, the risk of peripartum hysterectomy was increased for women with twin pregnancy (OR 6.30, 95% CI 1.73 to 23.0) (<LINK REF="REF-Knight-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knight 2008</LINK>), while another study found twin pregnancy to be a risk factor for post caesarean section wound sepsis (<LINK REF="REF-Schneid_x002d_Kofman-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schneid-Kofman 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is growing evidence of an association between vaginal birth and urinary incontinence, particularly if the vaginal birth requires forceps or vacuum extraction (<LINK REF="REF-Farrell-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrell 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meyer-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meyer 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 1996</LINK>). Urinary incontinence identified in the postpartum period has been shown to have long-lasting effects, with a high risk of urinary incontinence five years later (<LINK REF="REF-Viktrup-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Viktrup 2001</LINK>). Use of the supine position for birth has been cited as a possible contributor to incontinence following vaginal birth. Faecal incontinence and incontinence of flatus have been reported to be associated with vaginal birth, particularly if forceps are used, and if there are lacerations involving the anal sphincter (<LINK REF="REF-Eason-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eason 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zetterstr_x00f6_m-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zetterström 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the Term Breech Trial, there was no significant difference in maternal mortality or immediate serious maternal morbidity between planned caesarean section and planned vaginal birth for singleton breech presentation at term (3.9% versus 3.2%, P = 0.35) (<LINK REF="REF-Hannah-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hannah 2002</LINK>). At three months postpartum, the women in the planned caesarean group reported a lower incidence of urinary incontinence (4.5% versus 7.3%, P = 0.02). Although the incidence of incontinence of flatus was not different between groups, if incontinence of flatus was reported, it was significantly less of a problem in the planned caesarean section group (P = 0.006). At two years, the only significant difference found was less constipation in the planned vaginal birth group (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2015</LINK>). However, long-term risks of caesarean section, particularly risks in subsequent pregnancies such as placenta praevia, placenta accreta, repeat caesarean section and uterine rupture, as well as reduced fertility, have not been evaluated in randomised trials. Thus from a maternal perspective, the relative benefits and risks of planned caesarean section versus planned vaginal birth are not clear-cut. Any evaluation of risks versus benefits must take into account the likelihood of serious long-term adverse effects of caesarean section. Data from a large Canadian cohort indicated that even in women with previous caesarean section, maternal mortality was significantly higher with caesarean section than with vaginal birth (<LINK REF="REF-Wen-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wen 2004b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Given that in well-resourced environments, suicide is becoming an important contributor to maternal mortality, emotional consequences of birth such as depression need to be given importance when weighing up benefits and harms of different approaches to care. Even when emergency caesarean section is performed, some women may gain self-esteem from having at least attempted to achieve vaginal birth. The sense of control from participation in the decision-making process may also promote self-esteem.</P>

A summary of the intervention effect and a measure of quality for each of the above outcomes was produced using the GRADE approach. The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome. The evidence can be downgraded from 'high quality' by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious) limitations, depending on assessments for risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates or potential publication bias.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cluster-randomised trials</HEADING>
<P>We plan to include cluster-randomised trials in the analyses along with individually-randomised trials if such trials are identified in future updates. We will adjust their sample sizes using the methods described in the <I>Handbook</I> using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), from a similar trial or from a study of a similar population. If we use ICCs from other sources, we will report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identify both cluster-randomised trials and individually-randomised trials, we plan to synthesise the relevant information. We will consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit is considered to be unlikely.</P>

<P>We included two trials comparing planned caesarean versus planned vaginal birth for twin pregnancies.</P>
<P>The earlier trial (<LINK REF="STD-Rabinovici-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Rabinovici 1987</LINK>), involved 60 women with cephalic/non-cephalic twin pregnancies in labour at 35 or more weeks' gestation who were allocated to vaginal delivery (33) or caesarean section (27). The trial was conducted in Israel.</P>
<P>In the vaginal birth group, two women were delivered by caesarean section, and in four the second twin changed to cephalic presentation. These six women were excluded from the published data analysis. We have included the categorical neonatal outcomes in this review to conform to an intention-to-treat analysis. We were not able to include the continuous neonatal variables, and the maternal outcomes for the six excluded women were not reported, so we have not included these outcomes in this review. The reported maternal febrile morbidity (excluding the six women) was increased in the caesarean section group (11/27 versus 3/27).</P>
<P>Most of the data included in the review are from a more recent multicentre trial (<LINK REF="STD-Barrett-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Barrett 2013</LINK>), where 2804 women were randomised in 106 centres in 25 countries. All centres had facilities to perform emergency caesarean section and had anaesthetic, obstetrical, and nursing staff available in the hospital at the time of planned vaginal delivery. Women with a twin pregnancy between 32 weeks&#8217; and 38 weeks six days gestation were recruited to the trial. Inclusion criteria included that the first twin was cephalic, both twins alive and with weight estimated between 1500 g and 4000 g.</P>
<P>In the intervention group, women were randomised to planned lower segment caesarean delivery. If the first twin was delivered vaginally then caesarean section was attempted with the second twin if this was feasible. In the comparison group women were randomised to planned vaginal delivery with induction of labour between 37 weeks five days and 38 weeks six days and women were attended by clinical staff experienced in managing vaginal delivery of twins. The primary outcomes in this study were fetal or neonatal mortality or serious neonatal morbidity and maternal death or serious maternal morbidity before 28 days postpartum. Secondary outcomes included infant or child death or poor neurodevelopmental outcome up to two years, maternal satisfaction with mode of delivery, breastfeeding, quality of life, fatigue or depression.</P>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-12-15 11:55:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The potential effects of the choice of planned mode of delivery in specific clinical circumstances are complex, and extend beyond the easily measurable clinical outcomes, to less obvious consequences such as emotional effects on the mother, her sense of self-esteem and her relationship with her child or children. Previous large randomised trials of interventions associated with more medical intervention in the birth process, which have included long-term follow-up of the children, have shown unexpected discordance between short-term perinatal morbidity and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. Two examples are planned caesarean section for term breech presentation, and continuous electronic fetal monitoring and scalp blood sampling during labour.</P>
<P>In the Term Breech Trial, in countries with low perinatal mortality rates, there were three perinatal deaths and 26 babies with severe perinatal morbidity of 511 in the planned vaginal birth group, compared with no deaths and severe perinatal morbidity in two of 514 babies following planned caesarean section (<LINK REF="REF-Hannah-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hannah 2000</LINK>). One would have expected less neurodevelopmental delay at two years in the planned caesarean section group, but the trend (though not statistically significant) was in the opposite direction: 12/457 compared with 7/463 in the planned vaginal birth group (<LINK REF="REF-Whyte-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whyte 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the Dublin trial of continuous cardiotocography during labour, neonatal seizures occurred in 12 of 6530 babies following continuous electronic monitoring during labour, and 27 of 6554 following intermittent auscultation (<LINK REF="REF-Macdonald-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macdonald 1985</LINK>). There were 14 perinatal deaths in each group. Despite there being far fewer cases of neonatal seizures in the continuous electronic monitoring group, the rate of subsequent cerebral palsy was similar between groups: 12/6527 versus 10/6552 respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Grant-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grant 1989</LINK>). Similar comparisons in the Seattle trial of continuous electronic monitoring and scalp blood sampling for preterm labour were: seizures 7/122 versus 7/124 (<LINK REF="REF-Luthy-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luthy 1987</LINK>); cerebral palsy 16/82 versus 7/91, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Shy-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shy 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>Because of this consistent trend to more long-term neurological sequale following medical interventions during childbirth than would be expected on the basis of the short-term perinatal outcomes, clinical decisions must be based on long-term rather than short-term outcomes. As more data relevant to this review become available, it is important that the implications of short-term perinatal morbidity be interpreted with caution, and the results of long-term follow-up be awaited.</P>
<P>As the study of <LINK REF="STD-Barrett-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Barrett 2013</LINK> was a multicentre trial with a wide geographic distribution, the results should be applicable to a variety of clinical settings. However, caution should be exercised in applying the evidence to settings without ready access to caesarean section, or where there may not be access in subsequent pregnancies.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-12-15 11:56:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Data mainly from one large, multicentre study found no clear evidence of benefit from planned caesarean section for term twin pregnancies with leading cephalic presentation. Data on long-term infant outcomes are awaited. Women should be informed of possible risks during labour and vaginal birth pertinent to their specific clinical presentation, as well as the beneficial perinatal effects of labour and vaginal birth, and the current and long-term effects of caesarean section for both mother and babies. Medical interventions in the birth process such as caesarean section should be avoided unless there is reasonable clinical certainty that they will be of long-term benefit. There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of planned caesarean section for term twin pregnancy with leading cephalic presentation, except in the context of further randomised trials.</P>

<P>Data on long-term infant outcomes from <LINK REF="STD-Barrett-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Barrett 2013</LINK> are awaited. In view of the wide confidence intervals for several key outcomes, further randomised trials would be justified. Trials are also needed to assess the usefulness of planned caesarean section for preterm twin pregnancy.</P>
