<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease of the nervous system which affects young and middle-aged adults. Repeated damage to parts of the nerves leads to progressive weakness and disability. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) involves people breathing pure oxygen in a specially designed chamber (such as used for deep sea divers suffering pressure problems after resurfacing). HBOT is sometimes used for MS in case a lack of oxygen to the affected nerves may be making MS worse, but this theory is unproven. The review of nine trials found no consistent evidence that HOBT can improve disability or modify the progression of MS. There is little need for further research.<BR/>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, recurrent and progressive illness with no cure. On the basis of speculative pathophysiology, it has been suggested that Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) may slow or reverse the progress of the disease. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The object of this review was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of HBOT in the treatment of MS. </P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2011-06-09 16:53:40 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Multiple Sclerosis Group's Trials Register (25 February 2011).</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All randomised, controlled trials involving a comparison between HBOT and a sham therapy in MS were evaluated.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers independently appraised all comparative trials identified, extracted data and scored them for methodological quality. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>We identified ten reports of nine trials that satisfied selection criteria (504 participants in total). Two trials produced generally positive results, while the remaining seven reported generally no evidence of a treatment effect. None of our three a priori subgroup analyses placed these two trials in the same group and were therefore unable to account for this difference. Three analyses (of 21) did indicate some benefit. For example, the mean Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) at 12 months was improved in the HBOT group (group mean reduction in EDSS compared to sham -0.85 of a point, 95% confidence interval -1.28 to -0.42, P = 0.0001). Only the two generally positive trials reported on this outcome at this time (16% of the total participants in this review). </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>We found no consistent evidence to confirm a beneficial effect of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and do not believe routine use is justified. The small number of analyses suggestive of benefit are isolated, difficult to ascribe with biological plausibility and would need to be confirmed in future well-designed trials. Such trials are not, in our view, justified by this review.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2011-07-04 10:09:17 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological disease in which there is patchy inflammation, demyelination and gliosis in the central nervous system (CNS). Although it exhibits marked racial and geographic variability in its prevalence, MS occurs most widely in Northern European races (prevalence 30 to 150 per 100,000) (<LINK REF="REF-Compston-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Compston 1998</LINK>) and is the commonest cause of chronic neurological disability in these groups. While there is considerable variability in clinical features and rate of progression, the histological changes are remarkably constant (<LINK REF="REF-Prineas-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prineas 1993</LINK>). Discrete areas of inflammation appear and evolve within the CNS, showing a marked perivenular distribution. Perivascular cuffing with lymphocytes, breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and egress of inflammatory cells from the intravascular compartment are followed by cascading inflammatory activation. Damage is seen in myelin sheaths and oligodendrocytes, and eventually degeneration of axons causes the neurological deficits by which the disease becomes apparent. A degree of recovery is possible, at least in the early stages (<LINK REF="REF-Prineas-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prineas 1979</LINK>), but with successive episodes of inflammation, remyelination becomes less efficient, axonal loss accumulates and neurological disability progresses.</P>
<P>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data have shown that breakdown of the BBB is an extremely early event in the evolution of an inflammatory lesion in MS (<LINK REF="REF-Silver-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silver 1998</LINK>). It is widely held that this process, and subsequent stages in the development of a plaque, are immunologically mediated (<LINK REF="REF-Bar_x002d_Or-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bar-Or 1999</LINK>). Despite the current wide adoption and success of immunosuppressive therapy in MS (corticosteroids, beta interferons, glatiramer acetate) the evidence for this remains circumstantial. </P>
<P>Several features of the disease suggest there may be a vascular association, including the observation of peri-venular lesions (<LINK REF="REF-Scheinker-1943" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scheinker 1943</LINK>), and both abnormal permeability (<LINK REF="REF-Aita-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aita 1978</LINK>) and vasoconstriction (<LINK REF="REF-Brickner-1950" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brickner 1950</LINK>) of vessels near MS lesions. A summary paper (<LINK REF="REF-James-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">James 1982</LINK>) suggested that small fat emboli may be responsible for the typical lesions. James postulated that a subacute form of fat embolisation similar to that following trauma may be responsible and that such emboli were triggered by a number of stimuli. The reduced vascularity of the cortex in comparison to the white matter was postulated to explain the anatomical distribution of lesions. </P>
<P>James went on to suggest the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) as a treatment for MS based on the demonstrated ability of HBOT to produce vasoconstriction with increased oxygen delivery and some anecdotal evidence of efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-James-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">James 1982</LINK>). In the subsequent ten years a flurry of activity produced a number of randomised studies in the UK, USA and Europe, despite widespread scepticism concerning the postulated pathophysiology. Results were mixed and, while some have embraced the therapy with enthusiasm, most neurologists used these results to abandon the concept. The largest professional body in hyperbaric medicine does not list MS as one of its accepted indications (<LINK REF="REF-UHMS-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">UHMS 2001</LINK>). </P>
<P>Today, however, many patients in the UK continue to be treated on a permanent recurrent basis (<LINK REF="REF-Perrins-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perrins 1996</LINK>). At some centres, physicians are not directly involved in therapeutic decisions or outcome evaluation. Elsewhere, support groups are developing to provide this service to their own communities or to provide the necessary funds to allow MS patients to access treatment (e.g. the MUMS Network- www.netnet.net/mums - last accessed September 2003).</P>
<P>HBOT is associated with some risk of adverse effects including damage to the ears, sinuses and lungs from the effects of pressure, temporary worsening of short-sightedness, claustrophobia and oxygen poisoning. Although serious adverse events are rare, HBOT cannot be regarded as an entirely benign intervention.</P>
<P>If there is an appreciable therapeutic effect of HBOT on MS and this can be generated at reasonable cost, the use of this treatment modality should be encouraged. If there is little possibility of an important treatment effect, then physicians should be made aware of evidence that will discourage the use of resources in this area.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objectives of this review were to determine the efficacy and safety of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in the treatment of patients with MS.</P>
<P>Specifically we wish to address the following questions:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Is a course of HBOT more efficacious than placebo or no treatment in improving disability for patients with MS?</LI>
<LI>Is a course of HBOT more efficacious than placebo or no treatment in slowing the progress of disease in progressive MS?</LI>
<LI>Is a course of HBOT more efficacious than placebo or no treatment in preventing or delaying relapse in relapsing/remitting MS?</LI>
<LI>Is HBOT administration safe?</LI>
</UL>

<P>One reviewer (MB) examined the search results and identified comparative studies that may have been relevant. All comparative clinical trials identified were retrieved in full and reviewed independently by two reviewers (MB and RH), one with context expertise in the treatment of MS, one with context expertise in hyperbaric medicine and clinical epidemiology. Using a data extraction form developed for this review, each reviewer extracted relevant data, graded for methodological quality using the method of Jadad (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>), and made a recommendation for inclusion or exclusion from the review. The method of Jadad scores trials on three criteria (randomisation, double-blinding and description of withdrawals), each of which, if present, is given a score of 1. Further points are available for description of a reliable randomisation method and use of a placebo. The scores are totalled as an estimate of overall quality. An independent clinical epidemiologist was available to settle differences, but was not required. </P>
<P>All data extracted reflected original allocation group to allow an intention to treat analysis. Drop-outs were identified where this information was given. We employed a priori sensitivity analyses using different approaches to imputing missing data. The best case scenario assumed that none of the originally enrolled participants missing from the primary analysis in the treatment group had the poor outcome of interest whilst all those missing from the control group did. The worst case scenario was the reverse.</P>
<P>For some outcomes, several studies reported no individuals with the outcome of interest in either group. As this review deals for the most part with outcomes that are uncommon, the inclusion of such data is of clinical relevance. Such data does not, however, contribute to the meta-analysis using RevMan 4.1, and this is noted in the results section where relevant. The list of studies and outcomes affected is given in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> .</P>
<P>
<B>Data analysis</B>
<BR/>Separate analyses were made using RevMan 4.1 software of all primary outcomes identified above. Failure to improve EDSS was examined using comparison of group means and SD (difference between means across trials). As this data was not available from a number of trials, the number of participants failing to improve one point on the EDSS was also compared as a dichotomous variable and the results presented as an odds ratio of failure to improve. Other outcomes were similarly treated as dichotomous rather than continuous variables with estimations of odds ratios for the failure to improve in FSS, prevention of exacerbation and the incidence of side-effects of therapy. </P>
<P>All dichotomous variable data were analysed using the DerSimonian and Laird random-effects method and presented with 95% confidence intervals. Heterogeneity between trials was tested for using a standard chi squared test and we accepted there was significant heterogeneity when P was &lt; 0.05. Where meaningful, the number needed to treat to achieve one extra favourable outcome was calculated and presented with 95% confidence intervals. Subgroup analysis was considered by individual treatment session nitrogen dose (nature of sham treatment), individual treatment oxygen dose (treatment pressure) and length of therapy - (one month (20 treatment sessions) versus six months or one year). In view of the paucity of data presented on patient entry severity, disease classification and comparator therapies (see table : 'Characteristics of included studies'), we did not consider subgroup analysis to be appropriate on the basis of these factors.</P>
<P>To assess possible effect of dropouts who did not enter analysis in these studies, a sensitivity analysis was performed where appropriate as a best case (all dropouts in the active groups assumed successes, all dropouts in the sham group assumed failures) and worst case (all dropouts in the active group assumed failures, all in the sham group assumed successes).</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2011-07-04 10:09:17 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review search update yielded only four results, of which none were RCTs. The initial searches were performed in 2001 and repeated in June 2006, July 2009, January 2010 and February 2011. No new randomised trials have been identified since the initial search and we have found very few relevant reports of any kind in the literature since then. </P>
<P>In total, we identified 36 publications dealing with the treatment of MS with HBOT (MEDLINE 16, DORCTIHM 4, HANDSEARCHING 8, REFERENCES 6, UNPUBLISHED 2). Initial examination suggested 19 possible comparative trials. After appraisal of the full report we excluded nine publications: two were reviews (one semi-quantitative, one qualitative) containing no new data (<LINK REF="STD-Gottlieb-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Gottlieb 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kleijnen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kleijnen 1995</LINK>), one was the results of a prospective registry (<LINK REF="STD-Kindwall-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Kindwall 1991</LINK>), two were comparative, but non-randomised (<LINK REF="STD-Pallotta-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Pallotta 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Worthington-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Worthington 1987</LINK>) and four were abstracts of randomised studies containing no appropriate clinical outcome data (<LINK REF="STD-Erwin-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Erwin 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Massey-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Massey 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Murthy-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Murthy 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Slater-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Slater 1985</LINK>). None of these abstracts have been published as full accounts and an approach to the authors did not produce further data. (<I>See</I> 'Table of excluded studies'). A search in June 2006 found six further publications, none of which were reports of comparative trials.<BR/>
<BR/>In total, nine trials contributed to this review. One trial was the subject of two publications, one dealing with short-term results following treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Barnes-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Barnes 1985</LINK>), the other with longer-term results at six months and two years (<LINK REF="STD-Barnes-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Barnes 1987</LINK>). All included trials were published between 1983 (<LINK REF="STD-Fischer-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Fischer 1983</LINK>) and 1990 (<LINK REF="STD-Oriani-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Oriani 1990</LINK>) and the reviewers are unaware of any on-going RCTs in the area. In total, these trials include data on 504 participants, 260 receiving HBOT and 244 placebo, and the largest (<LINK REF="STD-Barnes-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Barnes 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barnes-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Barnes 1987</LINK>) accounts for 29.7% of cases. (<I>See</I> 'Table of included studies').</P>
<P>The dose of oxygen per treatment session varied between studies. The lowest dose administered (<LINK REF="STD-Harpur-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Harpur 1986</LINK>) was 1.75 ATA for 90 minutes, while the highest dose was 2.5 ATA for 90 minutes {<LINK REF="STD-Confavreux-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Confavreux 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oriani-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Oriani 1990</LINK>}. All others used 2.0 ATA for 90 minutes. All trials used an initial course of 20 treatment sessions over four weeks, while two (<LINK REF="STD-Harpur-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Harpur 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oriani-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Oriani 1990</LINK>) continued to administer 'top-up' treatments (<I>see</I> 'Table of included studies'). Subgroup analyses for the primary outcomes were performed with respect to oxygen dose and the use of top-up therapy where data were available.</P>
<P>The method of sham treatment also varied across the studies. Four studies (five reports) used air administered at a trivial pressure presumed sufficient to convince the participants of compression, an inspired partial pressure of oxygen (PIO<SUB>2</SUB>) of approximately 167mmHg and nitrogen (PIN<SUB>2)</SUB> of approximately 608mmHg (<LINK REF="STD-Barnes-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Barnes 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Neiman-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Neiman 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Confavreux-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Confavreux 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wiles-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Wiles 1986</LINK>), four used nitrogen enriched air to achieve a PIO<SUB>2</SUB> equal to air at 1 ATA (152mmHg) at the same pressure as the active treatment group and consequently high PIN<SUB>2</SUB> varying from approximately 1100 to 1345 mmHg (<LINK REF="STD-Fischer-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Fischer 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wood-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harpur-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Harpur 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-L_x0027_Hermitte-1986" TYPE="STUDY">L'Hermitte 1986</LINK>), while Oriani (<LINK REF="STD-Oriani-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Oriani 1990</LINK>) used air at the same pressure as the treatment group (PIO<SUB>2 </SUB>380mmHg, PIN<SUB>2</SUB> 1520mmHg). Subgroup analysis for the main outcomes was performed with respect to sham PIN<SUB>2</SUB> where data were available.</P>
<P>All trials included participants with a clinical assessment of definite MS.

Individual trial exclusions identified were Barnes (<LINK REF="STD-Barnes-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Barnes 1985</LINK>) (aged over 60 years), Oriani (<LINK REF="STD-Oriani-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Oriani 1990</LINK>) (definite disease for longer than 10 years), Fischer (<LINK REF="STD-Fischer-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Fischer 1983</LINK>) (definite disease for longer than five years) and Wiles (<LINK REF="STD-Wiles-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Wiles 1986</LINK>) (able to walk assisted or unassisted for 50 metres). All but one trial gave a mean and SD for entry EDSS scores in each group, the exception being Wood (<LINK REF="STD-Wood-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1985</LINK>), that gave a mean and range of entry EDSS.</P>
<P>There was no detail on the recruitment time period in any of the studies.

All included studies reported at least one clinical outcome of interest. Outcomes considered for this review were: group mean differences in EDSS pre-treatment to immediately post -treatment, six months post-treatment and one year post-treatment; improvement as defined as a decrease of at least one point on the EDSS at end of treatment, six months and one year; improvement in FSS on similar criteria at these assessment times; subjective ratings of improvement in individual systems of the FSS; relapse during treatment and at six months and one year; and the incidence of adverse events during therapy, specifically aural barotrauma and visual disturbances.

<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2008-08-26 11:41:29 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Deirdre Beecher">
<P>
<B>Jadad score</B>
<BR/>Study quality was generally assessed as high. Three of the nine included studies were assigned a score of 5 (<LINK REF="STD-Fischer-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Fischer 1983</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Neiman-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Neiman 1985</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wood-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1985</LINK>), while the remaining six studies were assigned a score of 4. The significance of this small variation is unclear and it was not used as a basis for sensitivity analysis by study quality.</P>
<P>
<B>Randomisation</B>
<BR/>Allocation concealment was adequately described in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Fischer-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Fischer 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oriani-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Oriani 1990</LINK>), while the issue remained unclear in the remaining studies. Randomisation procedures were loosely described, if at all, in these studies and there is no clear indication that the investigators were unable to predict the prospective group to which a participant would be allocated. In one study, (<LINK REF="STD-Harpur-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Harpur 1986</LINK>), the participants were matched in pairs and then randomised to HBOT or sham.</P>
<P>
<B>Patient baseline characteristics</B>
<BR/>All participants were in a clinically stable state in all studies with the exception of L'Hermitte, where no specific mention was made concerning recent exacerbation (<LINK REF="STD-L_x0027_Hermitte-1986" TYPE="STUDY">L'Hermitte 1986</LINK>). There were differences in the mean and range of entry EDSS. The mildest cases on admission were those in Oriani (<LINK REF="STD-Oriani-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Oriani 1990</LINK>), where the entry criteria was EDSS of less than 5 and the mean scores were 3.39 (SD 1.16) in the active group and 2.97 (SD 0.84) in the control group, whilst the most severely affected were the participants enrolled by Confavreux (<LINK REF="STD-Confavreux-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Confavreux 1986</LINK>) (mean EDSS 6.2, SD 0.7 active, mean 6.9, SD 1.4 control). The majority of studies enrolled participants with scores between 3 and 8. There were no obvious differences between groups in the same study, although no author made a specific statement to confirm this.</P>
<P>
<B>Blinding</B>
<BR/>The participants were blinded in all studies, although only Harpur attempted to test the success of patient blinding by questionnaire (no numerical result reported) (<LINK REF="STD-Harpur-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Harpur 1986</LINK>). This author described blinding as "preserved, although most participants felt they had received placebo due to the lack of anticipated effect." All studies similarly reported blinding of outcome assessors to allocation. In all trials, assessment for primary clinical outcomes were made by the treating neurologist remote to the treatment facility. Although not clearly stated, it is probable that many of the treating physicians in the trials would have been aware of treatment allocation. The hyperbaric facility staff administering the gases would be required to know the mixture they were administering. Four trials, (<LINK REF="STD-Fischer-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Fischer 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Confavreux-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Confavreux 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barnes-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Barnes 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oriani-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Oriani 1990</LINK>), specifically defined who in their facility was blind to allocation.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Patients lost to follow-up<BR/>
</B>The numbers of participants lost to follow-up are summarised in <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>. There were no participants withdrawn or lost to follow-up who appeared in the analysis in any of the studies. Sensitivity analysis in this review has made best and worse case analyses to examine potentially important effects on outcome. Overall, there were 31 participants lost to final follow-up (7.7% of the total number enrolled).</P>
<P>
<B>Intention to treat analysis</B>
<BR/>This was not mentioned as a strategy in any of the trials. While participants lost to follow-up or withdrawn were excluded from analysis, there was no re-allocation to placebo in participants who failed to complete active therapy. No information is available on these participants.</P>

<I>(1) Improvement of mean EDSS at completion of 20 treatments.</I>
</P>
<P>Five trials contributed data to this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Fischer-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Fischer 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Neiman-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Neiman 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harpur-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Harpur 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wiles-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Wiles 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oriani-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Oriani 1990</LINK>), involving 271 participants (54% of the total included in this review), 134 randomised to receive HBOT and 137 to a sham treatment. The Neiman trial contributed most weight to the analysis (58%). There was no significant reduction in the mean EDSS in the active treatment group compared to sham (P = 0.4, mean change in active group compared to sham of -0.07, 95%CI -0.23 to 0.09). The test for heterogeneity was marginal (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> 9.48, P = 0.05). Subgroup analysis by PIN<SUB>2</SUB> during treatment and oxygen dose did not explain this possible heterogeneity. </P>
<P>
<I>(2) Improvement of mean EDSS at six months.</I>
</P>
<P>Three trials contributed data to this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Fischer-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Fischer 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harpur-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Harpur 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oriani-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Oriani 1990</LINK>), involving 163 participants (32% of the total), 80 randomised to HBOT, 83 to sham. The Harpur trial contributed most weight to the analysis (44.2%). There was no significant reduction in the mean EDSS in the HBOT group compared to the sham, (mean change in the active group compared to sham -0.22, 95%CI -0.54 to 0.09, P = 0.17). There was significant heterogeneity in this analysis (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> 7.55, df2, P = 0.023). Subgroup analysis by length of treatment suggested there was a significant benefit of HBOT for those having a shorter course of therapy (20 treatments) compared to 20 treatments plus five months of boosters. This reflected the results of a single trial (<LINK REF="STD-Fischer-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Fischer 1983</LINK>) using the shorter course (short course mean change in active group compared to sham, -0.84, 95%CI -1.43 to -0.25, P = 0.006, long course mean change -0.29, 95%CI -0.91 to 0.33, P = 0.4). </P>
<P>
<I>(3) Improvement of mean EDSS at 12 months.</I>
</P>
<P>Only two trials contributed data to this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Fischer-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Fischer 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oriani-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Oriani 1990</LINK>), involving 81 participants (16% of the total), 39 randomised to HBOT and 42 to sham. There was a significant reduction in EDSS in the active group compared to sham, (mean change in the active group compared to sham -0.85, 95%CI -1.28 to -0.42, P = 0.0001). There was no significant heterogeneity in this analysis. It should be noted that the two trials contributing to this result were the only two of the nine trials to report generally positive results. One of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Fischer-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Fischer 1983</LINK>), gave 20 treatments only, while the other (<LINK REF="STD-Oriani-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Oriani 1990</LINK>) gave an initial course of 20 treatments plus a 'top-up' regimen to one year.</P>
<P>
<I>(4) The number of participants not improved by at least one point on EDSS at completion of 20 treatments.</I>
</P>
<P>Eight trials contributed data to this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Wiles-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Wiles 1986</LINK> the exception), involving 411 participants (82% of the total), 215 randomised to HBOT and 196 to sham. In three trials, no participants were improved in either arm (<LINK REF="STD-Barnes-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Barnes 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Neiman-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Neiman 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-L_x0027_Hermitte-1986" TYPE="STUDY">L'Hermitte 1986</LINK>) and these trials therefore do not contribute to the meta-analysis. Few participants improved in either group, 11 (5%) in the HBOT group and 3 (1.5%) in the sham group. There was no significant reduction in the odds of remaining unimproved following the administration of HBOT (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.18, P = 0.09). There was no significant heterogeneity in this analysis. A pre-planned sensitivity analysis examining the effect of allocation of dropouts using a best case (all dropouts in active group deemed successes, all dropouts in sham group deemed failures) and worse case (all dropouts in the active group deemed failures, all in the sham group deemed successes) did not alter the result. (Best case odds of failing to improve with HBOT OR 0.36, 95%CI 0.09 to 1.49, P = 0.16, worst case OR 0.84, 95%CI 0.19 to 3.67, P = 0.82). </P>

In three trials, (<LINK REF="STD-L_x0027_Hermitte-1986" TYPE="STUDY">L'Hermitte 1986</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Confavreux-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Confavreux 1986</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Neiman-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Neiman 1985</LINK>), no participants were improved in either arm, and these trials therefore did not contribute to the meta-analysis. 16 participants (8.3%) improved in the HBOT group and 8 participants (4.7%) in the sham group. The Oriani trial contributed 53% of the weight in this analysis. There was no significant reduction in the odds of remaining unimproved following the administration of HBOT (OR 0.42, 95%CI 0.16 to 1.08, P = 0.07). There was no significant heterogeneity in this analysis. The analysis was sensitive to the allocation of dropouts. With the best case assumptions, there was a significant reduction in the odds of failing to improve with HBOT (OR 0.35, 95%CI 0.15 to 0.83, P = 0.02), while with the worst case assumptions, the result remain non-significant (OR 1.58, 95% CI 0.47 to 5.29, P = 0.45).</P>
<P>
<I>(6) The number of participants not improved by at least one point on EDSS at 12 months.</I>
</P>
<P>Only three trials contributed data to this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Barnes-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Barnes 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Confavreux-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Confavreux 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barnes-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Barnes 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oriani-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Oriani 1990</LINK>), involving 176 participants (35% of the total), 90 randomised to HBOT and 86 to sham. In one trial, (<LINK REF="STD-Confavreux-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Confavreux 1986</LINK>), no participants were improved in either arm, and this trial therefore did not contribute to the meta-analysis. Thirteen participants (14.3%) improved in the HBOT group and four participants (4.5%) in the sham group. This analysis largely reflects the Oriani study, to which it contributes 84.7% of the weight. There was a significant reduction in the odds of being unimproved following the administration of HBOT (OR 0.2, 95%CI 0.06 to 0.72, P = 0.01). There was no significant heterogeneity in this analysis. Subgroup analysis according to treatment length (20 treatments versus more than 20 treatments) was hampered by having only one study in each subgroup, but suggests benefit for the HBOT group for the longer course given by Oriani (OR 0.19, 95%CI 0.05 to 0.73, P = 0.02), but no benefit from the shorter course given by Barnes and Confavreux (OR 0.34, 95%CI 0.01 to 8.64, P = 0.52). The result was sensitive to the allocation of dropouts with a loss of any significant advantage from the administration of HBOT with worst case assumptions (OR 1.34, 95% CI 0.08 to 21.75, P = 0.21). The analysis suggests we would need to treat 10 participants with HBOT to achieve one extra patient with an improvement in EDSS of one point at one year, but we may have to treat as many as 71 (NNT = 10, 95%CI 5 to 71). </P>

There was no significant reduction in the incidence of exacerbation following the administration of HBOT (OR 0.74, 95%CI 0.25 to 2.22, P=0.6).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-03-11 11:09:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found little evidence of a significant effect for the administration of HBOT in this review. There were no clear and clinically important benefits evident from HBOT administration with respect to the primary outcomes. While there was a modest benefit demonstrated in mean EDSS at 12 months, this result is uncertain given that only two trials reported on this outcome at this time (16% of the total participants in this review) and they were the only trials of the nine in this review to suggest benefit. Similarly, the modest benefit suggested at the same time in the proportion of participants with improved EDSS reflected a single trial (<LINK REF="STD-Oriani-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Oriani 1990</LINK>), which contributed 84.7% of the weight to that analysis and was sensitive to the allocation of drop-outs. All other trials reporting this outcome at six months suggested no clinically useful benefit. There was similarly little consistent evidence for benefit with respect to the secondary outcomes relating to improvements in FSS. No analysis indicated benefit in global FSS or the bladder/bowel sphincter function element of this scale. The benefit in the pyramidal function element at six months and 12 months reflected one single positive trial (<LINK REF="STD-Oriani-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Oriani 1990</LINK>). Of the 20 separate outcome factors where meta-analysis was possible, significant benefit was only suggested in three. Where appropriate we made three previously planned subgroup analyses with respect to treatment length (20 versus 20 plus 'top-ups'), nature of the sham therapy (high inspired nitrogen versus low inspired nitrogen) and oxygen dose per treatment session (high dose &gt; 2.0 ATA versus low dose). None of these subgroup analyses could explain the heterogeneity between the results of Fischer and Oriani on the one hand, and the other seven trials, as those two trials were separated on analysis in all three subgroups.</P>
<P>This review has involved data from nine randomised controlled trials and we believe includes all such studies published in full. A further three studies presented in abstract only did not contain any useful outcome data and have not reached full publication, despite completion prior to 1985. We are not aware of any other unpublished studies. We note with interest that no significant investigations have been reported in this area since the original publication of our review and it is probable there is little ongoing interest in the application of HBOT to MS.</P>
<P>Using the Jadad criteria for study quality, these studies generally rated highly (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>), however only two studies clearly defined allocation concealment and we therefore cannot be sure there has not been an element of selection bias at enrolment in some studies. This review is limited not only by the modest total number of participants enrolled (504), but the fact that all these studies are small (the largest enrolling 120 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Barnes-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Barnes 1985</LINK>, 29.7% of the total), and there is considerable variation in entry criteria and treatment length. A further limitation for meta-analysis is that for some outcomes in some trials there were no individuals with the outcome of interest in either arm of the study. Data where this occurs cannot contribute to the meta-analysis using RevMan 4.1, and this has the effect of magnifying any differences between groups that exist in the remaining trials. Outcomes where no patient in either arm experienced the outcome of interest are listed in Table 13.</P>
<P>These studies were published between 12 and 19 years prior to this review and clinical diagnostic criteria were used for all these studies to determine eligibility (<LINK REF="REF-Schumacher-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schumacher 1965</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-McDonald-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 1977</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Poser-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poser 1983</LINK>). Entry criteria for disease severity and classification in many of these trials was incompletely defined and varied considerably between trials. While some specified a minimum and maximum entry EDSS, others specified only a maximum or some less well-defined physical criterion such as ability to enter the chamber environment unaided. Others appear to have recruited on an opportunistic basis. In general, the entry EDSS scores indicated the majority of participants had mild or moderate disabilities. While it may have been preferable to use individual patient data as the basis of this review, this was not possible given the period of time that has elapsed since these trials were reported. We have therefore been unable to perform analyses based on disease severity or classification at entry as originally planned.</P>
<P>The included studies used a variety of outcome measures, the most common being the EDSS and FSS developed by Kurtzke (<LINK REF="REF-Kurtzke-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kurtzke 1965</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Kurtzke-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kurtzke 1983</LINK>). These scales are summarised in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. The original study (<LINK REF="STD-Fischer-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Fischer 1983</LINK>) defined a reduction of one point on the EDSS as a 'major improvement', and a similar reduction of one point on the FSS as a 'minor improvement'. Most subsequent authors followed this example. Where the data were available we chose relative reductions in the mean EDSS between groups as our primary outcome measure. In order to include the maximum information from the studies where mean EDSS was not reported, we also compared the numbers of participants in each group who improved at least one point on this scale. As secondary outcome measures we considered reductions or increases of at least one point in the FSS.</P>
<P>For the primary outcome of mean reductions in EDSS, there were no significant benefits in the HBOT group compared to the sham group at the completion of 20 treatments or at six months. While there was a trend to a modest improvement in the HBOT group, this is unlikely to be clinically important. At the completion of 20 treatments there was a relative mean change in EDSS of -0.07 (95%CI -0.23 to 0.09), while at six months the change was -0.22 (95%CI -0.54 to 0.09). Neither of these changes would be clinically detectable in an individual patient. While there was a significant reduction in mean EDSS in the HBOT group at 12 months (-0.84, 95%CI -1.28 to -0.42), this result remains barely detectable on clinical examination and of unclear clinical benefit. Furthermore, this result should be interpreted with great caution for a number of reasons. Primarily, as discussed above, the only two studies that contributed to this outcome were also the only two studies in the review to report generally favourable outcomes and it is possible there was bias towards later reporting in those trials showing successful outcomes compared to those in which the initial findings were unpromising. It is also biologically implausible that a benefit be absent at six months after treatment and present at 12 months. Proponents of HBOT suggest that a long course of treatment may be required to demonstrate benefit (<LINK REF="REF-James-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">James 1985</LINK>) and that those trials giving only 20 treatments are flawed in this regard. Others also maintain that treatments over 2 ATA are toxic and unhelpful (<LINK REF="REF-Neubauer-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neubauer 1983</LINK>). Both these assertions are difficult to sustain however, in that of the two trials contributing to this significant result, one gave a short course at only 2 ATA (<LINK REF="STD-Fischer-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Fischer 1983</LINK>), while the other continued with top-up treatments to 12 months and used 2.5 ATA (<LINK REF="STD-Oriani-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Oriani 1990</LINK>), and both showed benefits after 20 treatments and six months. Furthermore, the only other trial to administer a longer course of treatments (<LINK REF="STD-Harpur-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Harpur 1986</LINK>) failed to suggest any benefit in EDSS at 20 treatment or six months (no data at 12 months). There is no reason to extrapolate that data from other trials, including Harpur, would have confirmed a benefit after 12 months, having failed to do so at earlier analyses.</P>
<P>Unsurprisingly, the related primary analyses comparing the numbers of participants with improvement in EDSS scores of at least one point mirror those above relating to mean scores. Only a small proportion of participants benefited in either group (at 20 treatments 6.8% HBOT group, 3% sham). There were no significant benefits following HBOT administration at the completion of 20 treatments or at six months, while the result at 12 months was again statistically significant. The odds of remaining unimproved in the HBOT group at 12 months were lower, (OR 0.2, 95%CI 0.06 to 0.72, P = 0.01) and we might expect to treat 10 participants in order produce one extra patient with an improvement in EDSS at 12 months, although perhaps as many as 71 (NNT = 10, 95%CI 5 to 71). This result suffers with many of the same problems as those discussed above for the mean EDSS analysis at 12 months. Here, the results reflect closely the Oriani study, to which it lends 84.7% of the weight. Furthermore, this result is sensitive to the allocation of a small number of dropouts who were not analysed in the original trials (12 participants, 4.2%). If these participants are allocated according to worst case assumptions, the benefit of HBOT is no longer significant (OR 1.34, 95%CI 0.08 to 21.75, P = 0.21).</P>
<P>Only four trials reported on the occurrence of exacerbation at any time and there were no significant differences in the number of participants suffering an exacerbation at any analysis. For example, at 12 months roughly one third of participants entered in the two studies that reported this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Barnes-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Barnes 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oriani-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Oriani 1990</LINK>) had suffered an exacerbation (25.9% in the HBOT group and 36.9% in the sham).</P>
<P>With regard to the secondary outcomes, there was no evidence of a benefit from the administration of HBOT in the proportion of participants with improvements on estimation of global FSS. At the completion of 20 treatments, 29% of those who had received HBOT had improved, while 28% in the sham group had improved. Only Oriani (<LINK REF="STD-Oriani-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Oriani 1990</LINK>) reported on global improvements in FSS after 12 months and found no difference between the groups (41% in each arm of the study).</P>
<P>It may be that certain elements of the FSS are more amenable to improvement during treatment. Anecdotally, most improvements reported have been in sphincter function and pyramidal system function, and these trials focus particularly on these areas. No other elements of the FSS were reported separately by more than one trial. There was no evidence from this review to support the improvement of bladder/bowel function following HBOT when compared to a sham. A significant proportion of participants in both groups did report improvement, however. At the completion of 20 treatments, for example, 21.1% of the participants receiving HBOT reported an improvement, while 16.5% did so in the sham group. Interestingly, the analysis at six months suffered significant heterogeneity and subgroup analysis by length of treatment (20 treatments in one month versus 20 treatments in one month plus five months of top-up treatments) suggested there was a significant benefit for those participants having the shorter course (OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.80, P = 0.02). It is difficult to find any plausible explanation for this and runs counter to the supporters of HBOT in MS (who advocate continuing therapy). This result should be interpreted with extreme caution.</P>
<P>Improvement in pyramidal function was also examined in this review. While there was no evidence to support the use of HBOT on assessment at 20 treatments, there was a statistically significant effect evident at six months in favour of those participants receiving HBOT. The odds of failing to improve following HBOT were reduced (OR 0.24, 95%CI 0.06 to 0.92, P = 0.04), and this analysis suggests we would need to treat 11 patients in order for one extra patient to improve at six months. Again, this analysis largely reflects the results of one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Oriani-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Oriani 1990</LINK>) which contributes much of the weight toward the final estimate (78.5%) and we should interpret this result with some caution. <LINK REF="STD-Oriani-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Oriani 1990</LINK> was also the only trial to report any benefit in pyramidal function at 12 months.</P>
<P>While many of those who use HBOT do so on the basis of prevention of deterioration in function or disability, few outcomes were measured in these trials from that point of view. Five trials did however, report the number of participants in whom bladder/bowel function deteriorated and this review could find no evidence for a significant effect of HBOT administration. After 20 treatments, 9% of participants receiving HBOT had deteriorated, versus 8% of those allocated to sham. At 12 months these proportions had risen to 13.3% and 19.5% respectively.</P>
<P>HBOT is regarded as a relatively benign intervention. There are few major adverse effects (pulmonary barotrauma, drug reactions, injuries or death related to chamber fire) and while these are all rare enough not to expect to see them in the trials included in this review, they should be included in consideration of the benefit of this therapy. In practice it is likely than a beneficial effect strong enough to be clearly identified in clinical trials would overwhelm the consideration of such rare events. There are however, a number of more minor complications that may occur commonly and several authors reported on these. Visual disturbance, usually reduction in visual acuity secondary to conformational changes in the lens, is very commonly reported. In this review participants receiving HBOT were significantly more likely to have reduced acuity compared to the participants receiving sham (55% versus 2.3%). While the great majority of patients recover spontaneously over a period of days to weeks, there is a small proportion that continue to require correction to restore sight to pre-treatment levels. No trial attempted to examine recovery. The second most common adverse effect associated with HBOT is aural barotrauma. Barotrauma can affect any air-filled cavity in the body (including the middle ear, lungs and respiratory sinuses) and occurs as a direct result of compression. Aural barotrauma is by far the most common as the middle ear air space is small, largely surrounded by bone and the sensitive tympanic membrane, and usually requires active effort by the patient in order to inflate the middle ear through the eustachian tube on each side. Barotrauma is thus not a consequence of HBOT directly, but rather of the physical conditions required to administer it. Not surprisingly, therefore, in trials utilising a sham treatment involving compression, we have not demonstrated any significant differences between those receiving HBOT and those receiving sham. The pooled figures from those trials that reported instances of aural barotrauma suggest we might expect 23.9% of patients to have an episode of aural barotrauma sufficiently serious to interrupt their treatment. This broadly reflects clinical practice. Problems may be resolved with education or one of a number of devices and techniques to improve or replace eustachian tube function, so an episode of barotrauma usually does not preclude continuing therapy.</P>
<P>Oxygen is toxic to the tissues in high doses and this manifests acutely as a wide variety of pre-seizure symptoms, or as frank seizures, in the chamber. These events are self-terminating as the brain oxygen tension falls and rarely result in any permanent sequelae. The incidence varies with oxygen dose and is thus more likely at higher treatment pressures. The incidence at 2.5 ATA for 90 minutes oxygen breathing is approximately 1:1,500. Many patients continue therapy after such events, but the episode can be traumatic and may result in withdrawal from further treatment. No data regarding oxygen toxicity was presented in any of the trials in this review.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>We found no consistent evidence to confirm a beneficial effect of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and do not believe routine use is justified. The small number of analyses suggestive of benefit were isolated, difficult to ascribe with biological plausibility and would need to be confirmed in future well-designed trials. Such trials are not, in our view, justified by this review.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Although the trials included in this review are somewhat dated and difficult to interpret compared to contemporary investigations, we do not believe there is a strong case for further research in this area as there is little indication of strong treatment effects. It is possible, however, that modest treatment benefits may be present in a subset of disease severity or classification. One of the two trials indicating some benefit (<LINK REF="STD-Oriani-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Oriani 1990</LINK>), for example, enrolled patients with relatively mild disabilities, and it may be that HBOT has a role in mild disease. Any future trials would need to consider in particular:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Appropriate sample sizes with power to detect expected differences</LI>
<LI>Careful definition and selection of target patients</LI>
<LI>Appropriate oxygen dose per treatment session (pressure and time)</LI>
<LI>Demonstration of any differential treatment effect between single intensive treatment courses and ongoing regular treatments</LI>
<LI>Appropriate outcome measures including quantitative serial MRI data and quality of life measures</LI>
<LI>Careful elucidation of any adverse effects</LI>
<LI>The cost-utility of the therapy</LI>
</UL>
