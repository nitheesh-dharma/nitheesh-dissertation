<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-03-19 19:16:15 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>Uterine fibroids are benign (non-cancerous) growths in the uterus. They are the most common type of growth found in a woman's pelvis, being present in about one in four or five women older than 35 years. Although many women with fibroids are not aware of them, the growths may cause symptoms or problems due to their size, number, or location. Common symptoms can include longer or more frequent menstrual periods, heavy bleeding, menstrual pain, pressure in the lower abdomen, infertility, or miscarriages. Women with these symptoms may require treatment. Fibroids can be treated with surgery, such as myomectomy (removal of the fibroids while leaving the uterus in place) or hysterectomy (removal of the uterus). Another approach is uterine artery embolization, by which the blood vessels to the uterus are blocked. Drugs such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists may be used to shrink fibroids and to control bleeding.</P>
<P>Herbal preparations are commonly used alternatives to drug treatment, surgery, or both. This systematic review included 21 randomised clinical trials involving 2222 women with uterine fibroids. There is no evidence on the effectiveness of herbal preparations for symptom relief as no trials evaluated this properly. Compared with conventional medication, one herbal preparation, Tripterygium wilfordii, may have a more beneficial effect in reducing the volume of uterine fibroids. Another five herbal medicines appeared to be similar to conventional medication in reducing the volume of fibroids. The herbal medicine Guizhi Fuling formula showed a significantly greater effect in reducing the volume of the fibroids when combined with mifepristone versus mifepristone alone. However, these clinical trials were small in terms of the number of participants and the trial quality was low. Thirteen out of 21 included trials reported on adverse effects of herbal preparations and found some minor problems such as stomach discomfort, nausea, hot flushes, and poor appetite although no serious adverse effects were identified. The effect of herbal preparations for uterine fibroids is therefore not confirmed in this review and needs to be studied in large, good quality trials.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-04-02 14:28:20 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>We included 21 randomised trials (involving 2222 women) and the majority of them had unclear or high risk of bias. There were several different herbal preparations used within the included trials. The average treatment duration was three to six months. The primary outcome of uterine fibroid related symptoms was not reported in any of the included trials. The majority of the trials reported fibroid volume and size of the uterus.</P>
<P>Compared with mifepristone, Tripterygium wilfordii extract was associated with a greater reduction in the fibroid volume (MD -23.03 cm<SUP>3</SUP>, 95% CI -28.39 to -17.67; 2 trials) and in uterine size (MD -51.25 cm<SUP>3</SUP>, 95% CI -77.70 to -24.80; 2 trials). There was no evidence of a significant difference between Nona Roguy herbal product and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist on the average fibroid volume or the uterine size. The combination of Guizhi Fuling formula and mifepristone was associated with a greater reduction in the fibroid volume (-1.72 [-2.42, -1.02] 7 trials) and in uterine size (MD -31.63 [95% CI -54.58, -8.68] 3 trials)) compared with mifepristone alone.

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-03-19 20:10:20 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>Uterine fibroids are the most common, non-cancerous uterine growths in women of childbearing age. Alternative names are uterine leiomyomata, fibromyoma, myoma, or fibroids. The lifetime risk of fibroids in a woman over the age of 45 years has been estimated to be more than 60%, including symptomatic and non-symptomatic conditions (<LINK REF="REF-Okolo-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Okolo 2008</LINK>). Around 30% of women of childbearing age have clinically symptomatic uterine fibroids (<LINK REF="REF-Newbold-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newbold 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stewart-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 2001</LINK>). Common symptoms may include heavy or painful periods; prolonged menstrual periods; bleeding between periods; pelvic pain or low back pain; 'fullness' in the lower abdomen, with or without urinary or rectal symptoms due to compression; and reproductive problems, such as infertility, multiple miscarriages, or early onset of labour during pregnancy. Many women with uterine fibroids do not have any symptoms. A recent investigation of 21,479 women across eight countries showed that the prevalence of fibroids was from 9.4% (UK) to 17.8% (Italy) in the age population of 40 to 49 years (<LINK REF="REF-Zimmermann-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zimmermann 2012</LINK>). Uterine fibroids constitute the main reason for hysterectomies to be carried out, based on data between 1990 and 1997 in the United States (<LINK REF="REF-Farquhar-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farquhar 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Uterine fibroids are growths of muscular and fibrous cells within, or attached to, the wall of the uterus. According to the location of the growth, they can be categorised as submucosal when they grow just underneath the uterine lining, intramural when they are in between the muscles of the uterus, and subserosal when they are on the outside of the uterus. Fibroids may grow as a single tumour or in clusters. A single fibroid can be less than one inch in size or can grow to eight inches or more. A group of fibroids can also vary in size. The cause of uterine fibroids remains unknown, however genetic, hormonal, immunological, and environmental factors may play a role in starting the growth of fibroids, or in continuing that growth (<LINK REF="REF-Munro-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munro 2011</LINK>). Several risk factors for uterine fibroids have been identified. African-American women are at three- to five-times greater risk than white women. Women who are overweight or obese for their height (based on body mass index (BMI)) are also at slightly higher risk than women who are average in weight for their height. Women who have given birth appear to be at lower risk (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Recommended treatment for uterine fibroids depends on the severity of symptoms, the woman's age, pregnancy status, desire for future pregnancies, general health, and the characteristics of the fibroids (<LINK REF="REF-Stewart-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 2001</LINK>). If a woman shows no symptoms, or the fibroids are small, she may not need any treatment. If a woman has serious symptoms or pain, medical therapy can be used to relieve symptoms. Such treatment may include gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) (<LINK REF="REF-Lethaby-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lethaby 2001</LINK>); synthetic steroids with antiprogesterone activity, such as mifepristone, to slow or stop the growth of fibroids (<LINK REF="REF-Tristan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tristan 2012</LINK>); and the use of progesterone and its derivatives for short-term treatment of bleeding and for inhibiting the fibroids' growth (<LINK REF="REF-Grigorieva-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grigorieva 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maruo-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maruo 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Surgical therapy is considered to be an effective treatment and includes myomectomy to remove only the fibroids and leave the healthy uterus, or hysterectomy to remove the entire uterus (<LINK REF="REF-Falcone-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Falcone 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Griffiths-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griffiths 2006</LINK>). Another accepted treatment is uterine artery embolization (UAE), which is used to block off the blood supply to the uterus and so make the fibroids shrink (<LINK REF="REF-Gupta-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McLucas-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">McLucas 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tranquart-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tranquart 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Watson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watson 2002</LINK>). However, few women with uterine fibroids prefer surgery and women may seek less invasive options, such as pain medication, medical therapy, or other alternative therapies.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-03-19 20:12:28 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>Among alternative therapies, herbal treatments for fibroids are used in several medical traditions and countries (<LINK REF="REF-Fugh_x002d_Berman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fugh-Berman 2004</LINK>). For example, in China the use of traditional Chinese herbal medicines for treating uterine fibroids is a common clinical practice. In this review, herbal preparations are defined as any formulation of medicinal herbs including extracts, raw herbs, or herbal decoctions prescribed by practitioners. These could include herbal products such as Chinese proprietary medicine or self-prepared herbal decoctions. In Chinese medicine, herbal medicine has been used for many years for different diseases or conditions. For example, the herbal medicine Guizhi Fuling formula has been described in historical classics in ancient China for treatment of women's symptoms, and it is still used in China (<LINK REF="REF-Li-J-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li J 2008</LINK>). However, there are huge variations in the herbal preparations used, which will depend on the practitioners themselves and on the individualised treatment of different women.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-03-19 20:16:20 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>According to the theory of Chinese medicine, practitioners recognise uterine fibroids as a condition of imbalance between yin and yang in the body (in allopathic terms, disturbances of the endocrine system and blood circulation). Therefore, it is important that the practitioners make a diagnosis based on the symptoms and signs from observing the tongue and taking the pulse, and this practice is called 'pattern differentiation' (Chinese medicine diagnosis). The practitioners prescribe a herbal formula according to the pattern of the syndrome (in Chinese, <I>Zheng</I>). Clinical studies from the Chinese literature show that Chinese herbal preparations might relieve symptoms and shrink the fibroid tumours without significant adverse effects (<LINK REF="REF-Huang-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huang 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Xiong-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xiong 2002</LINK>). One of the commonly used herbal medicines is Guizhi Fuling formula, and basic studies showed that Guizhi Fuling formula might work on fibroids by promoting qi flow and blood circulation, immune regulation, and softening and resolving hard lumps (<LINK REF="REF-Ji-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ji 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Li-J-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li J 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sang-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sang 2004</LINK>). However, the exact mechanisms of the therapeutic effect are not fully understood.</P>

<P>Two review authors (JP Liu and H Yang) independently extracted data from eligible studies using a data extraction form designed and pilot-tested by the authors. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion or by a third review author (Y Xia). Papers not in Chinese, English, Japanese, or Italian were translated with the help of the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group. We extracted the following characteristics and data from each included trial: primary author, study setting, methodology, age, gender, and ethnicity of participants, number of participants randomised and analysed, participant inclusion and exclusion criteria, symptoms and methods for measurement, the diagnostic criteria, type of herb or herbs, quality of the products, route of delivery, dosage and duration of intervention, details of the comparison regime, duration of follow up, reasons for and number that dropped out or were lost during follow up, outcome measures (end of treatment and at follow up), and number and type of adverse events.</P>
<P>We sought data on the number of participants with each outcome by allocated treatment group, irrespective of compliance or follow up, to allow an intention-to-treat analysis.

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2013-03-19 20:45:07 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>Two review authors (JP Liu and H Yang) independently assessed the included studies for risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool (www.cochrane-handbook.org) to assess: selection bias (random sequence generation and allocation concealment); performance bias (blinding of participants and personnel); detection bias (blinding of outcome assessors); attrition bias (incomplete outcome data); reporting bias (selective reporting); and other bias. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or by a third review author (F Cardini). We described all judgements fully and presented the conclusions in the 'Risk of bias' table.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Generation of the allocation sequence</HEADING>
<P>Low risk of bias: if the allocation sequence was generated by a computer or random number table. Drawing of lots, tossing of a coin, shuffling of cards, or throwing dice may also be considered as low risk if a person who was not otherwise involved in the recruitment of participants performed the procedure.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Allocation concealment</HEADING>
<P>Low risk of bias: if the allocation of participants involved a central independent unit, on-site locked computer, identical appearing numbered drug bottles or containers prepared by an independent pharmacist or investigator, or sealed envelopes. Envelopes should be serially numbered, sealed, and opaque. However, this information is rarely provided, indicating an increased risk of bias.</P>
<P>Unclear risk of bias: if the trial was described as randomised but the method used to conceal the allocation was not described, or the sealed envelopes were not described as opaque.</P>
<P>High risk of bias: if the allocation sequence was known to the investigators who assigned participants, or if the study was quasi-randomised.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Blinding (or masks)</HEADING>
<P>Low risk of bias: double blinding, if the trial was described as double blind and both the participant and physician were blinded, or participant and outcome assessor.<BR/>Unclear risk of bias: single blinding, if the participants, or physicians, or outcome assessors were blinded.<BR/>High risk of bias: open-label, if blinding was not applied.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Incomplete data reporting</HEADING>
<P>Low risk of bias: if the dropout numbers were low (e.g. less than 20%) and they were evenly distributed among different groups, or if it was specified that there were no withdrawals or losses to follow up.<BR/>Unclear risk of bias: if the report gave the impression that there had been no withdrawals or losses to follow up but this was not specifically stated.<BR/>High risk of bias: if the number of, or reasons for, withdrawals or losses to follow up were not described.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Selective reporting bias</HEADING>
<P>Selective reporting is a type of reporting bias that affects the internal validity of an individual study. It refers to the selective reporting of some outcomes (for example positive outcomes) and the failure to report others (for example adverse events). If the trial protocols were not available, we would compare the outcome measures in the method section with the actual reported outcomes in the results for the assessment of selective reporting bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Other bias</HEADING>
<P>We considered baseline comparability as an important factor for other bias. If baseline data were comparable, the study would be at low risk of other bias. Otherwise, no information or insufficient information would be considered as either high or unclear risk of bias.</P>

<P>We would perform analyses by intention to treat where possible and attempt to obtain missing data from the original trialists. For dichotomous outcomes, participants with incomplete or missing data were to be included in a sensitivity analysis by counting them as treatment failures to explore the possible effect of loss to follow up on the findings ('worst-case' scenario). For continuous data, we took a 'carry forward' approach, in which we used the last observed patient data, if available, as the missing data to conduct data analysis.</P>

<P>If a sufficient number of randomised trials was identified and data were available, we would have performed subgroup analyses according to symptoms (presence or absence of), diagnosis with or without imaging confirmation, and the location of uterine fibroids (submucosal, intramural, or subserosal fibroids). Whenever there was significant heterogeneity we used a random-effects model and investigated heterogeneity in both the clinical characteristics and methodological differences between studies. We would carry out subgroup analyses in Review Manager 5.1.7 (RevMan 2012) to see if any differences were explained by differences between the studies.</P>

<P>1. eligibility was restricted to studies without high risk of bias;</P>
<P>2. alternative imputation strategies had been implemented;</P>
<P>3. the summary effect measure was odds ratio rather than risk ratio.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Overall quality of the body of evidence: summary of findings table</HEADING>
<P>Summary of findings tables were generated using GRADEPRO software. These tables evaluated the overall quality of the body of evidence for the main review outcomes using GRADE criteria (study limitations (that is risk of bias), consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness, and publication bias).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>A total of 2222 women with uterine fibroids were randomised into herbal treatment (n = 1118) or control (n = 1104). Twenty trials were conducted in China and one trial in Malaysia. The 21 trials included women of childbearing age with uterine fibroids, diagnosed through routine gynaecological examination and confirmed by B-mode ultrasound (most commonly used diagnostic method for uterine fibroids, which can show a clear two (or three) dimensional image of the size and location of uterine fibroids). As available outcome data were limited, we could not perform prespecified subgroup analyses, that is of symptom type or location of fibroids.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>Ten herbal preparations were tested in the 21 trials (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). The controls were placebo (one trial), pharmaceutical medicines including mifepristone and GnRH agonist (eight trials). Twelve trials tested herbal medicine plus medication versus medication (including four herbal medicines: Guizhi Fuling capsule, Qingliuqing capsule, Lenge Xiaozheng Tang, and Jiliu Tang). The average treatment duration was 3.6 months (ranging from three to six months).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>No trial reported the primary outcome for effectiveness, that is uterine fibroid related symptoms measured by a validated instrument. Thirteen of 21 trials reported the outcome of adverse events in relation to herbal medicines (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). Among secondary outcomes, no trials reported the need for surgical treatment, quality of life, or incidence of complications such as infertility. The outcomes reported were volume of the fibroids or size of the uterus. The volume of fibroids or the size of the uterus was measured by B-mode ultrasound. However, the method of calculating volume was different in some of the trials. Some studies reported the average volume of the fibroids by calculating the maximum fibroid size in each woman, while others reported the average volume by calculating the totality of multiple fibroids. Three trials reported follow up after the completion of treatment, ranging from three to six months.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-03-19 21:48:48 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>This systematic review included 21 randomised trials of herbal preparations for the treatment of uterine fibroids. The majority of the herbal preparations were tested in single trials. Only the herbal medicines Guizhi Fuling formula (either capsule or decoction) and Tripterygium wilfordii were tested in two or more trials, with or without mifepristone against mifepristone alone. One trial with good quality was published in English (<LINK REF="STD-Hazlina-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hazlina 2005</LINK>) and the other trials, published in Chinese, were of low quality. No trials reported menstrual symptoms related to fibroids, quality of life, incidence of complications, or the need for a surgical procedure. Most of the trials reported the volume of fibroids or size of the uterus, or both. The trials in this review showed a similar effect of herbal preparations combined with medication in terms of reduced volume of uterine fibroids. However, due to the small sample of the trials and methodological flaws in the majority of the trials, any indicated benefit is not conclusive. Further large and rigorous trials are needed.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-03-19 21:56:11 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>The included studies tested 10 different herbal medicines with conventional therapy, including mifepristone or GnRHa. In general, there was no significant difference between herbs and medical treatment for the reduced volume of fibroids. However, the lack of statistical significant difference does not mean equal effectiveness as none of the trials were designed as equivalence or non-inferiority trials and the sample size was no more than 100 in each arm in the majority of the trials.</P>
<P>With regard to the conventional medical treatments used in the included studies, the efficacy of mifepristone for reducing fibroid volume has not been firmly established (<LINK REF="REF-Tristan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tristan 2012</LINK>). A Cochrane systematic review demonstrated that mifepristone reduced heavy menstrual bleeding and improved fibroid-specific quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Tristan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tristan 2012</LINK>). Unfortunately, none of the trials in our review reported these outcomes and we don't know whether herbal medicines can be helpful in relieving fibroid related symptoms or not.</P>
<P>The evidence from this review is not sufficiently convincing to support a clinical recommendation due to the following aspects of the trials.</P>
<OL>
<LI>There is a lack of evidence on the clinical effect of individual herbal preparations for menstrual symptom improvement in uterine fibroids. In clinical practice, Chinese herbal medicine is used mainly for symptom improvement, but this was not confirmed from the included trials due to the lack of a validated measurement, or reporting of symptoms or quality of life. Almost all reported outcomes were surrogate outcomes and may not reflect the clinical effectiveness. Comparisons with placebo are needed, as there is no clear evidence of the efficacy of the comparators used in the trials.</LI>
<LI>Although Chinese herbal extracts of Tripterygium wilfordii showed a promising effect compared with mifepristone, the findings are not confirmed as we only had two small trials that were of poor quality and uncertain evidence on safety. The Chinese herbal medicine Guizhi Fuling showed a promising benefit when combined with mifepristone versus mifepristone alone. However, the findings need to be verified in large, rigorous trials.</LI>
<LI>The trials reported outcomes by the end of treatment or at short-term follow up. For those women with asymptomatic fibroids or mild symptoms, the use of herbal therapies is intended to prevent fibroid growth or to manage the mild symptoms. For this (wide) subgroup of women the main outcome is the avoidance of surgical treatment, measured through long-term follow up. Future trialists are encouraged to adopt this outcome, as women may simply reach their menopause without needing surgery. In addition, reproductive outcomes related to uterine fibroids, such as the relationship between submucosal, intramural, or subserosal fibroids and pregnancy rates, miscarriage, and malpresentation, should be addressed in future trials (<LINK REF="REF-Klatsky-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klatsky 2008</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Reporting of adverse events in relation to herbal preparations was not sufficient in the included trials, and one trial suggested potential kidney function impairment after three-month herbal treatment. Therefore, the safety of herbal medicine is still undetermined.</LI>
</OL>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-03-19 21:57:45 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>This systematic review has several methodological limitations. Firstly, there is a lack of high quality trials and we had to exclude some of the trials that claimed to be randomised because of an unexplainable skew in the distribution of participants among the compared groups or an inadequate method for sequence generation for randomisation, which means they were highly prone to selection bias (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-J-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu J 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Secondly, trials did not report use of double blinding (except for one trial), which may be related to performance and detection bias (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Thirdly, the trials had a small sample size. Although some data analyses did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference between herbal medicines and conventional medicine, the results are likely to have been underpowered. Therefore, the size of the trials may mean that the analyses may not establish with confidence that the two interventions have equivalent effects.</P>
<P>Fourth, the trials failed to report clinically useful outcomes such as symptoms or quality of life, which may suggest evidence of selective reporting bias. We could not differentiate the participants with symptoms from those without symptoms in the included studies. It is difficult to justify the herbal medicine treatment as some women without symptoms may not need any treatment. Therefore, we suggest that future trials should measure and report clinical symptoms as one of the major outcomes.</P>
<P>The above limitations mean that potential bias may have been present in the selection of participants, administration of treatment, and assessment of outcomes in the primary studies. Methodologically less rigorous trials show significantly larger intervention effects than more robust trials (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). An empirical study has shown that Chinese trials are significantly affected by publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Vickers-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vickers 1998</LINK>). When interpreting the present findings, publication bias should be taken into consideration accordingly.</P>
<P>In summary, the findings of this review should be interpreted with caution due to the small sample sizes, low methodological quality in the majority of the 21 trials, and the limited number of trials included for each individual herbal preparation.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-03-19 22:01:30 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>Although we conducted comprehensive searches in both English and Chinese databases, we may have missed some studies published in the non-English or non-Chinese literature, such as in the Japanese or Korean language. Second, we endeavoured to contact trial authors to clarify the methods for randomisation and obtain missing data, but the response was not satisfactory and leaves some trials with unclear randomisation. This may cause selection bias, and may not reflect the whole picture in using herbal medicine for the treatment of uterine fibroids.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2013-03-19 22:02:08 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As far as we know, there is no other systematic review or meta-analysis published on the same topic. We also could not identify any large, multicentre trials for a comparison of our findings with other types of evidence.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-03-19 22:07:08 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-03-19 22:02:59 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>Current evidence does not support the use of herbal preparations for treatment of uterine fibroids. There is no conclusive evidence of benefit due to a limited number of trials conducted for individual herbal preparations, the methodological quality of the primary studies, and their insufficient power to meet robust conclusions.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-03-19 22:07:08 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>Further well-designed, randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled trials are needed to evaluate herbal preparations for uterine fibroids. To improve quality, trials needs to use appropriate allocation concealment; blinding of participants, researchers and outcome assessors; and clarify the number of participants randomised and the number analysed. Clinically relevant outcomes, such as symptoms, quality of life, infertility, and anaemia, should be addressed and measured using validated patient-reported instruments. Potentially promising herbal preparations require further trials with large samples. As in this systematic review, the quality of herbal medicines was not reported in detail and for future trials it is important to investigate herbal medicines according to a set of criteria which include a preparation consistent with the description in the pharmacopoeia, chemical standardisation, biological assays, animal models, and clinical testing (<LINK REF="REF-Yuan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yuan 2000</LINK>). It will be necessary to improve the description of the herbal medicines being tested, for example plant species, geographical origin, harvest season, preparation procedures, and the quality of the products. Furthermore, future trials should pay more attention to the adverse effects of herbal medicines, especially for long-term use. Adverse events should be fully recorded and reported. Finally, trial reports should follow international standards, such as the CONSORT statement (<A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org/">http://www.consort-statement.org/</A>), and the trial protocol should be registered and accessible.</P>
