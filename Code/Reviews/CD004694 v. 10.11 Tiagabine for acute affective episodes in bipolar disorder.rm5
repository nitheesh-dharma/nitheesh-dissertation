<P>This systematic review investigated the evidence base for the efficacy and acceptability of tiagabine compared to placebo and other pharmacological agents in the acute treatment of bipolar disorder. No randomised controlled trials were found. Currently, there is insufficient evidence on which to base any recommendations regarding the use of tiagabine in acute treatment of bipolar illness, either as a single treatment or as an additional treatment. A significant proportion of patients suffered episodes of syncope or seizure. There is a need for randomised controlled trials examining the efficacy and acceptability of tiagabine in the acute treatment of bipolar disorder, after the nature of these episodes has been clarified.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-05-30 08:25:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Bipolar disorder is a common recurrent illness with high levels of chronicity. Treatment resistance persists despite the use of established medications, such as lithium and valproate. New medications are required for the treatment of refractory cases. Some open-label reports have suggested that the anticonvulsant tiagabine may be efficacious in bipolar disorder. There is a need to clarify the evidence available, in the form of randomised controlled trials, for its use in the treatment of acute affective episodes in bipolar disorder.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-10-23 10:51:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this update, we searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References) to October 2012. This register contains relevant randomised controlled trials from: <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (all years), EMBASE (1974 to date), MEDLINE (1950 to date) and PsycINFO (1967 to date). We examined reference lists of relevant papers and major textbooks of affective disorder. We contacted authors, other experts in the field and pharmaceutical companies for knowledge of suitable published or unpublished trials. We handsearched specialist journals and conference proceedings.</P>

<P>We found no randomised controlled trials of tiagabine in the treatment of acute episodes of bipolar disorder. However, there are reports that a number of patients suffered episodes of syncope or seizure. Further investigation of the efficacy and acceptability of tiagabine in the treatment of acute affective episodes of bipolar disorder should await the clarification of the nature of the reported episodes of syncope and seizure-like activity and an examination of the level of risk involved.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-05-30 08:31:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-05-30 08:25:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Bipolar disorder is a chronic disorder with a lifetime prevalence of 1% to 5% (<LINK REF="REF-Akiskal-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akiskal 2000</LINK>) and carries with it significant morbidity, socioeconomic costs and risk of suicide. Classically, it is manifested in repeated manic, depressed or mixed mood episodes.</P>
<P>In the acute phase of the disorder it can present as:</P>
<OL>
<LI>an acute manic episode, where there are symptoms of elated mood, disinhibition and rapidity of thought;</LI>
<LI>an acute depressive episode, where mood is lowered and there are a range of changes in thoughts, emotions and bodily functions, such as sleep and appetite;</LI>
<LI>a mixed episode, where there are features of 1) and 2).</LI>
</OL>
<P>After the acute phase is over, by nature bipolar disorder tends to have repeated relapses. One-third of patients suffer chronic symptoms, which affect their social and occupational development. It ranks second amongst mental illnesses in the causes of worldwide disability (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1997</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-05-30 08:25:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Mood stabilisers are used in the treatment of bipolar disorder. Ideally, they should treat affective episodes of all types efficaciously. Lithium is the mood stabiliser in longest use. It remains a first choice in the treatment of bipolar disorder. However, the response to lithium treatment is often unsatisfactory (<LINK REF="REF-Bowden-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bowden 1996</LINK>). It has a narrow therapeutic window and is often associated with side effects, even at therapeutic doses. It is thought to precipitate episode recurrence on withdrawal, making its use in the non-compliant patient problematic.</P>
<P>The anticonvulsants carbamazepine and valproate have become established as adjunctive and alternative treatments to lithium. Data on atypical antipsychotics have also shown that they may have antimanic activity (<LINK REF="REF-Keck-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keck 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rendell-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rendell 2003</LINK>). However, even with these advances, treatment resistance persists and hence newer interventions are constantly being sought and investigated. Recently, the application of a range of anticonvulsant agents in bipolar disorder has been explored. Tiagabine is an anticonvulsant used in adjunctive treatment of focal and secondary generalised epilepsy (<LINK REF="REF-Genton-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Genton 2001</LINK>) and may also have a role in the acute phase of bipolar disorder.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-05-30 08:25:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Putatively, tiagabine acts by blocking the uptake-reuptake of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain (<LINK REF="REF-Suzdak-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suzdak 1995</LINK>). Patients with epilepsy appear to tolerate tiagabine well (<LINK REF="REF-Sachdeo-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sachdeo 1997</LINK>). However, the following adverse effects have been reported: dizziness, tiredness, somnolence, other signs of central nervous system suppression and incomplete seizure control (<LINK REF="REF-Leppik-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leppik 1995</LINK>). Interestingly, there are reports of a paradoxical association with non-convulsive status epilepticus in a small number of patients with epilepsy (<LINK REF="REF-Balslev-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balslev 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kellinghaus-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kellinghaus 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kellinghaus-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kellinghaus 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Knake-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knake 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mangano-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mangano 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schapel-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schapel 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Skodda-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skodda 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vinton-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinton 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhu-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhu 2002</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-05-30 08:31:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In view of the problem of treatment resistance in bipolar disorder, new medications which are both efficacious and well-tolerated are required. There is some evidence of efficacy of tiagabine in maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder (<LINK REF="STD-Kauffman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kauffman 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schaffer-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Schaffer 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schaffer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Schaffer 2002</LINK>) and we have previously reviewed and analysed the evidence in another Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Vasudev-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vasudev 2011</LINK>). There is a need to clarify the evidence for the use of tiagabine in the treatment of acute episodes of this disorder.</P>
<P>This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2006. That review did not find any randomised controlled trials and hence no conclusions could be drawn. This update explores publication of any new data which would inform the usage of tiagabine for the treatment of acute affective episodes in bipolar disorder.</P>

Where possible, data from these studies were to be separated into diagnostic groups. If necessary, the authors of the studies were to be requested to provide original data. Where such separation was impossible, the studies were to be included only if at least 80% of randomised participants had a bipolar diagnosis. Furthermore, we would conduct a sensitivity analysis to examine the effect of their inclusion.</P>

<P>The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group (CCDAN) maintain two clinical trials registers at their editorial base in Bristol, UK, a references register and a studies-based register. The CCDANCTR-References Register contains over 29,000 reports of trials in depression, anxiety and neurosis. Approximately 60% of these references have been tagged to individual, coded trials. The coded trials are held in the CCDANCTR-Studies Register and records are linked between the two registers through the use of unique Study ID tags. Coding of trials is based on the EU-Psi coding manual. Please contact the CCDAN Trials Search Co-ordinator for further details. Reports of trials for inclusion in the Group's registers are collated from routine (weekly), generic searches of MEDLINE (1950-), EMBASE (1974-) and PsycINFO (1967-); quarterly searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and review-specific searches of additional databases. Reports of trials are also sourced from international trials registers c/o the World Health Organization&#8217;s trials portal (<A HREF="http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/">ICTRP</A>), drug companies, the handsearching of key journals, conference proceedings and other (non-Cochrane) systematic reviews and meta-analyses.</P>

<P>We planned to calculate study responders on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis; this implies that drop-outs were always included in the analysis. Where participants withdrew from the trial before the study endpoint, it was assumed that they would have experienced a negative outcome by the end of the trial (e.g. failure to respond to treatment). Where there were missing data and the method of 'last observation carried forward' (LOCF) had been used to do an ITT analysis, then we would use the LOCF data, with due consideration of the potential bias and uncertainty introduced. When dichotomous or continuous outcomes were not completely reported in the published literature, we would ask trial authors to supply the data on an individual basis. We would compare the results arising from these two methods during sensitivity analysis. Where ITT analysis was not possible, we were to use endpoint data for trial completers. When only the standard error (SE) or t-statistics or P values were reported, we would impute standard deviations (SDs) for changes from baseline as described previously (<LINK REF="REF-Abrams-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abrams 2005</LINK>).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-10-10 15:05:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Over the six years since our last review, there have been no new published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of tiagabine in acute therapy of bipolar disorder. Though the reason for the lack of these data is unknown, it could be that scientists and clinicians have been missing out testing this particular GABAergic agent. This is confirmed by the lack of any ongoing studies as evidenced by our handsearches as well as further correspondence with a number of key opinion leaders. Indeed a frequently used agent in bipolar disorder, valproate, mediates its activity via the GABAergic system and has been found to be safe and efficacious (<LINK REF="REF-Macritchie-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macritchie 2003</LINK>). Newer studies continue to implicate the GABA system in bipolar disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Fatemi-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fatemi 2011</LINK>); good-quality, prospective, randomised controlled trials of tiagabine in the acute treatment of bipolar disorder are needed.</P>
<P>The presence of new onset syncope/ seizure like activity potentially induced by this anti-epileptic during the treatment of acute bipolar disorder remains of concern. This needs to be further investigated.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-05-30 08:56:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This systematic review did not find any randomised controlled trials examining the efficacy and acceptability of tiagabine treatment for the prevention of affective relapses in the acute treatment of bipolar disorder. The three open-label studies mentioned above found minimal efficacy of this agent. Patients suffering from depressive illness seemed to benefit more, however, compared to those with hypomanic illness. Three patients were reported to have suffered syncope or possible absence/generalised seizures.</P>
<P>There are a number of reports of tiagabine in association with non-convulsive status epilepticus (<LINK REF="REF-Balslev-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balslev 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kellinghaus-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kellinghaus 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kellinghaus-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kellinghaus 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Knake-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knake 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mangano-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mangano 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schapel-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schapel 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Skodda-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skodda 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vinton-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinton 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhu-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhu 2002</LINK>). A MEDLINE search found nine published articles documenting this side effect in at least 17 epileptic patients. All age groups were affected. The effect was not related to dose. Non-convulsive status epilepticus has been defined by the presence of typical delta wave activity with intermingled spikes on EEG, coupled with unresponsiveness clinically (<LINK REF="REF-Vinton-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinton 2005</LINK>). Most patients appeared to improve following the reduction or withdrawal of tiagabine and/or addition of a benzodiazepine.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-10-15 13:52:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is no published evidence from randomised controlled trials on which to base any recommendations regarding the use of tiagabine in any phase of acute bipolar illness, either as monotherapy or as an adjunctive treatment. We have identified a signal that there may be a problem with syncope/seizure-like activity in some patients. It is unclear whether these episodes represent the same clinical phenomenon. Further, most of these incidents occurred in patients who were in receipt of other psychotropic and/or anticonvulsant agents, raising the possibility of drug interaction. We are unable to provide any definitive information regarding the estimation of risk. Given this concern and the absence of evidence of benefit, at this time, tiagabine cannot be recommended for acute episodes of bipolar disorder.</P>

<P>We have updated the Methods section to meet the standards required by the 2008 <I>Cochrane Handbook</I> <I>for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I>. These include changing the objectives into Cochrane format; we have provided more detail on study inclusion criteria (particularly participants, where an age range has now been introduced); we have separated the outcomes into primary and secondary; and the assessment of risk of bias is now performed using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool.</P>

<P>Open-label study</P>
<P>8 inpatients suffering from an acute manic episode of bipolar disorder received tiagabine either as monotherapy (2 patients) or as adjunctive therapy (6 patients)</P>
<P>Dosage: initial dose of 20 mg a day increasing to a maximum dose of 40 mg a day</P>
<P>Duration: 4 days</P>
<P>Outcome criteria: change in mania scores on the Bech-Rafaelsen Mania Rating Scale (BRMAS) (<LINK REF="REF-Bech-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bech 1978</LINK>)</P>
<P>Results: there was a decrease in BRMAS scores at the end of the study at day 14 in all of the patients, however none achieved statistical significance. Patients whose illness was of moderate severity (baseline score &lt; 30) at the beginning of the study seemed to do better than those with severe illness (baseline score &gt; 30).</P>
<P>Serious adverse effects occurred in 2 patients. One patient had a generalised tonic clonic seizure after receiving 30 mg a day of tiagabine for 3 days. This patient had been receiving concomitant sodium valproate at a dose of 2500 mg a day. Another patient experienced severe nausea and vomiting after increasing the drug dosage from 30 to 40 mg a day. Nausea was reversible after discontinuation of the drug. There was no reported incidence of mortality during the trial.</P>

<P>Case series of 22 adult patients suffering from refractory bipolar disorder<BR/>Tiagabine was added open-label to previous medication at a dose of 1 mg/day. Dosage was increased by up to 1 mg per week in a maintenance fashion. No exclusion criteria were applied. Patients had been on multiple other medications, details of which were not described. A mean dose of 4.1 mg (2.2 SD) of tiagabine was used. A priori positive response to tiagabine was measured on the Clinical Global Impression - Bipolar version (CGI-BP) (<LINK REF="REF-Spearing-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spearing 1997</LINK>). </P>
<P>8 of the 22 patients (36%) responded to tiagabine. All of the 14 non-responders withdrew from the treatment; 13 withdrew because of unacceptable adverse effects and one due to poor compliance. Adverse effects leading to discontinuation included overactivation (5 patients), oversedation (4 patients), cognitive impairment (2 patients) and headaches (2 patients). One patient with epilepsy suffered a recurrence of absence seizures which had previously been controlled with gabapentin. All side effects were resolved within 1 to 2 days of tiagabine discontinuation. The report did not mention the methods used for assessment of adverse effects, including any laboratory investigations or subjective adverse effect scores.</P>

<P>Open-label study<BR/>17 patients suffering from bipolar disorder (type 1 and 2); results from 13 finally included. 6 patients were hypomanic and 7 were depressed. Tiagabine used as adjunctive therapy.<BR/>Dosage: 4 mg a day with gradual increases of 4 mg a week as tolerated</P>
<P>Duration: the end of the evaluation period was taken as the time at which new medication was required or existing (non-trial) medication increased. The mean duration of treatment was 38 days.</P>
<P>Outcome criteria: the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) (<LINK REF="REF-Young-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Young 1978</LINK>), Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS) (<LINK REF="REF-Rush-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rush 1996</LINK>) and the Clinical Global Impression for Bipolar Disorder (CGI-BP) (<LINK REF="REF-Spearing-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spearing 1997</LINK>)</P>
<P>Results: on the CGI-BP 3 patients were 'much or very much improved' while 10 were 'minimally improved, no change or worse'. The YMRS and IDS sores showed that there was some improvement in patients presenting with depression; however in hypomania there was no significant difference between the baseline and final scores<BR/>4 patients were excluded from analysis because of early discontinuation within the first week; 2 stopped due to side effects (nausea in one and decreased libido in the other); 2 discontinued because of apparent worsening of mood symptoms (not necessarily related to tiagabine)</P>
<P>Of the patients whose response could be evaluated: 3 were discontinued from tiagabine administration due to significant adverse events; one of these had loss of consciousness and was incontinent of bladder and bowel. The event was unwitnessed. This patient had been on other anticonvulsant medication for his bipolar illness (divalproex, topiramate and gabapentin). On discontinuation of tiagabine the adverse effects abated.</P>
<P>In another patient an episode of unresponsiveness, disorientation and 'shaking' was noted 4 months after initiation of tiagabine. This patient was on thioridazine, fluoxetine, alprazolam and zolpidem as well at the time of the adverse event. Discontinuing tiagabine again led to abatement of symptoms.</P>
<P>In another patient a 'fainting spell' was noted with unresponsiveness, disorientation and unsteady gait. There was no loss of consciousness. Symptoms cleared after few hours of supportive treatment and oxygen therapy. Tiagabine was discontinued and the symptoms did not reoccur.</P>
