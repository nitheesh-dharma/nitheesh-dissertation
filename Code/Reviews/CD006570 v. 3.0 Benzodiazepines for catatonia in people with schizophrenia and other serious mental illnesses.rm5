<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-08-11 15:02:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Bethany  L York">
<P>Some people who have schizophrenia or other serious mental illnesses develop catatonia, which consists of extreme lack of movement or constant repetitive movement over which they seem to have very little control.  Whilst in a catatonic state these people are unable to interact with their environment and may go on to acquire secondary problems such as pneumonia, blood clotting problems (thrombosis), malnutrition or dehydration.  Current treatments for this are either drugs, which are given by injection, or electric shock treatment (electroconvulsive therapy).  The aim of this review is to look at how effective benzodiazepines are compared to placebo or other drug treatments in treating this problem.  However, while some clinical trials that seemed relevant were identified, no usable data could be extracted from them. There is no good trial-derived data on this subject.  However, there are five trials on which more information needs to be collected.  In the longer term, to make sure people with catatonia receive the most effective treatment, this is an area that would benefit from good research and well planned and reported trials.  Also, since the condition is rare, there should be good communication between those involved in researching it. </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-08-06 10:51:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Bethany  L York">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-07-31 20:59:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Catatonia is a syndrome characterised by motor abnormalities such as purposeless activity, immobility and posturing, together with disturbances of consciousness and volition. In 1874 observers described seventeen typical signs, although many more have since been added (<LINK REF="REF-Kahlbaum-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kahlbaum 1973</LINK>). Catatonia has been described in the context of schizophrenia, organic illnesses and mood disorders (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1992</LINK>). Regardless of the cause, when catatonia is not aggressively treated the patient is at increased risk for a number of negative outcomes. People with catatonia may develop pneumonia and thromboembolic complications (<LINK REF="REF-Regestein-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Regestein 1977</LINK>). Malnutrition and dehydration are also common (<LINK REF="REF-Penland-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Penland 2006</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-08-06 10:51:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Bethany  L York">
<P>A number of different treatments have been advocated for catatonia. Attention to underlying causes is important, although, in some instances, antipsychotics may worsen catatonia (<LINK REF="REF-Penland-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Penland 2006</LINK>). Benzodiazepines, especially lorazepam, have been thought to be of some benefit (<LINK REF="REF-Rosebush-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosebush 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schmider-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Schmider 1999</LINK>). Together with electroconvulsive therapy, benzodiazepines are perhaps the most widely reported treatment.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-07-31 20:56:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Much of the evidence-base for the use of benzodiazepines for catatonia consists of case reports and small studies. This systematic review will attempt to identify and summarise any relevant evidence from trials.</P>

<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2008-08-11 10:25:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Bethany  L York">

<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Randomised controlled trials. Where a trial was described as 'double-blind', but it was only implied that the study was randomised, these trials were included in a sensitivity analysis. If there was no substantive difference within primary outcomes (see types of outcome measures) when these 'implied randomisation' studies were added, then they were included in the final analysis. If there was a substantive difference, only clearly randomised trials were used and the results of the sensitivity analysis were described in the text. Quasi-randomised studies, such as those allocating by using alternate days of the week, were excluded. For studies with cross-over designs, only data from the first cross-over phase were analysed.</P>

<STUDY_SELECTION MODIFIED="2008-08-02 10:32:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We (RCG, GW) independently inspected citations identified from the search. We identified potentially relevant reports and ordered full papers for reassessment. If doubts remained we acquired the full article for further inspection. We obtained full reports and independently reassessed these for inclusion.This process was repeated for the full papers. If it was impossible to resolve disagreements these studies were added to those awaiting assessment and the authors of the papers contacted for clarification.</P>
</STUDY_SELECTION>
<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2008-08-11 10:52:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Bethany  L York">
<P>1. Extraction</P>
<P>We (RCG, GW) independently extracted data from the selected trials. Again, where disagreement occurred attempts were made to resolve this by discussion, where doubt still remained we acquired further information from authors. Data were extracted onto standard, simple forms.</P>
<P>2. Management</P>
<P>2.1 Continuous to binary</P>
<P>Where possible, efforts were made to convert outcome measures to binary data. This can be done by identifying cut off points on rating scales and dividing participants accordingly into 'clinically improved' or 'not clinically improved'. It was generally assumed that if there had been a 50% reduction in a scale-derived score such as the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS, <LINK REF="REF-Overall-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1962</LINK>) or the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS, <LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>), this could be considered as a clinically significant response (<LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005a</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005b</LINK>). It was recognised that for many people, especially those with chronic or severe illness, a less rigorous definition of important improvement (e.g. 25% on the BPRS) would be equally valid. If individual patient data had been available, the 50% cut-off would have been used for the definition in the case of non-chronically ill people and 25% for those with chronic illness. If data based on these thresholds were not available, we would have used the primary cut-off presented by the original authors.</P>
<P>2.2 Normal distribution<BR/>For continuous data we calculated the weighted mean difference (WMD) between groups and its 95% confidence interval (CI) using a fixed effects model. Continuous data on outcomes in trials relevant to mental health issues are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data we applied the following standards to continuous final value endpoint data before inclusion: (a) standard deviations and means were reported in the paper or were obtainable from the authors; (b) when a scale started from zero, the standard deviation, when multiplied by two, should be less than the mean (otherwise the mean is unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution - <LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>); in cases with data that are greater than the mean they were entered into 'Other data' table as skewed data. If a scale starts from a positive value (such as PANSS, which can have values from 30 to 210) the calculation described above in (b) should be modified to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skewness is present if 2SD&gt;(S-Smin), where S is the mean score and Smin is the minimum score.</P>
<P>For change data (mean change from baseline on a rating scale) it is impossible to tell whether data are non-normally distributed (skewed) or not, unless individual patient data are available. After consulting the ALLSTAT electronic statistics mailing list, we presented change data in RevMan graphs to summarise available information. In doing this, we assumed either that data were not skewed or that the analysis could cope with the unknown degree of skew.</P>
<P>2.3 Final endpoint value versus change data<BR/>Where both final endpoint data and change data were available for the same outcome category, only final endpoint data were presented. We acknowledge that by doing this much of the published change data may be excluded, but argue that endpoint data is more clinically relevant and that if change data were to be presented along with endpoint data, it would be given undeserved equal prominence. Authors of studies reporting only change data are being contacted for endpoint figures. Again, where loss to follow up is greater than 20%, we will not use data because we (RCG, GW) consider that, for short-term studies such as those likely to be included in this review, this degree of loss would be indicative of poor study quality.</P>
<P>2.4 Scale-derived data<BR/>A wide range of instruments are available to measure mental health outcomes. These instruments vary in quality and many are not valid, and are known to be subject to bias in trials of treatments for schizophrenia (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>). Therefore, continuous data from rating scales were included only if the measuring instrument had been described in a peer-reviewed journal. Scales which had been rated by therapists, rather than an independent rater were reported as 'prone to bias'.</P>
</DATA_EXTRACTION>
<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2008-08-11 10:53:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Bethany  L York">
<P>Again working independently, RCG and GW assessed risk of bias using the tool described in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>). This tool encourages consideration of how the sequence was generated, how allocation was concealed, the integrity of blinding at outcome, the completeness of outcome data, selective reporting and other biases. We would not have included studies where sequence generation was at high risk of bias or where allocation was clearly not concealed.</P>
</QUALITY_ASSESSMENT>
<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2008-08-11 10:56:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Bethany  L York">
<P>1. Binary data<BR/>For binary outcomes we would have calculated the relative risk (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) based on the fixed-effect model. Relative Risk is more intuitive (<LINK REF="REF-Boissel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boissel 1999</LINK>) than odds ratios and odds ratios tend to be interpreted as RR by clinicians (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2000</LINK>). This misinterpretation then leads to an overestimate of the impression of the effect. Should the overall results have been significant we would have calculated the number needed to treat (NNT) and the number-needed-to-harm (NNH).</P>
<P>2. Continuous data</P>
<P>For continuous outcomes we would have estimated a fixed-effect weighted mean difference (WMD) between groups. We would not have calculated effect size measures.</P>
</EFFECT_MEASURES>
<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2008-08-11 11:44:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Bethany  L York">
<P>1. Cluster trials<BR/>Studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (e.g. randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Firstly, authors often fail to account for intraclass correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) whereby p values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This causes type 1 errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Should clustering not have been accounted for in primary studies, we would have presented the data in a table, with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review we will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intraclass correlation co-efficients of their clustered data and to adjust for this using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Should clustering have been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we would have also presented these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjusted for the clustering effect. We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a 'design effect'. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the intraclass correlation co-efficient (ICC) [Design effect=1+(m-1)*ICC] (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC had not been reported it would have been assumed to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>). Should cluster studies have been appropriately analysed taking into account intraclass correlation coefficients and relevant data documented in the report, synthesis with other studies would have been possible using the generic inverse variance technique.</P>
<P>2. Cross-over trials</P>
<P>A major concern of cross-over trials is the carryover effect. It occurs if an effect (e.g. pharmacological, physiological or psychological) of the treatment in the first phase is carried over to the second phase. As a consequence on entry to the second phase the participants can differ systematically from their initial state despite a wash-out phase. For the same reason cross-over trials are not appropriate if the condition of interest is unstable (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). As both effects are very likely in schizophrenia, we would have only used data of the first phase of cross-over studies.</P>
<P>3. Studies with multiple treatment groups</P>
<P>Should a study have involved more than two treatment arms, if relevant, the additional treatment arms would have been presented in comparisons. Where the additional treatment arms were not relevant, these data were not reproduced.</P>
</UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS>
<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2008-08-11 11:01:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Bethany  L York">
<P>1. Unreported data</P>
<P>We would have contacted the primary author of each included study for any unreported data (e.g. standard deviations, details of dropouts, details of interventions received by control group).</P>
<P>2. Overall loss of credibility</P>
<P>At some degree of loss of follow up, data must lose credibility. We are forced to make a judgment where this is for the very short-term trials likely to be included in this review. Should more than 20% of data have been unaccounted for we would not have reproduced these data or used them within analyses.</P>
<P>3. Binary</P>
<P>In the case where attrition for a binary outcome was between 0 and 20% and outcomes of these people had been described, we would have included these data as reported.

<P>1. Clinical heterogeneity</P>
<P>Firstly, consideration of all the included studies within any comparison would have been undertaken to judge clinical heterogeneity.</P>
<P>2. Statistical</P>
<P>2.1 Visual inspection</P>
<P>Then visual inspection of graphs would have been used to investigate the possibility of statistical heterogeneity.</P>
<P>2.2 Employing the I-squared statistic</P>
<P>Visual inspection would have been supplemented using, primarily, the I-squared statistic. This provides an estimate of the percentage of variability due to heterogeneity rather than chance alone. Should the I-squared estimate have been greater than or equal to 50%, this would have been interpreted as indicating the presence of high levels of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). If inconsistency had been high, data would not have been summated, but would have been presented separately and reasons for heterogeneity investigated.</P>
</HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT>
<BIAS_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2008-08-06 10:51:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Bethany  L York">
<P>Reporting biases arise when the dissemination of research findings is influenced by the nature and direction of results. These are described in section 10.1 of the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>). We are aware that funnel plots may be useful in investigating reporting biases but are of limited power to detect small-study effects. We would not have used funnel plots for outcomes where there were ten or fewer studies, or where all studies were of similar sizes. In other cases, should funnel plots have been possible, we would have sought statistical advice in their interpretation.</P>
</BIAS_ASSESSMENT>
<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2008-08-02 11:37:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Should it have been possible we would have employed a fixed-effect model for analyses. We understand that there is no closed argument for preference for use of fixed or random-effect models. The random-effect method incorporates an assumption that the different studies are estimating different, yet related, intervention effects. This does seem true to us, however, random-effect does put added weight onto the smaller of the studies - those trials that are most vulnerable to bias. For this reason we favour using fixed-effect models and would have employed only random-effect when investigating heterogeneity.</P>
</DATA_SYNTHESIS>
<SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2008-08-11 11:08:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Bethany  L York">
<P>If data had been clearly heterogeneous we would have checked that data were correctly extracted and entered and that we had made no unit-of-analysis errors. If the high levels of heterogeneity had remained we would not have undertake a meta-analysis at this point for if there is considerable variation in results, and particularly if there is inconsistency in the direction of effect, it may be misleading to quote an average value for the intervention effect. We would have wanted to explore heterogeneity. We pre-specify no characteristics of studies that may be associated with heterogeneity except quality of trial method. If no clear association could have been shown by sorting studies by quality of methods a random-effect meta-analysis would have been preformed. Should other characteristics of the studies have been highlighted by the investigation of heterogeneity, perhaps some plausible but unpredicted clinical heterogeneity, these post-hoc reasons would have been discussed, data analysed and presented. However, should the heterogeneity have been substantially unaffected by use of random-effect meta-analysis and no other reasons for heterogeneity be clear, the final data would have been presented without a meta-analysis.</P>

<SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2008-08-11 11:08:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Bethany  L York">
<P>Should data have been permitting, sensitivity analyses would have been undertaken in order to see if sub-grouping data resulted in important changes in the results. The following sub-groupings were pre-specified:</P>
<P>1. Published (in a journal/chapter) versus unpublished trials.<BR/>2. High quality (well-described sequence generation and concealment of allocation) studies versus others.<BR/>3. Use of specific benzodiazepines versus use of all other benzodiazepines.</P>

<P>We excluded seventeen studies from the review. Only ten of these were randomised. Many of both the randomised and the non-randomised excluded studies did not focus specifically on treatment outcomes in people with catatonia. Of the ten randomised studies, only three included more than one person with catatonia (<LINK REF="STD-Fischer-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Fischer 1974</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kunigiri-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kunigiri 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ungvari-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ungvari 1997</LINK>), and of these, none employed benzodiazepines as a therapeutic intervention.</P>
<P>1. Studies awaiting assessment</P>
<P>Five studies currently await assessment. We were able to obtain only abstracts for two (<LINK REF="STD-Patra-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Patra 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wetzel-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wetzel 1997</LINK>) and these did not contain any usable data. For a third study (<LINK REF="STD-Merlis-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Merlis 1962</LINK>), we found a full journal article. However, the method of allocation of participants to the different therapeutic interventions was unclear. Additionally, in that study, only twelve out of a total of eighty participants suffered from catatonia and no independent data were presented about these specific people. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Schmider-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Schmider 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ungvari-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ungvari 1999</LINK>) were described as double-blind and had cross-over designs; the latter with persons with chronic catatonia. However, in both cases, data were not reported separately for the first cross-over phase and therefore could not be included for analysis. <LINK REF="STD-Schmider-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Schmider 1999</LINK> presented findings graphically and as statistics with accompanying p values, making them impossible to use in this review.

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2008-08-10 20:47:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>1. The search</P>
<P>It is feasible that we have failed to identify relevant studies by using a search that was biased. Every effort is made to ensure that searches are as comprehensive as possible, but there is evidence that studies from low and middle-income countries are not well represented in some of the databases we employ, and it is from these countries that relevant trials may be more likely to come. We, however, do not think that we would have missed any large study as, we think, such a trial would have been widely reported.</P>
<P>2. Cross-over studies</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Schmider-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Schmider 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ungvari-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ungvari 1999</LINK> were cross-over designs and <LINK REF="STD-Ungvari-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ungvari 1999</LINK> specifically randomised people with chronic catatonia. We had pre-stated in our protocol that such studies would only have data extracted from the first period (pre-cross-over) because of a possible carry-over effect, and it is possible that we are mistaken. We, however, feel justified in our decision as not only could the effects of the drugs carry over (even beyond their period of physiological effect) but also, we would suggest that the symptoms of even 'chronic' catatonia would be unstable. It is, however, of importance that such studies were possible.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2008-08-11 11:12:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Bethany  L York">
<P>Because our review did not yield any usable data for analysis, we are unable to comment on agreement or disagreement with other studies or reviews. There still is insufficient trial-derived evidence about the usefulness of benzodiazepines in the treatment of people with catatonia. At this time, clinicians, patients and carers can base decisions about using benzodiazepines to treat people with catatonia only on anecdotal cases or small studies with some deficiencies in methodology and/or reporting of findings. Such cases and studies have tended to support the use of benzodiazepines in the treatment of people with catatonia (<LINK REF="REF-Rosebush-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosebush 1990</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-08-11 11:43:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Bethany  L York">
<P>1. For people with catatonia and carers</P>
<P>We are unable to give any clear statements on the benefits or risks associated with the use of benzodiazepines in the treatment of people with catatonia. As far as we can see, treatment of this distressing and serious condition will continue to be based on evidence other than that derived from high-grade trials. Perhaps carers and recipients of care could highlight the need for good studies and their willingness to take part.</P>
<P>2. For clinicians</P>
<P>We are unable to give any clear statements on the benefits or risks associated with the use of benzodiazepines in the treatment of persons with catatonia. Clinicians will have to continue to make judgements on how to treat people that are probably more based on consensus than hard evidence. Again, should clinicians show a willingness to take part in clinically relevant evaluative studies, this would make this type of work much more possible.</P>
<P>3. For managers/policy makers</P>
<P>Policy will have to be based on non-trial evidence and consensus until better data are available.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-08-11 11:13:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Bethany  L York">
<P>1. General<BR/>Trialists undertaking research in this area should ensure that both methods and data reporting are of the highest quality. Some specific issues include the need for descriptions of both randomisation and the process and testing of blinding. Reporting outcomes using only graphs, summary statistics or p values should be avoided. Instead, authors should present means, standard deviations, confidence intervals, measures of association between intervention and outcome, e.g. relative risks and odds-ratios, as well as the raw numbers, if possible. Finally, trialists should report on all findings related to the method they describe. Where cross-over designs are used, findings from each cross-over phase should be reported separately.</P>
<P>2. Specific<BR/>The use of specific treatments for people with catatonia is not supported by any evidence from randomised trials. The excluded studies and those awaiting assessment demonstrate that such studies are not impossible (<LINK REF="STD-Fischer-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Fischer 1974</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kunigiri-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kunigiri 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Merlis-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Merlis 1962</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Patra-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Patra 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Schmider-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Schmider 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ungvari-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ungvari 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ungvari-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ungvari 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wetzel-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wetzel 1997</LINK>). We suggest that there is an urgent need to test the effects of benzodiazepines for this condition, as, anecdotally, these drugs would appear to be a promising pharmacological approach (<LINK REF="REF-Rosebush-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosebush 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schmider-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Schmider 1999</LINK>).
