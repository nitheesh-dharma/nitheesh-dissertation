I notice that other references is completely empty; is this correct? Bandolier 2000 is mentioned in the discussion but not referenced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of included studies: fine but please expand the abbreviations used in the footnotes. Excluded studies blankl for Baughman and York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaview Labels: please switch off totals throughout as all results are single studies. The decline rates are shown as negative figures; this jars as the FEV1 fell so you could change the titles to change in FEV1 etc or make the decline rates into postive figures. Please do one or the other. Also I do not understand the final outcome? What medication is changing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsis: Sarcoidosis is not common in comparison to asthma, so I have removed &amp;quot;fairly common&amp;quot;. I have also simplified the descrption of the treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract: please add date of search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Background: Is ketoconazole a cytotoxic drug?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion: fine. Do you want to comment on the fact that the placebo arm were able to achieve oral steroid reduction that was similar to that in the active arm?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contentious issues: ?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spellchecked: not yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next action: back to Toby 25_2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;28/02/2003&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the comments Chris - I have added all the publication details for Baughman and the reasons for exclusion in the Characteristics of excluded studies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were three drugs that were studied; chloroquine, methotrexate and cyclosporin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have removed the -ve signs from the meta-analysis and switched the axes for decline in lung function. I have entered methotrexate in the final outcome to make it explicit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have asked Shanthi for clarification that ketoconazole is a cytotoxic drug (all the info I have found on it indicates that it is 'antifungal' - not sure if that rules it out of the review or not). It is an anti-fungal agent but it has also been used to manage the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outcome - this is a slightly tricky issue, and we have opted for several markers as being of primary significance. Steroid sparing efficacy was important, as was chest x-ray and lung function. In this patient population multiple organ involvement was common and this is a pretty severe form of the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion - I have entered a line saying that placebo also induced reduction in steroid use - the rate of reduction was still significantly greater in the active arm but I don't really know what sort of reduction is meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have also spell-checked the review. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;21/3/3 Thanks for sorting all this out Toby. I have clarified the final meta-view outcome label. This is now ready for copy-editing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;9_5_3&lt;br&gt;Peer Review issues raised.&lt;br&gt;Ketoconazole is used for hypercalcaemia so should not be included. I have removed it from the review. Hope this is OK!&lt;br&gt;BTA has been changed to Chloroquine.&lt;br&gt;Israel results amended to marked improvement in 15 cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This now ready for the module.&lt;br&gt;Old title: +Immunosuppressive and cytotoxic therapy for pulmonary sarcoidosis&lt;br&gt;Old title: *Immunosuppressive and cytotoxic therapy for pulmonary sarcoidosis (WITH TJL 060704 - AWAITING WYSER GERMAN PAPER)&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2008-07-28 12:22:38 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson" REVIEW_NO="IMC-OTH" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.0.14" REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="7.0">

<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Sarcoidosis is a condition that can affect most of the organs in the body, including the lungs, heart, brain, bones, liver and skin. Patients who have severe disease or those who do not respond to treatment with steroids are often given powerful agents that suppress the immune system in an attempt to control the disease. However, these drugs have severe side effects. There is no evidence at the moment that the benefits of these drugs outweigh their side effects.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Immunosuppressive and cytotoxic agents have been used as both an alternative to oral corticosteroids, and as a means of maintaining a low dose of steroids in the treatment of pulmonary sarcoidosis.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the efficacy of immunosuppressive and cytotoxic agents in the treatment of pulmonary sarcoidosis.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL were searched for possible randomised trials and bibliographies were checked for other potentially relevant trials. Searches were current as of April 2006.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials comparing an immunosuppressive or cytotoxic therapy with a control in patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis were included in the review.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers independently assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data for entry in to the RevMan 4.2. Pharmaceutical companies and study investigators were contacted for unpublished trials.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Five studies were included in the review. Trials comparing methotrexate, chloroquine, cyclosporin A and pentoxifylline were identified. No data could be combined for a meta-analysis. Data on lung function, chest x-ray scores and dyspnoea were largely inconclusive. Adverse effects were associated with methotrexate, cyclosporin A, chloroquine and pentoxifylline. In two small studies methotrexate and pentoxifylline were associated with a steroid sparing effect. In the methotrexate study this was apparent after 12 months of therapy, but no difference was observed at 6 months.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The current body of evidence supporting the use of immunosuppressive agents and cytotoxic therapies is limited. Side-effects associated with some of the therapies were severe.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-07-28 12:20:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Sarcoidosis is a common, multi system, granulomatous disorder with frequent lung involvement that can in some cases progress to pulmonary fibrosis. The severity of the lung involvement is assessed on the basis of the patient's symptoms (particularly dyspnoea and cough), changes on the chest x-ray (CXR) and on deteriorating lung function. High resolution CT scans are now important in differentiating sarcoid from other interstitial lung diseases. Patients may also complain of systemic symptoms such as lethargy. Involvement of other organs including liver, skin and brain is also common in this group of patients. Oral corticosteroids are often prescribed first in such cases. Immunosuppressives and cytotoxic agents are also prescribed for those who do not respond to steroids and show a progressive deterioration or to those who are unable to tolerate steroids (steroid sparing agents). </P>
<P>Drugs that have been used in this context include methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclosporin A, hydroxychloroquine, chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, pentoxifylline, tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), and thalidomide. These drugs are usually prescribed for severe systemic sarcoidosis, particularly neurosarcoidosis and chronic skin sarcoidosis. These drugs can have severe side effects and require close monitoring. It is therefore important to know whether they have any beneficial effect in pulmonary sarcoidosis.</P>
<P>Certain ethnic groups, including Black Americans and Afro-Caribbean populations have a higher incidence of pulmonary sarcoidosis, which runs a particularly relentless course with higher morbidity and mortality.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of the review is to determine the benefit of immunosuppressive and cytotoxic agents for the treatment of patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis.</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS MODIFIED="2008-07-28 12:14:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>To be considered for inclusion clinical studies had to be randomised controlled trials with a control group or a group on corticosteroids.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Studies were included only where adult patients with evidence of pulmonary sarcoidosis had been recruited. If possible, confirmation of sarcoidosis would have been obtained histologically, showing classic radiographic changes, and patients should have shown deterioration in lung function. Studies including patients with other types of interstitial lung disease were excluded.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Interventions considered for the review were any one of the following drugs given either orally or parenterally; methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclosporin A, hydroxychloroquine, chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide and pentoxifylline, TNF alpha and thalidomide. In the control group the interventions considered were placebo or no treatment group or treatment with corticosteroids.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>(1) Lung function measurements<BR/>(2) Changes on chest x-ray and HRCT using standardised radiographic scores<BR/>(3) Symptom scores<BR/>(4) Mortality<BR/>(5) Side effects due to the drugs<BR/>(6) Steroid usage</P>
<P>Although non-pulmonary manifestations of sarcoidosis were not under consideration in this review, due to the heterogeneous nature of multi-system sarcoidosis it was inevitable that participants recruited would have extra-pulmonary manifestations of sarcoidosis. Therefore multi-system disease with pulmonary involvement was included in the review. The focus of the review was on pulmonary involvement and the outcome measures deemed of primary significance were chest x-ray, lung function and changes in steroid usage.</P>
</CRIT_OUTCOMES>
</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>Initial searches were carried out on CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL. Search strategies were developed using the following terms:</P>
<P>sarcoidosis and (methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclosporin A, hydroxychloroquine, chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, pentoxifylline, tumour necrosis factor alpha, thalidomide). </P>
<P>Full search strategies for CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE are included in the additional tables (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). The searches were combined with RCT filters which are described in the Airways Group module published on The Cochrane Library. The search was not restricted by language and translations were obtained where necessary. </P>
<P>Bibliographies of each retrieved RCT and review were then checked for additional trial reports. Pharmaceutical companies were contacted for extra trial data where possible. Authors of identified RCTs were contacted for other published and unpublished studies.</P>
<P>Search updates have been carried out since the initial search. The most recent searches were run in April 2006 and will be updated annually.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-07-28 12:14:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Each article identified was reviewed by SP and TL to see if it met the inclusion criteria. In case of doubt, a third reviewer (HW) was appointed to assess the article and a consensus reached. No disagreement occurred.</P>
<P>All trials were entered and scored independently using the following principles:</P>
<P>Grade A - Adequate concealment of allocation<BR/>Grade B - Unclear concealment of allocation<BR/>Grade C - Inadequate concealment of allocation<BR/>
<BR/>Inter-rater reliability were measured using simple agreement.</P>
<P>The methodological quality of each trial was assessed using a 0-5 scale based upon the method<BR/>described by <LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK> and summarised as follows:</P>
<P>(1) Was the study described as randomised (1= yes; 0= no)?<BR/>(2) Was the study described as being double blind (1= yes; 0= no)?<BR/>(3) Was there a description of withdrawals and dropouts (1= yes; 0= no)?<BR/>(4) Was the method of randomisation well described and appropriate (1= yes; 0= no)?<BR/>(5) Was the method of double blinding well described and appropriate (1= yes; 0= no)?<BR/>(6) Deduct 1 point if methods for randomisation or blinding were inappropriate.</P>
<P>In addition each study was assessed for the reliability of the diagnosis of sarcoidosis using pre-specified criteria agreed between the reviewers (Such as clinical presentation, radiology, serum ACE, BAL, histology).</P>
<P>Data for each trial were extracted by one of the reviewers and checked by the second author. For those studies where verification could not be obtained, a third independent reviewer was used.</P>
<P>STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS</P>
<P>It was anticipated that data were available for most of the therapies described above. Data from trials examining different drugs were analysed separately. Sensitivity analysis based on study quality was to have been performed if studies were combined. Tests for heterogeneity could not be carried out, but should future studies be incorporated resulting in significant heterogeneity, this will be explored where appropriate. Planned sub-group analyses were:</P>
<P>1. Ethnic background<BR/>2. Stage of lung disease as defined radiographically<BR/>3. Immunosuppressants vs placebo or Immunosuppressants vs corticosteroids<BR/>4. In studies that examined oral corticosteroid-sparing effects of the treatment, we will categorise trials into those that carried out prior oral corticosteroid down-titration and those that did not.</P>
<P>No sub-group analysis was possible as no combined studies could be carried out.</P>
<P>Clinical investigators were contacted for unpublished data. Only clarification of trial methodologies were made available.</P>

<P>An updated electronic search conducted in April 2006 identified 502 references. Of these two were retrieved. Both of these referred to the same clinical trial which met the entry criteria of the review (<LINK REF="STD-Manganiello-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Manganiello 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Five studies were included in the review (<LINK REF="STD-BTA-1967" TYPE="STUDY">BTA 1967</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wyser-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wyser 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Baltzan-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Baltzan 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Baughman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Baughman 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Manganiello-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Manganiello 2005</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Participants</HEADING>
<P>A total of 164 participants were recruited to the studies. The sample sizes ranged from 24 (<LINK REF="STD-Baughman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Baughman 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Baltzan-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Baltzan 1999</LINK>) to 52 (<LINK REF="STD-BTA-1967" TYPE="STUDY">BTA 1967</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-BTA-1967" TYPE="STUDY">BTA 1967</LINK>, pulmonary sarcoidosis was diagnosed on the basis of chest x-ray and symptoms. In the remaining studies, the diagnosis of pulmonary sarcoidosis was confirmed by histology. The age of the study population was not reported in <LINK REF="STD-Manganiello-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Manganiello 2005</LINK>.

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Interventions, comparisons and study duration</HEADING>
<P>Four different treatments were assessed in the five studies. <LINK REF="STD-Baltzan-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Baltzan 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-BTA-1967" TYPE="STUDY">BTA 1967</LINK> assessed chloroquine, <LINK REF="STD-Baughman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Baughman 2000</LINK> studied methotrexate, <LINK REF="STD-Manganiello-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Manganiello 2005</LINK> trialed pentoxifylline, all of which compared active treatment with placebo. <LINK REF="STD-Wyser-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wyser 1997</LINK> conducted a study of cyclosporin A but there was no placebo group. In three of the studies the participants recruited were taking corticosteroids. The process by which corticosteroids were reduced in <LINK REF="STD-Manganiello-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Manganiello 2005</LINK> was not reported. <LINK REF="STD-Baughman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Baughman 2000</LINK> tapered corticosteroids on the basis of disease control. Participants in both treatment groups had received 40 mg of prednisone per day for up to 4 weeks prior to enrolment in the study. Following randomisation to additional methotrexate or placebo their dose of prednisone was altered according to a specific protocol: if the disease was worsening, the dose of prednisone was doubled. If patients improved or were stable on two consecutive visits the dose was halved. If participants were stable on one visit but had side effects, the dose was halved. Dose alteration was agreed between participant and physician. <LINK REF="STD-Wyser-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wyser 1997</LINK> reduced the dose of prednisone in both groups by equal amounts over the course of the study. <LINK REF="STD-Baltzan-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Baltzan 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-BTA-1967" TYPE="STUDY">BTA 1967</LINK> assessed chloroquine without concomitant corticosteroid therapy.</P>
<P>Study duration varied between the studies. <LINK REF="STD-BTA-1967" TYPE="STUDY">BTA 1967</LINK> was 4 months in duration (two different doses of chloroquine were given to the actively treated group: 600 and 400 mg/d for the first and second set of 8 weeks). <LINK REF="STD-Baltzan-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Baltzan 1999</LINK> randomised participants after an extensive run-in phase in which the study drug was given at a dose of 750 mg/day for two months and subsequently reduced by 250 mg at two monthly intervals thereafter.

The follow-up period was 19.7 months +/- 11.2 (range 6-48 months). <LINK REF="STD-Wyser-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wyser 1997</LINK> altered prednisone dosage, starting at 20 mg/day for 3 months followed by 15 mg/day for 3 months, and then maintained at 10 mg for up to 18 months. <LINK REF="STD-Manganiello-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Manganiello 2005</LINK> was of 24 weeks duration, and <LINK REF="STD-Baughman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Baughman 2000</LINK> was of 52 weeks duration.</P>

</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>The overall quality of the studies was mixed. Details of intervention varied between studies, with two studies (<LINK REF="STD-BTA-1967" TYPE="STUDY">BTA 1967</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Baughman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Baughman 2000</LINK>) indicating that the placebo intervention was identical to the active arm. <LINK REF="STD-Baltzan-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Baltzan 1999</LINK> gave no indication that placebo presentation was identical.

There were slight differences in lung function at baseline (largely due to the differences between participants' ages across the two groups. Please refer to graphs on p 266 and 268 of the original paper). During the first four months of the study, mean FEV1 and FVC increased in the treatment group. FVC continued to rise but FEV1 decreased to pre-treatment levels by the end of the study. In the control group, the values for FEV1 and FVC remained constant.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-07-28 12:20:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Immunosuppressive and cytotoxic drugs are given to patients with severe, multisystem sarcoidosis (particularly neurosarcoidosis) and chronic sarcoidosis (more than 2 years duration). They are also used when there is no response to corticosteroids with progressive deterioration (this occurs in 2-8%) and when there are severe side effects due to corticosteroids (as steroid-sparing agents).</P>
<P>Randomised controlled trial evidence supporting the use of these drugs is limited. Most of the published data is anecdotal with observations made on small numbers of patients. These drugs are often prescribed as a last ditch attempt in severe cases. However, these drugs have severe side effects and require close monitoring so it is important to look at the evidence for their efficacy carefully.</P>
<P>Methotrexate is a folic acid antagonist and has been used for cardiac, pulmonary, central nervous system, and skin sarcoidosis. <LINK REF="STD-Baughman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Baughman 2000</LINK> has conducted the only RCT to date using methotrexate and has shown that the group using methotrexate required significantly less corticosteroids than the control group after 12 months of treatment. However, participants on placebo were also able to reduce steroid consumption. There was no difference between the methotrexate group and the control group in lung function, CXR, symptoms or side effects.</P>
<P>The findings of <LINK REF="STD-Manganiello-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Manganiello 2005</LINK> indicate that steroid usage was lower in those treated with pentoxifylline a TNF inhibitor. Whilst recurrence was also lower in the treatment group than with placebo, the frequency of reported side-effects indicate that evidence from long-term studies assessing both its efficacy and tolerability are required before recommendations can be made.</P>
<P>There has only been one RCT looking at the efficacy of Cyclosporine A in progressive pulmonary sarcoidosis. <LINK REF="STD-Wyser-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wyser 1997</LINK> could show no benefit in the group treated with cyclosporine and prednisone compared to those treated with prednisone alone, and more adverse events were observed.</P>
<P>Two RCTs have looked at the role of chloroquine and have found little evidence for their efficacy in pulmonary sarcoidosis. <LINK REF="STD-Baltzan-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Baltzan 1999</LINK> found that chloroquine reduced the decline rate in FEV1 and DLCO over a 20 month period but this was not found in the BTA study.</P>
<P>The BTA study compared CXR at different time points using a dual-physician scored CXR scale but found no difference between the treated and control groups at 12 months. There was also no improvement in dyspnoea at 12 months but an extensive list of side effects were observed in the group treated with chloroquine.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Methodological Limitations</HEADING>
<P>In spite of extensive literature searches, this systematic review has only been able to identify five small trials. Differences in treatment or outcome prevented us from combining estimates from these studies. Efficacy was defined as regression of the disease (for example, improvement in lung function), no deterioration in the disease with reduction in the maintenance dose of corticosteroids. There were only five RCTs. Two of them looked at hydroxychloroquine and the other two methotrexate and cyclosporine A. It was therefore not possible to combine data for meta-analysis. No sub-group analysis was possible. There was no long-term follow up data available.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Pulmonary sarcoidosis is characterised by an unpredictable course with some patients showing spontaneous resolution while others progress to lung fibrosis. Extrapulmonary sarcoidosis can run a chronic relentless course requiring treatment with high doses of corticosteroids and other drugs for several years with potentially severe side effects. There is some RCT evidence currently that cytotoxic and immunosuppressive agents are beneficial in pulmonary sarcoidosis. The evidence is best for a therapeutic effect of methotrexate as a steroid sparing agent. Many potentially life-threatening adverse events are associated with many of these drugs. Therefore, the use of these agents cannot currently be recommended.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There is clearly a need for RCTs looking at the role of several of these agents in sarcoidosis with a reasonable length of follow up. The newer agents now available, such as infliximab and thalidomide have shown some promise in several case reports but require proper evaluation. They may have a less severe side effect profile than the older more cytotoxic drugs. In order to recruit sufficient numbers of patients it will have to be a multi-centre project. Outcome measures used must include a well-validated symptom score, measurement of lung function and CXR. Patients who withdraw or dropout should be accounted for and followed up. The side effects must be well documented.</P>
