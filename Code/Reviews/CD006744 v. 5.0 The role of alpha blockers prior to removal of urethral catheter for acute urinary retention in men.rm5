<P>
<B>
<I>Background on the condition</I>
</B>
</P>
<P>Acute urinary retention in men is a medical emergency characterised by the sudden and often painful inability to pass urine. There are many known causes including prostate obstruction (because of enlargement of the prostate or cancer), urethral strictures (a narrowing of the urethra due to scar tissue), urine infection, constipation and neurological conditions. A narrow drainage tube (urinary catheter) is temporarily inserted into the bladder through the penis to allow drainage of urine. Once the catheter is removed, some men fail to pass urine again and need to be re-catheterised. In these men, continued use of catheters or prostate surgery are the standard treatment options. Catheters are associated with risks such as infection and can harm quality of life. Measures for increasing the rate of successful catheter removal, that is, enabling patients to urinate spontaneously again, are therefore potentially beneficial. Alpha blockers (for example tamsulosin, alfuzosin) are a group of drugs known to have positive effects on urinary symptoms such as poor urinary flow. It is believed that their relaxing effect on the prostate may also increase the chance to void again after catheter removal. This review evaluated the evidence available to support this practice.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>The main findings of the review </I>
</B>
</P>
<P>In nine clinical trials men were either given a dummy tablet (placebo, inactive drug), an alpha blocker for one to three days (in one study up to a maximum of eight days and in another for 32 days) or no treatment before the catheter was removed. In ideal circumstances, neither patients nor doctors knew which type of tablet was given, to prevent the bias in reporting the results. The results suggested that alpha blocker treatment increased the chances of successful catheter removal and return to urination although the overall scientific evidence available to support this was limited. Four different alpha blockers were tested (alfuzosin, tamsulosin, doxazosin and silodosin). Their results were similar except for doxazosin which did not seem to make a significant difference.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Adverse effects</I>
</B>
</P>
<P>Side effects caused by alpha blockers were few and comparable to placebo or no treatment, though this evidence was limited. They included retrograde ejaculation, dizziness, low blood pressure, fainting, sleepiness, feeling unwell and headache.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Conclusions</I>
</B>
</P>
<P>There was some evidence to say that alpha blockers also reduce the risk of suffering another (recurrent) episode of urinary retention after successful catheter removal, though it remains unclear whether they reduce the need for future surgery on the prostate. It is therefore unclear whether, or for how long, alpha blocker treatment should be continued after successful catheter removal and whether the costs of alpha blocker treatment in such situations are justified. Further research is needed to answer these questions.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-01-15 14:33:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Acute urinary retention is a urological emergency in men and requires urgent catheterisation. Any intervention which aims at improving urinary symptoms following an acute urinary retention episode could be potentially beneficial. Alpha blockers relax prostatic smooth muscle cells thereby decreasing the resistance to urinary flow and by doing so could improve urinary symptoms.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-01-15 14:46:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess the effectiveness of alpha blockers on successful resumption of micturition following removal of a urethral urinary catheter after an episode of acute urinary retention in men. In the absence of internationally agreed outcome measures for the success of a trial without catheter, success was defined as the return to satisfactory voiding without need for re-catheterisation within 24 hours.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-03-25 15:25:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Trials Register, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE in process, and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings (searched 9 October 2013), CENTRAL (2013, Issue 5) (searched 5 June 2013), MEDLINE 1946 to May Week 4 2013, MEDLINE in Process (covering to 3 June 2013), EMBASE Classic and EMBASE 1947 to 2013 Week 22 (all searched 4 June 2013) and the reference lists of relevant articles. No language or other restrictions were imposed on the searches.</P>

<P>Only randomised and quasi-randomised clinical trials of alpha blockers for trial without a urethral catheter following an episode of acute urinary retention in men were included.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-06-05 08:57:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently examined all the citations and abstracts derived from the search strategy. Any disagreement about trial selection and inclusion was resolved by discussion. A third independent judgement was sought where disagreement persisted. Two review authors extracted independently, cross-checked and processed the data as described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Intervention</I>. Quality of evidence of the critical outcomes was assessed by adopting the GRADE approach.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-09-10 12:39:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nine randomised clinical trials were included in this review. Eight trials compared alpha blockers versus placebo (five trials tested alfuzosin and two trials tested tamsulosin, one trial tested both alfuzosin and tamsulosin, one trial tested silodosin) and one trial compared an alpha blocker (doxazosin) versus no treatment. Trial without catheter was performed after treatment with the drug for one to three days in seven trials and for eight and 32 days in two other trials respectively. There was moderate quality evidence to suggest that the rate of successful trial without catheter favoured alpha blockers over placebo ( 366/608, 60.2%, of men using an alpha blocker were able to void spontaneously after catheter removal compared with 185/486, 38.1%, using placebo, risk ratio (RR) 1.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.36 to 1.76). The incidence of recurrent acute urinary retention was lower in groups treated with an alpha blocker (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.79). This evidence was of moderate quality and was statistically significant for alfuzosin, tamsulosin and silodosin, though not for doxazosin. Of the trials mentioning adverse effects (for example, postural hypotension, dizziness), there was not enough information to detect statistically significant differences between the groups (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.89) and the evidence was of low quality. Overall, adverse effect rates were low for both placebo and alpha blockers and, for example, vasodilatation-related adverse effects did not often result in discontinuation. However, the data in this review are limited due to the large amount of unpublished data that was not available to us.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-01-15 14:45:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There was some evidence to suggest that alpha blockers increase the success rates of trial without catheter, and the incidence of adverse effects was low. There was some evidence of a decreased incidence of acute urinary retention. The need for further surgery, cost effectiveness and recommended duration of alpha blocker treatment after successful trial without catheter remain unknown as these were not reported by any trial. There is a lack of internationally agreed outcome measures for what constitutes successful trial without catheter. This makes meta-analysis difficult. Large, well-designed controlled trials, which use the recommendations set out in the CONSORT statement, and include clinically important outcome measures, are required.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-06-05 08:58:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>According to International Continence Society, urinary retention is defined as the inability to pass urine despite persistent effort (<LINK REF="REF-Haylen-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haylen 2010</LINK>). Acute urinary retention in men is a urological emergency. It is characterised by a sudden and often very painful inability to pass urine. The standard first-line management is bladder catheterisation (insertion of a drainage tube into the bladder). Reported incidence rates of acute urinary retention vary from 0.4% to 25% per year in men seen in urological practice every year (<LINK REF="REF-Schulman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulman 2001</LINK>). One large US cohort study estimated the risk of a retention episode at 23% for a 60-year old male if he lived for another 20 years (<LINK REF="REF-Jacobsen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobsen 1997</LINK>). The incidence of acute urinary retention in the overall male population is low. It increases with age and various studies have reported incidence rates ranging from 2.2 to 6.8 out of 1000 man-years in the general male population (<LINK REF="REF-Jacobsen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobsen 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meigs-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meigs 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Temml-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Temml 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Verhamme-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verhamme 2005</LINK>). This rises to 17 to 25 in 1000 man-years in men with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) presumed secondary to benign prostatic enlargement (BPE) (<LINK REF="REF-Barry-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barry 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McConnell-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">McConnell 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roerborn-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roerborn 2000</LINK>). It has been claimed that emergency admissions due to retention have a larger adverse impact on patients' health-related quality of life than emergency admissions for renal colic or elective admission for surgery for LUTS or BPE. This is mainly due to the higher number of investigations and recurrent emergency attendances in the acute urinary retention group compared to the other two groups (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The causes of acute urinary retention can be classified into three categories. The first one is characterised by any condition that causes an increased resistance to urinary flow (for example, BPE, bladder neck stenosis, urethral stricture). The second category is characterised by weakness of the detrusor muscle or interruption of the sensory bladder innervation (for example, spinal cord injuries, neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis). The third category is caused by any event leading to bladder overdistention (for example, following surgery or as a side effect of drug treatment) (<LINK REF="REF-Emberton-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emberton 1999</LINK>). Retention is also commonly associated with urinary tract infection.</P>
<P>The definitive treatment depends on the underlying cause. The principal aim of treatment is to restore spontaneous voiding without the need for re-catheterisation and, by doing so, avoiding the risk of catheter-related complications (such as causing a false urethral passage, infection, pain, haematuria (blood in the urine), urethral stricture formation) and worsening renal function (acute or chronic renal failure) to improve quality of life. Catheters are either introduced by the transurethral or suprapubic route and can be used short term, long term or intermittently.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-05-23 09:48:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are three approaches to treatment once symptoms have been controlled by bladder catheterisation. </P>
<OL>
<LI>The first is early surgery, such as transurethral resection of the prostate, within a few days or semi-elective within a few weeks of the first episode of retention. Surgery carries the risk of bleeding, infection, retrograde ejaculation, erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence, treatment failure and recurrence of lower urinary tract symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Omar-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Omar 2014</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>The second approach is long-term catheterisation, using either an in-dwelling transurethral or suprapubic catheter, or intermittent catheterisation. This approach has disadvantages such as urinary tract infection (<LINK REF="REF-Ni_x00eb_l_x002d_Weise-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Niël-Weise 2005</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>The third option is to remove the catheter again to see whether normal micturition resumes, a trial without catheter (TWOC). This can be done in an ambulant or in-patient hospital setting.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Success rates reported for TWOC in observational studies range from 23% to 28% (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taube-1989a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taube 1989a</LINK>). Failure requires re-catheterisation and re-assessment of future management options, such as prostate surgery or long-term catheterisation. There are advantages both for the patient and healthcare system from a successful trial period without a catheter. Apart from not having to spend time with a catheter at home, successful resumption of voiding could mean delaying or ideally avoiding the need for surgery. It has also been shown that surgery, where necessary, is safer in the absence of an indwelling catheter (<LINK REF="REF-Pickard-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pickard 1998</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-06-05 08:58:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Any intervention which aims to increase the rate of successful TWOC following an acute urinary retention episode is considered potentially beneficial. Alpha1-adrenoreceptors are highly prevalent in the prostate and bladder neck (<LINK REF="REF-Caine-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caine 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Caine-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caine 1987</LINK>). The principle behind the use of alpha1-adrenoreceptor antagonists (alpha1 blockers) is that they reduce prostatic smooth muscle tonus and thus resistance to urinary flow (<LINK REF="REF-Fulton-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fulton 1995</LINK>). This should result in an improvement of urinary symptoms. Caine and colleagues suggested that alpha blockers could improve the chances of successful TWOC, assuming there is adequate detrusor function (<LINK REF="REF-Caine-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caine 1976</LINK>). However, their wide use at that time was restricted mainly because of cardiovascular side effects. Functionally more uroselective agents have been developed. Alpha1 blockers such as alfuzosin, doxazosin, indoramin, prazosin, silodosin, tamsulosin and terazosin are commonly used as first-line treatment for lower urinary tract symptoms associated with BPE.</P>
<P>Despite their greater selectivity, alpha1 blockers can still interact with many other drugs. Their main pharmacological adverse effect, apart from retrograde ejaculation, remains an additive or enhancing hypotensive effect especially when used with other antihypertensive drugs. Known adverse effects include drowsiness, (postural) hypotension, syncope, asthenia, depression, headache, dry mouth, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation (gastro-intestinal disturbances), oedema, blurred vision, rhinitis, erectile disorders (including priapism), tachycardia and palpitations. They should, therefore, be avoided in patients with a history of postural hypotension and micturition syncope. Patients on antihypertensive treatment may require reduced dosage. Alpha blockers are also associated with hypersensitivity reactions including rash, pruritus and angioedema. Caution is advised in elderly patients and those with hepatic or severe renal impairment. Caution is also in elderly people undergoing cataract surgery as there is risk of intra-operative floppy iris syndrome (most strongly associated with tamsulosin) (<LINK REF="REF-BNF-December-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF December 2013</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Quality of evidence</HEADING>
<P>The quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2013a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2013b</LINK>). The following five domains were assessed for evaluating the quality of evidence.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Limitations of study design</LI>
<LI>Inconsistency of results</LI>
<LI>Indirectness of evidence</LI>
<LI>Imprecision of measurements</LI>
<LI>Publication bias</LI>
</OL>
<P>The primary outcomes listed above were categorised as 'critical' for decision-making from the male patient's perspective: the remaining secondary outcomes were categorised as 'important' or 'not important'. Evidence related to outcomes deemed 'critical' was then rated as high, moderate, low or very low quality. This rating indicates confidence in the accuracy of the measured effect of intervention compared to the true effect. The quality of evidence was downgraded if the randomisation process (random sequence generation and allocation concealment) of the trial was considered to be inadequate and/or if the effect estimate crossed the line of 'no effect' on either side by 25% or 50% (i.e. an effect estimate with a wide confidence interval). Further reasons to downgrade were if findings between trials were inconsistent or if trials measured outcomes not directly corresponding to the pre-specified review outcomes. Publication bias was only assessed if there were 10 or more trials. The GRADE working group recommended including up to seven critical outcomes in a systematic review. Quality of evidence was assessed for all primary outcomes if reported (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2013a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2013b</LINK>).</P>

<P>Only randomised or quasi-randomised trials were included in this systematic review. Two review authors (EF and MO) independently examined all the citations and abstracts derived from the search strategy. Full reports of potentially relevant trials were then retrieved and examined independently for eligibility in the same manner. Review authors were not blinded to the names of the trials' authors, institutions or the journals. We contacted authors of trials under consideration for additional information when required. Trials in languages other than English were translated as appropriate. Any disagreement about trial selection and inclusion was resolved by discussion. An independent judgment was sought where disagreement persisted. Excluded studies considered formally for this review were also listed along with reasons for their exclusion. Studies were excluded from the review if they were not randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials of treatment with alpha blockers for urinary retention, or if they made comparisons other than those pre-specified.

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2014-06-05 08:59:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The analyses in this systematic review were based upon available data from all included trials relevant to the comparisons and outcomes being studied. When trials were reported in multiple publications, only the most current or complete data were included for each outcome. When appropriate, meta-analysis was performed using a fixed-effect model for calculation of pooled estimates and their 95% confidence intervals (CI).</P>
<P>For categorical outcomes, the number of participants reporting an outcome was related to the number at risk in each group to derive the risk ratio (RR). If continuous variables had been identified, we planned to use the mean and standard deviation to derive a mean difference. For similar outcomes reported using different scales, the standard mean difference (SMD) would have been calculated. When data used to calculate RRs were unavailable, the most detailed available numerical data were used to calculate actual numbers or mean and standard deviations (e.g. P values). Differences between trials were further investigated when significant heterogeneity was found or appeared obvious from visual inspection of the results.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2014-06-05 09:03:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This systematic review suggests that some alpha blockers may help men by increasing the rate of successful trial without catheter (TWOC) after an acute urinary retention episode. However, the current evidence is limited in terms of the number of trials and participants. A major limitation of this review is the lack of standardisation of the definition of a successful TWOC. When is a TWOC considered successful? Does it depend on maximum flow rate, residual volume, or both? Or is it simply no need for re-catheterisation within 24 hours? Does re-catheterisation after two or three days following a successful TWOC constitute a failed trial or is it recurrent urinary retention, that is a new event?</P>
<P>Costs and cost effectiveness of alpha blocker treatment is important for both patients and healthcare providers. It would probably make little sense if alpha blockers only delayed prostate surgery for a few months, with the added cost and distress of going back into retention. Because this outcome was not reported in the trials, this review was unable to answer whether alpha blockers before catheter removal are cost effective in this clinical scenario. A few trials tried to address these issues but we could not assess the information as part of a meta-analysis because men had been treated both with the active drug and a placebo. A review of the literature showed one retrospective study from Belgium that evaluated costs for the first six months after a failed TWOC following a first episode of acute urinary retention (<LINK REF="REF-Lamotte-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lamotte 2005</LINK>). No alpha blockers were used in the study, which came to the conclusion that delayed transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) during a subsequent or scheduled hospitalisation was less expensive compared to TURP performed during the initial emergency hospital admission.</P>
<P>A follow-on study to <LINK REF="STD-McNeill-2005" TYPE="STUDY">McNeill 2005</LINK> examined whether use of alfuzosin during hospitalisation for acute urinary retention and for six months after successful TWOC was cost effective compared to placebo and immediate prostatectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Annemans-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Annemans 2005</LINK>). Alfuzosin treatment was associated with a lower rate of prostatectomy after hospital discharge following successful TWOC. Alfuzosin treatment generated cost savings of £349 relative to placebo and £892 relative to immediate prostatectomy (both statistically significant, P &lt; 0.05). However, this is limited evidence considering the possible implications of this important issue.</P>
<P>Another unanswered question is how long alpha blockers should be continued after successful TWOC? If future trials reporting on longer-term outcomes suggest that most men on alpha blockers end up having prostate surgery within one year, then this could lead to a change in management strategy where men could be listed for prostate surgery regardless of a successful TWOC. In order to answer these questions, rigorous well-designed randomised controlled trials, which use the recommendations set out in the CONSORT statement and reporting all critical outcomes, are required.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-06-05 09:03:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The critical outcomes were assessed using the GRADE approach. There was moderate quality evidence that alpha blockers increase success rates of a trial without a catheter. There was low quality evidence that alpha blockers may reduce the risk of recurrent urinary retention. There was insufficient evidence to determine whether the use of alpha blockers reduces the need for prostatic surgery. The effects on QoL, cost effectiveness and recommended duration of alpha blocker treatment after successful trial without catheter remain unknown, as these outcomes were not reported.</P>

Other trials reported need for re-catheterisation as a TWOC failure endpoint (<LINK REF="STD-Agrawal-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Agrawal 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kumar-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Kumar 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lucas-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lucas 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McNeill-1999" TYPE="STUDY">McNeill 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McNeill-2005" TYPE="STUDY">McNeill 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prieto-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Prieto 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shah-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Shah 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tiong-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Tiong 2009</LINK>).

<P>A condition-specific quality of life measure (IPSS score) was also reported by two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Kumar-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Kumar 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McNeill-2005" TYPE="STUDY">McNeill 2005</LINK>) but the data were only reported in men who had had a successful TWOC, so were not relevant to a comparison between the groups.

However, the data in this review are limited due to the large amount of unpublished data that was not available to us (<LINK REF="REF-Ramirez-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramirez 2014</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-06-05 09:03:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is an urgent need for standardisation of the definition of what constitutes a successful TWOC for future studies. More randomised controlled trials are needed to assess whether alpha blocker treatment is beneficial for successful TWOC, prevents recurrent urinary retention and whether it reduces the need for prostatic surgery. Furthermore, long-term follow-up studies in which patients with successful TWOC are maintained on the allocated intervention are needed to determine if they are worthwhile in the longer term. Other questions to be answered are cost effectiveness and the duration of alpha blocker treatment after TWOC.</P>
<P>As the majority of the identified trails were single centred, therefore, future trials should be large, adequately powered and multi-centred. The trials should include outcomes which are critical from patients' perspective and which should also abide by the principles and recommendations of the CONSORT guideline.</P>

<P>Dear Professor Ramirez,</P>
<P>Thank you for your feedback. In this systematic review, the number of people with adverse effects due to alpha blockers was reported in <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>. The results were not statistically significant (Risk Ratio 1.19; 95% Confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to 1.89), and had a wide confidence interval. Forty-one out of 649 in the treatment group and 22/415 in the control group reported adverse effects. The number of people with serious adverse effects due to alpha blocker treatment was reported in <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>. These results were also not statistically significant (Risk Ratio 0.77; 95% CI 0.13 to 4.54), and only 3/238 in the treatment group reported serious adverse effects.</P>
<P>We also highlight within the abstract and plain language summary that alpha blockers are associated with adverse effects, specifically:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<I>&#8220;Of the trials mentioning adverse effects (for example, postural hypotension, dizziness), there was not enough information to detect statistically significant differences between the groups&#8221;</I>- <I>Abstract.</I>
</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>
<I>&#8220;Side effects caused by alpha blockers were few and comparable to placebo or no treatment, though this evidence was limited. They included retrograde ejaculation, dizziness, low blood pressure, fainting, sleepiness, feeling unwell and headache.&#8221;</I> &#8211; <I>Plain Language Summary</I>
</LI>
</UL>
<P>In your study we noticed that the incidence of hypotension for tamsulosin was 42.4 events per 10,000 person years. We think that this shows that the incidence of hypotension is indeed low. Out of 383,567 participants, 2562 admissions to hospital for severe hypotension were identified in your study (<LINK REF="REF-Bird-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bird 2013</LINK>). Moreover, in our review the use of alpha blockers was short term, covering only the period prior to removal urethral catheter. However, we note the large amount of unpublished evidence regarding tamsulosin (and probably other alpha blockers) and have added a caveat in the review to this effect (<LINK REF="REF-Ramirez-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramirez 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>&#8220;However, the data in this review are limited due to the large amount of unpublished data that was not available to us&#8221; (<LINK REF="REF-Ramirez-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramirez 2014</LINK>)</P>
