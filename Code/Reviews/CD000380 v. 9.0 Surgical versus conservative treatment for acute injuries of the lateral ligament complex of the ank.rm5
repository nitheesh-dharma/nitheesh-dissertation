<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Surgery versus conservative treatment for acute ankle sprains in adults</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Ankle sprain is one of the commonest musculoskeletal injuries in active people. It generally involves damage to the lateral or outer ligaments, which connect bones together on the outside of the ankle joint. Treatment is usually either immobilisation of the leg in a plaster cast, or 'functional treatment' where the ankle is kept in use while protected by an external support. After treatment, however, some people still have a weak and sometimes painful ankle. This review aimed to find out if primary surgical repair of the torn ligament(s) gives a better result than either of these two non-surgical or conservative treatments. </P>
<P>Twenty trials were included. These involved a total of 2562 mostly young active adult males. All trials had methodological flaws that could have affected their results. Data for pooling individual outcomes were only available for a maximum of 12 trials. Additionally, there was one low quality and potentially biased trial with very positive results in favour of surgery. When this trial was excluded, the findings of better results for surgery in terms of return to sports, re-injury, persistent pain and ankle instability as judged by the patient were no longer statistically significant. Thus, the trend to a better result from surgery remains unproven. Ankle stability, as judged by the clinician using standard tests, was better after surgery than with conservative treatment. Conversely, there was some limited evidence for longer recovery times, and higher incidences of ankle stiffness, impaired ankle mobility and complications in the surgical treatment group.</P>
<P>We concluded that there was not enough evidence from randomised controlled trials to say whether surgery gives a better result than conservative treatment for acute ankle sprain in adults.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Ankle sprains are one of the most commonly treated musculoskeletal injuries. The three main treatment modalities for acute lateral ankle ligament injuries are immobilisation with plaster cast or splint, 'functional treatment' comprising early mobilisation and use of an external support (e.g. ankle brace), and surgical repair or reconstruction.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>We aimed to compare surgical versus conservative treatment for acute injuries of the lateral ligament complex of the ankle in adults.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (January 2006), the Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2005, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to December 2005), EMBASE, CINAHL and reference lists of articles, and contacted researchers in the field. This review is considered updated to January 2006.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing surgical with conservative interventions for treating ankle sprains in adults.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>At least two authors independently assessed methodological quality and extracted data. Where appropriate, results of comparable studies were pooled. We performed sensitivity analyses to explore the robustness of the findings.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Twenty trials were included. These involved a total of 2562 mostly young active adult males. All trials had methodological weaknesses. Specifically, concealment of allocation was confirmed in only one trial. Data for pooling individual outcomes were only available for a maximum of 12 trials and under 60% of participants.</P>
<P>The findings of statistically significant differences in favour of the surgical treatment group for the four primary outcomes (non-return to pre-injury level of sports; ankle sprain recurrence; long-term pain; subjective or functional instability) when using the fixed-effect model were not robust when using the random-effects model, nor on the removal of one low quality (quasi-randomised) trial that had more extreme results. A corresponding drop in the I statistics showed the remaining trials to be more homogeneous. </P>
<P>The functional implications of the statistically significantly higher incidence of objective instability in conservatively treated trial participants are uncertain. There was some limited evidence for longer recovery times, and higher incidences of ankle stiffness, impaired ankle mobility and complications in the surgical treatment group.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is insufficient evidence available from randomised controlled trials to determine the relative effectiveness of surgical and conservative treatment for acute injuries of the lateral ligament complex of the ankle. High quality randomised controlled trials of primary surgical repair versus the best available conservative treatment for well-defined injuries are required.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-08-12 17:52:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>Inversion injuries, primarily sprains, of the ankle are one of the most commonly treated musculoskeletal injuries. In the UK, approximately one person in every 10,000 is treated for an ankle injury each day (<LINK REF="REF-Kannus-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kannus 1991</LINK>). In people with a sedentary lifestyle such injuries may be less disruptive; however, in athletes and those whose work is more demanding physically, such injuries may have an important life-long effect. Some sports (e.g. basketball, soccer and volleyball) have a very high incidence of ankle injuries. Overall, ankle sprains make up about 10% to 15% of sports-related injuries (<LINK REF="REF-MacAuley-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacAuley 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The most common mechanism of injury is internal rotation (inversion) of the plantarflexed foot (toes on ground and heel up). Injury occurs to the anterior talo-fibular ligament first, followed to a varying degree by injury to the calcaneofibular ligament. The posterior talofibular ligament is usually uninjured unless there is a frank dislocation of the ankle. Together, these lateral ligaments, which connect bones together on the outside of the ankle joint, form the lateral ligament complex.</P>
<P>Traditionally, lateral ligament injuries are graded I to III. Grade I (mild) represents a stretch, II (moderate) represents a partial tear, and III (severe) represents a complete tear (<LINK REF="REF-Kannus-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kannus 1991</LINK>). Practically, this gradation may be considered as purely theoretical, because it has no therapeutic or prognostic consequences (<LINK REF="REF-De-Bie-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Bie 2002</LINK>). Most injuries resolve; however, some people may suffer from chronic functional instability of the ankle joint. Persistent ligament laxity can present as both subjective (giving way) and objective instability (anterior drawer-talar tilt) and lead to chronic functional instability of the ankle joint. When the duration of functional instability of the ankle joint exceeds six months it is considered chronic and a ligament reconstruction may be considered (<LINK REF="REF-De-Vries-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Vries 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The diagnosis of this injury is made following a delayed physical examination four to seven days after trauma (<LINK REF="REF-Klenerman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klenerman 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Dijk-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Dijk 1996</LINK>) and by exclusion of a fracture. The Ottawa Ankle Rule is a decision rule increasingly used to save unnecessary X-ray investigation (<LINK REF="REF-Stiell-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stiell 1994</LINK>). A variety of treatments for acute lateral ankle ligament injuries without fracture are used, with the three main modalities being:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Immobilisation with plaster cast or splint;</LI>
<LI>Functional treatment; this is an early mobilisation programme and involves the use of an external support;</LI>
<LI>Operative treatment.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Kannus and Renstrom (<LINK REF="REF-Kannus-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kannus 1991</LINK>) in their narrative review of Grade III ankle injuries compared operation, cast, or early controlled mobilisation and identified 12 clinical trials in the English literature. In a comprehensive narrative review of treatment modalities for soft tissue injuries of the ankle (<LINK REF="REF-Ogilvie_x002d_Harris-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ogilvie-Harris 1995</LINK>), 58 RCTs were identified of which 18 compared pharmacological interventions, 12 surgical repair, 12 active mobilisation, three cryotherapy, five diathermy, and a further eight compared other modalities including three studies of ultrasound. A more recent systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Pijnenburg-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pijnenburg 2000</LINK>) summarised the results of 27 RCTs, comparing operation, cast, functional treatment and minimal treatment. The authors concluded that primary operative repair led to better results; however, they also questioned whether it should be the treatment of choice given the risk of surgical complications and increased costs. <LINK REF="REF-Pijnenburg-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pijnenburg 2000</LINK> based results on three outcomes: time lost from work, residual pain and giving-way. Their assessment of trial quality was based on three criteria: the method of randomisation, assessor blinding and intention-to-treat analysis. The current review is restricted to trials which compare surgery with conservative interventions for acute ankle sprains, includes other clinically important outcomes and considers other aspects of trial methodology.</P>
<P>Three other Cochrane reviews on the treatment of ankle sprains are now available. Two (<LINK REF="REF-Kerkhoffs-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kerkhoffs 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kerkhoffs-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kerkhoffs 2002b</LINK>) compare conservative interventions involving immobilisation and functional treatment strategies respectively, and one (<LINK REF="REF-Van-der-Windt-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van der Windt 1999</LINK>) evaluates the use of ultrasound.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this review is to examine the evidence from randomised and quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials comparing surgery versus conservative (non-operative) treatments for the management of acute injuries of the lateral ligament complex of the ankle. The main focus is on skeletally mature individuals up to middle age. The relative effects of the two treatments are considered primarily in terms of the return to pre-injury level of activity; re-injury or recurrence; persistent pain; and subjective instability.</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Randomised or quasi-randomised (methods of allocating participants to a treatment which are not strictly random; e.g. date of birth, hospital record number or alternation) controlled trials comparing interventions, specified below, for the treatment of acute injuries to the lateral ligament complex of the ankle.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Adults with an acute injury of the lateral ligament complex of the ankle. Trials dealing exclusively with children (where growth plate injuries predominate) or participants with congenital deformities or degenerative conditions were excluded. Studies involving a mixed population of adults and children were eligible provided the proportion of children was clearly small (&lt; 10%).</P>
<P>Trials focusing on the treatment of chronic instability or post-surgical treatment were excluded. Patients with chronic instability have symptoms of pain, swelling, recurrent sprains and instability for longer than six months (<LINK REF="REF-Karlsson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karlsson 1997</LINK>). If studies included participants with chronic ankle sprains or other ankle injuries such as fractures, then results from these studies were included in the review provided such injuries were under 10% of the entire study population. </P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Surgical intervention could be either ligament repair or reconstruction followed by conservative modalities. The main conservative modalities involved either immobilisation, such as in a plaster cast, or functional treatment involving mobilisation and use of external ankle supports such as functional braces. Only trials comparing surgical with conservative treatment were included.</P>

<P>
<B>Selecting trials for inclusion</B>
<BR/>At least two authors independently assessed all identified trials for inclusion using the above criteria. Disagreement was resolved by discussion, with arbitration by a third author where differences remained.</P>
<P>
<B>Assessment of methodological quality</B>
<BR/>At least two authors independently assessed methodological quality via a piloted, subject-specific modification of the generic evaluation tool used by the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group. Titles of journals, names of authors or supporting institutions were not masked at any stage (<LINK REF="REF-Verhagen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verhagen 1998</LINK>). The 11 aspects of internal validity and external validity assessed are shown in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. From the first update of the review, the scores of individual items were no longer summed. Disagreement was resolved by discussion, followed if necessary by scrutiny from another author. Studies were also ranked by quality of allocation concealment (Cochrane score A, B or C).</P>
<P>
<B>Data collection</B>
<BR/>At least two authors independently extracted data using a piloted data extraction form. Disagreement was resolved as above. If necessary, we contacted trialists in order to complete the data extraction form and for further information on methodology.</P>
<P>
<B>Data synthesis</B>
<BR/>For each study, relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for dichotomous outcomes, and mean differences and 95% CIs for continuous outcomes. Where possible, the results of comparable groups of trials were pooled using both the fixed-effect and random-effects models. Heterogeneity between comparable trials was tested using the chi and I tests (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the effects of excluding the results of one outlier trial and trials where allocation was clearly not concealed. To test whether subgroups, split by the type of treatment (functional versus plaster cast) in the conservative treatment group, were statistically significantly different from one another, we tested the interaction using the technique described by <LINK REF="REF-Altman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 2003</LINK>.</P>

Of the remainder, 11 are excluded for reasons given in the 'Characteristics of excluded studies' table and one is in 'Studies awaiting assessment' pending the review selection procedure. Most of the 20 included studies were fully reported in medical journals. The report of one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Delfosse-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Delfosse 1994</LINK>) is only available as an abstract. The trials were initially identified in the following ways: Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group (2 trials); MEDLINE (7); bibliography checking (7 trials); and handsearching (4).</P>
<P>The publication dates of the trials span 38 years; <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1965</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Freeman-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 1965</LINK> being the earliest. The trials were conducted in one of the following 10 countries: Austria (1 trial), Belgium (1), Canada (1), Denmark (4), Finland (2), Germany (4), Italy (1), Netherlands (3), Norway (1), and the UK (2). Translations were obtained for two trials in Danish (<LINK REF="STD-Kolind_x002d_Sorensen-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Kolind-Sorensen 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Petersen-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Petersen 1985</LINK>), one in Finish (<LINK REF="STD-Hietaniemi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hietaniemi 1997</LINK>) and two in German (<LINK REF="STD-Eggert-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Eggert 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klein-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1988</LINK>); a translation of one of three reports in German of <LINK REF="STD-Zwipp-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Zwipp 1986</LINK> was also obtained.</P>
<P>The 20 included studies involved a total of 2562 mostly young active adult males. Where data were provided, the percentage of males ranged from 55% to 100%. Where provided, median or mean ages of trial populations ranged between 23 and 27 years. The youngest recorded participant was nine years old in <LINK REF="STD-Zwipp-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Zwipp 1986</LINK> and the oldest was 55 years in <LINK REF="STD-Povacz-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Povacz 1998</LINK>. Lower age limits were set by nine trials (<LINK REF="STD-Delfosse-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Delfosse 1994</LINK>: 16 years; <LINK REF="STD-Eggert-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Eggert 1986</LINK>: 12 years; <LINK REF="STD-Evans-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Evans 1984</LINK>: 16 years; <LINK REF="STD-Hietaniemi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hietaniemi 1997</LINK>: 18 years; <LINK REF="STD-Klein-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1988</LINK>: 16 years; <LINK REF="STD-Korkala-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Korkala 1987</LINK>: 15 years; <LINK REF="STD-Niedermann-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Niedermann 1981</LINK>: 12 years; <LINK REF="STD-Petersen-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Petersen 1985</LINK>: 15 years; <LINK REF="STD-Pijnenburg-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Pijnenburg 2003</LINK>: 18 years). However, the youngest participant in <LINK REF="STD-Pijnenburg-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Pijnenburg 2003</LINK> was 17 years. Though not easily quantifiable, only a small proportion of children were included in any trial; three trials specified that the epiphysis should be closed (<LINK REF="STD-Niedermann-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Niedermann 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Povacz-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Povacz 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Specchiulli-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Specchiulli 2001</LINK>). Upper age limits were set by 11 trials (<LINK REF="STD-Delfosse-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Delfosse 1994</LINK>: 35 years; <LINK REF="STD-Evans-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Evans 1984</LINK>: 35 years; <LINK REF="STD-Hietaniemi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hietaniemi 1997</LINK>: 30 years; <LINK REF="STD-Klein-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1988</LINK>: 40 years; <LINK REF="STD-Korkala-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Korkala 1987</LINK>: 50 years; <LINK REF="STD-Moller_x002d_Larsen-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Moller-Larsen 1988</LINK>: 50 years; <LINK REF="STD-Niedermann-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Niedermann 1981</LINK>: 50 years; <LINK REF="STD-Petersen-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Petersen 1985</LINK>: 50 years; <LINK REF="STD-Pijnenburg-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Pijnenburg 2003</LINK>: 45 years; <LINK REF="STD-Povacz-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Povacz 1998</LINK>: 40 years; <LINK REF="STD-Specchiulli-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Specchiulli 2001</LINK>: 40 years). </P>
<P>Injuries were generally reported to be acute or recent; some trials provided more tightly defined inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Hietaniemi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hietaniemi 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Pijnenburg-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Pijnenburg 2003</LINK>: within 2 days; <LINK REF="STD-Klein-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Povacz-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Povacz 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Specchiulli-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Specchiulli 2001</LINK>: within 24 hours). Diagnostic confirmation, using arthrography, stress radiographs and other objective measures of ligament rupture, was indicated in all but one study (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1965</LINK>); however, it is likely they were used in this trial as well.</P>
<P>Fourteen trials, with two treatment groups, compared surgical with conservative treatment: <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1965</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Delfosse-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Delfosse 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Evans-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Evans 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gronmark-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Gronmark 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hietaniemi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hietaniemi 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kolind_x002d_Sorensen-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Kolind-Sorensen 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klein-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Niedermann-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Niedermann 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Petersen-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Petersen 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pijnenburg-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Pijnenburg 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Povacz-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Povacz 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prins-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Prins 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sommer-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Sommer 1987</LINK>; and <LINK REF="STD-Specchiulli-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Specchiulli 2001</LINK>. Five trials compared three treatments. In four of these trials (<LINK REF="STD-Freeman-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 1965</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Korkala-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Korkala 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moller_x002d_Larsen-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Moller-Larsen 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Moppes-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Van Moppes 1982</LINK>) there was one surgical group, and in the other trial (<LINK REF="STD-Eggert-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Eggert 1986</LINK>) there were two treatment groups involving surgery. There were two surgical treatment groups and two conservative treatment groups in the remaining trial (<LINK REF="STD-Zwipp-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Zwipp 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>Where detailed, operative treatment involved surgical repair where the ruptured ends of the ligament were sutured together. No anatomic reconstruction was performed. Treatment following surgery was either identical or essentially the same as that provided to conservatively treated participants in one or more comparisons in 16 trials. Exceptions were four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Hietaniemi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hietaniemi 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Povacz-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Povacz 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sommer-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Sommer 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Specchiulli-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Specchiulli 2001</LINK>) where surgery was followed by cast immobilisation while conservatively treated participants were given functional treatment. Conservative treatment was not defined in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1965</LINK>), in which it was assumed to involve immobilisation for a similar length of time to the surgical treatment group.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2008-07-08 13:01:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All trials had methodological weaknesses as shown by the low scores for many of the individual items of methodological quality; see table below. In particular, concealment of allocation (item A) was confirmed in only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Povacz-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Povacz 1998</LINK>). Thirteen trials provided inadequate or no details of their method of randomisation; we were unable to judge whether allocation was concealed for these. Allocation was not concealed in six trials (<LINK REF="STD-Eggert-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Eggert 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kolind_x002d_Sorensen-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Kolind-Sorensen 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pijnenburg-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Pijnenburg 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prins-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Prins 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Specchiulli-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Specchiulli 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zwipp-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Zwipp 1986</LINK>). However, while allocation was not concealed, participants of <LINK REF="STD-Specchiulli-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Specchiulli 2001</LINK> were not informed of the "treatment model" (i.e. study) prior to their treatment. Intention-to-treat analysis (item B) was hard to confirm. Most trials failed to achieve the top score (2 points) for this item, for reasons such as post-randomisation exclusions, failure to provide the numbers entered into the trial based on treatment allocation, and lack of account of losses. Blinding of patients and care providers (items E and F) is unlikely in these comparisons and none was claimed. Blinding of outcome assessors (item C) should be possible in some circumstances; however, this was not reported in these trials with the exception of blinded assessment of radiographs for long-term degenerative changes in <LINK REF="STD-Pijnenburg-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Pijnenburg 2003</LINK>. Independent assessment was reported in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Evans-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Evans 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Povacz-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Povacz 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zwipp-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Zwipp 1986</LINK>) but this is not rated in our methodological quality scoring system.</P>
<P>Baseline characteristics and their comparability (item D) were usually inadequately detailed; the failure to provide characteristics for all patients entered into the trial rather than those in the analyses was a common reason for a lower score. Most trials did not provide sufficient information to confirm the comparability of care programmes (item G). Some details of the intended trial populations (item H) were given in all trials except <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1965</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kolind_x002d_Sorensen-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Kolind-Sorensen 1975</LINK>. Whilst the outcome measures used were generally well defined (item I), outcome measurement (item J) was usually rated lower. For instance, follow ups were not always conducted at regular follow-up times (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Gronmark-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Gronmark 1980</LINK>). Results at one year and above for all patients were reported in 13 trials (item K).</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>The primary comparison in this review is of any surgical intervention versus any conservative intervention. Secondary analyses comprising analyses subgrouped by the type of conservative intervention, either cast immobilisation or functional treatment, for primary outcome measures and two secondary outcomes are presented. Insufficient data precluded further subgroup analyses by intervention type, such as surgery followed by functional treatment versus either functional treatment alone or cast immobilisation alone. Some sensitivity analyses are also presented to explore the effects of excluding the results of trials, including quasi-randomised trials, where allocation was not concealed (<LINK REF="STD-Eggert-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Eggert 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kolind_x002d_Sorensen-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Kolind-Sorensen 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pijnenburg-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Pijnenburg 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prins-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Prins 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Specchiulli-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Specchiulli 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zwipp-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Zwipp 1986</LINK>) and of variations in the definitions of outcome measures. In the first version of the review, we realised that the results of <LINK REF="STD-Prins-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Prins 1978</LINK> were more extreme and often differed from the other trials. Coincidentally, it was the only trial whose quasi-randomised method of treatment allocation had been confirmed. While all three of the newly included trials are quasi-randomised, we have continued to examine the effect of the exclusion of <LINK REF="STD-Prins-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Prins 1978</LINK> from the analyses where its results still appear to be at variance to the other trials.</P>
<P>Unless specified otherwise, fixed-effect analyses are presented in the following.</P>
<P>
<B>Surgical versus conservative treatment<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>
<B>
<I>Primary outcomes<BR/>
</I>
</B>The variety of measures used to show longer-term recovery to pre-injury activity levels in the included trials are displayed in the analyses (<I>see </I>Analysis 01.01). Pooled data failed to demonstrate a statistically significant return in surgically treated patients (non-return: RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.11); however, these results were highly heterogeneous (I = 65.6%) and dominated (see "Weight %" column in figure) by one quasi-randomised study (<LINK REF="STD-Prins-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Prins 1978</LINK>). Excluding the results from <LINK REF="STD-Prins-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Prins 1978</LINK> considerably reduces the statistical heterogeneity (I = 15.3%) as well as reversing the direction of the effect (non-return: RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.49; <I>see</I> Analysis 01.02). Pooled data from five trials (<I>see </I>Analysis 01.01) showed that significantly more surgically treated people returned to their pre-injury sports level (non-return: RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.83). Again this analysis was strongly influenced by the results from <LINK REF="STD-Prins-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Prins 1978</LINK>; the removal of this trial results in a non-significant result (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.27; <I>see</I> Analysis 01.02). Analysis 01.03 shows non-return to pre-injury sports level split by definition, either non-return to any sports or reduction of sports activity, with and without <LINK REF="STD-Prins-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Prins 1978</LINK>. This again demonstrates the effect of inclusion of the data from <LINK REF="STD-Prins-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Prins 1978</LINK>; reduction in sports activity was defined in terms of sports involving running for this trial.<B>
<I>
<BR/>
</I>
</B>
<BR/>The majority of the 15 trials reporting on the time to resumption of normal activities (usually defined as work), reported a longer time of return for surgically treated patients; only <LINK REF="STD-Prins-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Prins 1978</LINK> reported a shorter time. There were no data available for pooling for this outcome.</P>
<P>There was a statistically significant difference decrease in the numbers of people with recurrent ankle sprain in the surgical group compared with the conservative treatment group (recurrence: RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.98; <I>see </I>Analysis 01.04). The result is no longer statistically significant (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.04) upon the removal of <LINK REF="STD-Prins-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Prins 1978</LINK> (<I>see</I> Analysis 01.05); again, the statistical heterogeneity is considerably reduced (I decreased from 22.7% to 3.4%). Nonetheless, there remains a tendency towards there being less recurrent ankle sprain in the surgery group: based on the 95% confidence interval, there could be as much as a 31% reduction in risk for those in the surgery group and up to a 4% increase in risk.</P>
<P>The definition of pain was often vague, and varied among trials. Analysis 01.06 shows the pooled data for long term findings of pain split into three analyses: pain at rest; pain on weight-bearing or during activity, or unspecified or overall pain; and tenderness. The statistically significant difference in favour of the surgery groups in the numbers of patients with pain of the second category (activity pain: RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.82) is not evident when the random-effects model is used (<I>see</I> Analysis 01.07: RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.11). The latter result is more appropriate given the significant heterogeneity between the trials (I = 69.5%). Upon removal of the trials with unconcealed allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Eggert-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Eggert 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klein-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pijnenburg-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Pijnenburg 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prins-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Prins 1978</LINK>), heterogeneity is substantially reduced (I = 46.6%) and there is no statistically significant difference between the two groups (<I>see</I> Analysis 01.08).</P>
<P>Using the fixed-effect model to pool results from 12 trials, people in the surgical groups demonstrated less frequent subjective or functional instability (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.83). The pooled result, however, was highly heterogeneous (I = 74.8%) and the results of the random-effects model (<I>see</I> Analysis 01.10) are not statistically significant (instability: RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.17). Similarly, no statistically significant difference was identified between the two groups, as well as some reduction in heterogeneity, following removal of <LINK REF="STD-Prins-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Prins 1978</LINK>; <I>see</I> Analysis 01.11.</P>
<P>

<I>Secondary outcomes<BR/>

</B>Objective instability, as defined by a positive talar tilt on stress radiographs (<I>see</I> Analysis 01.12: RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.60) or positive anterior drawer sign (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.67), was significantly less common in the surgical treatment group. The removal of trials with no concealment of allocation produced a similar result; the wider 95% confidence intervals reflecting the inclusion of fewer trials (<I>see</I> Analysis 01.13). Despite the variability in the threshold values among trials, these pooled results were statistically homogeneous. Where reported, the mean or median values for talar tilt or anterior draw were more similar (<I>see</I> Analysis 01.14); equivalent results for the two treatment methods were reported for talar tilt by three other studies (<LINK REF="STD-Klein-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moller_x002d_Larsen-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Moller-Larsen 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Povacz-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Povacz 1998</LINK>), and for anterior draw in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Klein-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1988</LINK>).<BR/>

</B>Pooled results from 12 trials showed no statistically significant difference between the two treatment groups in the number of people with longer-term swelling, either intermittent or constant (swelling: RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.10; <I>see</I> Analysis 01.15). The significant heterogeneity (I = 47.1%) was reduced (I = 22.2%) and the relative risk moved towards 1 (RR 0.97) following the removal of <LINK REF="STD-Prins-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Prins 1978</LINK> (<I>see</I> Analysis 01.16).</P>
<P>Using the fixed-effect model to pool results from three trials, significantly more surgically treated patients complained of ankle stiffness (<I>see</I> Analysis 01.17: RR 2.24, 95% CI 1.41 to 3.55). While the results of the random-effects model (<I>see</I> Analysis 01.18: RR 2.17, 95% CI 0.99 to 4.77) do not achieve statistical significance, these limited data still indicate a tendency for more stiffness in the ankle surgery group.</P>
<P>Likewise, pooled results of seven trials showed significantly more surgically treated people with impaired ankle mobility using the fixed-effect model (<I>see</I> Analysis 01.19; reduced range of motion: RR 1.95, 95% CI 1.16 to 3.28) but not using the random-effects model (<I>see</I> Analysis 01.20: RR 1.80, 95% CI 0.95 to 3.42). Two trials found no participants with muscle atrophy at one year or above; the only trial (<LINK REF="STD-Niedermann-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Niedermann 1981</LINK>) detecting muscle atrophy at one year found no difference between the two groups (<I>see</I> Analysis 01.21). <LINK REF="STD-Specchiulli-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Specchiulli 2001</LINK> similarly found no statistically significant difference between the two groups in the mean side-to-side difference in calf circumference (mean difference 1.20 cm, 95% CI -1.06 to 3.46 cm).</P>
<P>Aside from deep vein thrombosis, which occurred in a few cases in both groups (RR 2.89, 95% CI 0.81 to 10.33), all recorded complications (scar tenderness, sensory loss or disturbance, infection and one case of Sudeck's atrophy) were in surgically treated patients (<I>see</I> Analysis 01.22). No arthrosis was recorded by <LINK REF="STD-Hietaniemi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hietaniemi 1997</LINK>. There was no statistically significant differences between the two groups in the numbers of people with an increase in radiographically-rated signs of arthrosis in <LINK REF="STD-Pijnenburg-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Pijnenburg 2003</LINK> at a median of eight-years follow up (<I>see</I> Analysis 01.22).</P>
<P>Similar numbers of participants of both groups from seven trials considered that they had a poor result (<I>see </I>Analysis 01.23: RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.65).</P>
<P>
<B>Surgical versus conservative treatment: sub-group analysis by conservative method (plaster cast immobilisation or functional treatment)</B>
<BR/>Subgroup analysis by the method of conservative treatment was performed for the primary outcomes and two secondary outcomes. Only data from surgical treatment groups where surgery was followed by cast immobilisation are presented. Thus data from the surgery followed by functional treatment groups of <LINK REF="STD-Eggert-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Eggert 1986</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Zwipp-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Zwipp 1986</LINK> are not included in the following; nor are those for all the participants of <LINK REF="STD-Pijnenburg-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Pijnenburg 2003</LINK>. No analysis showed a statistically significant difference in the results of the two subgroups. In several analyses the removal of <LINK REF="STD-Prins-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Prins 1978</LINK> increased the agreement between the results of the two subgroups. (Supplementary analyses showing the effect of removing <LINK REF="STD-Prins-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Prins 1978</LINK> are presented for the primary outcomes only.)</P>
<P>Five trials presented data for the numbers of patients returning to their pre-injury sports level (<I>see</I> Analysis 02.01). A test of interaction shows no statistically significant difference between the results of the two subgroups (P = 0.21). The dominant effect of <LINK REF="STD-Prins-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Prins 1978</LINK> is notable; the results of the two subgroups were very similar (test for interaction: P = 0.977) after its exclusion (<I>see</I> Analysis 02.02). A similar finding applies to recurrence or re-injury, where the agreement between the two subgroups increases on the exclusion of <LINK REF="STD-Prins-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Prins 1978</LINK> (<I>see</I> Analyses 02.03 and 02.04); neither tests for interaction gave statistically significant results (P = 0.174; P = 0.476).</P>
<P>The random-effects model was used to pool the results for the remaining outcomes given the significant heterogeneity in at least one of the subgroups of each analysis. A test of interaction shows no statistically significant difference between the results of the two subgroups for pain or tenderness (<I>see</I> Analysis 02.05; P = 0.312; P = 0.24). On removal of <LINK REF="STD-Prins-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Prins 1978</LINK> (<I>see</I> Analysis 02.06), the agreement between the two subgroups increased for pain and remained about the same for tenderness (test for interaction: P = 0.715; P = 0.187). As shown by inspection of the analyses 02.07 and 02.08, the agreement between the two subgroups is also increased on the removal of <LINK REF="STD-Prins-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Prins 1978</LINK> for the outcome of subjective instability (test for interaction: P = 0.57; P = 0.978). There is no statistically significant difference between the results for the two treatment subgroups for either of the two measures of objective instability (<I>see</I> Analysis 02.09; test for interaction: P = 0.51; P = 0.957), or swelling (<I>see</I> Analysis 02.10; test for interaction: P = 0.272).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This systematic review presents a comprehensive examination of all randomised controlled clinical trials comparing surgery with conservative treatment for acute lateral ankle ligament injuries. The pooled data from these trials fail to demonstrate a clearly superior treatment approach. While there is some evidence indicating that surgery may provide benefit over conservative treatment in some less important secondary outcomes, the heterogeneity in the results for primary outcomes underlines the need for a very cautious interpretation of the available evidence.</P>
<P>Although our search for trials was both comprehensive, systematic, recently updated and we also attempted to contact corresponding authors, the possibility of publication and study identification biases remains (<LINK REF="REF-Dickersin-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickersin 1994</LINK>). In the first version of our review, we referred to two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Grasmueck-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Grasmueck 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Otto-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Otto 1997</LINK>) involving 260 patients, published as conference proceedings for which data were unavailable. After our cut-off date for study inclusion, we received full reports, both in German, from a trialist (<LINK REF="STD-Grasmueck-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Grasmueck 1997</LINK>). One of these reports is a journal article that was not indexed in either MEDLINE or EMBASE, and the other is a thesis. This trial is now awaiting assessment. We have now excluded <LINK REF="STD-Otto-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Otto 1997</LINK>; provisional on the full report of this trial ever being made available. The identification of one newly included trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kolind_x002d_Sorensen-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Kolind-Sorensen 1975</LINK>), published in a Danish journal, again shows that our previous search failed to find important evidence, again in a non-English journal. While this is probably inevitable, it does highlight the need to search for both old and new trials for updating purposes. We continue to encourage the trialists of any other trials to contact us as well as publish their results, so that future versions of this review will provide clearer evidence. There is also a possibility of study selection bias (<LINK REF="REF-Mulrow-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mulrow 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oxman-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oxman 1994</LINK>); however, at least two independent reviewers performed the selection of trials and we feel confident that the studies excluded were done so for consistent and appropriate reasons (<LINK REF="REF-Dickersin-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickersin 1992</LINK>). </P>
<P>There is moderate to high potential for systematic bias impinging on the validity of the evidence from the 20 included trials. The shortcomings in the trial methods, such as failure to control for selection bias through adequate concealment of allocation and lack of outcome assessment blinding, have already been described. Pooling of data for individual outcomes was hampered by inconsistent availability of data and the variation of the outcome measures. It is of particular note that, at maximum, data for under two thirds of the trials (12 out of 20) and just over half the participants (under 57%) were available for pooling (for the outcomes of recurrence, subjective instability, swelling, long-term pain). Significant heterogeneity of pooled results was a common finding and its influence on both the effect size and statistical test for an overall effect was noteworthy. While the heterogeneity could result from variations in outcome definition and other variations in study characteristics, the influence of study quality in this review was impressive. For example, one quasi-randomised trial (<LINK REF="STD-Prins-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Prins 1978</LINK>) demonstrated markedly different primary outcomes from the other studies. The results of <LINK REF="STD-Prins-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Prins 1978</LINK> are consistent with the observation by <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK> of an exaggerated treatment effect in trials in which allocation concealment was inadequate. Whilst we cannot examine in any meaningful way the effects of publication and study identification biases or the non-availability of data from many of the included trials, the results of sensitivity analyses (use of random-effects compared with the fixed-effect model; exclusion of data from trials with a known lack of allocation concealment) emphasise the lack of robustness of the available evidence.</P>
<P>The pooling of results from trials with different conservative modalities was examined. Most trials compared either surgical repair versus plaster cast immobilisation, or surgical repair versus functional treatment. In most cases surgical repair was followed by plaster cast immobilisation. Subgroup analyses were conducted for six outcomes according to the method of conservative treatment. Testing for interaction, we identified a statistically significant difference between the two subgroups for pain. However, the agreement in the results for two subgroups was generally enhanced (with the loss of a statistically significant result for pain) on the removal of <LINK REF="STD-Prins-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Prins 1978</LINK>. There is some evidence from direct comparisons of functional treatment with immobilisation of better short-term outcomes with functional treatment; however, the evidence from better quality trials was less conclusive (<LINK REF="REF-Kerkhoffs-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kerkhoffs 2002a</LINK>). </P>
<P>The majority (15) of the trials in this review were clearly conducted at least 20 years ago and reflect previous practice, especially in the use of prolonged cast immobilisation. Post-surgical treatment, especially the extent of immobilisation, is also open to debate and change. Thus, there are questions regarding how much of the evidence from these trials is applicable to current practice. Current trends in practice, however, tend towards functional treatment of acute lateral ankle ligament ruptures in adults (<LINK REF="REF-Ogilvie_x002d_Harris-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ogilvie-Harris 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kannus-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kannus 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pijnenburg-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pijnenburg 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tiling-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tiling 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shrier-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shrier 1995</LINK>) and are consistent with the results from this review. The patient populations, comprising younger and active adults, are generally representative as well as conforming to the main focus of our review: individuals from late adolescence to middle age.</P>
<P>In our data synthesis, preliminary investigations appear to favour surgical intervention in terms of return to previous sporting activity, recurrence, pain, functional and objective instability, and swelling. Sensitivity analyses, however, reveal the susceptibility of these findings to changes and specifically in the exclusion of data from one quasi-randomised trial (<LINK REF="STD-Prins-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Prins 1978</LINK>). In the absence of significant heterogeneity between studies, the enhanced objective stability after surgical treatment may be a valid finding; however, its clinical relevance is unclear. There was also some evidence of stiffness and restrictions in ankle mobility after surgery. As an invasive intervention, the risk of complications associated with surgery always needs to be considered, as well as the additional resources required. There was some evidence of additional complications associated with surgery and that, in many trials, surgically treated patients took longer to return to work. This review addressed the question of whether primary surgical repair for an acute injury is appropriate. It did not examine the effectiveness of secondary surgery, such as reconstruction, following treatment failure or chronic symptoms; this issue is now under review (<LINK REF="REF-De-Vries-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Vries 2006</LINK>).</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is insufficient evidence available from randomised controlled trials to determine the relative effectiveness of surgical and conservative treatment for acute injuries of the lateral ligament complex of the ankle in adults. Treatment decisions must be made on an individual basis, carefully weighing the relative benefits and risks of each option. Given the risk of operative complications and the higher costs (including those of hospital admission) associated with surgery, the best available option for most patients would be conservative treatment for acute injuries and close follow up to identify patients who may remain symptomatic.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There is an urgent need for sufficiently powered, high quality and appropriately reported (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>) randomised trials of surgical repair versus the best available conservative treatment for well-defined injuries. The findings of systematic reviews examining conservative interventions should help to inform the selection of the conservative treatment. Since there is evidence that the traditional grading of lateral ligament injuries does not predict outcome (<LINK REF="REF-De-Bie-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Bie 2002</LINK>), there is need for research to identify the characteristics of those injuries that are likely to have a poorer outcome and may be considered as candidates for more intensive or surgical treatment. Two other reviews examining a) the effectiveness, timing and type of secondary surgery and b) post-operative treatment are recommended and may assist the choice of surgical intervention and subsequent treatment. The former topic is now addressed in a recently completed Cochrane review on interventions for chronic ankle instability (<LINK REF="REF-De-Vries-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Vries 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Attention should be given to outcome assessment in future trials. Future research should focus on obtaining sufficiently long-term follow-up (ideally two years or more) on all patients using a systematic and prospective approach. In addition, while blinding of interventions is not possible, concealed allocation and blinded outcome measurement would improve the quality and validity of future results. The use of well-defined and validated functional outcome measures, including patient-derived quality of life measures, is preferable. Finally, the recording of all relevant cost outcomes would be useful. </P>

<CONTRIBUTIONS>
<P>This review was initiated by Paul Parker and others, including three review group authors (Rob de Bie, Helen Handoll and Brian Rowe) (please see acknowledgements), and some preliminary work done. Helen Handoll (HH) took over a caretaker role until the lead was taken by Gino Kerkhoffs (GK) and the scope of the review refined. Although some of the preliminary work from the above project was taken forward to this review, all the results were checked and the analyses restructured to conform to the revised protocol and availability of results from the more recently identified trials. Initial trial location was performed by HH and Kathryn Quinn, and subsequently by HH, GK and Lesley Gillespie. Study selection was by at least two review authors, and always GK and HH. All authors participated in quality assessment and data extraction of the included trials. Compilation of the comparisons, structuring of the review, data entry into RevMan, and composition of the first drafts and rewrites of the text were shared by HH and GK. Rob de Bie, Brian Rowe and Peter Struijs advised on the analysis and content and provided critical feedback on the work at various stages. Similar arrangements applied to the update. Gino Kerkhoffs and Helen Handoll are guarantors of the review.</P>
