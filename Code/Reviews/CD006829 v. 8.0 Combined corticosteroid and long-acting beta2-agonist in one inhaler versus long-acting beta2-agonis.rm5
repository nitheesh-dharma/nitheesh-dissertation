SoF looks much better, Thanks. Also much better to put weight on GRADE issues and not on clinically important differences! I have tidied up the analyses and removed the duplicate primary outcome analyses from the secondary FPS and BDF comparisons. BDF doses also corrected following errors reported by peer reviewer.Mortality should be ascertained in all participants added to research implications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Cazzola moved into the discussion and both definitions of MID for exacerbations now mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. I need to come off as an author for this review and Emma to look at responses to feedback too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC accepted all changes and sent on to Emma 26/04/2012&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC 25/04/2012 BDF split by dose for pneumonia and final sentence of reply to comment expanded: &amp;quot;Given further consideration to the size of effect of combination therapty on quality of life scores. We agree that the results obtained in our review do not reach the minimum clinically important difference in SGRQ scores, but note that small average differences may conceal important differences in the number in each treatment group that do achieve a minimally important improvement in quality of life.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have added my changes in green so Luis can accept both TJL changes and mine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;24042012. Couple of changes from TJL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. What's new - added New citation, conclusions not changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Abstract - minor tweaking. Like the way that the downgrades for the SoF table are woven into the results. Preferable to 'probably' or 'might'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Have double checked N randomised. Abstract said 14 studies with 11706 - this was the N for pneumonia based on 12 studies. Some studies did not have Ns given in Charactersitics of included studies tables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Anzueto - study given matched with Ferguson 2008...Have changed this now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. Gone through discussion and reworded in parts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6. Gone through the characteristics of studies tables and added Ns for studies that did not have this information previously. Also have added some baseline details such as age and FEV1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC 24 April. I have looked again at the doses in the new BDF trials. I think we should split the high and low dose arms for pneumonia subgrouped by dose.in Rennard and Tashkin. I will do this tomorrow as I do not have the data to hand. Also I have revised the results section of the abstract and What's new to give more information about the number of patients who have been added to the review and the total for each outcome as well as a comment on the risks of bias in the results section. I was contemplating trying to add the two new mometasone studies for this update, but the amount of work is substantial and the interpretation will be complex, as the issue is as much about differences between types and doses of ICS as the overall pooled result (which is unlikely to change much).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LJN I wonder why did pneumonia risk change to 3 and 4 % in each group; when in the prior version it was 5 and 8%? I realized that those % corresponded to one year duration trials, excluding TORCH and shorter studies. Luis J N&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding inhaled doses in different countries; formoterol 4.5 mcg = 6 mcg. Budesonide 160 mcg= 200 mcg. That means a difference of 20% in labelling doses in packaging in the newer presentations. LJN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC has revised SoF table and the natural frequencies reported in abstract, PLS and conclusions. March 2nd&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4 April 2012He has also made amendments to the review after discussion with Emma Welsh April 2012. Thanks for doing a great job on this Emma. I have accepted the changes, so we need to send them to Luis and Toby using tracked changes from the last version that they saw! All graphs are now in year order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;================================================================&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC FEb 13th&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have accepted all Phillippa's changes except for the PLS comment (Emma will kindly look at this) and two questions in green in included studies. These relate to the other trials so I wonder if Luis can help here please?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Cates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;============================================================&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC and Toby have made changes and Kardos admissions restored. 23/01/2012 Changes to risk of bias for mortality and summary of findings shown in this version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC and Luis have signed this off. We need help in sorting out Figure 1 please but then this can proceed to editorial. 17/01/2012&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC 9/1/2012 I am happy that all the new data has been entered correctly Table 1 updated with NNT for pneumonia for new trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I agree with the change to random effects model for primary reporting and have mentioned this in changes from protocol (in view of clinical heterogeneity I do not think fixed effects is sensible across different drugs, doses and durations)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The abstract results now match the Forest plots. The results are divided into primary and secondary with most emphasis on the primary results. Comparative risks of different doses and products cannot safely be made, so I have removed them from the abstract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PLS - I have revised this to reflect the new data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Background: Which Cochrane review looks at LABA v placebo. Nannini 2007b should be the review comparing to ICS not Placebo. Changed now to Nannini 2010 by CJC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risk of bias tables updated for the new studies. Selective outcome reporting is my assessment so please check and see what you think. Last two empty domains removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Effects of interventions checked through. All analyses changed to Random models and results now all match the Forest plots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion. Subgroups in RevMan switched on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SoF table now added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris (16/01/2011)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PS I have now removed Kardos from hospitalisations and also downgraded exacerbations due to pneumonia. Interesting that exacerbation treatment effect in TRISTAN is different from the newer studies in spite of requiring annual exacerbation for past 3 years as inclusion criterion! Should we add something on Pneumonia classified as SAE (therefore needing admission to hospital)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;=================================================&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC 13/12/2011&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks Luis for the data extraction sheets. The SE for GIV must come from natural log of the confidence intervals, please see my extraction sheets. I have amended the GIV exacerbation data according to my extraction sheets, but cannot see how the hospitalisation data has been derived (as it is not in the papers that I could find), and I do not see how the other SGRQ GIV data has been derived for comparisons 2:15,18,19,22 either. Can you enlighten me please? Also please check the data for GIV exacerbations to see if you agree with my entries. The old outcome 2.2 has been deleted as it is the same as the primary exacerbation outcome in comparison 1 now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also how does 13 go to 14 studies with 4 added?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;==============================================&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma Notes 25/11/2011&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract: I think it would be worth revising the abstract to make it clearer that the review looked at combo vs laba and BDF vs LABA and FPS vs LABA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Background: What does this mean?: In practice, at stages II and III (FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;% predicted post bronchodilator &amp;gt;30% and &amp;lt;80%, or grades III and IV in the 2003 updated stages)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risk of bias: the table is not complete and requires additional comments. The methods section state you will only look at three domains...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Effects of interventions: Move comment on MID for QoL to discussion?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LIz: I have updated all the search dates to November 2011 as that was the most recent Register search. 2/12/11&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LJN 22 OCt 2011= I have updated figures. In BDF versus F subgroups; it was impossible to calculate changes in FEV1 because each study presented data in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LJN 23 Nov 2011I do not know how to update Table NNT or harm in case of pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC Jan 22nd&lt;br&gt;Hi Toby - my edits are in red. I have rechecked the NNT results. They should use the LABA only arm as baseline so I have recalculated them and amended the text.&lt;br&gt;Astra have pointed out a mistake in the data extraction from Calverley 2003. 7/256 in F arm has been mistakenly entered 2/256 from placebo arm.&lt;br&gt;Toby has re-entered the data and amended the abstract and results section, it is of some interest that this outcome for FPS is significant with fixed effects but not random.&lt;br&gt;I have clarified the wording in what's new as follows:&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;This amendment changed the pooled OR for all studies from 1.62 (95% CI 1.35 to 1.94) to OR 1.58; (95% CI 1.32 to 1.88). This does not alter the conclusions of the review.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;Abstract: LABA and BDF expanded to avoid new abbreviations!&lt;br&gt;Results expanded to include random effects results and Relative Odds Ratio&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;3. Pneumonia&lt;br&gt;Pooled results for all combination inhalers v LABA&lt;br&gt;There was a significant increase in the odds of pneumonia on combination therapy compared with LABA as monotherapy (OR 1.58; 95% confidence interval 1.32 to 1.88, N = 7173, see Figure 04). There was, however, heterogeneity between these results and a random effects model yielded a wider confidence interval that includes the possibility of no difference between the treatments (OR (random) 1.48; 95% CI 0.99 to 2.21).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NNT(H) for this outcome was calculated for each study with baseline risks drawn from the combination treatment groups (see Table 02). As might be anticipated studies of a year or more were associated with lower NNTs than those conducted over a shorter period of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For illustrative purpose the NNT(H) over three years using the 20% baseline risk in TORCH is 13, whilst over one year in TRISTAN the baseline risk of 2% converts to an NNT(H) of 89.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FPS versus SAL&lt;br&gt;Pneumonia was more frequently reported on FPS treatment than by those on SAL (OR 1.59; 95% CI 1.33 to 1.91). Heterogeneity was present and a random effects model gives a wider confidence interval that includes the possibility of no difference between the treatments (OR (random) 1.50; 95% CI 0.90 to 2.48).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BDF versus F&lt;br&gt;Pneumonia was reported for Calverley 2003 with no significant differences between BDF and F (BDF: 3% versus F: 3%). The confidence interval for the OR in the study was wide (OR 1.15; 95% CI 0.41 to 3.23) due to the small number of events, and no significant difference was found between the results for FPS and BDF (Relative Odds Ratio 0.72, 95% CI; 0.25 to 2.06).&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;Discussion:&lt;br&gt;First paragraph now ends: &amp;quot;The size of the increase in risk of pneumonia is a relative increase of odds of around 50%; the confidence interval around this result followed the TORCH study using a fixed effect model (95% CI; 1.32 to 1.88) but is wider if a random effects model is used (95% CI; 0.99 to 2.21). This means that in an individual patient the possible increase in risk of pneumonia needs to be balanced against the reduction in exacerbation rate.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br&gt;CJC Editing Aug 22&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract Results : Abbreviations removed and focus is now on combined inhalers together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Background&lt;br&gt;****Toby can you add references to the other new reviews please in the final sentence. Also to the second para in the discussion?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives and Types of Study&lt;br&gt;These have slipped under the radar - I have sorted this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods:&lt;br&gt;****Could you add the standard paragraph on NNT calculation using Visual Rx please Toby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results&lt;br&gt;***Please add a figure for exacerbation rates and pneumonia to show the forest plots (to match the other reviews).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion amended to emphasise trade-offs. Please add links to the other two reviews in para 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We may yet get this on the module!&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2013-04-12 10:17:50 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson" REVIEW_NO="CCB3-COP" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.2.1 " REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="8.0">

<P>This review contains evidence from 5 studies previously included in a review of combination therapy in COPD (Nannini L, Cates CJ, Lasserson TJ, Poole P. Combined corticosteroid and long-acting beta-agonist in one inhaler for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2004, Issue 3), with new data from four studies (Kardos 2007; O'Donnell 2006; SCO100470; TORCH).<BR/>
<BR/>New findings<BR/>There was no significant difference in the odds of death between combination therapy and LABA. Exacerbation rates are lower with combination therapy over LABA. Pneumonia was more frequent with combination therapy than with LABA. Additional work should focus on budesonide and formoterol, and the collection of confirmatory evidence on the frequency of pneumonia.</P>

<TITLE MODIFIED="2012-08-13 14:07:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">Do combined inhalers (steroid plus bronchodilator) offer additional benefits or harms in people with COPD compared with the bronchodilator alone?</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-08-14 12:43:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema. People with COPD have damaged (inflamed) or narrowed airways (tubes in the lungs), which makes breathing difficult. The symptoms are breathlessness, coughing and phlegm and can vary from mild to severe (where day-to-day activities become limited). The most common cause of COPD is smoking, however COPD may also be caused by occupational exposure to dust.</P>
<P>This review is about regular treatment with the combined delivery of inhaled steroids and long-acting beta agonists in one inhaler (a combination inhaler). Combination inhalers contain two medications normally given in separate inhalers, a long-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist (LABA), which is a bronchodilator that widens the tubes in the lungs, and a steroid which helps control the underlying inflammation in the lungs. This combination inhaler may make it easier to take the medication than using separate inhalers. Two combination inhalers containing two different medications are currently licensed for COPD, budesonide and formoterol (marketed as Symbicort) and fluticasone and salmeterol (marketed as Advair, Viani or Seretide).</P>
<P>We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared any combination inhaler versus the same LABA component inhaler used by people with COPD. The studies were well-designed with low risk of bias for randomisation and blinding but there were high numbers of people who dropped out of the trials, which affected our confidence in the results for the outcomes.</P>
<P>Overall, we found 14 trials involving 11,794 people with COPD.</P>
<P>The results of the studies showed that combined inhalers reduced the frequency of exacerbations compared with their LABA component alone, from, for example, an average of one exacerbation per year on a long-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist to an average of 0.76 exacerbations per year on a combined inhaler. The risk of mortality was similar between the treatments, although the overall result was not precise enough to rule out an effect in favour of either treatment. There was evidence of an overall increased risk of pneumonia with combined inhalers, from around three per 100 people per year on LABA to four per 100 per year on combined inhalers.</P>
<P>There was no significant difference between treatments in terms of hospitalisations although the results of the three studies were inconsistent so we cannot be certain what this means. Combined treatment was more effective than LABA in improving health-related quality of life, symptoms such as breathlessness and cough, some measures of lung function, and also reduced rescue medication use, but it is difficult to tell whether these differences would be meaningful for individual people with COPD. Fluticasone/salmeterol led to more candidiasis and chest infections compared with salmeterol. </P>
<P>Future research is required to show whether combined therapy reduces hospitalisations, and to better estimate the increased risks of pneumonia. This will need more trials with different doses of inhaled corticosteroids and including direct comparisons of different combination inhalers. The conclusions of the review are current to November 2011.<B>

<P>Two authors independently assessed study risk of bias and extracted data. The primary outcomes were exacerbations, mortality and pneumonia, while secondary outcomes were health-related quality of life (measured by validated scales), lung function, withdrawals due to lack of efficacy, withdrawals due to adverse events and side-effects. Dichotomous data were analysed as random-effects model odds ratios or rate ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and continuous data as mean differences and 95% CIs. We rated the quality of evidence for exacerbations, mortality and pneumonia according to recommendations made by the GRADE working group.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-08-14 12:50:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria, randomising 11,794 people with severe COPD. We looked at any LABA plus ICS inhaler (LABA/ICS) versus the same LABA component alone, and then we looked at the 10 studies which assessed fluticasone plus salmeterol (FPS) and the four studies assessing budesonide plus formoterol (BDF) separately. The studies were well-designed with low risk of bias for randomisation and blinding but they had high rates of attrition, which reduced our confidence in the results for outcomes other than mortality.</P>
<P>
<B>Primary outcomes</B>
<BR/>There was low quality evidence that exacerbation rates in people using LABA/ICS inhalers were lower in comparison to those with LABA alone, from nine studies which randomised 9921 participants (rate ratio 0.76; 95% CI 0.68 to 0.84). This corresponds to one exacerbation per person per year on LABA and 0.76 exacerbations per person per year on ICS/LABA. Our confidence in this effect was limited by statistical heterogeneity between the results of the studies (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 68%) and a risk of bias from the high withdrawal rates across the studies. When analysed as the number of people experiencing one or more exacerbations over the course of the study, FPS lowered the odds of an exacerbation with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.83 (95% CI 0.70 to 0.98, 6 studies, 3357 participants). With a risk of an exacerbation of 47% in the LABA group over one year, 42% of people treated with LABA/ICS would be expected to experience an exacerbation. Concerns over the effect of reporting biases led us to downgrade the quality of evidence for this effect from high to moderate.</P>
<P>There was no significant difference in the rate of hospitalisations (rate ratio 0.79; 95% CI 0.55 to 1.13, very low quality evidence due to risk of bias, statistical imprecision and inconsistency). There was no significant difference in mortality between people on combined inhalers and those on LABA, from 10 studies on 10,680 participants (OR 0.92; 95% CI 0.76 to 1.11, downgraded to moderate quality evidence due to statistical imprecision). Pneumonia occurred more commonly in people randomised to combined inhalers, from 12 studies with 11,076 participants (OR 1.55; 95% CI 1.20 to 2.01, moderate quality evidence due to risk of bias in relation to attrition) with an annual risk of around 3% on LABA alone compared to 4% on combination treatment. There were no significant differences between the results for either exacerbations or pneumonia from trials adding different doses or types of inhaled corticosteroid.</P>
<P>
<B>Secondary outcomes</B>
<BR/>ICS/LABA was more effective than LABA alone in improving health-related quality of life measured by the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (1.58 units lower with FPS; 2.69 units lower with BDF), dyspnoea (0.09 units lower with FPS), symptoms (0.07 units lower with BDF), rescue medication (0.38 puffs per day fewer with FPS, 0.33 puffs per day fewer with BDF), and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<SUB>1</SUB>) (70 mL higher with FPS, 50 mL higher with BDF). Candidiasis (OR 3.75) and upper respiratory infection (OR 1.32) occurred more frequently with FPS than SAL. We did not combine adverse event data relating to candidiasis for BDF studies as the results were very inconsistent. </P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-08-14 12:27:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Concerns over the analysis and availability of data from the studies bring into question the superiority of ICS/LABA over LABA alone in preventing exacerbations. The effects on hospitalisations were inconsistent and require further exploration. There was moderate quality evidence of an increased risk of pneumonia with ICS/LABA. There was moderate quality evidence that treatments had similar effects on mortality. Quality of life, symptoms score, rescue medication use and FEV<SUB>1</SUB> improved more on ICS/LABA than on LABA, but the average differences were probably not clinically significant for these outcomes. To an individual patient the increased risk of pneumonia needs to be balanced against the possible reduction in exacerbations.</P>
<P>More information would be useful on the relative benefits and adverse event rates with combination inhalers using different doses of inhaled corticosteroids. Evidence from head-to-head comparisons is needed to assess the comparative risks and benefits of the different combination inhalers.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2012-08-15 09:53:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-08-13 14:08:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Many people with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are treated with both an inhaled long-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist (LABA) and an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), and combinations of a LABA and ICS at fixed doses are available using a single inhaler device. Two commercially available preparations are fluticasone and salmeterol (FPS) (marketed as Advair, Seretide and Viani) and budesonide and formoterol (BDF) (marketed as Symbicort and Vannair).</P>
<P>Both component treatments are considered to confer some benefit in COPD. LABAs are recommended by <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK> and the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) (<LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2010</LINK>) as regular treatment because they are more effective and convenient than treatment with short-acting bronchodilators (<LINK REF="REF-Mahler-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahler 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dahl-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dahl 2001</LINK>). </P>
<P>Inhaled steroids reduce the frequency and severity of exacerbations (<LINK REF="REF-Yang-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yang 2007</LINK>), although prolonged treatment with inhaled glucocorticosteroids does not slow the decline in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<SUB>1</SUB>) (<LINK REF="REF-Burge-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burge 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sutherland-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sutherland 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yang-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yang 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Celli-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Celli 2008</LINK>). However, the clinical impact of the effect size remains unclear and in the absence of randomised head-to-head comparisons the dosage at which steroids are effective in COPD remains a source of contention. <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2010</LINK> recommend the addition of inhaled corticosteroids to long-acting bronchodilators in symptomatic COPD patients with an FEV<SUB>1</SUB> &lt; 50% predicted and two or more exacerbations in the previous 12 months, or three exacerbations in the last three years (<LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2010</LINK>). Recent Cochrane reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Spencer-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spencer 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Welsh-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Welsh 2011</LINK>) have compared the effects of treatment with a LABA with ICS treatment, and combination LABA and ICS (LABA/ICS) therapy with tiotropium.</P>
<P>In practice, at stages II and III (FEV<SUB>1</SUB>% predicted post-bronchodilator &gt; 30% and &lt; 80%) or grades III and IV in the 2003 updated stages of severity (<LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2010</LINK>), patients may seek medical attention because of dyspnoea or exacerbations of their disease that have an impact on their quality of life. Therefore, clinicians and patients are faced with the choice between starting treatment with either a LABA alone or its co-administration with an ICS. The availability of new studies has prompted us to split the previous version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Nannini-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nannini 2004</LINK>) in order to consider separate comparisons of combination LABA/ICS therapy with placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Nannini-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nannini 2007a</LINK>), inhaled steroids (<LINK REF="REF-Nannini-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nannini 2010</LINK>) and LABAs.</P>
<P>LABAs and ICS may also be used with tiotropium. As this is the subject of other Cochrane reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Karner-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karner 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Karner-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karner 2011a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Karner-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karner 2011b</LINK>), treatment in addition to regular tiotropium has not been considered in this review.</P>

Two further studies included separate BDF arms with 320 µg/9 µg daily and 160 µg/9 µg daily (<LINK REF="STD-Tashkin-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Tashkin 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rennard-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Rennard 2009</LINK>) also versus formoterol (9 µg twice daily). The dosage of the combined preparation and the separate medications remained stable throughout the studies.</P>

<P>Drop-out rates were uniformly high in the long-term studies (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>) and most studies were judged to be at high risk of attrition bias, but <LINK REF="STD-TORCH" TYPE="STUDY">TORCH</LINK> ascertained the mortality results for those participants that withdrew from the study and so was judged at low risk of attrition bias for mortality. For studies which reported dichotomised data on exacerbations (that is the number of participants experiencing one or more exacerbations), we did not consider attrition to have affected the direction or magnitude of effect across the studies which contributed to this outcome.</P>
<P>Taken together (high withdrawal rates and high risk of attrition bias) most studies had some potential for bias. The analysis of data for the primary outcome of exacerbations as dichotomous data was at risk of reporting bias.</P>

<P>The exacerbation rates with combined inhalers were reduced in comparison to LABA alone (rate ratio 0.76; 95% CI 0.68 to 0.84) (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). These results are based on data from nine trials. The number of participants randomised to the studies was 9921. However, the total number of years of follow-up used to calculate the rates across the studies was not available. Assessment of the withdrawal rates suggests that this effect is at risk of attrition bias (see <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). There was significant heterogeneity between the study results for this outcome (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 68%). The range of average exacerbation rates on LABA alone (the control arm) in the trials lasting at least 12 months was between 0.9 and 1.5 exacerbations per person per year. The quality of evidence for this effect was graded as low due to the high rates of attrition and inconsistency between the results of different studies (see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Subgroup analysis based on medication type</HEADING>
<P>Combination FPS had a greater protective effect against exacerbations than salmeterol alone (rate ratio 0.77; 95% CI 0.66 to 0.89, 5 trials, 6391 participants) (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). There was a high level of statistical variation however (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 82%), with the effect size from three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kardos-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kardos 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ferguson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ferguson 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Anzueto-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Anzueto 2009</LINK>) considerably greater than for either of the earlier studies (<LINK REF="STD-TORCH" TYPE="STUDY">TORCH</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TRISTAN" TYPE="STUDY">TRISTAN</LINK>). This disparity across the studies may reflect subgroups of COPD patients who are at greater risk of exacerbating. <LINK REF="STD-TORCH" TYPE="STUDY">TORCH</LINK> was the only study that did not require study participants to have had a history of exacerbations in the 12 months before enrolment. This does not explain the disparity between <LINK REF="STD-TRISTAN" TYPE="STUDY">TRISTAN</LINK> and the newer studies (since the inclusion criteria of <LINK REF="STD-TRISTAN" TYPE="STUDY">TRISTAN</LINK> specified at least one episode of acute COPD per year in the previous three years). When pooled data were re-analysed using a fixed-effect model, the result was very similar (rate ratio 0.80; 95% CI 0.76 to 0.85). The two trials using lower-dose FPS (250 µg/50 µg) that contributed data to this outcome showed a significant reduction in exacerbations (rate ratio 0.70; 95% CI 0.61 to 0.79) (<LINK REF="STD-Ferguson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ferguson 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Anzueto-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Anzueto 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>The combination BDF was also significantly more effective than formoterol alone in preventing exacerbations (rate ratio 0.73; 95% CI 0.64 to 0.83). These results were based on 2622 participants from four trials. The results were unchanged with a fixed-effect model (rate ratio 0.73; 95% CI 0.64 to 0.83) and heterogeneity among these results was low (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%).</P>
<P>No significant difference in the effect on exacerbation rates was found between the results from studies using FPS or BDF (test for subgroup differences: Chi<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0.24, df = 1 (P = 0.63)).</P>

A fixed-effect model gave a similar overall result (OR 1.59; 95% CI 1.35 to 1.86).</P>
<P>The NNT(H) for one additional participant to suffer pneumonia on combination treatment was calculated for each study with baseline risks drawn from the LABA only treatment groups (see <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). As might be anticipated, studies of a year or more were associated with lower NNT(H)s than those conducted over a shorter period of time.</P>
<P>For illustrative purposes, the NNT(H) over three years using the 20% baseline risk in <LINK REF="STD-TORCH" TYPE="STUDY">TORCH</LINK> is 17, whilst over one year in <LINK REF="STD-TRISTAN" TYPE="STUDY">TRISTAN</LINK> the baseline risk of 2% converts to an NNT(H) of 75. After <LINK REF="STD-TORCH" TYPE="STUDY">TORCH</LINK> raised the issue of risks of pneumonia, all subsequent studies added chest X-ray for diagnosis of pneumonia.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Subgroup analyses based on medication type and dose</HEADING>
<P>Pneumonia was more frequently reported in people on FPS treatment than by those on salmeterol in the studies using FPS 500/50 µg twice daily (OR 1.55; 95% CI 0.92 to 2.61). Three studies used a lower dose of ICS, FPS 250/50 µg twice daily (<LINK REF="STD-Hanania-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hanania 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ferguson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ferguson 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Anzueto-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Anzueto 2009</LINK>) instead of 500/50 µg twice daily. Restricting the results to these studies still showed a significant increase in the risk of pneumonia even on the lower dose of fluticasone (OR 2.19; 95% CI 1.35 to 3.53) as shown in <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>.</P>
<P>Pneumonia was reported for <LINK REF="STD-Calverley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Calverley 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Tashkin-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Tashkin 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rennard-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Rennard 2009</LINK>, and we have separated the results into participants treated with different doses of budesonide. The trials using higher dose budesonide, BDF 320/9 µg twice daily, showed an increase in the odds of pneumonia that was not statistically significant (OR 1.08; 95% CI 0.60 to 1.97), and this was similar to the results from trials using lower dose budesonide, BDF 160/9 µg twice daily (OR 1.10; 95% CI 0.53 to 2.26), see <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>. Fewer participants were included in the BDF trials and the BDF CIs overlap those from the FPS studies. We have not demonstrated a significant difference in the risk of pneumonia between FPS and BDF, or any indication of a dose-response effect (test for subgroup differences: Chi² = 4.22, df = 3 (P = 0.24), I² = 28.9%).</P>
<P>Such indirect comparisons must be interpreted with caution as they are subject to confounding by differences between the trials in the ascertainment of pneumonia, co-interventions and patient characteristics. Moreover, the average duration of the FPS studies was longer than the BDF studies, as shown in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>, which may also make comparison between the subgroups unreliable.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Secondary outcome: quality of life</HEADING>

<P>Combination therapy led to a significant improvement in health-related quality of life as measured on the SGRQ compared with salmeterol (-1.58 SGRQ units; 95% CI -2.15 to -1.01, 6 studies, N = 10,681; <LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>). The data from <LINK REF="STD-TORCH" TYPE="STUDY">TORCH</LINK> were not available for the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. Removing this study from the outcome data gave a difference of -1.31 (95% CI -2.01 to -0.61). The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for the SGRQ is around four units (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2005</LINK>). Furthermore, the trials in this analysis did not provide data on the number of participants that showed both a decrease and an increase in the threshold of four units over control in each treatment arm, so it was not possible to assess whether or not there was a difference in the proportion of participants with clinically important changes in quality of life on each treatment.</P>
<P>The SGRQ domain data were available for four studies. Significant differences on three domains of the SGRQ were evident: symptoms -2.78 (95% CI -3.88 to -1.68); activity -1.31 (95% CI -2.38 to -0.24); and impact -1.41 (95% CI -2.33 to -0.50).</P>
<P>Health-related quality of life was also measured using the CRQ. Pooled data from two trials on 680 participants showed a significant improvement in health-related quality of life in people on FPS in comparison with those on salmeterol (2.83 units; 95% CI 0.25 to 5.41), but this difference is small in comparison with the minimal clinically important difference of 10 units on this scale (<LINK REF="STD-Hanania-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hanania 2003</LINK>).</P>

However, comparisons with formoterol were not reported in detail in <LINK REF="STD-Szafranski-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Szafranski 2003</LINK>, which reported mean effects of 3.09 in the BDF group and 3.6 units in those treated with formoterol.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-08-14 12:23:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We have reviewed the data from 14 randomised trials (11,794 participants) assessing the effectiveness of combined inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist (LABA/ICS) in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The majority of trials contributing data to this review were in people with severe COPD, defined by a low FEV<SUB>1</SUB> (&lt; 50% predicted) and a history of exacerbations in the previous 12 months.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Primary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The exacerbation rates for participants on combined inhalers were reduced in comparison with the rates on LABAs alone, who had mean rates of around one to one and a half exacerbations per person per year. However, the size of the effect estimates varied across the studies. The odds of an exacerbation were lower with LABA/ICS, and all cause mortality was similar between treatment groups (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>). There was no significant difference between LABA/ICS and LABA in hospitalisations, although there was considerable heterogeneity among the studies contributing data to this outcome (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 74%). Differences in the eligibility criteria between the studies provide one possible explanation for this variation in average response to treatment. <LINK REF="STD-Anzueto-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Anzueto 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ferguson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ferguson 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kardos-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kardos 2007</LINK>; and <LINK REF="STD-TRISTAN" TYPE="STUDY">TRISTAN</LINK> stipulated a recent exacerbation as an inclusion criterion and may have recruited participants who were more at risk of future exacerbations than <LINK REF="STD-TORCH" TYPE="STUDY">TORCH</LINK> which did not recruit on the basis of exacerbation history.</P>
<P>Pneumonia occurred more often in people randomised to combined inhalers (OR 1.55; 95% CI 1.20 to 2.01) (<LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>) with an annual risk in the one-year studies of around 3% on LABAs alone compared to 4% on combination treatment. No significant differences were found between results of studies comparing FPS and salmeterol with those comparing BDF with formoterol for any of the primary outcomes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Secondary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Combined treatment was more effective than LABAs alone in improving quality of life measured by the SGRQ and the CRQ, symptom score, pre-dose and post-dose FEV<SUB>1</SUB> and rescue medication use. However, the mean differences in SGRQ and FEV<SUB>1</SUB> between combination therapy and the LABAs were less than the minimal clinically significant difference for these outcomes. Withdrawals due to lack of efficacy and due to adverse events were significantly less with combined inhalers.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-08-13 17:21:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>The effect of exacerbations on health status measurements, the impact on daily activities and their value in predicting long-term morbidity suggest that preventing or reducing exacerbations leads to improvements in quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Osman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osman 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miravitlles-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miravitlles 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miravitlles-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miravitlles 2007</LINK>). The evidence summarized by this review indicates that there is an effect of combination therapy on exacerbations over that of long-acting beta-agonists, but the size of the effect is likely to be a source of ongoing debate.</P>
<P>There is some uncertainty as to what constitutes a minimal important difference for relative measures of exacerbations such as odds or rates. The minimal important difference for exacerbation rate has been suggested to be 22% (<LINK REF="REF-Cazzola-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cazzola 2008</LINK>) and combined inhalers showed a 24% reduction. <LINK REF="REF-Cazzola-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cazzola 2008</LINK> also suggests that a reduction of one exacerbation per year could be considered a minimal important difference, greater than the difference we found with combined inhalers in this review. Taken together with evidence of the relationship between exacerbations and quality of life, there is a possible explanation for why the statistically significant difference we found for health status measurements with LABA/ICS did not exceed thresholds for minimal important differences on the questionnaires used. </P>
<P> Neither the mean effect of around 2.7 units (BDF) or 1.6 units (FPS) reached the designated 4 unit threshold of clinical importance. We are unable to fully interpret this without a comparison of the number of participants who achieved a clinically significant difference in SGRQ in each treatment group, as given in <LINK REF="REF-Karner-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karner 2012</LINK>.</P>
<P>The most concerning side-effect observed in this review was the increase in risk of pneumonia with combination therapy. <LINK REF="STD-TORCH" TYPE="STUDY">TORCH</LINK> represented 37% of the total weight in this analysis but did not use radiological findings to confirm the diagnosis of pneumonia. All the trials after <LINK REF="STD-TORCH" TYPE="STUDY">TORCH</LINK> included chest X-ray as one diagnostic criterion for pneumonia. We did not find any significant differences in the risk of pneumonia between high and medium doses of FPS (500 µg fluticasone or 250 µg fluticasone) nor between FPS and BDF trials. The additional evidence from newer trials in this 2012 update, which used combined inhalers containing a lower dose of 250 µg fluticasone twice daily (<LINK REF="STD-Ferguson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ferguson 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Anzueto-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Anzueto 2009</LINK>), still indicates a significant reduction in exacerbation rates and a (not significant) increase in the risk of pneumonia. We have, therefore, found no evidence of a dose-related benefit or harm in the trials of FPS.</P>
<P>The data available for BDF comes from <LINK REF="STD-Calverley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Calverley 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tashkin-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Tashkin 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rennard-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Rennard 2009</LINK>, which did not find significant differences in the risk of pneumonia between the combined inhaler and formoterol. However, there was also no significant difference in the risk of pneumonia between the trials using FPS versus salmeterol and those comparing BDF to formoterol (test for subgroup differences: Chi² = 2.62, df = 1 (P = 0.11), I² = 61.8%) (<LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>). Moreover, comparing the results from FPS and BDF trials may give misleading results as we cannot be sure that the ascertainment of pneumonia, severity of COPD, duration of treatment and other factors are comparable between the trials. Likewise, the data available for serious adverse events is limited by the absence of studies evaluating fluticasone and salmeterol, including the TORCH trial which dominated the results for pneumonia and mortality. The most reliable comparative evidence will have to come from trials randomising FPS and BDF within the same study. Others have also noted that evidence for any intra-class differences in the risk of pneumonia between currently available formulations is inconclusive due to the absence of head-to-head trials (<LINK REF="REF-Singh-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>This review suggests that there may be a risk of pneumonia associated with the administration of inhaled steroid at the high doses that are licensed in combined inhalers for treating COPD. More work is needed on different doses of inhaled corticosteroids to assess the relative risks and benefits at lower doses. Also, the systematic, standardised collection of confirmed pneumonia cases in future studies will help to ascertain whether or not this risk is associated with additional morbidity leading to hospitalisation.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-08-14 12:26:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The outcomes we included in the <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> relate to the exacerbation rate (low quality), number of people experiencing one or more exacerbations (moderate quality), hospitalisations (very low quality), pneumonia (moderate quality) and mortality (moderate quality). We downgraded the quality of evidence because of the risk of bias due to attrition in exacerbation rates and pneumonia, inconsistency in exacerbations rates and in hospitalisation, imprecision in mortality and hospitalisation, and for reporting bias in the number of people experiencing one or more exacerbations. </P>
<P>Although we rated the effect of LABA/ICS on exacerbations as low quality, the impact of inconsistency could be debated: it is the magnitude of the effect that varies across the studies and not the direction. Furthermore the effect was more consistent across the subgroup of studies comparing budesonide/formoterol with formoterol. The data on pneumonia are also subject to attrition, although evidence does point to a possible increase in the risk of pneumonia with inhaled steroids in people with COPD (<LINK REF="REF-Singh-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 2009</LINK>). As noted above we remain uncertain as to whether this is a compound, class or dose effect in the absence of head-to-head comparisons. High or unbalanced withdrawal rates in long-term trials in COPD introduce a possible threat to the validity of the trial findings. For this reason we downgraded the quality of evidence for the exacerbation and pneumonia findings of the review. For mortality most of the data were derived from <LINK REF="STD-TORCH" TYPE="STUDY">TORCH</LINK> and we are confident that ascertainment of vital status extended to patients who withdrew from this study as well as for those who completed it (see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2012-08-13 17:21:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>There is a well-established debate over the definition and analysis of exacerbations which occur in clinical trials of therapies in COPD (<LINK REF="REF-Roisin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roisin 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Calverley-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Calverley 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Suissa-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suissa 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cazzola-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cazzola 2008</LINK>). The statistical analysis of exacerbations as rate ratios and how exacerbations are defined at the study level bring into question some of the findings in this review. The large long-term studies (that is those in excess of six months) which are adequately powered to detect statistically significant findings may overestimate the treatment effects of this therapy if they do not make allowances for duration of exposure to treatment, and within and between patient variability (<LINK REF="REF-Suissa-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suissa 2006</LINK>). The method of weighting counts of exacerbations as described by <LINK REF="REF-Suissa-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suissa 2006</LINK> (using duration of person follow-up time as a denominator in calculating the mean group rate of exacerbations rather than an unweighted approach) was undertaken in <LINK REF="STD-Calverley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Calverley 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Szafranski-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Szafranski 2003</LINK>; and <LINK REF="STD-TORCH" TYPE="STUDY">TORCH</LINK>. The pooled analyses across the different interventions gave an effect size of 0.76 in the rate of exacerbations in favour of combination therapy. The relative reduction of 24% in the mean number of exacerbations may mean that for people who experience frequent loss of disease control, this will result in a potentially greater benefit than in patients who are relatively stable. It is noteworthy that in spite of the entry criteria stipulating a significant history of exacerbations, only 51% of participants from the salmeterol group in <LINK REF="STD-Kardos-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kardos 2007</LINK> suffered one or more exacerbations after 48 weeks of treatment. Although the analysis of exacerbations as dichotomous data gave results which supported a protective effect of LABA/ICS, neither TORCH nor studies of budesonide and formoterol contribute to this outcome.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-08-15 09:53:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our assessment of the quality of evidence for the primary outcomes has presented challenges to interpreting statistically significant results for exacerbations. Biases in the analysis and reporting of data bring the reliability of the observed reduction in exacerbations, measured as rates or as odds ratios, into question. The studies recruited people with moderate and severe COPD, many of whom had a history of exacerbations in the previous year. Combination therapy led to fewer exacerbations and withdrawals, and to better quality of life, lung function, symptom scores and less rescue medication use than with long-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist treatment alone. Rates of side-effects were similar between combination therapy and long-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists with the exception of oral candidiasis, upper respiratory tract infection and, in particular, an increased risk of pneumonia seen with combination therapy. Clinicians and patients should weigh up the benefits of combination therapy in terms of reduction in COPD exacerbations against the risk it poses in terms of the possible increased risk of pneumonia.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-08-13 17:21:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>Reporting of exacerbations in future trials should be separated by type (that is requirement for medication and hospitalisation), allowing further exploration of how these drugs affect different severities of exacerbation and providing a clearer picture as to the resource implications of choosing either therapy. In the absence of a consensus regarding the choice of analysis of exacerbation rates, data reflecting both risk and rates should be available for evaluation.</P>
<P>Pneumonia requires careful monitoring in future trials. This may also help clarify to what extent the exacerbation rate is affected by an increase in the incidence of pneumonia. Further head-to-head trials making direct comparisons between the risks and benefits of FPS and BDF are needed, including at different doses.</P>
<P>Mortality should be ascertained in all randomised participants in future trials, not just for those who complete the trial.</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY MODIFIED="2012-08-13 17:21:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>We read with interest the review by Nannini et al. (1), particularly because of its focus on desirable clinical endpoints in the management of COPD, which include exacerbations and quality of life.  The authors of this review should be congratulated for their efforts in compiling the evidence on the efficacy and safety of the combination LABA and ICS as compared to LABA alone and for providing further information on the role of combination inhaled therapy in the management of COPD.  Our concerns with this review lie in the analysis of exacerbations and the quality of life data from the included trials.</P>
<P>The TORCH trial (2) contributed the most weight to the exacerbation analysis. In this trial, 34 yo 44% of randomised participants withdrew from the study and only exacerbations for those who remained were counted. There was a differential rate of withdrawal between treatment arms in this trial and this has implications for how one might interpret any differences in exacerbations between treatments. It is clear from the reported data that people in each arm withdrew for different reasons. One cannot assume that the treatment arms were balanced when only participants that stayed in the trial were accounted for.  As such, differences in rates of exacerbations between the groups cannot be attributed solely to differences in allocated treatment; rather the differences may be due to confounders.</P>
<P>In addition, the data used in the exacerbation meta-analysis of this review does not allow readers to understand what the trials were measuring. The data used in Analysis 1.1 from each of the five trials appears to be the annualized rate per year of exacerbations.  Further details on the types of exacerbations and incidence of exacerbations in studies are required to fully understand the impact of combination therapy on exacerbations.  For example, it appears that data on the annual rate of all exacerbations in TRISTAN (3) was included in the analysis, whereas from TORCH, the annual rate of moderate/severe exacerbations was included.</P>
<P>More importantly, readers need to be alerted to the fact that annualized rates of exacerbations and subsequent reductions in these rates need to be interpreted with caution. In TORCH, the annual rate of exacerbations at baseline was approximately 1 per year for all patients. After treatment, LABA alone patients had a rate per year of 0.97 and LABA+ICS patients had a rate of 0.85. There are a number of concerns with this type of outcome measure. First, it is unclear what the clinical significance is of a statistical reduction of 0.12 exacerbations per year. Does this mean you would need to treat a patient for 8 years with LABA+ICS to prevent one additional exacerbation versus LABA alone? This review reports a 12% relative risk reduction in 'exacerbations' from TORCH.  However, additional information is required to assess what the magnitude of the benefit is in absolute terms.</P>
<P>When one calculates a 'rate per year' of exacerbations, it is done by adding all the exacerbations that took place in a treatment arm and dividing by the number of years in the study. This method would count multiple exacerbations that occurred in a single patient. It is our opinion that the yearly rate of exacerbations cannot be interpreted in isolation. One needs to also know how many people had at least one exacerbation in each treatment arm at the end of the trial and then compare this measure between groups. In TORCH, which made up over 50% of the overall effect size, this information was not reported. The authors do report that annual rate of any exacerbation (in Table 4 of the TORCH trial) however these numbers are smaller than the reported annual rates of moderate to severe exacerbations. In our opinion, this obvious discrepancy in the reported numbers in TORCH needs to be clarified.</P>
<P>We are also concerned about the conclusion that there was a 'clinical benefit' with LABA+ICS versus LABA alone with respect to quality of life. Nannini et al report a St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire Score (SGRQ) improvement of -1.64 units; 95% CI -2.28 to -1, four studies, N = 4700. The minimum clinically important difference in SGRQ is thought to be a change of at least 4 points (4). In our opinion, readers of this review should be alerted to the fact that trials may have shown a statistical improvement in SGRQ with LABA+ICS but this difference may not be clinically perceptible.</P>
<P>In summary, we feel that although there may be statistical differences between LABA+ICS and LABA alone, there is insufficient evidence of a clinically important change in quality of life. As for exacerbations, more information needs to be provided within the review to adequately describe the data from included trials and only then can readers make sense of the information and form their own, well-informed conclusions.</P>

<P>We are grateful to Dr Tejani and Dr Bruchet for sending us their comments on the review. We have taken their feedback into account for this update of the review and have undertaken the following to enable readers to draw their own conclusions regarding the relative benefits, harms and quality of evidence for the studies that address our review question:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Included a Summary of Findings table to illustrate the risks of mortality and pneumonia with combination treatment and with long-acting beta-agonists.</LI>
<LI>Clarified that the analysis of exacerbation rates as ratios reflect an average per patient and provided additional estimates of baseline rates to indicate the size of effect with combination treatment in the Summary of Findings table.</LI>
<LI>Given further consideration to the size of effect of combination therapy on quality of life scores. We agree that the results obtained in our review do not reach the minimum clinically important difference in SGRQ scores, but note that small average differences may conceal important differences in the number in each treatment group that do achieve a minimally important improvement in quality of life.</LI>

<APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2012-01-23 14:10:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates" NOTES="&lt;h1 class=&quot;fixedtext&quot; readonly=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC has revised SoF table and the natural frequencies reported in abstract, PLS and conclusions. March 2nd&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4 April 2012He has also made amendments to the review after discussion with Emma Welsh April 2012. Thanks for doing a great job on this Emma. I have accepted the changes, so we need to send them to Luis and Toby using tracked changes from the last version that they saw!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;================================================================&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC FEb 13th&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have accepted all Phillippa's changes except for the PLS comment (Emma will kindly look at this) and two questions in green in included studies. These relate to the other trials so I wonder if Luis can help here please?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Cates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;============================================================&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC and Toby have made changes and Kardos admissions restored. 23/01/2012 Changes to risk of bias for mortality and summary of findings shown in this version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC and Luis have signed this off. We need help in sorting out Figure 1 please but then this can proceed to editorial. 17/01/2012&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC 9/1/2012 I am happy that all the new data has been entered correctly Table 1 updated with NNT for pneumonia for new trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I agree with the change to random effects model for primary reporting and have mentioned this in changes from protocol (in view of clinical heterogeneity I do not think fixed effects is sensible across different drugs, doses and durations)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The abstract results now match the Forest plots. The results are divided into primary and secondary with most emphasis on the primary results. Comparative risks of different doses and products cannot safely be made, so I have removed them from the abstract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PLS - I have revised this to reflect the new data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Background: Which Cochrane review looks at LABA v placebo. Nannini 2007b should be the review comparing to ICS not Placebo. Changed now to Nannini 2010 by CJC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risk of bias tables updated for the new studies. Selective outcome reporting is my assessment so please check and see what you think. Last two empty domains removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Effects of interventions checked through. All analyses changed to Random models and results now all match the Forest plots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion. Subgroups in RevMan switched on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SoF table now added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris (16/01/2011)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PS I have now removed Kardos from hospitalisations and also downgraded exacerbations due to pneumonia. Interesting that exacerbation treatment effect in TRISTAN is different from the newer studies in spite of requiring annual exacerbation for past 3 years as inclusion criterion! Should we add something on Pneumonia classified as SAE (therefore needing admission to hospital)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;=================================================&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC 13/12/2011&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks Luis for the data extraction sheets. The SE for GIV must come from natural log of the confidence intervals, please see my extraction sheets. I have amended the GIV exacerbation data according to my extraction sheets, but cannot see how the hospitalisation data has been derived (as it is not in the papers that I could find), and I do not see how the other SGRQ GIV data has been derived for comparisons 2:15,18,19,22 either. Can you enlighten me please? Also please check the data for GIV exacerbations to see if you agree with my entries. The old outcome 2.2 has been deleted as it is the same as the primary exacerbation outcome in comparison 1 now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also how does 13 go to 14 studies with 4 added?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;==============================================&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma Notes 25/11/2011&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract: I think it would be worth revising the abstract to make it clearer that the review looked at combo vs laba and BDF vs LABA and FPS vs LABA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Background: What does this mean?: In practice, at stages II and III (FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;% predicted post bronchodilator &amp;gt;30% and &amp;lt;80%, or grades III and IV in the 2003 updated stages)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risk of bias: the table is not complete and requires additional comments. The methods section state you will only look at three domains...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Effects of interventions: Move comment on MID for QoL to discussion?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LIz: I have updated all the search dates to November 2011 as that was the most recent Register search. 2/12/11&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LJN 22 OCt 2011= I have updated figures. In BDF versus F subgroups; it was impossible to calculate changes in FEV1 because each study presented data in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LJN 23 Nov 2011I do not know how to update Table NNT or harm in case of pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC Jan 22nd&lt;br&gt;Hi Toby - my edits are in red. I have rechecked the NNT results. They should use the LABA only arm as baseline so I have recalculated them and amended the text.&lt;br&gt;Astra have pointed out a mistake in the data extraction from Calverley 2003. 7/256 in F arm has been mistakenly entered 2/256 from placebo arm.&lt;br&gt;Toby has re-entered the data and amended the abstract and results section, it is of some interest that this outcome for FPS is significant with fixed effects but not random.&lt;br&gt;I have clarified the wording in what's new as follows:&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;This amendment changed the pooled OR for all studies from 1.62 (95% CI 1.35 to 1.94) to OR 1.58; (95% CI 1.32 to 1.88). This does not alter the conclusions of the review.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;Abstract: LABA and BDF expanded to avoid new abbreviations!&lt;br&gt;Results expanded to include random effects results and Relative Odds Ratio&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;3. Pneumonia&lt;br&gt;Pooled results for all combination inhalers v LABA&lt;br&gt;There was a significant increase in the odds of pneumonia on combination therapy compared with LABA as monotherapy (OR 1.58; 95% confidence interval 1.32 to 1.88, N = 7173, see Figure 04). There was, however, heterogeneity between these results and a random effects model yielded a wider confidence interval that includes the possibility of no difference between the treatments (OR (random) 1.48; 95% CI 0.99 to 2.21).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NNT(H) for this outcome was calculated for each study with baseline risks drawn from the combination treatment groups (see Table 02). As might be anticipated studies of a year or more were associated with lower NNTs than those conducted over a shorter period of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For illustrative purpose the NNT(H) over three years using the 20% baseline risk in TORCH is 13, whilst over one year in TRISTAN the baseline risk of 2% converts to an NNT(H) of 89.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FPS versus SAL&lt;br&gt;Pneumonia was more frequently reported on FPS treatment than by those on SAL (OR 1.59; 95% CI 1.33 to 1.91). Heterogeneity was present and a random effects model gives a wider confidence interval that includes the possibility of no difference between the treatments (OR (random) 1.50; 95% CI 0.90 to 2.48).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BDF versus F&lt;br&gt;Pneumonia was reported for Calverley 2003 with no significant differences between BDF and F (BDF: 3% versus F: 3%). The confidence interval for the OR in the study was wide (OR 1.15; 95% CI 0.41 to 3.23) due to the small number of events, and no significant difference was found between the results for FPS and BDF (Relative Odds Ratio 0.72, 95% CI; 0.25 to 2.06).&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;Discussion:&lt;br&gt;First paragraph now ends: &amp;quot;The size of the increase in risk of pneumonia is a relative increase of odds of around 50%; the confidence interval around this result followed the TORCH study using a fixed effect model (95% CI; 1.32 to 1.88) but is wider if a random effects model is used (95% CI; 0.99 to 2.21). This means that in an individual patient the possible increase in risk of pneumonia needs to be balanced against the reduction in exacerbation rate.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br&gt;CJC Editing Aug 22&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract Results : Abbreviations removed and focus is now on combined inhalers together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Background&lt;br&gt;****Toby can you add references to the other new reviews please in the final sentence. Also to the second para in the discussion?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives and Types of Study&lt;br&gt;These have slipped under the radar - I have sorted this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods:&lt;br&gt;****Could you add the standard paragraph on NNT calculation using Visual Rx please Toby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results&lt;br&gt;***Please add a figure for exacerbation rates and pneumonia to show the forest plots (to match the other reviews).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion amended to emphasise trade-offs. Please add links to the other two reviews in para 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We may yet get this on the module!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1 class=&quot;fixedtext&quot; readonly=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;f5866&quot;&gt;&lt;span coll_flag=&quot;f5866&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;collapse.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Title&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1 class=&quot;fixedtext&quot;

<P>For the 2012 update the rate ratios have been analysed using the Generic Inverse Variance method. Two new trials included three arms (<LINK REF="STD-Rennard-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Rennard 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tashkin-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Tashkin 2008</LINK>) and the exacerbation rates from the two active arms were combined as a mean of the rate in each arm. The standard errors were calculated by using a P value of 0.001 in <LINK REF="STD-Rennard-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Rennard 2009</LINK> and a P value of 0.12 in <LINK REF="STD-Tashkin-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Tashkin 2008</LINK>. For the hospitalisation rates data were made available by <LINK REF="STD-Kardos-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kardos 2007</LINK> on the number of patients with one or more exacerbations in each arm, and these were converted into a risk ratio which was combined with the rate ratios from the other studies.</P>
