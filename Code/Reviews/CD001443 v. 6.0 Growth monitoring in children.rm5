</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Growth monitoring is widely accepted and strongly supported by health professionals, and is a standard component of community paediatric services throughout the world. We sought to evaluate research evidence of its impact. This requires definition, consideration of the setting, and discussion of the intended effects of this activity. In this review, we define growth monitoring as the regular recording of a child's weight, coupled with some specified remedial actions if the weight is abnormal in some way. Although the causes of growth faltering and the responses to it may be region specific, the process is the same, and we consider here growth monitoring in both the deprived and richer populations of the world. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>Growth monitoring consists of routine measurements to detect abnormal growth, combined with some action when this is detected. As primary care workers worldwide invest time in this activity, we sought evidence of its benefits and harms. The review objectives are to evaluate the effects of routine growth monitoring on:</P>
<P>1. The child, in relation to preventing death, illness or malnutrition; and referrals for medical care, medical specialist assessment or professional social support follow-up.</P>
<P>2. The mother, in relation to nutritional knowledge, anxiety or reassurance about the child's health, and satisfaction with services.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Cochrane Controlled Trials Register; MEDLINE; EMBASE; CINAHL; World Health Organization and World Bank publications; specialists in this area; citations in existing reviews and identified studies.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised or quasi-randomised trials comparing routine growth monitoring (regular monitoring of growth, plotting on a chart, combined with referral or intervention when growth is abnormal) with no growth monitoring.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Trial quality was assessed, and data abstracted by both reviewers.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Two studies included, both conducted in developing countries. In one, the nutritional status at 30 months in 500 children showed no difference between those allocated to growth monitoring and those not. The other study examined whether counselling improved mothers' knowledge of the growth chart, and reported better test scores at four months.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Given the level of investment in growth monitoring worldwide, it is surprising there is so little research evaluating its potential benefits and harms.</P>

<BACKGROUND>
<P>Routine growth monitoring is widely accepted and strongly supported by health professionals (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 1996</LINK>), and is a standard component of community paediatric services throughout the world. We sought to evaluate research evidence of its impact. This requires definition, consideration of the setting, and discussion of the intended effects of this activity.</P>
<P>Definitions<BR/>---------------<BR/>Growth monitoring comprises a package of activities:</P>
<P>-regularly measuring the weight of children; </P>
<P>-plotting the information on a growth chart to make abnormal growth visible; </P>
<P>-if growth is abnormal (usually faltering), the health worker does something, in concert with the mother; </P>
<P>-as a result of these actions, the child's nutrition improves, the child receives appropriate social or medical support, or doctors are able to diagnose early serious disease. </P>
<P>In this review, therefore, we define growth monitoring as the regular recording of a child's weight, coupled with some specified remedial actions if the weight is abnormal in some way. Although the causes of growth faltering and the responses to it may be region specific, the process is the same, and we consider here growth monitoring in both the deprived and richer populations of the world. </P>
<P>Developing countries<BR/>-----------------------------<BR/>In developing countries, the United Nations Children's Fund recommend monthly growth monitoring for all children up to 18 months (<LINK REF="REF-UNICEF-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNICEF 1990</LINK>). Part of this appears to be based on a large volume of narrative endorsements of growth monitoring found in the literature. Often, growth monitoring is part of complex development programmes aimed at improving nutrition, and growth monitoring is perceived to mobilise communities. A narrative overview of 10 such projects suggested that growth monitoring (used in three of them) has the potential for "a significant impact on mortality&#8230;even in the absence of nutrition supplementation or education" (<LINK REF="REF-Gwatkin-et-al-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gwatkin et al 1980</LINK>). Opinion about growth monitoring ranges from untempered enthusiasm to whether it does any good at all (<LINK REF="REF-Morley-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morley 1973</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Shekar-_x0026_-Latham-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shekar &amp; Latham 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Nabarro-et-al-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nabarro et al 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Chopra-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chopra 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Ross-and-Garner-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ross and Garner 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Developed countries<BR/>-----------------------------<BR/>In developed countries, growth monitoring is conducted less frequently, the purpose is different, and the outcomes anticipated are more modest. In Great Britain, there are no nationally set norms, but the Child Growth Foundation recommend five routine measurements after birth to five years (<LINK REF="REF-Schilg-_x0026_--Hulse-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schilg &amp; Hulse 1997</LINK>). In a number of countries, including the UK, It is routine practice for health visitors to weight infants who attend for immunisations or other reasons. From the public health perspective, we wish to establish the minimum number of routine measurements for every child and when these should be done. This will then help direct health staff responsible for community health in defined populations to follow up those children in whom they do not have measures in order to maximise the impact of monitoring on the population's health. Thus this review is not concerned with individual measures that a health worker might perform as part of a clinical assessment, but the potential benefits of obtaining weights and/or heights of all children in the general population routinely; and the frequency or timing of these measurements.</P>
<P>Objectives of growth monitoring<BR/>-----------------------------------------------<BR/>Part of the debate about the effectiveness of growth monitoring endures because of lack of clarity over what it is and what its purpose is. Consequently, the objectives of growth monitoring, and indicators of achievement of those objectives, vary (<LINK REF="REF-Griffiths-et-al-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griffiths et al 1996</LINK>). For example, if the objective of growth monitoring is to plot nutritional trends in a population, then measures of effectiveness will relate to validation of data showing secular trends; if the objective is to raise maternal awareness of nutritional matters, then measures of effectiveness will relate to changes in knowledge of the mother. Evaluation of the effectiveness of growth monitoring programmes must take these objectives into account, whilst keeping a focus on outcomes that are meaningful indicators of health to professionals and consumers alike.</P>
<P>Responses to identifying abnormal growth<BR/>------------------------------------------------------------<BR/>Growth monitoring helps detect three main problems: a) feeding difficulties, particularly in the younger child; b) chronic ill health from whatever cause, including respiratory infection, malaria, tuberculosis, and growth hormone deficiency; c) social deprivation, where poverty and home circumstances are such that one outcome is poor nutrition; d) "non-organic failure to thrive", where poor weight gain is thought to be due to psychosocial causes.</P>
<P>Responses follow the problem identified as perceived by the health professional. For feeding difficulties, a health worker may take a more detailed history and offer the mother advice, or provide more formal "health education" messages. In the case of chronic ill health, a longer medical history will be sought, the child treated in some cases, or referred for further investigation to a specialist. Where social deprivation is a possible cause, a mix of inputs are commonly applied, including more intensive monitoring; home visits and targetting by health visitors and community health workers.</P>
<P>We have therefore grouped the remedial actions into: a) counselling of the mother; b) counselling of the mother, aided by the growth chart; c) nutritional supplement; d) treatment of concurrent disease, such as diarrhoea; e) investigation for disease by the practitioner; f) referral to a specialist for investigation and diagnosis; g) professional health worker or social support.</P>
<P>There are other ways of grouping these remedial actions. Hall (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 1996</LINK>) has done this for developed countries, and Dickin (<LINK REF="REF-Dickin-et-al-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickin et al 1997</LINK>) have reviewed relevant child growth promotion activities recently.</P>
<P>Intended outcomes<BR/>---------------------------<BR/>The intended outcomes of these interventions are linked to the assumed cause of the abnormal growth. For children where problems feeding appears to underlie the growth faltering, resolving these feeding difficulties with consequent improved nutrition is the intended outcome. Maternal knowledge and understanding of feeding is an additional outcome, along with increased maternal satisfaction with services and feeling reassured about their infants health. With chronic ill health, diagnosis and treatment of specific diseases, referral to primary care practitioners or to specialists, are all outcomes that will reflect what growth monitoring is intended to do. In terms of social interventions, additional social worker visits or assessments made at clinic could reflect greater targetted activities for these children and their families.</P>
<P>In evaluating the impact on health, the effects of growth monitoring (the measurement plus the intervention) will need to show at least an impact on the nutritional status of the sub-population identified by monitoring, or the whole population; better quality of life of the children; improved maternal confidence about the health of their child and the services. Ultimately, the aim of growth monitoring is to minimise illness and avoid unnecessary child deaths, but demonstrating impact on these parameters, although finding such data is likely to be problematic given growth monitoring is so frequently meshed into a whole series of other child health services.</P>
<P>Growth monitoring is used as a component of health promotion. Health staff may also use growth monitoring as a focus for discussion around feeding, hygiene, and other aspects of the child's health and behaviour (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 1996</LINK>). It is also used as a way of reassuring parents, and convincing them of the value of good nutrition. These benefits are less easily measured, but can be evaluated by examining the mother's knowledge of child development and growth, and her satisfaction with the services provided. High clinic attendance indicates whether parents value a service, and can be used to evaluate whether growth monitoring adds value as far as the parents are concerned to existing child activities in clinics.</P>
<P>Unintended outcomes<BR/>-------------------------------<BR/>Growth monitoring may appear harmless, but mothers can become anxious about whether the baby is doing well, and may feel guilty if the clinic detects a loss of weight between visits. If the health worker appears to blame the mother, she may be reluctant to return to the clinic, and miss interventions known to be of benefit, such as vaccines. It is important then to seek comparative data about the impact of growth monitoring on the mother: how many people are reassured? How many people are disturbed by reports of faltering growth? How does the process of growth monitoring influence mother satisfaction with the services provided? Does growth monitoring influence clinic utilisation?</P>
<P>Costs<BR/>--------<BR/>Growth monitoring, even if delivered as part of a package of care, has resource implications in terms of health workers' and mothers' time, the costs of the equipment, training, charts, ensuring follow up, and actions arising as a result of faltering growth. Thus it has considerable direct costs, opportunity costs, and knock-on costs. </P>
<P>Co-interventions<BR/>----------------------<BR/>Growth monitoring is delivered as part of package, as noted above, and the underlying organisation results in regular, routine contact between a mother and a health professional. Clinics are also a social activity, when mothers meet together. The regular contact with the health worker and the socialising between mothers at clinic both could benefit the mother and child, and thus the provision of clinics rather than growth monitoring per se may be of benefit. This review will explore the evidence for co-interventions resulting in benefit, by comparing clinics with growth monitoring with two types of control group: clinics with no growth monitoring, and communities with no routine clinic.</P>

<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, published on the Cochrane Library, last searched disk issue 2, 1999.</P>
<P>MEDLINE 1966-1998; EMBASE 1988-1998; CINAHL 1993-1998, using subject and textword terms: anthropometry; child; child growth; child health; community health; failure to thrive; growth; growth chart; growth monitoring; health visitor; height; infant; monitoring; nutrition; thrive; weight. Last searched April 1998.</P>
<P>We also checked the citations of existing reviews on growth monitoring (<LINK REF="REF-Griffiths-et-al-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griffiths et al 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Dickin-et-al-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickin et al 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Organisations and individual researchers working in the field were contacted for unpublished data, confidential reports and raw data of published trials. </P>
<P>External referees were asked to check the completeness of the search strategy and the efforts made to identify trials.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two persons applied the criteria for including studies for the review. Descriptive data were extracted and checked. How well researchers concealed allocation was assessed: whether it was clearly concealed, or if the trial was simply described as "randomised" with no additional details; or if the trial used an alternate design.</P>
<P>Three comparisons were intended:</P>
<P>Routine child health clinics with growth monitoring versus clinics without.</P>
<P>Clinics with growth monitoring versus no clinics.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2008-11-13 05:48:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Ten possible studies were identified. One trial met the inclusion criteria. A second trial compared growth monitoring with and without plotting on growth chart, which is actually a comparison between our two pre-specified interventions, and did not include one of our prespecified control arms of "no growth monitoring". However, given that it could potentially useful information, we included it. Data from this trial were published in four separate journals, listed in the reference to this trial [<LINK REF="STD-Ruel--1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ruel 1990</LINK>].</P>
<P>Both trials were conducted in developing countries.</P>
<P>One study from India [<LINK REF="STD-George-1993" TYPE="STUDY">George 1993</LINK>] randomized six pairs of villages to receive or not to receive routine growth monitoring. The study was nested in a health intervention programme, with both groups receiving nutrition education, immunisation, deworming and curative care at weekly rural clinics. </P>
<P>In the growth monitoring villages, a community health worker weighed the children every month and followed a very specific protocol of responses if growth faltered [George S, PhD thesis, table A2.1a]. No routine weighing was conducted in the control villages. Mean weight gain and mean height gain in the children was then compared over the 30 months period of intervention through five cross-sectional surveys. The data in both the paper and the thesis is mainly in the form of graphs, and it has not been possible to extract the sufficient data to summarise changes over the whole two year period, or obtain the figures at specific time points. We have approached the authors for the tables of results and whether the data can be re-analysed.</P>
<P>The study in Lesotho [<LINK REF="STD-Ruel--1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ruel 1990</LINK>] intervened in 9 primary health care clinics over a four month period. Mothers were assigned sequentially to either the standard growth chart, a new "road to health chart", or a control group without a chart. At each monthly clinic, mothers were "taught how to interpret the respective growth chart", emphasising direction of growth. The control group received no instruction about the chart. On the fourth and final visit, mothers were given a final weighing and counselling session, followed by an interview which included a post-instruction test on knowledge of interpretation of growth chart, weaning practices and nutrition management.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>In the India study, the method of allocating groups in the six pairs was not clear and there was no blinding. The study population at the beginning of the study was 515 for intervention group and 505 for control group, with 90% of those recruited co-operating.</P>
<P>Some baseline characteristics were different between groups. Breastfeeding was longer and weaning practice was later and more traditional in growth monitoring villages than in the control group. The mean Z-scores of weight for age and height for age of children in growth monitoring villages were lower than those in the control at the baseline.</P>
<P>In the Lesotho study, 1,221 mothers with children aged &lt;=2 years at 9 PHC clinics were enrolled. Treatment allocation concealment was not adequate as mothers were sequentially assigned so both the health workers knew who they were allocating the intervention to, and the mother could also predict. Groups were similar in socioeconomic status and baseline maternal knowledge, and were treated equally. Drop out rate was high, 27% in growth chart group and 29% in no-chart group.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2008-11-13 05:48:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Effects on the child<BR/>----------------------------<BR/>The India study examined outcomes in the child. Mean Z-scores of weight for age and height for age of preschool children improved in both villages with growth monitoring and villages without [<LINK REF="STD-George-1993" TYPE="STUDY">George 1993</LINK>]. There was no difference in mean weight and height gain during the 30 months of the intervention. In the group of children aged 3-23 months, the improvement was greater than in older children. The weight gains were twice in the good growing season compared to the poor growing season. <BR/>No study evaluated the effects of growth monitoring on child morbidity or mortality.</P>
<P>No study evaluated the effects of growth monitoring on referrals for medical care, referrals for specialist medical assessment, or referrals for social worker follow-up. </P>
<P>Effects on the mother<BR/>-------------------------------<BR/>In the Lesotho study, the authors report that using a particular growth chart, and teaching mothers to interpret growth curves, appeared to improve mean scores measuring maternal comprehension of growth patterns. These results were obtained over an implementation phase of four months. 367 mothers received a growth surveillance chart; 389 received a road to health chart; and 465 did not receive a chart. 335/1221 mothers did not complete the four visits. Mothers given the road to health chart were given instructions in its interpretation, and their mean score for this chart moved from 1.82 to 3.57. Mothers given the growth surveillance chart were given instruction in this, and their mean score moved from 1.11 at baseline to 2.82 at post-test evaluation. The control group had a baseline average score of 0.75, and post intervention score average of 1.8. Thus the greatest percentage score improvement adjusted for baseline score was in the Road to Health Chart, although what the significance of this is not clear [<LINK REF="STD-Ruel--1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ruel 1990</LINK>].</P>
<P>No study has measured maternal anxiety or reassurance in relation to feedback about the child's weight; and no study examined overall satisfaction with the services.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The study by George et al. showed some baseline differences in the intervention and control groups, and the overall nutrition intervention appeared to benefit both groups. The authors are fairly certain that the growth monitoring was properly conducted by staff, and that specific advice was given when growth faltered, so the absence of effect is unlikely to be due to failed implementation. The trial was cluster randomised by village, thereby increasing the amount of statistical uncertainty around any estimate of effects calculated. Thus the absence of an impact on nutritional status may reflect a true absence of impact, or the result of the study being too small to detect a difference between the two groups.</P>
<P>The study by Ruel et al. suggests some differences in maternal interpretation of growth charts between women instructed in their use and women who had not been instructed. Indeed, the knowledge evaluation was done at the same time as the final clinic nutrition counselling session, and thus the results may simply reflect short term recall of information presented to them earlier that day. Using a scoring system to test knowledge and then presenting mean values of the scores is one way of assessing knowledge, but makes it difficult for the reader to understand exactly what the score actually reflects. This is mitigated to a certain extent by the authors presenting the results of the individual questions in a table.</P>
<P>The evidence identified provided very little information to evaluate the benefits and harms of growth monitoring. This is possibly because intrinsically growth monitoring does not appear harmful. However, this assumption may be incorrect as:</P>
<P>1. Growth faltering, or the possibility this may be detected, causes maternal anxiety;</P>
<P>2. Large amounts of valuable health worker and carer time is expended in carrying out growth monitoring.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>At present, there is insufficient reliable information to be confident whether routine growth monitoring is of benefit to child health in both developing and developed country settings.</P>
<P>Thus it is not clear to us whether we recommend that health professionals actively pursue children to obtain measures of growth at arbitrarily defined intervals. This includes home visits of children who have not attended clinic at the expected times.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>We need to conduct a systematic review of interventions once growth faltering has been detected. This is in progress (Dr Mary Rudolph, personal communication, 1998).</P>
<P>In terms of a trial, the design will depend on the setting and the primary purpose of the monitoring. Then researchers will need to: </P>
<P>1. Define clearly the intervention, which includes the actions that arise out of detecting faltering growth. </P>
<P>2. Randomise by clinic or village, and ensure sufficient data are collected to correct for design effects. </P>
<P>3. Identify and define outcomes carefully, dependent on the agreed purpose of the growth monitoring. These should include nutritional status. They may include measures of medical referral, treatments given or conditions detected; information about maternal knowledge, feeding practices, and satisfaction with the service.</P>
<P>4. Include representatives of parents in the planning of the study, to help particularly with defining parental satisfaction outcomes.</P>
<P>A common study design across several countries, including poorer parts of the world, would increase the power and help answer whether continuing the practice of routine growth monitoring is worthwhile or should be abandoned.</P>
