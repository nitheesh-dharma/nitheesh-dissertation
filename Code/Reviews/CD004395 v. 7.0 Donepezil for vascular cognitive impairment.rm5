<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter involved in memory function. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as donepezil, inhibit the breakdown of acetylcholine and have been shown to be of benefit for people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. Deficits in acetylcholine mediated neurotransmission have been postulated in cognitive impairment due to vascular disease of the brain. Two large-scales randomized trials provide evidence of beneficial effects from donepezil at doses of 5 or 10 mg per day over 24 weeks. The drug was well tolerated and drop-out rate was low.<I> </I>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Vascular disease is the second commonest cause of dementia after Alzheimer's disease. There are difficulties in classifying patients with this type of cognitive impairment owing to varied clinical presentation and different types of arterial disease. There is some degree of overlap in the neuropathology of Alzheimer's and vascular dementia. Deficient cholinergic neurotransmission, a characteristic of Alzheimer's disease, has been postulated to contribute to the cognitive impairment of vascular disease of the brain. Cholinesterase inhibitors, such as donepezil, may therefore be a rational treatment.<BR/> </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the clinical efficacy and tolerability of donepezil on cognitive function, clinical global impression, activities of daily living and social functioning of people with vascular cognitive impairment.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Relevant randomized controlled trials were identified from a search of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialized Register on 7 June 2005 using the terms donepezil, E2020 and Aricept. This Register consists of records from all major healthcare databases and many ongoing trials databases. Unpublished trials were requested from the drug company Eisai Inc and they provided us with the required data.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All unconfounded randomized double-blind trials comparing donepezil with placebo were eligible for inclusion. Trials using combinations of donepezil with other pharmacological interventions were excluded. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Both reviewers assessed studies against the criteria for inclusion and extracted data. Data were pooled where appropriate, and weighted mean differences or Peto odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals calculated. Intention-to-treat analysis was undertaken when possible.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Two large-scale, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group controlled trials were identified for inclusion. A total of 1219 people with mild to moderate cognitive decline due to probable or possible vascular dementia (according to the NINCDS/AIREN criteria and the Hachinski Ischemia Scale) were recruited. Donepezil, at doses of 5 or 10 mg a day was compared with placebo for 24 weeks. For each outcome measure, mean change from baseline at weeks 12 and 24, using a last observation carried forward analysis, was calculated.</P>
<P>
<B>Cognitive function:</B>
<BR/>
</P>
<P>The donepezil groups showed statistically significantly better performance than the placebo groups on the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cog) at 12 and 24 weeks.<BR/>The donepezil groups produced statistically significantly better scores than the placebo groups on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) at 12 and 24 weeks. </P>
<P>
<B>Global function:</B>
<BR/>
</P>
<P>The sum of the boxes of the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR-SB) showed at 24 weeks a statistically significant benefit of 10 mg donepezil daily over both placebo and a 5 mg daily dosage.<BR/>The Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change-plus version (CIBIC-plus) showed improved global function of participants taking 5 mg of donepezil daily compared with the placebo group but this was not seen in the higher dose group.</P>
<P>A<B>ctivities of daily living and social behaviour:<BR/>
</B>
</P>
<P>On the Instrumental Activity of Daily Living<B> (</B>IADL) scale, there was no statistically significant difference between the groups taking donepezil 5 mg per day donepezil and placebo, but the group taking 10 mg of donepezil a day showed benefit compared with placebo<BR/>There were statistically significant benefit for donepezil at either dosage compared with placebo on the Alzheimer's Disease Functional Assessment and Change Scale (ADFACS).</P>
<P>
<B>Tolerability and adverse effects:</B>
<BR/>
</P>
<P>Broad range of adverse events were reported in the studies and data confirmed that donepezil was well tolerated, and most of the side effects were transient and were resolved by stopping the medication. Some of these events, especially nausea, diarrhoea, anorexia and cramp appeared more frequently on the 10 mg dose where there was a statistically significant difference compared with placebo.</P>
<P>
<B>Drop-out:<BR/>
</B>
</P>
<P>The drop-out rate was similar between the groups, 84.2% (330) patients completed the studies. The withdrawal rate was low and due mainly to side effects.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Evidence from the available studies support the benefit of donepezil in improving cognition function, clinical global impression and activities of daily living in patients with probable or possible mild to moderate vascular cognitive impairment after 6 months treatment. Extending studies for longer periods would be desirable to establish the efficacy of donepezil in patients with advanced stages of cognitive impairment. Moreover, there is an urgent need for establishing specific clinical diagnostic criteria and rating scales for vascular cognitive impairment.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is a clinical syndrome comprising a wide spectrum of cognitive dysfunctions resulting from brain damage due to vascular disease. The traditional concept of vascular dementia, reflected in the earlier term multi-infarct dementia, has been expanded to include a wide range of syndromes including subcortical vascular dementia (Binswanger's disease). Although it is now suspected that there may be a vascular element in their aetiology, degenerative dementias such as Alzheimer's disease, fronto-temporal dementias, and dementia with Lewy bodies are still held to be distinct entities (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2003</LINK>). The definition of vascular dementia has proved problematic in terms of determining criteria both for dementia and vascular pathogenesis (<LINK REF="REF-Hachinski-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hachinski 1992</LINK>). A lack of validated and agreed criteria has been a barrier to epidemiological studies on this topic (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chui-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chui 1992</LINK>). Some publications claim that vascular dementia is over diagnosed (<LINK REF="REF-Brust-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brust 1988</LINK>); and others consider its frequency to be underestimated (<LINK REF="REF-Joynt-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joynt 1988</LINK>). </P>
<P>Vascular disease is the second most common cause of dementia and cognitive impairment after Alzheimer's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Jorm-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jorm 1991</LINK>). The prevalence of all forms of dementia and of vascular dementia rises with age (<LINK REF="REF-Hofman-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofman 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhang-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 1990</LINK>). Between 1% and 4% of people aged over 65 years suffer from vascular dementia (<LINK REF="REF-Hebert-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hebert 1995</LINK>) and the prevalence of the disease appears to double every 5 or 10 years after the age of 65 years (<LINK REF="REF-Hofman-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofman 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) has recently been proposed as a term to include vascular dementia and all forms of mild to severe cognitive impairment due to cerebrovascular disease (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2003</LINK>). This term comprises three conditions: vascular cognitive impairment without dementia, vascular dementia, and Alzheimer's disease with a vascular component (mixed dementia). Vascular cognitive impairment without dementia (vascular CIND) <LINK REF="REF-Ebly-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ebly 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Graham-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graham 1997</LINK> is the most prevalent subgroup of vascular cognitive impairment below the age of 85 years (<LINK REF="REF-Rockwood-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rockwood 2000</LINK>). Vascular dementia (VaD) comprises dementias resulting from all types of vascular pathology. The current classification of VaD includes cortical vascular dementia, subcortical ischaemic vascular dementia, strategic-infarct dementia, hypoperfusion dementia, haemorraghic dementia, and dementias resulting from specific arteriopathies (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The aetiology of Alzheimer's disease with a vascular component dementia (mixed dementia) is linked to both vascular and degenerative processes. Neuropathological studies have confirmed that cerebrovascular disease and Alzheimer's disease frequently coexist in the elderly population (<LINK REF="REF-MRC-CFAS-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">MRC CFAS 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heyman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heyman 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Snowdon-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Snowdon 1997</LINK>). Half of patients with vascular disease who became demented also have Alzheimer's disease (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 1994</LINK>), and one third of pathologically confirmed Alzheimer's disease patients have evidence of vascular lesions (<LINK REF="REF-Gearing-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gearing 1995</LINK>). The link is partly due to the coexistence of Alzheimer type neuronal degeneration with congophilic angiopathy (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>), both processes associated with amyloid deposition (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>)(<LINK REF="REF-MRC-CFAS-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">MRC CFAS 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>In vascular cognitive impairment there is typically an abrupt onset of cognitive difficulties, with widely varied clinical manifestations influenced by the causative pathology and the brain structures involved. Memory loss is not necessarily as prominent in VCI as in Alzheimer's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Stewart-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 1999</LINK>). This reflects the particular susceptibility for involvement of the temporal lobe in Alzheimer's disease, while vascular lesions show no similar anatomical predilection (<LINK REF="REF-Rockwood-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rockwood 2000</LINK>). Although concept of dementia usually implies progressive irreversible disease, vascular impairment more typically follows a stepwise course and stabilization or even partial recovery may occur (<LINK REF="REF-Meyer-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meyer 1995</LINK>). No significant difference in survival time has been found between VCI and probable Alzheimer's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Rockwood-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rockwood 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Myocardial infarction, hypertension, atrial fibrillation (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>), peripheral vascular disease, diabetes mellitus, blood-brain barrier dysfunction, white matter lesions, smoking and hyperlipidaemia are modifiable risk factors for VCI (<LINK REF="REF-Desmond-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Desmond 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meyer-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meyer 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rockwood-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rockwood 1997</LINK>). Age, geographical origin, Asian ethnicity - vascular dementia represents over 50% of dementias in Japan (<LINK REF="REF-Ueda-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ueda 1992</LINK>) - genetic predisposition, and a history of prior stroke are non-modifiable risk factors. There is a history of prior stroke in 76% of patients with vascular dementia and in 57% of those with vascular cognitive impairment , as compared with only 5-7% of people with Alzheimer's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Rockwood-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rockwood 1997</LINK>). </P>
<P>Advances in stroke management, and the recognition of the co-existence of vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease have opened new prospects for the prevention and treatment of vascular dementia. Several approaches have focused on extending the cholinergic hypothesis to dementias other than Alzheimer's disease. Acetylcholine is a non-proteinaceous small-molecule involved in neurotransmission (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>) in the brain tracts subserving memory. Administration of the cholinergic antagonist scopolamine impairs learning in humans (<LINK REF="REF-Crow-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crow 1973</LINK>). Acetylcholine acts on two types of receptors, nicotinic and muscarinic, and both types are also involved in modulation of cerebral blood flow (<LINK REF="REF-Schwarz-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwarz 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhang-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>One of the earliest neurochemical changes documented in Alzheimer's disease is reduction in choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus (<LINK REF="REF-Bowen-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bowen 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Davis-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 1976</LINK>). This would be expected to reduce the synthesis of acetylcholine. Some studies have found that ChAT activity is more than 40% lower in brains affected by vascular dementia than in controls (<LINK REF="REF-Mann-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mann 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Perry-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perry 1977</LINK>). The temporal cortex, hippocampus and basal ganglia have been reported to be the most consistently affected (<LINK REF="REF-Gottfries-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gottfries 1994</LINK>). Decreased acetylcholine concentrations have been found in the cerebrospinal fluid of people with Binswanger's disease and dementia with multiple small infarcts (<LINK REF="REF-Tohgi-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tohgi 1996</LINK>). These observations raise the possibility that drugs enhancing cholinergic neurotransmission may be beneficial in vascular cognitive impairment and dementia. </P>
<P>Cholinesterase inhibitors delay the breakdown of acetylcholine and so increase synaptic transmission between neurons. Four cholinesterase inhibitors, tacrine, donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine, have been approved by the United State Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of people with Alzheimer's disease. Donepezil (Aricept), a second generation cholinesterase inhibitor, is a piperidine-based agent. It is a non -competitive, reversible antagonist of cholinesterase and is highly selective for acetyl- as opposed to butyryl-cholinesterase (<LINK REF="REF-Dawbarn-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dawbarn 2001</LINK>). Donepezil has been licensed in the United Kingdom since 1997 for treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. The drug is well absorbed after oral administration and peak plasma concentration is reached in 3 to 4 hours. The drug has a long half-life of approximately 70 hours so allowing once-daily dosage.</P>
<P>There is preliminary evidence that these cholinesterase inhibitors may have value for dementias other than Alzheimer's disease (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2001</LINK>). The clinical trials that consider treatment of VaD with cholinergic agents are few; in contrast the trials of the therapeutic interventions for controlling the risk factors for VaD are widely performed. This review evaluates the impact of donepezil on cognitive function, global outcomes and activities of daily living of patients with cognitive vascular impairment, as revealed by randomized controlled trials.</P>

<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>The reviewers independently discarded publications deemed as irrelevant on the basis of title and abstract. </P>
<P>QUALITY ASSESSMENT <BR/>The methodological quality of each selected trial was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Mulrow-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mulrow 1997</LINK>):<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>In category A (adequate), the report describes allocation of treatment by: (i) some forms of centralized randomized scheme, such as having to provide details of an enrolled participant to an office by telephone to receive the treatment group allocation; (ii) some form of randomization scheme controlled by a pharmacy; (iii) numbered or coded containers, as in a pharmaceutical trial in which capsules from identical-looking numbered bottles are administrated sequentially to enrolled participants; (iv) an on-site or coded computer system, provided that the allocations were in a locked, unreadable file that could be accessed only after inputting the characteristics of an enrolled participants; or (v) if assignment envelopes were used, the report should at least specify that they were sequentially numbered, sealed, and opaque; (vi) other combinations of described elements of the process that provide assurance of adequate concealment. </LI>
<LI>Category B ( intermediate) is where the report describes allocation of treatment by: (i) use of a ''list'' of ''table'' to allocate assignments; (ii) use of ''envelopes'' or ''sealed envelopes''; (iii) stating the study as ''randomized'' without further detail. </LI>
<LI>Category C ( inadequate) is where the report describes allocation of treatment by: (i) alternation; (ii) reference to case record numbers, dates of birth, day of week, or any such approach; (iii) any allocation procedure that is transparent before assignment, such as an open list of random numbers or assignments. Empirical research has shown that lack of adequate allocation concealment is associated with bias. Trials with unclear concealment measures have been shown liable to yield more pronounced estimates of treatment effects than trials that have adequate measure to conceal allocation schedules, but the effect is less pronounced than inadequately concealed trials. </LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>Trials falling in categories A or B were included in the review. Randomized controlled trials where the combination of donepezil with other anticholinesterase inhibitors were applied, were excluded. </P>
<P>DATA EXTRACTION<BR/>Data were extracted from the published reports. The summary statistics required for each trial and each outcome for continuous data are the mean change from baseline, the standard error of the mean change, and the number of patients for each treatment group at each assessment. Where changes from baseline are not reported, the mean, standard deviation and the number of patients for each treatment group at each time point were extracted if available. </P>
<P>For binary data the numbers in each treatment group and the numbers experiencing the outcome of interest were sought. </P>
<P>The baseline assessment is defined as the latest available assessment prior to randomization, but no longer than two months prior. </P>
<P>For each outcome measure, data were sought on every patient assessed. To allow an intention-to-treat analysis, the data were sought irrespective of compliance, whether or not the patient was subsequently deemed ineligible, or otherwise excluded from treatment or follow-up. If intention-to-treat data were not available in the publications, "on-treatment" or the data of those who complete the trial were sought and indicated as such. </P>
<P>Data from titration phases prior to the randomised phase were not used to assess safety or efficacy because patients were usually not randomised, nor were treatments concealed. </P>
<P>DATA ANALYSIS<BR/>The outcomes measured in clinical trials of dementia and cognitive impairment often arise from ordinal rating scales. Where the rating scales used in the trials have a reasonably large number of categories (more than 10) the data were treated as continuous outcomes arising from a normal distribution.</P>
<P>Summary statistics (n, mean and standard deviation) were required for each rating scale at each assessment time for each treatment group in each trial for change from baseline. When change from baseline results were not reported, the required summary statistics were calculated from the baseline and assessment time treatment group means and standard deviations. In this case a zero correlation between the measurements at baseline and assessment time was assumed. This method overestimates the standard deviation of the change from baseline, but this conservative approach is considered to be preferable in a meta-analysis.</P>
<P>The meta-analysis requires the combination of data from the trials that may not use the same rating scale to assess an outcome. The measure of the treatment difference for any outcome was the weighted mean difference (WMD) when the pooled trials use the same rating scale or test, and the standardised mean difference, which is the absolute mean difference divided by the pooled standard deviation when they used different rating scales or tests. </P>
<P>The duration of the trials was either 12 or 24 weeks. A separate meta-analysis was conducted for each period. Some trials may contribute data to more than one time period if multiple assessments have been done.</P>
<P>For binary outcomes, such as clinical improvement or no clinical improvement, the odds ratio was used to measure treatment effect. A weighted estimate of the typical treatment effect across trials was calculated.</P>
<P>Overall estimates of treatment differences are presented. In all cases the overall estimate from a fixed effects model is presented and a test for heterogeneity using a standard chi-square statistic or I<SUP>2 </SUP> performed. If, however, there is evidence of heterogeneity of the treatment effect between trials then either only homogeneous results are pooled, or a random-effects model used (in which case the confidence intervals are broader than those of a fixed-effects model).<BR/>

<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>Two 24 week international, double blind, randomized, parallel-group, controlled trials fulfilled the criteria for inclusion in this review. Three open-label setting studies were found in the search (<LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shua_x002d_Haim-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Shua-Haim 2000</LINK>, 309) for drug efficacy, safety and tolerability, but these were excluded, and further clinical studies (Lendon 2002) are underway to establish the efficacy of donepezil in vascular cognitive impairment. </P>
<P>PARTICIPANTS:<BR/>1219 patients from United states, Europe, Canada and Australia were eligible for enrolment. The trials were carried out by the Donepezil Study Group and supported by Eisai Inc. They had identical protocols. The protocol was reviewed and approved by the designated Human Subjects Review Board at each participant's site. The (NINDS-AIREN) criteria were applied for diagnosing probable or possible VaD patients, 73% had probable VaD and 27% had possible VaD. The inclusion criteria limited the trial to patients with mild to moderate dementia with cognitive decline based on baseline Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores of 10 to 26. The mean Hachinski score was 9.7. The capability of performance was an additional essential entry criterion. More than half of the patients were aged over 75 years, and there was a greater proportion of men (57.6%). The majority of the patients had an abrupt onset of symptoms with stepwise deterioration. A high percentage (99%) of the patients reported concomitant diseases (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>), 70% with hypertensin, 39% with hypercholesterolaemia, 60%of the patients had suffered from a stroke and 17.5% had a history of transient ischemics attack (TIA)(<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Consequently, 99% of patients were on concomitant medications (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). Aspirin was the most prevalent medication (63% were taking aspirin). During the intervention period other cholinesterase inhibitors and anticholinergics were not allowed.</P>
<P>The majority of the patients had experienced a stroke (60%) or TIA (20%) before their dementia became apparent. MRI and CT scans showed cerebrovascular abnormalities in 99% of patients. The most commonly observed abnormality was subcortical stroke (33%). White matter changes in the absence of other types of lesion were rare. More than 25% of patients showed mixed pathologies.<BR/>
<BR/>Patients were excluded if there was evidence of cognitive decline as a consequence of stroke based on brain images, or any cerebrovascular disease, or of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia, of psychiatric disorders, of stroke and myocardial infarction within the previous three months, of any life-threatening illnesses and of drug and alcohol abuse, with additional exclusion criteria comprising hypersensitivity to cholinesterase inhibitors.<BR/> <BR/>Patients were assigned randomly into three groups: placebo, 5 mg/day donepezil and 10 mg/day donepezil. The three group were homogenous according to baseline psychometric scores (<LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>). Neurological examination and psychometric assessment were assessed at baseline and at weeks 6,12, 18 and 24.</P>
<P>INTERVENTION:<BR/>Two doses of donepezil (5 and 10 mg per day) were compared with placebo. An evening single dose of donepezil was used. 406 patients received donepezil 5 mg/day, 421 were randomized to 5 mg/day for 28 days followed by an increase in dose to 10 mg/day for 24 weeks. Patients taking the 10 mg/day dose who could not tolerate the medication were discontinued from the study (the dose was not modified). </P>
<P>DROP-OUT:<BR/>Low withdrawal rates due to adverse events were reported.</P>
<P>ADVERSE EVENTS:<BR/>The safety of donepezil was assessed by monitoring the changes in the laboratory values, vital signs, electrocardiogram abnormalities followed by clinical assessment.</P>

<P>AUGUST 2005 UPDATE<BR/>The update search revealed 16 references. No further randomized-controlled trials were found which could be included. Two references reported the same extension trial for <LINK REF="STD-Study-307_x002f_309" TYPE="STUDY">Study 307/309</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Study-308_x002f_309" TYPE="STUDY">Study 308/309</LINK>. In <LINK REF="STD-Study-307_x002f_309" TYPE="STUDY">Study 307/309</LINK>, 885 patients with VaD according to National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and the Association International pour la Recherche et l' Enseignement en Neurosciences (NINDS-AIREN) diagnostic criteria who had completed one of the two identical double-blind, placebo-controlled, 24-week trials with donepezil (<LINK REF="STD-Study-307_x002f_309" TYPE="STUDY">Study 307/309</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Study-308_x002f_309" TYPE="STUDY">Study 308/309</LINK>), were enrolled in a multicenter,open-label trial (OL). 5 mg/day of donepezil was administered for the first 6 weeks, increased optionally to 10 mg/day. Results were stated at week 30 and week 54. The continual donepezil therapy was applied for a total period of 12-18 months. 674 completed for 30 weeks and a small group of 192 patients continued for 54 weeks. </P>
<P>The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) was used to assess changes in cognitive function. The data were reported as mean±SD change from double-blind baseline score. The results outlined that patients who remained on donepezil for at least 12 months maintained their initial improvement on ADAS-cog score (Week 30 OL: 5 mg/d, -1.2±0.4 N = 244; 10 mg/d -0.6±0.4 N = 236). The ADAS-cog score remained close to baseline for patients who received donepezil for more than 18 months (Week 54 OL: 5 mg/d, 1.2±0.9 N = 59; 10 mg/d 0.4±0.7 N = 69). These results supported the conclusion that there are benefits from long-term donepezil consumption on cognitive function. However, the assessment had been made based on one cognitive function outcome. Therefore, there is a need to estimate the changes on other outcomes involving activities of daily living. There was also insufficient documentation of the drug's safety. These data did not contribute to the meta-analysis of this review. </P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>Two randomized double blind, parallel-group studies were eligible for inclusion. A computer-generated randomization protocol was used to assign the treatment allocation. Two varied doses of donepezil were applied (5 and 10 mg): for the first 28 days all participants received a dose of 5 mg donepezil, then patients in 10 mg group were allocated the 10 mg dose. There was no significant difference between the placebo and treatment groups for all baseline characteristics. Blindness was assured by using placebo and donepezil tablets of identical appearance.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>There were two included studies and both provided data that were pooled in the meta-analyses. Analysis of the treatment effect was based on the completers population, defined as all subjects randomized to treatment who complied with treatment until the end-point and on the ITT-LOCF population, who were randomized to treatment, received at least one dose of study medication and provided data at baseline and at least one post baseline assessment. The completers data of two treatment groups, 5 and 10 mg/day of donepezil were analysed separately at two different time points, 12 and 24 weeks.</P>

<DISCUSSION>
<P>Two large-scales randomized controlled studies (<LINK REF="STD-Study-307_x002f_309" TYPE="STUDY">Study 307/309</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Study-308_x002f_309" TYPE="STUDY">Study 308/309</LINK>) enrolled 1219 patients with probable or possible vascular cognitive impairment according NINDS-AIREN criteria, for 24 weeks donepezil intervention. The combined data provided the following results:<BR/> <BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>The meta-analyses showed benefits associated with donepezil (10 mg/day) compared with placebo on cognitive function, global assessment and activities of daily living at 24 weeks.</LI>
<LI>Donepezil was well tolerated and the incidence rate of adverse effects was low. Some of these side effects occurred more frequently in the active treatment groups, particularly in the 10 mg group. </LI>
</UL>
<P> <BR/>To discuss and interpret the results, the following points should be highlighted:</P>
<UL>
<LI>The patients:</LI>
</UL>
<P>Sufficient number of participants (1219 patients) were enrolled in the studies. The participants were frail older people with high levels of vascular risk factors, and were also on varied concomitant medications, which correspond to similar patients clinicians deal with in their clinical practice.<BR/>The patients were medically stabilized for the previous 6 months before enrolment into the trial. Therefore, there was tight medical control of their comorbid conditions. However, that does not reflect the status of the general population who are not included in medical trials. None the less, the sample was biased toward older people in the population, as most of the participants were aged over 75 years.<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>The criteria:</LI>
</UL>
<P>Classification according to two diagnostic guidelines (NINDS-AIREN criteria and HIS scale) tend to enrol patients with different vascular cognitive impairment aetiology. Consequently, the studies probably contained patients with mixed dementia and the positive effect of donepezil might be due to the medication effect on the Alzheimer's disease component.<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI> The scale:</LI>
</UL>
<P>The rating scales that were used in these trials might be inappropriate to identify the changes seen in vascular dementia patients, as these scales are not specific for this type of dementia.<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>The dose:</LI>
</UL>
<P>Two doses were administrated in these studies. The 10 mg dose had a greater effect than 5 mg dose on the cognition function.<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>The trial period:</LI>

<P>The two studies administered donepezil for 24 weeks. Results from longer intervention period were obtained from two open-label trials (<LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2002</LINK>, 309) in patients with vascular dementia which showed that patients on titrated doses of donepezil for 12-18 months performed better on cognitive measures than their baseline assessment. <BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Control group:</LI>
</UL>
<P>The placebo patients did not decline on the outcomes measures during the studies. This stability might be due to the tight control of the comorbid conditions in the conducted participants, and/or to virtual effect of vascular preventive therapy, as most of the patients were on aspirin and other medications.<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Tolerability:</LI>
</UL>
<P>The incidence of adverse events and the number of non-completers due to side effects were low, though some of the adverse effects appeared more frequently in the 10 mg group than in the placebo group.</P>
<P>The available results indicate that patients with mild to moderate vascular cognitive impairment benefit from donepezil as a symptomatic therapy.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The evidence to date indicates that donepezil (5 or 10 mg per day) is well tolerated and can improve cognitive symptoms and functional ability in patients with vascular cognitive impairment. Long-term efficacy of donepezil in improving cognitive function of patients with VaD was described in a follow-up open-label trial for 12 to 18 months, but this trial does not provide an unbiased comparison with placebo.<BR/>
</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Testing long-term treatment of donepezil is recommended to establish the drug safety and the drug efficacy in slowing the rate of cognitive deterioration in a large follow-up trial.<I> </I>There is a need to extend the treatment effect in patients with severe cognitive decline. Outcome measures used should include other measures as costs and caregiver burden. Other ethical requirements are to identify appropriate diagnosis, clinical criteria and rating scales for patients with VCI.</P>
