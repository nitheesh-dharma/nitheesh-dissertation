<P>Hepatitis D virus is unique in that it can only infect a person who is already infected by hepatitis B virus. Chronic hepatitis D is a difficult-to-treat infection. Several antiviral and immunomodulating agents have been evaluated in treatment of hepatitis D. However, with the exception of interferon, all of them proved ineffective. This meta analysis of six randomised clinical trials of interferon shows that even Interferon alpha is not an ideal drug for this infection. Among the 169 participants included in primary meta analysis, interferon alpha induced loss of virus, normalisation of liver tests, and improvement in the liver biopsy in more patients compared with those who were left untreated. Unfortunately, most of these patients did not have sustained response after stopping treatment. Additional analysis of two trials comparing a higher dose of interferon alpha with lower dose among randomly assigned participants showed no significant difference in outcome between the two groups. There were differences in dosage and duration of interferon alpha used among included trials as well as some other methodological weakness which places a high risk of bias in this meta analysis.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-09-05 14:50:49 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Muhammad Arsalan Khan">
<P>Hepatitis D virus is a small defective RNA virus that requires the presence of hepatitis B virus infection to infect a person. Hepatitis D is a difficult-to-treat infection. Several clinical trials have been published on the efficacy of interferon alpha for hepatitis D virus (HDV) infection. However, there are few randomised trials evaluating the effects of interferon alpha, and it is difficult to judge any benefit of this intervention from the individual trials. </P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2011-10-01 20:43:59 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Muhammad Arsalan Khan">
<P>Two authors assessed the trials and extracted data on mortality, virologic, biochemical, and histological response as well as adverse events at end of treatment and six months or more after completing treatment. The analyses were performed using the intention-to-treat principle including all randomised participants irrespective of follow-up. Drop-outs, withdrawals, and non-compliance were considered as treatment failures. Data were analysed with fixed- and random-effects models. Reported results were based on fixed-effect model except in cases where statistical significance varied between the two models.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-11-01 11:14:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Muhammad Arsalan Khan">
<P>Six randomised trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Two hundred and one randomised participants (male = 174) were included. The risk of bias in all the included trials was high. Five trials compared interferon alpha with no treatment in the control group. One of these trials had two treatment arms with a higher dose and lower dose of interferon alpha and a no-treatment control group. We analysed both treatment regimens as a single group in a primary analysis and as separate groups in the subgroup analysis of different interferon dosages. The sixth trial compared only a higher dose of interferon alpha with a lower dose.</P>
<P>Meta-analysis of five trials comparing interferon alpha with no-treatment control group included 169 participants. There were seven drop-outs in the treatment group and nine in the control group. One patient out of 92 (1.1%) died in the interferon alpha group compared with zero out of 77 (0.0%) in the no-intervention control group (risk ratio (RR)) 3.00; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14 to 66.5). Interferon alpha led to failure of end of treatment virological response in 62/92 (67.4%) of the patients compared with 71/77 (92.2%) in the untreated controls (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.87, P = 0.0001 by fixed-effect model and RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.16, P = 0.17 by random-effects model). Failure of normalisation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) at the end of treatment was seen in 60/92 (65.2%) patients treated with interferon alpha versus 76/77 (98.7%) in the control group (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.80, P &lt; 0.00001). Sustained virological response was not achieved in 76/92 (82.6%) of patients on interferon compared with 73/77 (94.8%) of controls (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.98, P = 0.02). Serum alanine aminotransferase was abnormal in 81/92 (88.0%) treated with interferon alpha patients at six months post-treatment follow-up compared with 76/77 (98.7%) in controls (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.99, P = 0.04). There was no significant histological improvement in 67/92 (72.8%) patients treated with interferon alpha compared with 65/77 (84.4%) in controls (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.00, P = 0.06).</P>
<P>Two trials comparing a higher dose of interferon alpha with the lower dose showed no significant difference in sustained virological response (76.7% compared with 90.0%) (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.07, P = 0.16). Adverse events such as flu-like symptoms, asthenia, weight loss, alopecia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia were reported in all these trials and the adverse events were related to interferon alpha. These were common and sometimes severe. One patient in the treatment group was reported to have died by suicide towards the end of the study period.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-11-01 11:32:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Interferon alpha does not seem to cure hepatitis D in most patients. The agent seems effective in suppressing viral and liver disease activity in some patients, but this improvement is not sustained in the majority of patients. We cannot exclude overestimation of benefits and underestimation of harms due to high risk of bias (systematic errors) and high risk play of chance (random errors). Therefore, more randomised trials with large sample sizes and less risk of bias are needed before interferon can be recommended or refuted. </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-11-01 11:35:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>Hepatitis D virus (or delta virus) (HDV) is a defective small single-stranded circular RNA virus that requires the helper function of hepatitis B virus (HBV) for viral assembly and propagation (<LINK REF="REF-Rizzetto-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rizzetto 1977</LINK>). Acute infection with HDV acquired by coinfection with HBV is often severe. However, most patients achieve usually a complete recovery and only 2% of the patients progress to chronicity (<LINK REF="REF-Farci-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farci 2003</LINK>). Superinfection of HDV in persons with HBV infection leads to progressive disease and cirrhosis in approximately 80% of patients (<LINK REF="REF-Rizzetto-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rizzetto 2003</LINK>). Cirrhosis develops earlier in HDV-infected patients than patients infected only with chronic HBV (<LINK REF="REF-Rizzetto-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rizzetto 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2011</LINK>). Up to 5% of the world's population is infected with HBV, and probably 5% of the HBV carriers have HDV superinfection (<LINK REF="REF-Gaeta-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gaeta 2001</LINK>). Accordingly, about 15 million people may have chronic hepatitis D infection.</P>
<P>HDV is difficult to eradicate as most of the possible therapeutic targets are normal cellular proteins. The sole enzymatic activity that HDV possesses is a ribozyme that autocleaves the circular RNA, producing a linear molecule (<LINK REF="REF-Sharmeen-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharmeen 1988</LINK>). Concomitant infection with an RNA (HDV) and a DNA (HBV) virus makes chronic hepatitis D more difficult to treat than chronic hepatitis B alone. As with hepatitis B, poor results were obtained in the treatment of hepatitis D with immunosuppressive and immunostimulant drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Arrigoni-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arrigoni 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rizzetto-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rizzetto 1983</LINK>). The mechanism of action of interferon in chronic hepatitis D is poorly understood. In HDV transfected hepatoma cell lines, HDV replication was not affected by interferon (<LINK REF="REF-Ottobrelli-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ottobrelli 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ilan-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ilan 1992</LINK>). In vitro experiments apparently contrast with the results observed in patients, in whom response to interferon is often characterised by a concomitant reduction in HDV viraemia and in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, suggesting a direct antiviral effect of interferon on HDV.</P>
<P>Several clinical trials on the long-term administration of interferon were undertaken in the late 1980s (<LINK REF="STD-Farci-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Farci 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Malaguarnera-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malaguarnera 1996</LINK>). The response, assessed by the normalisation of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and clearance of serum HDV RNA varied widely. Moreover, it occurred at different times from the beginning of treatment, sometimes even after discontinuation of interferon. The proportion of patients with response and relapse seemed proportional to the dose of interferon (<LINK REF="STD-Di-Bisceglie-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Di Bisceglie 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Madejon-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Madejon 1994</LINK>). Sustained responses were unusual and often incomplete, showing persistently normal ALT despite the recrudescence of HDV viraemia. Concomitant sustained biochemical and virological responses were usually accompanied by the clearance of serum hepatis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and seroconversion to anti-HBs antibody (<LINK REF="STD-Battegay-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Battegay 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Farci et al demonstrated that interferon alpha, given in a dose of 9 million units three times a week for 48 weeks, was generally well tolerated and resulted in clearance of serum HDV RNA, normal ALT values, and histologic improvement in 50% of patients with chronic hepatitis D (<LINK REF="STD-Farci-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Farci 1994</LINK>). A complete biochemical response persisted for up to four years in half the patients who had normal ALT values at the end of therapy, whereas the effects on viral replication were not sustained in these patients. Niro et al reviewed the trials on the treatment of hepatitis D and concluded that the medical treatment of chronic hepatitis D rested on interferon, which should be administered at high doses (9 to 10 million units three times a week) to patients with compensated liver disease and as soon as chronic HDV disease was diagnosed (<LINK REF="REF-Niro-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Niro 2005</LINK>). Treatment should be prolonged for 12 months as response, ie, clearance of HDV RNA and normalisation of ALT levels, can be delayed and sometimes occur after the end of the treatment.</P>
<P>There is one previous meta-analysis available dealing with interferon alpha for hepatitis D (<LINK REF="REF-Hadziyannis-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hadziyannis 1991</LINK>). It is based on reduction in ALT levels as the primary outcome measure. We could not find any comprehensive meta-analyses that evaluated interferon alpha for chronic hepatitis D in terms of mortality and virological, biochemical, and histological responses at the end of treatment and the end of the follow-up. Therefore, we felt the need to perform the present Cochrane systematic review.</P>

Risk of bias of the randomised clinical trials was assessed using the definitions of following domains (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Sequence generation</I> </B>
<BR/>- Low risk of bias: sequence generation was achieved using computer random number generation or a random number table. Drawing lots, tossing a coin, shuffling cards, and throwing dice are also adequate if performed by an independent adjudicator.<BR/>- Uncertain risk of bias: the trial is described as randomised but the method of sequence generation was not specified.<BR/>- High risk of bias: the sequence generation method is not, or may not be, random. Quasi-randomised studies, those using dates, names, or admittance numbers in order to allocate patients are inadequate and were excluded for the assessment of benefits but not for the assessment of harms.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Allocation concealment</I>
</B>
<BR/>- Low risk of bias: allocation was controlled by a central and independent randomisation unit, serially numbered, opaque and sealed envelopes, or similar, so that intervention allocations could not have been foreseen in advance of, or during, enrolment.<BR/>- Uncertain risk of bias: the trial was described as randomised but the method used to conceal the allocation was not described, so that intervention allocations may have been foreseen in advance of, or during, enrolment.<BR/>- High risk of bias: if the allocation sequence was known to the investigators who assigned participants or if the study was quasi-randomised. Quasi-randomised studies were excluded for the assessment of benefits but not for the assessment of harms.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Blinding</I>
</B>
<BR/>- Low risk of bias: the trial was described as blinded, the parties that were blinded, and the method of blinding was described, so that knowledge of allocation was adequately prevented during the trial. <BR/>- Uncertain risk of bias: the trial was described as blind, but the method of blinding was not described, so that knowledge of allocation was possible during the trial.<BR/>- High risk of bias: the trial was not blinded, so that the allocation was known during the trial.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Incomplete outcome data</I>
</B>
<BR/>- Low risk of bias: the numbers and reasons for dropouts and withdrawals in all intervention groups were described or if it was specified that there were no dropouts or withdrawals. <BR/>- Uncertain risk of bias: the report gave the impression that there had been no dropouts or withdrawals, but this was not specifically stated. <BR/>- High risk of bias: the number or reasons for dropouts and withdrawals were not described.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Selective outcome reporting</I>
</B>
<BR/>- Low risk of bias: pre-defined, or clinically relevant and reasonably expected outcomes are reported on.<BR/>- Uncertain risk of bias: not all pre-defined, or clinically relevant and reasonably expected outcomes are reported on or are not reported fully, or it is unclear whether data on these outcomes were recorded or not.<BR/>- High risk of bias: one or more clinically relevant and reasonably expected outcomes were not reported on; data on these outcomes were likely to have been recorded.</P>
<P>If a trial obtained the judgement 'low risk of bias' in all the six bias risk domains, then it was categorised as a trial with low risk of bias for the purpose of data analyses. In all other cases, the trial was categorised as a trial with high risk of bias.</P>

<P>Six trials with 201 randomised participants provided data for analysis; 174 were males and 27 were women (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Five trials compared interferon monotherapy versus no intervention control (<LINK REF="STD-Porres-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Porres 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosina-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Rosina 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosina-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Rosina 1991;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Farci-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Farci 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gaudin-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gaudin 1995</LINK>). A total of 169 patients were included in these five trials; 92 in the intervention group and 77 in the no intervention group. The baseline characteristics of the patient sample included in the trials did not show any substantial differences between the groups in the individual trials as well as across the trials. These trials had methodological heterogeneity in terms of dosage regimen of interferon alpha and duration of administration of interferon (refer to <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table). The duration of treatment was one year in three trials, six months in one (<LINK REF="STD-Porres-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Porres 1989</LINK>), and three months in another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Rosina-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Rosina 1989</LINK>).

The fifth trial (<LINK REF="STD-Farci-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Farci 1994</LINK>) had three groups; two interferon alpha intervention groups and a control group with no treatment. The interferon groups tested a lower dose (3 million units thrice a week) and a higher dose (9 million units thrice a week).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-11-01 11:58:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Chronic hepatitis D aggravates the natural course of hepatitis B infection. It is difficult to treat hepatitis D. Interferon is the only treatment for chronic hepatitis D. Randomised clinical trials based on interferon therapy were conducted in late 1980s and early 1990s. These trials are few. The response evaluated was clearance of HDV RNA (virological response), normalisation of ALT (biochemical response), and histological improvement based on liver biopsy. We found absence of significant sustained virological response, improvement in ALT, and histological improvement in our analysis. We observed, however, a potential effect of interferon on end of treatment virological and biochemical responses. These observations are hampered by the risk of significant errors (bias) and the risk of random error (play of chance). We, therefore, tend to agree with Hughes et al (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2011</LINK>): interferon alpha, standard or pegylated, seems to be the only effective therapy available so far for HDV, though it may not be an ideal treatment. This therapy may not cure the infection in all patients, but it may potentially benefit in some patients. Such potential effects come at a price: increased risk of adverse events and of costs.</P>
<P>Interesting, although sustained virological response is not achieved in all patients, biochemical response appears to correlate with improvement in liver histology. The beneficial effect lasts even beyond the termination of therapy. A 2 to 14 year follow-up study of patients from <LINK REF="STD-Farci-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Farci 1994</LINK> showed that high doses of interferon alpha-2a (9 million units thrice a week) significantly improved the long-term clinical outcome and survival of patients with chronic hepatitis D, even though the majority had active cirrhosis before the onset of therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Farci-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farci 2004</LINK>). These patients had a sustained decrease in HDV replication, leading to clearance of HDV RNA and, eventually, hepatitis B virus (HBV) in some patients, as well as a dramatic improvement in liver histology with respect to activity grade and &#64257;brosis stage. So, the clearance of serum HDV RNA associated with loss of HBsAg may occur years after discontinuation of treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Lau-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lau 1999</LINK>).<B> </B>In patients, who do not clear HDV RNA but do show biochemical and histological response, interferon probably induces less pathogenic mutants (<LINK REF="REF-Ottobrelli-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ottobrelli 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>With the development of pegylated interferon, uncontrolled studies on hepatitis D have appeared in literature. Castelnau et al showed an end of treatment virological response of 57% (8/14) with pegylated interferon alpha 2b 1.5 microgram per kg and sustained virological response of 43% (<LINK REF="STD-Castelnau-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Castelnau 2006</LINK>). However, another study of 12 patients using the same dose showed a sustained virological response of only 17% (<LINK REF="STD-Erhardt-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Erhardt 2006</LINK>). Negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or decrease of more than three logs in HDV RNA level at six months of intervention is correlated with sustained virological response. In an international trial done by Wedemeyer and colleagues (HIDIT-1), pegylated interferon alpha 2a had a significant antiviral efficacy against HDV, with 28% achieving a sustained virological response (<LINK REF="STD-Wedemeyer-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Wedemeyer 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>HBsAg is required for production of viral hepatitis D particles, and active suppression of this antigen seems, therefore, a must. Few trials have compared the effectiveness of combination of one of the nucleoside analogues or ribavirin with standard or pegylated interferon versus interferon alone. These combinations failed to show advantage of using combination over interferon monotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Niro-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Niro 2006</LINK>)<B>.</B>  Available therapies do not effectively suppress the surface antigen but do have some effect in reducing its level. For example, lamivudine and famciclovir individually are ineffective against HDV (<LINK REF="REF-Yurdaydin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yurdaydin 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Niro-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Niro 2005a</LINK>). Four randomised trials comparing interferon monotherapy with lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil, or ribavirin combination with interferon failed to show improvement in the virological and biochemical responses over interferon monotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Gunsar-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gunsar 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Canbakan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Canbakan 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yurdaydin-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Yurdaydin 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wedemeyer-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Wedemeyer 2011</LINK>). Inclusion of these more recent trials in the analysis is beyond the scope of what was defined in the objectives of the current review.</P>
<P>There is a need to develop new therapies effective directly against HDV. There are few reports of clearance of HBsAg in up to 11% of the patients of hepatitis B with one year of pegylated interferon therapy. Thus, monitoring of HBsAg levels along with HDV RNA levels would be recommended in future trials to evaluate response. Ideally treatment should be continued until the loss of HBsAg. Monitoring HDV RNA levels could help in predicting the response and adjusting the duration of therapy just as done for hepatitis C (<LINK REF="REF-Lok-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lok 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-EASL-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">EASL 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ghany-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ghany 2009</LINK>) The HIDIT-1 trial showed that combination of pegylated interferon with adefovir dipivoxil was superior to interferon monotherapy in reducing HBsAg levels (<LINK REF="STD-Wedemeyer-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Wedemeyer 2011</LINK>). There is a need for randomised trials comparing pegylated interferon monotherapy with its combination with more powerful nucleos(t)ide analogues and for longer duration. In the future, drugs directly acting on HDV life cycle such as antisense oligonucleotides (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 1997</LINK>), prenylation inhibitors (<LINK REF="REF-Bordier-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bordier 2003</LINK>), and HBV/HDV virus entry inhibitors (<LINK REF="REF-Petersen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petersen 2008</LINK>) would also have some role alone, or probably in combination with pegylated interferon.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-11-01 11:59:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>From the available trials' data we may conclude that interferon alpha potentially seems effective in suppressing viral activity and decreasing liver disease activity in some patients, but the inhibitory effect is temporary, and improvement is not sustained in the majority of patients. From the limited data available, it is not possible to find out any predictive factors or determinants of response. Due to low sustained response, it seems difficult to accept this agent as standard of care for hepatitis D. The possibility that pegylated interferon might be more effective needs further evaluation in clinical trials. The reason is that all included trials had high risk of bias (systematic errors) and high risk of play of chance (random errors) and we cannot exclude outcome measure reporting bias as well as publication bias.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2011-11-01 11:59:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Data from the available randomised trials were difficult to compare due to the small number of trials and differences in the dose, duration, and agents used in combination. In addition to methodological heterogeneity, only one subgroup analysis could be conducted. All trials were unblinded, and several of them also showed other bias risks. Allocation concealment was not observed or was not clear. However, these trials were considered free from selective reporting and incomplete outcome data were adequately addressed by most of the trials. Assessment was based on an intention-to-treat principle. Possibility of publication bias cannot be excluded, and the risk of bias in the included trials was high.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2011-09-05 14:50:50 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We did not limit our search to English language publications only. However, the databases we searched contain less number of journals indexed from the developing world. We tried to retrieve the unpublished data by going through the abstracts from liver meetings. Data of an unpublished trial were generously provided by their authors. However, during the process of writing the review, the study got published (<LINK REF="STD-Wedemeyer-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Wedemeyer 2011</LINK>). This meta-analysis is based on a small number of trials, with each trial comprising a small sample size compounded by the differing dosage and duration of interferon administration. These limitations carry over into our analysis, and in our opinion, restricts definitive conclusion regarding this treatment.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2011-11-01 12:11:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>Other reviews have also highlighted the limited efficacy of interferon alpha against hepatitis D (<LINK REF="REF-Malaguarnera-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malaguarnera 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Farci-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farci 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Niro-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Niro 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Farci-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farci 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wedemeyer-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wedemeyer 2010</LINK>). They have mentioned the individual studies and have drawn conclusions without performing meta-analysis. There is one meta-analysis available which has been done by Hadziyannis (<LINK REF="REF-Hadziyannis-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hadziyannis 1991</LINK>). However, it is based on biochemical response, and used reduction in ALT levels as the primary outcome measure. While we did the systematic review comparing the trials in clinically relevant outcome measures such as mortality, virological, biochemical, and histological responses at the end of treatment and the end of the follow-up period and calculated the meta-analysis results. We also did subgroup analysis comparing high dose with low dose of interferon.</P>

<P>Administration of interferon to patients with chronic hepatitis D can neither be supported nor refuted. Interferon may benefit some patients through long-term remission. The patients run the risk of adverse events and serious adverse events. Newer therapies are needed.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-11-01 12:16:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>Randomised clinical trials are needed to compare interferon alpha versus placebo (or no placebo), pegylated interferon with standard interferon, to determine duration of therapy, ie, 12 months versus 18 or 24 months, to document any improvement in response with combination of newer, more powerful nucleoside or nucleotide analogues, and to evaluate combination of pegylated interferon with prenylation inhibitors or HBV/HDV virus entry inhibitors.</P>
<P>Other possible interventions ought to be assessed in chronic hepatitis D. A possible candidate could be a HBV/HDV virus entry inhibitor. In the future, trials ought to be reported according to the recommendations of CONSORT (http://www.consort-statement.org/).</P>
