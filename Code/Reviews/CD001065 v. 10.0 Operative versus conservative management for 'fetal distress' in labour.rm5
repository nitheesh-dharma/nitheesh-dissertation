<P>Too little evidence to show whether relieving factors causing a baby's distress during labour is better than birth with caesarean, forceps or ventouse intervention.</P>
<P>Babies showing signs of distress during labour (unusual heart rates or the passing of a bowel motion) are at greater risk of complications following their birth. Operative management, such as surgery to remove the baby through the woman's abdomen (caesarean delivery) or the use of surgical instruments for vaginal delivery may be offered. The review of one study (350 women) found too little evidence to show whether operative management is more beneficial than treating factors which may be causing the baby's distress, such as too little fluid surrounding the baby, the woman's physical position or pain relief (conservative management). Further research is needed.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2012-02-15 12:47:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Suspected fetal distress usually results in expedited delivery of a baby (often operatively). The potential harm to a mother and baby from operative delivery may not always be justified especially when fetal distress may be misdiagnosed. Even with a correct diagnosis it is not clear whether an operative or conservative approach is better. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this review was to assess the effects of operative management for fetal distress on maternal and perinatal morbidity.</P>

<P>One study of 350 women was included. This trial was carried out in 1959. There was no difference in perinatal mortality (risk ratio 1.18, 95% confidence interval 0.56 to 2.48).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There have been no contemporary trials of operative versus conservative management of suspected fetal distress. In settings without modern obstetric facilities, a policy of operative delivery in the event of meconium-stained liquor or fetal heart rate changes has not been shown to reduce perinatal mortality.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2012-02-15 12:48:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-07-28 14:02:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The management of 'fetal distress' during labour by expedited delivery of the baby, usually operatively, has become entrenched in obstetric practice without evidence from randomised trials of its effectiveness. Many would regard such evidence as unnecessary, because the need for expedited delivery of fetuses in 'distress' is seen as a self-evident imperative.</P>
<P>However, the value of a policy of operative delivery for 'fetal distress' can be questioned. Firstly, methods of diagnosing 'fetal distress' are far from precise. It is possible that the harm done by unnecessary interventions in falsely diagnosed cases may outweigh any benefits of the policy. Even if 'fetal distress' is correctly diagnosed, it is possible that operative delivery of a depressed infant may be more harmful than conservative management to allow time for recovery to take place in utero, particularly if aggravating factors which may have precipitated fetal compromise can be corrected. Such factors could include excessive uterine contractions, maternal supine position, oligohydramnios and adverse effects on the mother of interventions such as sedation or regional analgesia.</P>
<P>There is thus good reason to test the effectiveness of a policy of operative delivery for 'fetal distress'.</P>

<P>In the study of <LINK REF="STD-Walker-1959" TYPE="STUDY">Walker 1959</LINK>, allocation of the participants 'was determined by drawing a sealed envelope from a drum'. No data are available to assess the comparability of the two groups generated. No exclusions after allocation were recorded, and the main outcome assessed (perinatal mortality) is not subject to observer bias.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2009-07-03 15:08:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The actual operative delivery rates were strikingly different: operative policy 61% versus conservative policy 20% overall; 28% versus 7% for caesarean delivery; and 33% versus 13% for operative vaginal delivery. Operative deliveries in the conservatively managed group were for reasons other than fetal distress alone, such as cephalopelvic disproportion, intrauterine infection and pre-eclampsia. These problems, which carried a much worse prognosis, were therefore acted on in both the groups and the differences in management were largely a reflection of intervention for 'uncomplicated' fetal distress. Thirty-nine per cent of the women allocated to operative delivery had spontaneous vaginal deliveries because 'delivery was imminent' at trial entry.</P>
<P>There was no difference in perinatal mortality between groups (operative 14/174 versus conservative 12/176; risk ratio 1.18, 95% confidence interval 0.56 to 2.48).</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Unfortunately, no details are available for maternal or neonatal morbidity. Nor are details given about the causes of the perinatal deaths; it is therefore impossible to assess whether the similarity in the overall death rates reflected fewer deaths ascribed to 'asphyxia' balanced by more deaths ascribed to trauma in the intervention group. Such a reciprocity is plausible, given that 24% of the deliveries in the intervention group were achieved with the help of symphysiotomy or mid-cavity forceps. </P>
<P>While the conclusions of the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Walker-1959" TYPE="STUDY">Walker 1959</LINK> are not directly applicable to contemporary obstetric practice, they give cause to question interventionist policies for the management of suspected fetal distress which have become accepted practice without being subjected to randomized evaluation.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The changes in obstetric practice and methods of fetal evaluation since the trial of <LINK REF="STD-Walker-1959" TYPE="STUDY">Walker 1959</LINK> make it difficult to relate the results to contemporary obstetric practice. For those working in situations without modern obstetric facilities, it is useful to note that in this situation the policy of operative delivery in the event of meconium-stained liquor or fetal heart rate changes causes a considerable increase in operative deliveries, and has not been shown to reduce perinatal mortality.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Considerable scope exists for comparison of operative and conservative approaches within the 'grey areas' of the diagnosis of fetal distress by contemporary methods.</P>
