<P>In this update, published in Issue 11, 2015, the following changes were made:<BR/>1. The full search was updated to November 2014.<BR/>2. Overall, 32 new studies were identified. Of these, eight were included, 12 were excluded, eight were placed in ongoing trials and four await classification. Two further reports were identified for two already included trials. Upon identification of a trial registration document and published protocol, one study previously awaiting classification was moved to ongoing. Published protocols were found for two ongoing trials; and additional information from updated trial registration documentation added in for seven ongoing trials. Additional information for one ongoing trial resulted in its transfer from ongoing to studies awaiting classification.<BR/>3.

<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Fracture of the top end of the upper arm bone (proximal humerus) is a common injury in older people. It is often called a shoulder fracture. The bone typically fractures (breaks) just below the shoulder, usually after a fall. Most of these fractures occur without breaking the skin lying over the fracture. The injured arm is often supported in a sling until the fracture heals sufficiently to allow shoulder movement. More severe (displaced) fractures may be treated surgically. This may involve fixing the fracture fragments together by various means. Alternatively, the top of the fractured bone may be replaced (half 'shoulder' replacement: hemiarthroplasty). More rarely, the whole joint, thus including the joint socket, is replaced (total 'shoulder' replacement). Physiotherapy is often used to help restore function.</P>
<P>
<B>Results of the search</B>
</P>
<P>We searched medical databases up to November 2014 and included 31 randomised studies with a total of 1941 participants. Most of the 18 treatment comparisons were tested by one study only. The best evidence was from eight studies, one of which was a relatively large multicentre study; these investigated whether surgery gave a better result than non-surgical treatment for displaced fractures.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Nine trials evaluated non-surgical treatment in usually less severe fractures. One trial found a type of arm sling was generally more comfortable than a type of body bandage. There was some evidence that early mobilisation (within one week), compared with delayed mobilisation (after three weeks), resulted in less pain and faster recovery in people with 'stable' fractures. Two studies provided weak evidence that many patients could generally achieve a satisfactory outcome when given sufficient instruction to pursue exercises on their own.</P>
<P>Eight studies, involving 567 participants with displaced fractures, compared surgical versus non-surgical treatment. Pooled results from the five most recent trials showed that there were no important differences between the two approaches for patient-reported measures of function and quality of life at 6, 12 and 24 months. There was little difference between the two groups in mortality. Twice as many surgical group patients had additional or secondary surgery. More surgical group patients had adverse events.</P>
<P>Twelve trials (744 participants) tested different methods of surgical treatment. There was weak evidence of some differences (e.g. in complications) between some interventions (e.g. different devices or different ways of using devices).</P>
<P>There was very limited evidence suggesting similar outcomes for early versus delayed mobilisation after either surgical fixation or hemiarthroplasty.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence </B>
</P>
<P>Most of the 31 studies had weaknesses that could affect the reliability of their results. We considered that the evidence was either of high or moderate quality for the results of the surgical versus non-surgical treatment comparison, which means that we are pretty certain these results are reliable. We considered that the evidence for other comparisons was of low or very low quality, which means we are unsure of these results.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusions</B>
</P>
<P>Surgery does not result in a better outcome for the majority of people with displaced proximal humeral fractures and is likely to result in a greater need for subsequent surgery. Otherwise, there is not enough evidence to determine the best non-surgical or, when selected, surgical treatment for these fractures.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-10-31 22:29:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 31 heterogeneous RCTs (1941 participants). Most of the 18 separate treatment comparisons were tested by small single-centre trials. The main exception was the surgical versus non-surgical treatment comparison tested by eight trials. Except for a large multicentre trial, bias in these trials could not be ruled out. The quality of the evidence was either low or very low for all comparisons except the largest comparison.</P>
<P>Nine trials evaluated non-surgical treatment in mainly minimally displaced fractures. Four trials compared early (usually one week) versus delayed (three or four weeks) mobilisation after fracture but only limited pooling was possible and most of the data were from one trial (86 participants). This found some evidence that early mobilisation resulted in better recovery and less pain in people with mainly minimally displaced fractures. There was evidence of little difference between the two groups in shoulder complications (2/127 early mobilisation versus 3/132 delayed mobilisation; 4 trials) and fracture displacement and non-union (2/52 versus 1/54; 2 trials).</P>
<P>One quasi-randomised trial (28 participants) found the Gilchrist-type sling was generally more comfortable than the Desault-type sling (body bandage). One trial (48 participants) testing pulsed electromagnetic high-frequency energy provided no evidence. Two trials (62 participants) provided evidence indicating little difference in outcome between instruction for home exercises versus supervised physiotherapy. One trial (48 participants) reported, without presentable data, that home exercise alone gave better early and comparable long-term results than supervised exercise in a swimming pool plus home exercise.</P>
<P>Eight trials, involving 567 older participants, evaluated surgical intervention for displaced fractures. There was high quality evidence of no clinically important difference in patient-reported shoulder and upper-limb function at one- or two-year follow-up between surgical (primarily locking plate fixation or hemiarthroplasty) and non-surgical treatment (sling immobilisation) for the majority of displaced proximal humeral fractures; and moderate quality evidence of no clinically important difference between the two groups in quality of life at two years (and at interim follow-ups at six and 12 months). There was moderate quality evidence of little difference between groups in mortality in the surgery group (17/248 versus 12/248; risk ratio (RR) 1.40 favouring non-surgical treatment, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69 to 2.83; P = 0.35; 6 trials); only one death was explicitly linked with the treatment. There was moderate quality evidence of a higher risk of additional surgery in the surgery group (34/262 versus 16/261; RR 2.06, 95% CI 1.18 to 3.60; P = 0.01; 7 trials). Although there was moderate evidence of a higher risk of adverse events after surgery, the 95% confidence intervals for adverse events also included the potential for a greater risk of adverse events after non-surgical treatment.</P>
<P>Different methods of surgical management were tested in 12 trials. One trial (57 participants) comparing two types of locking plate versus a locking nail for treating two-part surgical neck fractures found some evidence of slightly better function after plate fixation but also of a higher rate of surgically-related complications. One trial (61 participants) comparing a locking plate versus minimally invasive fixation with distally inserted intramedullary K-wires found little difference between the two implants at two years. Compared with hemiarthroplasty, one trial (32 participants) found similar results with locking plate fixation in function and re-operation rates, whereas another trial (30 participants) reported all five re-operations occurred in the tension-band fixation group. One trial (62 participants) found better patient-rated (Quick DASH) and composite shoulder function scores at a minimum of two years follow-up and a lower incidence of re-operation and complications after reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) compared with hemiarthroplasty.</P>
<P>No important between-group differences were found in one trial (120 participants) comparing the deltoid-split approach versus deltopectoral approach for non-contact bridging plate fixation, and two trials (180 participants) comparing 'polyaxial' and 'monaxial' screws in locking plate fixation. One trial (68 participants) produced some preliminary evidence that tended to support the use of medial support locking screws in locking plate fixation. One trial (54 participants) found fewer adverse events, including re-operations, for the newer of two types of intramedullary nail. One trial (35 participants) found better functional results for one of two types of hemiarthroplasty. One trial (45 participants) found no important effects of tenodesis of the long head of the biceps for people undergoing hemiarthroplasty.</P>
<P>Very limited evidence suggested similar outcomes from early versus later mobilisation after either surgical fixation (one trial: 64 participants) or hemiarthroplasty (one trial: 49 participants).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-10-29 13:27:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Denise M Mitchell">
<P>There is high or moderate quality evidence that, compared with non-surgical treatment, surgery does not result in a better outcome at one and two years after injury for people with displaced proximal humeral fractures involving the humeral neck and is likely to result in a greater need for subsequent surgery. The evidence does not cover the treatment of two-part tuberosity fractures, fractures in young people, high energy trauma, nor the less common fractures such as fracture dislocations and head splitting fractures.</P>
<P>There is insufficient evidence from RCTs to inform the choices between different non-surgical, surgical, or rehabilitation interventions for these fractures.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-09-09 09:16:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Proximal humeral fractures account for approximately six per cent of all adult fractures (<LINK REF="REF-Court_x002d_Brown-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Court-Brown 2006</LINK>). Their incidence rapidly increases with age, and women are affected between two and three times as often as men (<LINK REF="REF-Court_x002d_Brown-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Court-Brown 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lind-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lind 1989</LINK>). Many patients who sustain a proximal humeral fracture are old and their bones are osteoporotic. <LINK REF="REF-Court_x002d_Brown-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Court-Brown 2001</LINK> found that 87% of these fractures in adults resulted from falls from standing height. <LINK REF="REF-Palvanen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palvanen 2006</LINK> found that the incidence of osteoporotic-related fractures of the proximal humerus in Finland had tripled between 1970 and 2002 to 105 per 100,000 people aged 60 or above. An epidemiological study of upper-limb fractures occurring in 2009 in the USA reported an incidence of 60 proximal humeral fractures per 100,000 people overall, with four-fold increased incidence of 253 per 100,000 in those aged 65 or older (<LINK REF="REF-Karl-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karl 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>Most proximal humeral fractures are closed fractures in that the overlying skin remains intact. The most commonly used classification of shoulder fractures is that of Neer (<LINK REF="REF-Neer-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neer 1970</LINK>). Neer considered four anatomical segments of the proximal humerus - the articular part, the greater tuberosity, the lesser tuberosity and the humeral shaft. These may be affected by fracture lines but are only considered as a 'part' if displaced by more than one centimetre or 45 degrees angulation from each other. Fractures, regardless of the number of fracture lines present, which did not meet the criteria for displacement of any one segment with respect to the others were considered 'minimally displaced'; these are sometimes referred to as one-part fractures. Neer's other categories, two-part, three-part and four-part fractures all involved the displacement or angulation of some or all of the above four segments. Each of these fracture types may be potentially associated with an anterior or posterior humeral head dislocation.</P>
<P>At initial presentation, it may be difficult to delineate the exact pathoanatomical pattern of the fracture even with sophisticated imaging. In any event, this may not correlate with the extent to which the vascularity (blood supply) of the humeral head is compromised. The vascularity of the proximal humerus is a primary focus of another widely used classification system for these fractures, the AO classification system (<LINK REF="REF-Muller-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muller 1991</LINK>), which was updated in conjunction with the OTA classification in 2007 (<LINK REF="REF-Marsh-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marsh 2007</LINK>). There are three main types (A, B, C), which in turn are further divided into three groups, each with a further three subgroups. Type A fractures are "extra-articular, unifocal, with intact vascular supply"; type B fractures are "extra-articular, bifocal, with possible vascular compromise"; and type C fractures are "articular, with a high likelihood of vascular compromise" (<LINK REF="REF-Robinson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Many proximal humeral fractures are only minimally displaced. Neer's estimate (<LINK REF="REF-Neer-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neer 1970</LINK>) that approximately 85% of all proximal humeral fractures are minimally displaced, in that no bone fragment is displaced by more than one centimetre, or angulated by more than 45 degrees is often cited (<LINK REF="REF-Koval-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koval 1997</LINK>). However, a lower figure of 49% was reported in a prospective consecutive series of over 1000 proximal humeral fractures (<LINK REF="REF-Court_x002d_Brown-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Court-Brown 2001</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-10-31 13:08:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Non-surgical (conservative) treatment is generally the accepted treatment option for minimally displaced fractures, and often used also for people with displaced fractures. Non-surgical treatment usually involves a period of immobilisation, such as in an arm sling, followed by physiotherapy and exercises. Non-surgical treatment can include closed reduction, where the displaced bone fragments are reduced using various manoeuvres while the arm is under traction. Various aspects of non-surgical treatment, such as the arm sling and collar and cuff, are illustrated online (<LINK REF="REF-AO-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">AO 2015</LINK>). Older types of bandages, such as the Desault and Velpeau, are illustrated in <LINK REF="REF-Brorson-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brorson 2011a</LINK>.</P>
<P>Surgery is usually reserved for displaced and unstable fractures and those with more complicated fracture patterns. Surgical interventions include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>closed reduction and percutaneous stabilisation using pins or wires;</LI>
<LI>external fixation;</LI>
<LI>open reduction and plating, for example buttress plates, angle blade plates and proximal humeral locking plates;</LI>
<LI>open reduction and fixation using a tension-band principle;</LI>
<LI>intramedullary nailing, either antegrade or retrograde insertion (intramedullary nails usually offer the option of locking screws, which are inserted into fracture fragments then transverse the nail, providing additional fracture stability);</LI>
<LI>hemiarthroplasty (replacement of the humeral head);</LI>
<LI>total shoulder replacement (replacement of the entire joint; both the 'ball' (humeral head) and 'socket' (glenoid)). There are two distinct types: anatomical and reverse shoulder arthroplasty. In reverse arthroplasty the joint polarity is reversed such that the ball is on glenoid side and the socket (fixed on a stem) on the humeral side.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Post-operative treatment generally involves a period of immobilisation followed by physiotherapy and exercises.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-10-31 13:10:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Immobilisation of the injured limb provides support and pain relief during healing. However, there is a risk of the shoulder becoming stiff and painful with substantial reduction of function. Subsequent physiotherapy and exercises aim to restore function and mobility of the injured (or operated) arm. Malunion of proximal humeral fractures may result in impingement or compromised function of the 'rotator cuff' of muscles and tendons that surrounds the shoulder joint. Persistent pain and painful pseudoparalysis are common indications for late surgery.</P>
<P>After reduction or repositioning of the fractured parts, surgical fixation using various techniques aims to stabilise the reduced fracture and restore joint integrity. Surgical stabilisation of the fracture may also allow earlier movement of the shoulder and elbow, preventing stiffness. Surgeons have often followed Neer's premise (<LINK REF="REF-Neer-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neer 1975</LINK>) that head avascular necrosis is virtually guaranteed in a four-part fracture and have usually offered these patients a hemiarthroplasty, where the humeral head is replaced by an artificial part. An exception is often made for a specific type of four-part fracture, the valgus impacted four-part fracture, which was not mentioned initially in Neer's classification. This fracture, where the fractured parts are compressed towards each other, is less likely to lead to avascular necrosis of the humeral head, provided the lateral displacement of the head fragment is not excessive (<LINK REF="REF-Jakob-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jakob 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Resch-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Resch 1997</LINK>). Bone quality also influences the appropriateness of any intervention and hence the long term clinical outcome. Furthermore, the patient's frailty may lead to a low rehabilitation drive and delay any recovery from both the initial trauma and any subsequent management.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-10-31 13:16:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Proximal humeral fractures are increasing in incidence, particularly in older people, and the short and long term consequences for individuals with these injuries and society are substantial (<LINK REF="REF-Palvanen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palvanen 2006</LINK>). There is considerable variation in practice, both in terms of definitive treatment such as surgical treatment for displaced fractures (<LINK REF="REF-Guy-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guy 2010</LINK>) and rehabilitation (<LINK REF="REF-Hodgson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodgson 2006</LINK>). Variation in practice includes that of the uptake of new implants, typically before their effectiveness has been evaluated, as illustrated for reverse shoulder arthoplasty in the USA (<LINK REF="REF-Schairer-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schairer 2015</LINK>). The costs of treating these fractures are also substantial and growing. The direct health-care costs, adjusted to 2007 prices, in the Netherlands of upper arm fractures, the majority of which were proximal humeral fractures, were EUR 4,440 per case with an overall annual cost of approximately EUR 40M (<LINK REF="REF-Polinder-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Polinder 2013</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Polinder-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Polinder 2013</LINK> suggested that the increase in the cost of fracture care in 'elderly women&#8217; from a previous report of costs in the Netherlands was partly because of a higher incidence of surgery. This trend to increased surgery also applies in other countries such as the USA (<LINK REF="REF-Bell-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bell 2011</LINK>). A very recently published report by the same team in the Netherlands estimated the medical costs per case in 2012, including hospitalisation, rehabilitation and nursing care, and, primarily in patients aged over 80 years, home care costs, were EUR 11,224 (<LINK REF="REF-Mahabier-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahabier 2015</LINK>). The estimated costs for lost productivity including time off work and other costs for those in work was EUR 20,374 per case in 2012. <LINK REF="REF-Schairer-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schairer 2015</LINK> found the estimated mean hospital costs in 2011 in the USA were significantly higher for reverse shoulder arthroplasty than for hemiarthroplasty (USD 21,723 versus USD 18,122), a difference which was almost three times greater when it came to mean hospital charges (USD 75,849 versus USD 65,477). The often poor treatment outcome and the increasing incidence of these fractures, the increasing use of surgery and of reverse shoulder arthoplasty (<LINK REF="REF-Han-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Han 2015</LINK>), high treatment costs and variations in practice all endorse the need for this review update.</P>
<P>The last two versions of this review noted the insufficiency of the evidence to inform practice, but also located ongoing trials that could potentially help to address this deficiency (<LINK REF="REF-Handoll-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handoll 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Handoll-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handoll 2010</LINK>).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Design</HEADING>
<P>Thirty trials were randomised clinical trials, although seven of these provided no details of their method of randomisation and thus the use of quasi-randomised methods for sequence generation cannot be ruled out (<LINK REF="STD-Cai-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Cai 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoellen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hoellen 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kristiansen-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Kristiansen 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kristiansen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Kristiansen 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lundberg-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Lundberg 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stableforth-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Stableforth 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wirbel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Wirbel 1999</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Rommens-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Rommens 1993</LINK> was a quasi-randomised trial using alternation for treatment allocation. <LINK REF="STD-Livesley-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Livesley 1992</LINK> was double-blinded. Of note is that the design of <LINK REF="STD-ProFHER-2015" TYPE="STUDY">ProFHER 2015</LINK>, a multicentre trial that compared surgical versus non-surgical treatment, was purposefully pragmatic such as in the requirement for individual surgeons to use surgical methods and implants with which they were familiar.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Sample sizes</HEADING>
<P>The 31 included trials involved a total of 1941 participants. Study size ranged from 20 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Bertoft-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Bertoft 1984</LINK>) to 250 participants (<LINK REF="STD-ProFHER-2015" TYPE="STUDY">ProFHER 2015</LINK>). One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kristiansen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Kristiansen 1989</LINK>) included one person with bilateral fractures; the treatment allocation for this participant is unclear.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Setting</HEADING>
<P>Thirty of the 31 included trials were single centre studies conducted in 13 different countries: Austria (1 trial); Belgium (1); China (3); Czech Republic (1); Denmark (2); Egypt (1); France (1); Germany (5); The Netherlands (1); Norway (1); Spain (3); Sweden (6) and UK (4). (Though essentially a single centre trial, the interventions in <LINK REF="STD-Hodgson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hodgson 2003</LINK> were undertaken at two centres within an NHS Trust in the UK.) The remaining trial was a multicentre trial conducted in the UK (<LINK REF="STD-ProFHER-2015" TYPE="STUDY">ProFHER 2015</LINK>). Details of the timing or duration or both of trial recruitment provided for 26 included trials (see the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>) show <LINK REF="STD-Stableforth-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Stableforth 1984</LINK> to have the earliest start date (1970) and longest period of recruitment (11 years).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>With the exception of one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Soliman-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Soliman 2013</LINK>), the majority of participants in each trial were women (67% to 94% of their trial population). Most participants were aged 60 and above; two trials included a small number of children (<LINK REF="STD-Livesley-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Livesley 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wirbel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Wirbel 1999</LINK>).

<P>Many trials in previous versions of this review preceded the availability of validated patient-reported outcome measures (e.g. DASH, Oxford Shoulder Score (<LINK REF="REF-Dawson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dawson 1996</LINK>)) for assessing function. From the 2012 update of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Handoll-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handoll 2012</LINK>), data for these types of outcome have become available from a growing number of trials (<LINK REF="STD-Boons-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Boons 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cai-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Cai 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fjalestad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Fjalestad 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olerud-2011a" TYPE="STUDY">Olerud 2011a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olerud-2011b" TYPE="STUDY">Olerud 2011b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ProFHER-2015" TYPE="STUDY">ProFHER 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sebasti_x00e1__x002d_Forcada-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Sebasti-Forcada 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Voigt-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Voigt 2011</LINK>). All trials except <LINK REF="STD-Ockert-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ockert 2010</LINK> assessed functioning and pain, but often reported these as part of a combined overall assessment, such as that of Neer (<LINK REF="REF-Neer-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neer 1970</LINK>) and Constant (<LINK REF="REF-Constant-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Constant 1987</LINK>), that included other measures.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Early mobilisation versus delayed mobilisation</HEADING>
<P>Although four trials compared early versus delayed mobilisation (<LINK REF="STD-Hodgson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hodgson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kristiansen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Kristiansen 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lefevre_x002d_Colau-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lefevre-Colau 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Torrens-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Torrens 2012</LINK>), the timing of the start of early mobilisation varied as, where described, did the nature and intensity of the physiotherapy provided. Notable is the long (two hour) duration of individual physiotherapy sessions of <LINK REF="STD-Lefevre_x002d_Colau-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lefevre-Colau 2007</LINK>. With three exceptions, the lack of comparable outcome measurement and data precluded data pooling and so the results of the individual trials are presented separately below.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Hodgson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hodgson 2003</LINK> compared commencing physiotherapy within one week of fracture versus delayed physiotherapy after three weeks of immobilisation in a collar and cuff sling in 86 people with minimally displaced fractures. The results, presented in <LINK REF="REF-Hodgson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodgson 2007</LINK> for self-reported shoulder disability using the Croft Shoulder Disability Questionnaire (<LINK REF="REF-Croft-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Croft 1994</LINK>), show a tendency for less disability in the early mobilisation group at one year (e.g. disability (1 or more problems): 18/42 versus 29/40; RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.88; severe disability (5 or more problems): 13/42 versus 17/40; RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.30), continuing improvement and recovery between one and two years, and also reveal that, overall, a substantial proportion of participants continued to report some or severe disability at two years (see 
<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). Results at two years for eight of the 22 questions of the Croft questionnaire are shown in <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>. These are presented to give an indication of the variety of problems experienced by these patients and the variation in the responses. There was some evidence supporting a quicker recovery in the early group as trial participants given early physiotherapy attended fewer treatment sessions (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>: mean difference (MD) -5.00 sessions; 95% (CI) -8.25 to -1.75) until they and their physiotherapists agreed that independent shoulder function had been achieved. As can be seen in <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>, participants of the early group had significantly better health-related quality-of-life scores at 16 weeks in two dimensions of the SF36 (role limitation physical: MD 22.20, 95% CI 3.82 to 40.58; and pain: MD 12.10, 95% CI 3.26 to 20.94). There were no statistically significant differences between the two treatment groups in the other six dimensions (e.g. physical functioning) of the SF36 at 16 weeks, and in all eight dimensions at one year. There were no complications arising from fracture displacement. The only recorded complication in the trial was a frozen shoulder in a participant of the delayed physiotherapy group (see 
<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>). Shoulder function, relative to the unaffected shoulder, measured using the Constant score (<LINK REF="REF-Constant-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Constant 1987</LINK>) was better at 8 and 16 weeks in the early group (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>: mean difference in ratio affected/unaffected arm 0.16; 95% CI 0.07 to 0.25). The between-group differences were smaller at one year and the confidence intervals crossed the line of no effect (MD 0.07, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.17).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Kristiansen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Kristiansen 1989</LINK>, which tested the duration of immobilisation in a sling and body bandage (one week versus three weeks) in 85 people with mainly undisplaced fractures, provided insufficient follow-up data to allow any test for statistical significance. The authors reported that while pain, function and mobility at six months and over were similar in both groups, the patients who started early mobilisation at one week suffered less pain in the first three months than those who kept their bandaging for three weeks. One case of complex regional pain syndrome type 1 (CRPS-1) occurred in each group (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Lefevre_x002d_Colau-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lefevre-Colau 2007</LINK> compared commencing physiotherapy within three days of fracture with delayed physiotherapy after three weeks of immobilisation in a sling in 74 people with minimally displaced or "stable" impacted fractures. Ten trial participants withdrew from the trial because of difficulties in reaching the hospital for treatment. Participants were discharged from physiotherapy at six months. Shoulder function measured using the Constant score was statistically significantly better in the early group at six weeks and three months (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>), with the differences probably including a clinically relevant effect; the differences at six months and end of treatment, though favouring the early group, were smaller and not statistically significant (MD 6.10, 95% CI -0.22 to 12.42). Although the early group had significantly reduced pain compared with the three weeks group by three months follow-up, there was no difference at six months (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>). Active range of motion, measured relative to the opposite arm, also did not differ significantly between the two groups at six months (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.12</LINK>). There were no cases of fracture non-union or displacement. One participant from each group received treatment for subacromial impingement (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>). All participants attended at least 70% of the supervised physiotherapy sessions; and very few expressed dissatisfaction with their treatment (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.13" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.13</LINK>).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Torrens-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Torrens 2012</LINK> compared sling immobilisation for one week versus four weeks in 42 people with minimally displaced or displaced two- or three-part fractures; all participants had the same "progressive rehabilitation" regimen. Results were reported at 3, 6 and 12 months. Participants in the four-weeks group had consistently higher quality-of-life scores (EuroQol 5D) at all three follow-ups (e.g. MD -0.09, 95% CI -0.21 to 0.03; see 
<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>). All three results include a clinically important difference in quality of life in favour of the four-weeks group but also the possibility of a much smaller and clinically unimportant effect favouring the early group. <LINK REF="STD-Torrens-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Torrens 2012</LINK> reported no complications aside from noting that the three participants (two early mobilisation versus one, four-weeks immobilisation) experiencing a "significant displacement" of their fracture did not require surgical treatment (see 
<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>
<I>)</I>. One person had died in the four-weeks group by 12 months follow-up (see 
<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>). The evidence from <LINK REF="STD-Torrens-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Torrens 2012</LINK> did not confirm differences between the two groups at any of the three follow-ups in Constant scores (see

Of note though is that the confidence intervals of the pain score results at 12 months included a clinically important difference in favour of the four-weeks group (MD 10.80, 95% CI -4.59 to 26.19); these also crossed the line of no effect.</P>
<P>The exceptions in terms of pooling were data for the adverse events, when pooled under 'shoulder complications' and 'fracture complications', for four and two trials respectively, and the secondary outcomes of pain and Constant scores available from two trials. Data pooled for reported shoulder complications that comprised frozen shoulder, CRPS-1 and treated subacromial impingement showed little difference between the two groups (2/127 versus 3/132; RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.15 to 3.63; 4 trials, 259 participants). Two trials reporting on fracture complications found no cases of non-union and only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Torrens-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Torrens 2012</LINK>) reported actual cases of fracture displacement (2/52 versus 1/54; RR 2.20, 95% CI 0.22 to 22.45; 2 trials; 106 participants). Both analyses of Constant score and pain (see 
<LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>) display evidence of statistical heterogeneity, which may in part reflect clinical heterogeneity of the contributing trials (<LINK REF="STD-Lefevre_x002d_Colau-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lefevre-Colau 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Torrens-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Torrens 2012</LINK>).</P>

Slight displacement of the fracture in the first week was reported in two participants of the Gilchrist group (see <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>).

In <LINK REF="STD-Boons-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Boons 2012</LINK>, one surgical group participant underwent revision surgery after one week because of head-stem separation. A non-surgically treated participant in <LINK REF="STD-Boons-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Boons 2012</LINK> who had surgery at 13 months, thus outside the trial's follow-up period, because of shoulder pain and impairment was not included in this analysis. In <LINK REF="STD-Fjalestad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Fjalestad 2010</LINK>, treatment failure resulting in an operation occurred in eight surgical group participants, one of whom had re-fixation plus bone grafting at six months and seven whose implants were removed because of screw penetration into the joint space; and one non-surgically treated patient, who had surgery because of fracture redisplacement at two weeks. In <LINK REF="STD-Kristiansen-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Kristiansen 1988</LINK>, the three cases of treatment failure were the removal of pins due to infection in one surgical group participant and a change of method resulting from a poor initial fracture reduction in two non-surgical group participants. The reasons for re-operations in the surgical group of <LINK REF="STD-Olerud-2011a" TYPE="STUDY">Olerud 2011a</LINK> were deep infection (two cases), non-union (one case), impingement (two cases), avascular necrosis (one case), screw penetration into joint (one case) and stiffness (two cases). One non-surgically-treated patient in <LINK REF="STD-Olerud-2011a" TYPE="STUDY">Olerud 2011a</LINK> had surgery because of impingement. Not included in this analysis is another non-surgically-treated patient with non-union who abstained from surgery partly because of a late diagnosis of axillary nerve palsy. The reasons for additional surgery in <LINK REF="STD-Olerud-2011b" TYPE="STUDY">Olerud 2011b</LINK> were screw penetration of the joint (for one patient treated with a locking plate), stiffness and impingement and displaced greater tuberosity respectively in three surgical group patients, and for complete displacement of the humeral shaft without bony contact in one non-surgically treated patient. Not included in this analysis is another non-surgically-treated patient who refused surgery for a non-union. The reasons for further surgery in the surgical group of <LINK REF="STD-ProFHER-2015" TYPE="STUDY">ProFHER 2015</LINK> were avascular necrosis (two cases), metalwork problems (seven cases) and post-traumatic stiffness (two cases). The reasons for subsequent surgery in the non-surgical treatment group of <LINK REF="STD-ProFHER-2015" TYPE="STUDY">ProFHER 2015</LINK> were avascular necrosis (one case), malunion (two cases), non-union (four cases), post-traumatic stiffness (one case), rotator cuff tear (one case), severe pain (one case) and not-reported (one case). In <LINK REF="STD-Stableforth-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Stableforth 1984</LINK>, one surgical group participant had their prosthesis removed because of a deep infection. Only <LINK REF="STD-ProFHER-2015" TYPE="STUDY">ProFHER 2015</LINK> reported on additional shoulder-related therapy, which occurred in slightly more participants of the surgery group (7/125 versus 4/125; RR 1.75 favouring non-surgical treatment, 95% CI 0.53 to 5.83; P = 0.36; see

<LINK REF="CMP-004.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.14</LINK>). <LINK REF="CMP-004.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.14</LINK> also presents the available data for individual complications. Unsurprisingly, surgery-related complications (e.g. infection and screw penetration of the joint) were predominant in the surgery treatment group. While non-union was more common in the non-surgical treatment group (P = 0.05), none of the differences between the two groups in the radiologically detected outcomes of avascular necrosis and signs of osteoarthritis were statistically significant. For avascular necrosis, data favouring surgery from <LINK REF="STD-Boons-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Boons 2012</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Olerud-2011b" TYPE="STUDY">Olerud 2011b</LINK> needs to be seen in the context that these were only likely to be detected in non-surgically treated patients, given that surgery involved the replacement of the humeral head. Additionally, some of these outcomes were without symptoms or minor in extent. For instance, in <LINK REF="STD-Fjalestad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Fjalestad 2010</LINK>, both cases of non-union in the non-surgical treatment group were without symptoms, and 22 of the 27 participants with radiographically-detected avascular necrosis were asymptomatic.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2011</LINK> compared open reduction with internal fixation using a locking plate (LPHP or PHILOS) versus a locking nail (PHN) in 57 participants with two-part surgical neck fractures. The American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeon's scores were statistically significantly better in the plate group at one year (MD 7.20; 95% CI 1.48 to 12.92) and three years (MD 4.00; 95% CI 0.01 to 7.99) (see <LINK REF="CMP-005.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.1</LINK>). The clinical importance of these findings, however, is uncertain given the MCID for ASES is included only in the 95% CI at one year follow-up. One participant of the nail group died of unrelated causes. While complications were not described in full, significantly more patients in the plate group had a complication (9/29 versus 1/28; RR 8.69, 95% CI 1.18 to 64.19; see <LINK REF="CMP-005.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.2</LINK>).

The account of the complications seemed incomplete, with no indication of how many required a re-operation but this was perhaps partly due to difficulties in translation from Czech to English.

 The recorded nature of the complications reflected the type of implant, with four cases of screw protrusion in the plate group that resulted in impingement and migration of K-wires, a distal humeral fracture and a nerve injury in the Zifko group. <LINK REF="STD-Smejkal-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Smejkal 2011</LINK> found no difference between the two groups in Constant scores relative to the healthy limb at a mean two years follow-up (MD -0.81%, 95% CI -7.45% to 5.83%; see <LINK REF="CMP-006.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.2</LINK>). Three participants of each group had a 'poor' Constant score. <LINK REF="CMP-006.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.3</LINK> shows there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in time to union (MD 2.10 weeks, 95% CI -2.25 to 6.45 weeks) or in a vaguely-described measure of time to recover normal upper limb function (27.2 versus 21.4 weeks; MD 5.80 weeks; 95% CI -0.16 to 11.76 weeks). <LINK REF="STD-Smejkal-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Smejkal 2011</LINK> suggested that the greater time to recover in the plate group reflected a greater impact of complications in this group.

The relative (compared with the patient's uninjured shoulder) individual Constant score results were 70.4% (range 38% to 102%) for the EPOCA group versus 46.2% (range 15% to 80%) for the HAS group (reported P = 0.001). Reported complications were two patients with deep infection in the EPOCA group, two patients with persistent pain scheduled for a reoperation in the HAS group (see <LINK REF="CMP-013.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 13.1</LINK>), and a periprosthetic fracture that occurred in one of the three patients who had died by one year. Radiological findings, except for heterotopic ossification where there were contradictory data, are shown in <LINK REF="CMP-013.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 13.2</LINK>. These tended to favour the EPOCA prosthesis. <LINK REF="STD-Fialka-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Fialka 2008</LINK> noted some association between the bony resorption of the tuberosities and a decreased Constant outcome score. Results for range of motion are shown in <LINK REF="CMP-013.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 13.3</LINK>.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Hemiarthroplasty: tenodesis of the long head of the biceps (LHB) versus LHB tendon left intact</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Soliman-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Soliman 2013</LINK> compared tenodesis of the LHB versus leaving the LHB tendon intact in 45 people undergoing hemiarthroplasty. By deduction from the study report, four participants in each group were excluded because they had a complication within three months of follow-up. These were reported to be tuberosity malposition (three participants); inferior subluxation of the prosthesis (two participants), loss of reduction of the greater tuberosity (two participants) and deep infection that required surgical debridement (one participant). Data for complications split by treatment group are shown in <LINK REF="CMP-014.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 14.1</LINK>. Of these complications, only deep infection resulted in further surgery. At two years, the difference between the two groups in the Constant scores in favour of the tenodesis group was below the MCID and thus unlikely to be clinically important (MD 4.60, 95% CI 0.38 to 8.82; see <LINK REF="CMP-014.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 14.2</LINK>). Three participants reported mild pain in the tenodesis group and six participants reported pain (four mild and two moderate pain) in the tendon intact group (3/19 versus 6/18; RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.62; see 
<LINK REF="CMP-014.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 14.3</LINK>). Both participants with moderate pain went on to have a mini-open biceps tenodesis at 18 and 28 months after diagnosis of an inflamed and scarred biceps tendon. There was no difference between the two groups in active shoulder elevation results at two years (see

<LINK REF="STD-Wirbel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Wirbel 1999</LINK> tested the duration of immobilisation (one week versus three weeks) before starting physiotherapy after closed reduction and percutaneous fixation of displaced fractures in 77 patients. <LINK REF="STD-Wirbel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Wirbel 1999</LINK> reported that there were no statistically significant differences between the two trial groups in their functional results, assessed using the Neer score, at 3, 6 or at an average of 14.2 months. Data provided for unsatisfactory or worse outcome, as defined by the Neer score, at six months are consistent with this claim (see <LINK REF="CMP-015.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 15.1</LINK>: 9/32 versus 10/32; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.92; 64 participants). Premature removal of Kirschner wires because of loosening occurred in the five people in each group (see 
<LINK REF="CMP-015.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 15.2</LINK>); these results, however, were not provided for the whole study population nor was it reported the treatment groups of five people who underwent open revision or hemiarthroplasty. Though similar numbers (three versus two) of people underwent removal of screws due to subacromial impingement after six months, the numbers of people in each group whose displaced tuberosity fractures were fixed with cannulated screws were not reported.

<P>mThis review, which covers all non-pharmacological treatment and rehabilitation interventions for proximal humeral fractures in adults, now includes 31 trials involving a total of 1941 participants. The only multicentre trial recruited 250 participants (<LINK REF="STD-ProFHER-2015" TYPE="STUDY">ProFHER 2015</LINK>). With the increased availability of trials, we have been able to undertake further pooling of data compared with the last version, but this is still limited to four comparisons. We have undertaken substantive pooling in only one comparison, that of surgical versus non-surgical treatment, including patient-reported outcome measures of function and quality of life. This is presented first, below. The main results of the comparisons falling within the three other main treatment categories are then presented in turn. Where data allow, we have given the main results of individual comparisons in terms of the listed <LINK TAG="CRIT_OUTCOMES_PRIMARY" TYPE="SECTION">Primary outcomes</LINK>.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Surgical treatment versus non-surgical treatment</HEADING>
<P>Eight heterogeneous trials, with a total of 567 participants and 568 predominantly displaced fractures evaluated surgical intervention for displaced fractures, of which 73% (415) were three- or four-part fractures (Neer classification). Of note is that the majority of the fractures (146/250 = 58.4%) in <LINK REF="STD-ProFHER-2015" TYPE="STUDY">ProFHER 2015</LINK> were either two-part (128) or one-part (18) fractures; the other seven two-part fractures were included in <LINK REF="STD-Kristiansen-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Kristiansen 1988</LINK>. <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> summarises the main fracture types, the interventions and length of follow-up of the individual trials. Six trials specifically limited their trial populations to older people. Although <LINK REF="STD-ProFHER-2015" TYPE="STUDY">ProFHER 2015</LINK> recruited adults of any age, the majority of trial participants were over 65 years (142/250 = 57%). Data for patient-reported functional scores and quality-of-life scores were available from the five more recent trials that are thus more likely to represent current practice. The main results of this comparison are presented in <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>. The results apply to the majority of displaced proximal humeral fractures involving the surgical neck, but note should be taken of clear exceptions, such as where surgery is required for severe soft-tissue compromise, as well as the exclusion of fracture-dislocations, in <LINK REF="STD-ProFHER-2015" TYPE="STUDY">ProFHER 2015</LINK>. There was high quality evidence of no clinically important difference in patient-reported shoulder and upper-limb function at one- or two-year follow-up between surgical (primarily locking plate fixation or hemiarthroplasty) and non-surgical treatment (sling 'immobilisation') for the majority of displaced proximal humeral fractures. There was moderate quality evidence of no clinically important difference between the two groups in quality of life at two years. While this observation applied to interim follow-ups at six and 12 months, pooled data from four studies at six months showed a statistically significant effect. There was moderate quality evidence of little difference between the groups in mortality: although there were slightly more deaths in the surgery group, the 95% confidence interval also included the potential for a higher mortality after non-surgical treatment. Also of note is that, where reported, only one death was explicitly linked with treatment (surgery). There was moderate quality evidence of a higher risk of additional surgery in the surgery group: based on an illustrative risk of 40 subsequent operations per 1000 non-surgically treated patients, this amounts to an extra 43 subsequent operations per 1000 surgically treated patients (95% CI 7 to 104 more). There was also moderate quality evidence of a higher overall risk of adverse events after surgery; however, the 95% confidence intervals for adverse events also included the potential for a greater risk of adverse events after non-surgical treatment.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Methods of non-surgical management (including rehabilitation)</HEADING>
<P>Non-surgical management, generally involving a period of arm immobilisation followed by physiotherapy, of (mainly) minimally displaced fractures is the focus of nine trials. Exceptionally, <LINK REF="STD-Torrens-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Torrens 2012</LINK> included a higher percentage of displaced fractures (81% = 34/42 fractures). There was a general recognition of the impaired function and serious complications, such as complex regional pain syndromes, that could follow a proximal humeral fracture.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Initial treatment, including immobilisation</HEADING>
<P>When considering the extent and duration of initial immobilisation after a fracture, a balance is needed between the advantages of pain relief and avoidance of fracture displacement, and the consequences of immobilisation, notably joint stiffness and muscle atrophy.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Early versus delayed mobilisation</HEADING>
<P>Of the four heterogeneous trials comparing early versus delayed mobilisation for minimally displaced or displaced fractures (<LINK REF="STD-Hodgson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hodgson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kristiansen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Kristiansen 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lefevre_x002d_Colau-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lefevre-Colau 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Torrens-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Torrens 2012</LINK>), only limited data, mainly for secondary outcomes, could be pooled from <LINK REF="STD-Lefevre_x002d_Colau-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lefevre-Colau 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Torrens-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Torrens 2012</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK> summarises the data relating to primary outcome measures for early versus delayed mobilisation in non-surgically treated fractures. With the exception of adverse event data provided by all four trials, most of these data are from <LINK REF="STD-Hodgson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hodgson 2003</LINK>. There was low quality evidence in favour of early mobilisation in terms of fewer people with shoulder problems at one year, of the need for fewer sessions of physiotherapy to achieve independent function, and of a better quality of life at 16 weeks in terms of less pain and less limitation of physical function. There was low quality evidence of no difference between early and delayed mobilisation in physical and pain aspects of quality of life at one year. There was very low quality evidence of no clinically important between-group differences in quality-of-life scores for people with mainly displaced fractures. There was very low quality evidence of little difference between the two groups in shoulder complications and fracture displacement and non-union; the incidences of individual complications were low.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Type of bandage</HEADING>
<P>The one quasi-randomised trial (28 participants with mainly minimally displaced fractures) provided very low quality evidence on the relative effects of two types of bandages, the Gilchrist arm sling versus the Desault body bandage (<LINK REF="STD-Rommens-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Rommens 1993</LINK>). There was no report of PROMS nor data to support the claims of no between-group differences in functional outcome or fracture healing. More participants found the arm sling comfortable and acceptable compared with the body bandage.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Instructions for home exercises versus physiotherapy</HEADING>
<P>Two small trials including a total of 62 participants with minimally displaced fractures compared home exercises after receiving instructions versus supervised physiotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Bertoft-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Bertoft 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lundberg-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Lundberg 1979</LINK>). Neither trial reported on PROMS for function or quality of life. There was very low quality evidence from single trials of little difference between the two groups in pain, change of therapy, adverse events, and range of motion.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Supervised exercises in a swimming pool plus home exercises versus home exercises alone</HEADING>
<P>The trial making this comparison in 48 participants with minimally displaced fractures did not provide evidence that could be presented or tested in the analyses (<LINK REF="STD-Revay-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Revay 1992</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Revay-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Revay 1992</LINK> claimed that the self-treatment group had better activities of daily living and joint mobility in the first two to three months but that the two groups had similar results at one year. <LINK REF="STD-Revay-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Revay 1992</LINK> suggested that the supervised group had neglected their home exercises, which effectively undermines the aim of this trial.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Livesley-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Livesley 1992</LINK> hypothesised that pain was associated with contracture of the capsule of the glenohumeral joint and that PHFE would reduce inflammation and swelling, improving the end functional result.

<P>There is very low quality evidence from one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2011</LINK>: 57 participants with two-part surgical neck fractures) of marginally better function (higher American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeon's scores) and slightly less pain after locking plate fixation compared with locking nail fixation at one year but not at three years. There was very low quality evidence of a higher rate of complications, including re-operation for screw penetration into the humeral head after plate fixation.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Open reduction with internal fixation using a locking plate versus minimally invasive fixation with distally inserted intramedullary K-wires</HEADING>

<P>With minimal opportunity for pooling, data from two small heterogeneous trials testing this comparison were presented separately.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Hemiarthroplasty versus open reduction and locking plate fixation</HEADING>
<P>The very low quality evidence from one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Cai-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Cai 2012</LINK>: 32 participants with four-part fractures) of lower DASH scores (better function) and slightly higher EQ-5D scores (better quality of life) at one and two years may not equate to clinically important differences in either of these outcomes between hemiarthroplasty and locking plate fixation. Three participants in each group had a re-operation.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Hemiarthroplasty versus tension band wiring</HEADING>
<P>There is very low quality evidence from one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hoellen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hoellen 1997</LINK>: 30 participants with four-part fractures) of no differences between the two groups in the Constant scores or pain (18 participants). At one-year follow-up, all five reoperations occurred in the fixation group.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Reverse shoulder arthroplasty versus hemiarthroplasty</HEADING>
<P>There is low quality evidence from one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Sebasti_x00e1__x002d_Forcada-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Sebasti-Forcada 2014</LINK>: 62 participants with either three- or four-part fractures) of better patient-rated (Quick DASH) and composite shoulder function scores (UCLA and Constant scores) at a minimum of two years follow-up in the reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) group. Although a condition-specific minimal clinically important difference is not available for QuickDASH, it is likely that the difference would have been clinically important to some extent. The clinically important differences favouring RSA in the Constant and UCLA scores will in part reflect the greater range of motion in the RSA group. Fewer people in the reverse arthroplasty group had a re-operation (one versus six) or had a complication (two versus 10).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Locking plate: use of medial locking screws</HEADING>
<P>There is very low quality evidence from one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2011</LINK>: 68 participants with two-, three- or four-part fractures) of medial locking screws resulting in fewer early losses of fixation and re-operations. However, the 95% CI results also included a higher risk of re-operations in the medial locking screws group. Based on the control risk of 154 re-operations per 1000 participants, medial locking screws resulted in 120 fewer re-operations (95% CI 149 fewer to 117 more). Although the medial screw group had statistically significantly higher Constant scores at 31-month follow-up, only part of the 95% CI included the minimal clinically important difference.</P>

<P>There is low quality evidence from one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lopiz-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Lopiz 2014</LINK>: 54 participants with two- or three-part fractures) of fewer adverse events, including re-operations and impingement, for the MPHN nail compared with the Polarus nail. Based on the control (Polarus nail) group risk of 423 re-operations per 1000 participants, the MPHN resulted in 308 fewer re-operations (95% CI 55 to 385 fewer). Of note is the very low quality evidence, as half as many participants in the MPHN group had rotator cuff symptoms.

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-10-31 21:11:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To inform consideration of applicability of the evidence from individual trials, we give quite extensive details in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> on the study populations and interventions. Additionally, <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> shows our assessments for each trial of four aspects of relevance to ascertaining external validity: definition of the study population, description of the interventions, definition of primary outcome measures and length of follow-up. Clearly unhelpful is where there are incomplete descriptions of study inclusion (10 trials) and interventions (five trials). Five trials had less than one year's follow-up: <LINK REF="STD-Lefevre_x002d_Colau-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lefevre-Colau 2007</LINK> (six months), <LINK REF="STD-Livesley-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Livesley 1992</LINK> (six months), <LINK REF="STD-Ockert-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ockert 2010</LINK> (six months) and <LINK REF="STD-Rommens-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Rommens 1993</LINK> (until fracture consolidation - time unspecified). Additionally, the minimum follow-up was six months in <LINK REF="STD-Lopiz-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Lopiz 2014</LINK>. Despite the claims of longer follow-up, the results seemed to apply to six months at most in <LINK REF="STD-Stableforth-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Stableforth 1984</LINK>. In <LINK REF="STD-Wirbel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Wirbel 1999</LINK>, though follow-up of 21 participants was more than two years, the main results applied to the set follow-up at six months. Our setting of our criterion to one-year follow-up as acceptable is arbitrary and mainly reflects a reasonable timing for assessment of function. However, it should be noted that in terms of a full outcome assessment, data at one-year follow-up must be considered preliminary results only given that complications such as avascular necrosis and device failure may not become evident until later and functional recovery can still be ongoing.</P>
<P>The measurement of outcome was variable, though generally comprehensive. In most of the older trials, there was frequent use of non-validated or, at best, partly validated scoring systems such as the Neer (<LINK REF="REF-Neer-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neer 1970</LINK>) and Constant (<LINK REF="REF-Constant-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Constant 1987</LINK>) systems, but also of simple rating systems for individual outcomes. Validated schemes such as the Oxford Shoulder Score (<LINK REF="REF-Dawson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dawson 1996</LINK>) and Shoulder Rating Questionnaire (<LINK REF="REF-L_x0027_Insalata-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">L'Insalata 1997</LINK>) for subjective assessment of symptoms and function were not available at the time for the trials in earlier versions of this review. Nonetheless, some consideration of interobserver reproducibility and other aspects of validity was evident in the establishment of the Constant score in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Lundberg-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Lundberg 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zyto-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Zyto 1997</LINK>). Non-validated outcome assessment schemes, often with arbitrary criteria for grading overall outcome (excellent, good, fair, poor), are probably best viewed as 'blunt' and flawed instruments. This needs to be noted when viewing the results of many of the older included trials; in particular <LINK REF="STD-Kristiansen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Kristiansen 1989</LINK>, whose outcome assessment is almost completely based on the Neer scoring system. As noted also in our 2012 update, more recent trials continue to be better in this respect. Four of the eight newly included trials reported on PROMS for function: for example, <LINK REF="STD-Boons-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Boons 2012</LINK> reported on the Simple Shoulder test; <LINK REF="STD-Cai-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Cai 2012</LINK> on DASH; <LINK REF="STD-ProFHER-2015" TYPE="STUDY">ProFHER 2015</LINK>, the Oxford Shoulder Score; and <LINK REF="STD-Sebasti_x00e1__x002d_Forcada-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Sebasti-Forcada 2014</LINK>, the QuickDASH. The continued use of the Constant score is notable, being reported by the newly included trials with the exception of <LINK REF="STD-ProFHER-2015" TYPE="STUDY">ProFHER 2015</LINK>, which did not conduct additional clinical examinations for the collection of such data.</P>
<P>The majority of the trials used Neer's fracture classification (<LINK REF="REF-Neer-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neer 1970</LINK>). Problems, such as poor interobserver reproducibility and intraobserver reliability, with the classification of fractures according to the Neer and AO systems have been shown for both radiographs and computerised tomographic scans (<LINK REF="REF-Bernstein-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernstein 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brorson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brorson 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sidor-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sidor 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Siebenrock-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siebenrock 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sjoden-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sjoden 1997</LINK>). This variation in the classification of fractures and hence diagnosis needs to be considered when interpreting the results of trials, both in respect to the comparability and composition of the intervention groups and in the applicability of the trial's findings. The limitations of the Neer classification scheme were also demonstrated by the identification of the valgus impacted four-part fracture as a separate category with a lower risk of avascular necrosis (<LINK REF="REF-Jakob-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jakob 1991</LINK>). Ideally a fracture classification system should act as a guide to treatment as well to enable the comparison of results from studies of patients with similar fracture patterns. However, other factors, such as osteoporotic bone, associated soft tissue injury and the patient's overall health and motivation, will also influence treatment choices and outcome. A recent study (<LINK REF="REF-Brorson-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brorson 2012</LINK>) looking at the agreement of surgeons' treatment recommendations in conjunction with the Neer classification concluded that the low observer agreement on the Neer classification may have less clinical importance than previously assumed. However, it noted that inter-observer agreement on treatment did not exceed moderate levels. The purposefully pragmatic inclusion criteria used in <LINK REF="STD-ProFHER-2015" TYPE="STUDY">ProFHER 2015</LINK> is noteworthy in this regard. These stipulated that the degree of displacement had to be sufficient for the treating surgeon to consider surgical intervention but did not have to meet the displacement criteria of Neer for inclusion in the trial. Post-recruitment classification by two independent surgeons of the baseline X-rays, resulted in the identification of 18 one-part fractures (see 
<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Nonetheless these exceptions were judged sufficiently displaced that they would have been considered for surgical intervention in practice; where the exact observation of Neer's arbitrary criteria is rare.</P>
<P>While it is possible that all 31 trials are relevant to current practice somewhere in the world, it is likely that some interventions are now rarely used. These include body bandages as tested in <LINK REF="STD-Rommens-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Rommens 1993</LINK>. Nowadays it is much more common practice to use either a 'collar and cuff' sling or a 'poly-sling' (these incorporate a chest strap that can be passed around the body). Additionally, the applicability of the findings from older trials, such as <LINK REF="STD-Stableforth-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Stableforth 1984</LINK>, is potentially less given subsequent changes in practice including the availability of new implants. These include locking plates, which are being increasingly used and promoted for these fractures (<LINK REF="REF-Thanasas-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thanasas 2009</LINK>). Previously, we noted that the increasing use of locking plates for these fractures was reflected in the use of locking plates in more recently included trials (<LINK REF="REF-Handoll-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handoll 2012</LINK>). Another more recent development has been the use of reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA), typically for more complex four-part fractures in older people. This was tested in a newly included trial (<LINK REF="STD-Sebasti_x00e1__x002d_Forcada-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Sebasti-Forcada 2014</LINK>), with evidence pending from three ongoing trials comparing RSA with hemiarthroplasty (<LINK REF="STD-NTR3208" TYPE="STUDY">NTR3208</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NCT02075476" TYPE="STUDY">NCT02075476</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SHeRPA" TYPE="STUDY">SHeRPA</LINK>), one ongoing trial comparing RSA with plating (<LINK REF="STD-DELPHI" TYPE="STUDY">DELPHI</LINK>) and one ongoing trial comparing two types of RSA (<LINK REF="STD-NCT01086202" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01086202</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comments on individual comparisons</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Surgical treatment versus non-surgical treatment</HEADING>
<P>In our previous commentary for this comparison we noted that "Trials comparing surgical versus non-surgical interventions, or indeed different surgical interventions, risk losing currency as different implants and methods become available and fashionable." (<LINK REF="REF-Handoll-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handoll 2012</LINK>). We also noted the impact of surgical decision-making in favour of locking plating systems, which allow for stronger constructs and fixation of more complex fracture patterns in osteopenic bone with the potential for less soft-tissue stripping and compromise to the blood supply (<LINK REF="REF-Thanasas-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thanasas 2009</LINK>). More recently for more complex (predominantly four-part) fractures, reverse shoulder arthroplasty is being promoted, as illustrated by its increasing use, for instance in the USA (<LINK REF="REF-Han-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Han 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schairer-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schairer 2015</LINK>). These illustrate how evolving technology (and marketing forces) mitigates against applying the findings of these types of trials. However, more emphasis can be given to the evidence from the five more recent trials (<LINK REF="STD-Boons-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Boons 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fjalestad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Fjalestad 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olerud-2011a" TYPE="STUDY">Olerud 2011a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olerud-2011b" TYPE="STUDY">Olerud 2011b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ProFHER-2015" TYPE="STUDY">ProFHER 2015</LINK>), all of which report patient-reported outcome measures of function and quality of life. When considering the validity and applicability of surgical trials, account needs to be taken also of fundamental variations in surgical practice, including facilities and operator expertise. In particular, operator expertise and the linked issue of the surgical learning curve, play a pivotal role in the validity and applicability of surgical trial findings. Awareness of these issues was behind the pragmatic decision in <LINK REF="STD-ProFHER-2015" TYPE="STUDY">ProFHER 2015</LINK> for surgeons to use methods with which they are familiar rather than stipulate the type of surgery. Indeed, the pragmatic multicentre design of <LINK REF="STD-ProFHER-2015" TYPE="STUDY">ProFHER 2015</LINK>, including the constant emphasis on good standard practice and surgery by experienced surgeons (predominantly consultants), means that its results have immediate applicability at least in the setting where it was conducted (UK NHS trauma hospitals) and most likely in many other countries with similar surgical practice.</P>
<P>Because of the dominance of the evidence from <LINK REF="STD-ProFHER-2015" TYPE="STUDY">ProFHER 2015</LINK>, particular note should be taken of its exclusion criteria (such as of fracture dislocations and two-part greater tuberosity fractures and other patterns not involving the surgical neck) and its study population, the composition of which shows the treatment uncertainty covered by this trial applied to the majority of displaced fractures of the proximal humerus. Additionally the lack of subgroup differences in <LINK REF="STD-ProFHER-2015" TYPE="STUDY">ProFHER 2015</LINK>, either for age (threshold of 65 years) or fracture type (tuberosity involvement or not; or Neer one- or two-part versus three- or four-part) strengthens the case for not differentiating treatment (use of surgery) on the basis of these characteristics. Nonetheless, in this trial and the other seven trials, six of which purposefully excluded younger adults, the evidence is predominantly from older people. This reflects the population distribution for these fractures (<LINK REF="REF-Karl-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karl 2015</LINK>) but also the population for which the main treatment uncertainty applies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Initial treatment, including immobilisation</HEADING>
<P>Most of the evidence for the comparison of early versus delayed mobilisation came from <LINK REF="STD-Hodgson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hodgson 2003</LINK> and thus applies primarily to the less severe fractures (minimally displaced two-part fractures). A survey sent to senior hospital physiotherapists working directly with orthopaedic patients revealed large variation in rehabilitation, in particular with regards to routine immobilisation, duration of immobilisation and timing of first contact with a physiotherapist, within and between hospitals in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Hodgson-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodgson 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hodgson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodgson 2006</LINK>). A survey sent to the participating centres of <LINK REF="STD-ProFHER-2015" TYPE="STUDY">ProFHER 2015</LINK>, which included displaced fractures, found the recommended duration of arm immobilisation for non-surgically treated patients ranged from two to six weeks, with 29 (91%) of 32 UK hospitals recommending immobilisation of &#8805; 3 weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Handoll-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handoll 2015</LINK>). This variation also needs to be viewed in the context of the type of arm immobilisation used, as methods such as collar and cuff provide support rather than rigid immobilisation. As noted by <LINK REF="REF-McKee-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKee 2007</LINK> in his commentary on <LINK REF="STD-Lefevre_x002d_Colau-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lefevre-Colau 2007</LINK>, the applicability of this trial is limited by the intensive physiotherapy regimen used in both groups. Both practically and financially the 32 two-hour sessions of physiotherapy may be difficult for patients and health providers; notably, 10 participants withdrew from the trial because of difficulties in attending. In contrast, the mean numbers of treatment sessions in <LINK REF="STD-Hodgson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hodgson 2003</LINK> were nine and 14 respectively in the two groups.</P>
<P>As stated above the body bandages tested in <LINK REF="STD-Rommens-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Rommens 1993</LINK>, which compared the Gilchrist arm sling with the Desault body bandage, is rarely used in practice. The above-mentioned survey of practice carried out as part of <LINK REF="STD-ProFHER-2015" TYPE="STUDY">ProFHER 2015</LINK> confirms this in the UK, where 'collar and cuff' slings, poly-slings and more rarely broad-arm slings are used (<LINK REF="REF-Handoll-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handoll 2010</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Continuing management (rehabilitation) after initial treatment involving sling immobilisation</HEADING>
<P>The three trials in this category that examined supervised versus home exercises were based in Sweden and possible differences in conventional physiotherapy regimens within and between countries, then and now, need to be taken into account when considering the application of trial findings. If they work, self-instruction and home-based exercise programmes are attractive for patients and conserve health care resources. There is some evidence from a Cochrane Review on fall prevention that older people, if well instructed and with intensive support (regular phone calls etc), can maintain a home-based exercise programme (<LINK REF="REF-Gillespie-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillespie 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gillespie-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillespie 2009</LINK>). However, there will still be some patients with insufficient understanding or motivation to perform the required exercises.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Different methods of surgical management</HEADING>
<P>Most of the recent research activity, in both published and registered trials, evaluates different types of surgery. We now distinguish between trials comparing different categories of surgical interventions (tested by five trials) and trials comparing different methods of performing an intervention in the same category (tested by seven trials).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Comparisons of different categories of surgical intervention</HEADING>
<P>The variety of available implants in the same category can limit the applicability and usefulness of trials comparing different categories of surgical intervention by comparisons of specific implants. Nonetheless, the comparison by <LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2011</LINK> of one of two locking plates versus a locking nail is very pertinent in terms of providing a useful investigation of the appropriateness of the current trend from locking nails to plates. This trial is too small to establish the superiority of one method over the other but it does provide some evidence of better function in the plate group at one year, and possibly for longer, although at a potentially greater risk of surgical complications and initially more invasive surgery. The comparison by <LINK REF="STD-Smejkal-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Smejkal 2011</LINK> of a locking plate versus minimally invasive fixation with distally inserted multiple intramedullary K-wires (the Zifko method of minimally invasive fixation) is of relevance to current practice but, while data from <LINK REF="STD-Smejkal-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Smejkal 2011</LINK> lend support to the use of the Zifko method in terms of it being a less extensive surgical procedure with potentially an earlier recovery than plate fixation, there were inadequate data on longer term function and outcome.</P>
<P>Again, the trial comparing hemiarthroplasty versus open reduction and locking plate fixation was too small to inform practice (<LINK REF="STD-Cai-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Cai 2012</LINK>). The absence of intraoperative conversions for the open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) group to hemiarthroplasty or early failures is notable for a series of 13 displaced four-part fractures and fracture-dislocations and may indicate differences in assessing and dealing with problematic or failed fixation in this centre compared with other centres. <LINK REF="STD-Hoellen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hoellen 1997</LINK>, a flawed trial with only one-year follow-up, considered only one of several shoulder prostheses now available (the prosthesis was cemented in place) in their comparison with tension band wiring.</P>
<P>The comparison of reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) versus hemiarthroplasty tested in <LINK REF="STD-Sebasti_x00e1__x002d_Forcada-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Sebasti-Forcada 2014</LINK> is very topical, as shown also by the three ongoing trials that are making the same comparison (<LINK REF="STD-NCT02075476" TYPE="STUDY">NCT02075476</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NTR3208" TYPE="STUDY">NTR3208</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SHeRPA" TYPE="STUDY">SHeRPA</LINK>). The prostheses compared within each of these four trials come from only one manufacturer. However, the three ongoing trials examines prosthesis from three different manufacturers. Prostheses made by different manufacturers will differ to some extent; however, the variation between prostheses from different manufacturers is likely to be of lesser importance clinically than the large differences between RSA and hemiarthroplasty. In terms of applicability, <LINK REF="STD-Sebasti_x00e1__x002d_Forcada-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Sebasti-Forcada 2014</LINK> is mainly limited by being a single-centre trial with the participants being operated on by two surgeons.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Comparisons of different methods of performing an intervention in the same category</HEADING>
<P>The trial (<LINK REF="STD-Buecking-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Buecking 2014</LINK>) comparing two approaches (deltoid-split approach versus deltopectoral) for non-contact bridging plate fixation had two notable limitations in terms of external validity. One was the absence of criteria for excluding patients for whom hemiarthroplasty was planned. The second was the inappropriate interpretation of the Lawson quality-of-life score. The two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Ockert-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ockert 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Voigt-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Voigt 2011</LINK>) comparing 'polyaxial' (where surgeons had greater control in their positioning of screws into the bone) versus 'monoaxial' locking plate fixation found no difference between the two methods. With no report of functional outcome, <LINK REF="STD-Ockert-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ockert 2010</LINK> contributed relatively little to this question. <LINK REF="STD-Voigt-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Voigt 2011</LINK>, which was a stronger trial but still insufficient to be conclusive, pointed out that the "majority of surgeons chose the same screw directions for the polyaxial screws as already exist in the fixed angle plate". In their 2014 publication, <LINK REF="STD-Ockert-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ockert 2010</LINK> also found that polyaxial screws were placed similarly to monoaxial screws. Of note also is the differences in the types of screws in the two implants in <LINK REF="STD-Voigt-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Voigt 2011</LINK>, which could in some respects alter the question. <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2011</LINK> tested the use of medial support locking screws for fixation using the PHILOS locking plate. While <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2011</LINK> did not provide conclusive evidence of clinical benefit of the enhanced stabilisation of this commonly used plate, the direction of effect is consistent with the theoretical advantages for medial support screws.</P>
<P>In their comparison of the MultiLoc Proximal Humeral Nail (MPHN) versus the Polarus nail, <LINK REF="STD-Lopiz-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Lopiz 2014</LINK> found the newer "straight" nail (the MPHN) resulted in fewer adverse events (screw loosening, impingement, rotator cuff symptoms) than the "curved" Polarus nail. This is plausible given the different design features of the MPHN that attempt to avoid the various problems, including impingement, that have been identified when using the Polarus nail. However, some consideration is also required of the rather high incidence of adverse events for the Polarus nail and the general inadequacies of tests for rotator cuff symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Hanchard-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanchard 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Fialka-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Fialka 2008</LINK> compared two shoulder prostheses but although the authors ascribed the different functional outcomes to tuberosity fixation, other design differences may account for these results. These include a different stem finish and a more accurate recreation of pre-operative humeral geometry with the EPOCA prosthesis. The study population of <LINK REF="STD-Soliman-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Soliman 2013</LINK>, which compared tenodesis of the long head of the biceps (LHB) versus LHB tendon left intact in people undergoing hemiarthroplasty, was exceptional in being younger (aged 45 to 60 years) than all other trial populations in this review and younger than the population for whom hemiarthroplasty is more typically used. Although the inclusion criteria included more severe injuries such as head-splitting fractures, <LINK REF="STD-Soliman-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Soliman 2013 </LINK>provided insufficient criteria on which to judge participant suitability for hemiarthroplasty. Additionally of note, is the absence of spontaneous ruptures of the long head of biceps.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Continuing management (including rehabilitation) after surgical intervention</HEADING>
<P>The need for and duration of immobilisation before commencing physiotherapy after surgical treatment is likely to depend on the method of fixation or type of prosthesis; and also other factors such as bone quality. While neither trial (<LINK REF="STD-Agorastides-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Agorastides 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wirbel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Wirbel 1999</LINK>) found conclusive evidence for early mobilisation, such as offering any functional advantage, it can also be observed that the evidence was inconclusive for later mobilisation too, such as avoiding destabilisation of the fracture fixation after percutaneous fixation or tuberosity fixation after hemiarthroplasty.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-10-31 21:33:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As noted in <LINK REF="REF-Handoll-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handoll 2012</LINK> and continues to apply in this update, more recent trials generally have better study design (e.g. they have appropriate random sequence generation and allocation concealment, and thus are at low risk of selection bias) and reporting (e.g. including participant flow diagrams). Nonetheless, as shown by <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>, many of the included trials had serious shortcomings and are at high risk of bias that could affect the validity of their findings. The main but generally unavoidable shortcoming in trials testing physical and surgical interventions was the lack of blinding, which is unavoidable to a great degree. Twenty-one trials were considered at high risk of outcome assessment bias for function and other subjective outcomes. The risk of bias resulting from a high loss to follow-up or exclusion of participants from the analyses was considered high in 13 trials, two of which were new to this version (<LINK REF="STD-Buecking-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Buecking 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soliman-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Soliman 2013</LINK>). Most comparisons were carried out in small single trials only; there is clearly a need for caution in interpreting the results of small trials which demonstrate 'no evidence of an effect' rather than 'evidence of no effect'. Insufficiencies in quantity and quality of the evidence still preclude the drawing of robust conclusions for most of the comparisons evaluated by the included trials.</P>
<P>Only one of the eight newly included trials had prospective trial registration and a published protocol (<LINK REF="STD-ProFHER-2015" TYPE="STUDY">ProFHER 2015</LINK>). While this is discouraging at present, it is notable that the increased research activity in this previously overlooked area is also associated with far more prospective trial registration as well as publication of trial protocols. Both these items show the greater use of robust methodology that is required to minimise bias. Additionally, there is a growing interest in multicentre trials. Seven of the 21 ongoing trials are multicentre.</P>
<P>The results of the GRADE assessment of the quality of evidence for the individual comparisons are summarised below. With the exception of the evidence for the comparison of surgical versus non-surgical treatment, most of the GRADE assessments for the other comparisons were low or very low quality. This typically reflects the insufficiency of the evidence from small single trials which have limitations in design, conduct, analysis and reporting, putting them at high risk of bias.</P>

<P>While our search was comprehensive it is likely that we have failed to identify some randomised trials, particularly those reported only in abstracts or in non-English language publications. We may also have overlooked mixed-population trials that included proximal humeral fractures as a subgroup. However, we are almost certain that we have not overlooked trials that would provide definitive evidence that could inform practice. It is clear, from the growing awareness and imperative of trial registration, that such trials are now in progress. We prepared the review using systematic processes throughout, including contacting trial investigators for clarification and missing data. We describe the dilemma presented in the pooling of data from clearly heterogeneous trials for the surgical treatment versus non-surgical treatment comparison in the <LINK TAG="INTERVENTION_EFFECTS" TYPE="SECTION">Effects of interventions</LINK>. This is, however, compatible with the overall question and notably the pooled analyses did not result in statistically significant heterogeneity.</P>

<P>Several new systematic reviews, none of which cover all treatment options, were identified via the search update. The only rehabilitation review examined the effects of exercise in people with select upper limb fractures including proximal humeral fractures (<LINK REF="REF-Bruder-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bruder 2011</LINK>). Two reviews compared surgical versus non-surgical intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Li-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mao-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mao 2014</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Li-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 2013</LINK> limited surgery to internal fixation. One review compared arthroplasty versus 'joint preservation' that was either non-surgical treatment or internal fixation (<LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2014</LINK>). Two compared arthroplasty versus internal fixation (<LINK REF="REF-Dai-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dai 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gomberawalla-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gomberawalla 2013</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Dai-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dai 2014</LINK> limited internal fixation to locking plate fixation. Two reviews compared reverse shoulder arthroplasty versus hemiarthroplasty (<LINK REF="REF-Mata_x002d_Fink-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mata-Fink 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Namdari-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Namdari 2013</LINK>). All eight reviews, four of which included evidence from a broader spectrum of study designs (<LINK REF="REF-Dai-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dai 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gomberawalla-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gomberawalla 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mata_x002d_Fink-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mata-Fink 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Namdari-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Namdari 2013</LINK>), reported the limitations in the available evidence. Unlike our review, with its later search date, none of the three reviews comparing surgical versus non-surgical treatment included <LINK REF="STD-ProFHER-2015" TYPE="STUDY">ProFHER 2015</LINK> and neither of the two reviews comparing RSA with hemiarthroplasty included the first randomised trial on this topic (<LINK REF="STD-Sebasti_x00e1__x002d_Forcada-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Sebasti-Forcada 2014</LINK>).</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-10-27 18:23:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Denise M Mitchell">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-10-20 08:36:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is high or moderate quality evidence that, compared with non-surgical treatment, surgery does not result in a better outcome at one and two years after injury for people with displaced proximal humeral fractures involving the humeral neck and is likely to result in a greater need for subsequent surgery. The evidence does not cover the treatment of two-part tuberosity fractures, fractures in young people, high energy trauma, nor the less common fractures such as fracture dislocations and head splitting fractures.</P>
<P>There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to inform the choices between different non-surgical interventions, different surgical interventions, or different rehabilitation interventions for these fractures.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-10-27 18:23:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Denise M Mitchell">
<P>The availability of high quality evidence primarily from a sufficiently powered multicentre randomised trial (<LINK REF="STD-ProFHER-2015" TYPE="STUDY">ProFHER 2015</LINK>) is the key reason why this review can now inform on the use of surgery for the majority of displaced fractures. There is a need for similar trials to help address other key treatment uncertainties. Decisions on priority topics should consider the coverage of the current evidence base as well as the topics covered by the ongoing trials. Of particular note is that three ongoing trials are already comparing reverse shoulder arthoplasty versus hemiarthoplasty.</P>
<P>Although the identification of priority topics requires input from others, including patients, we suggest that research should be focused primarily on optimising non-surgical treatment. Where randomised trials are warranted, these should use standard and validated outcome measures, including patient-reported measures of functional outcome and quality of life, and also assess resource implications. They should also meet the CONSORT criteria for design and reporting of non-pharmacological studies (<LINK REF="REF-Boutron-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boutron 2008</LINK>) and subsequent developments including the adequate reporting of interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Hoffmann-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoffmann 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>This Cochrane review should be maintained and updated as further randomised controlled trials become available. The authors would be pleased to receive information about any other randomised controlled trials relating to the treatment of these fractures.</P>

<P>Statement added to <LINK TAG="CRIT_PARTICIPANTS" TYPE="SECTION">Types of participants</LINK> clarifying the inclusion of trials with a small proportion of children.</P>
<P>A new secondary outcome was added to <LINK TAG="CRIT_OUTCOMES" TYPE="SECTION">Types of outcome measures</LINK> (composite scores, whether validated or not, of subjectively- and objectively-rated function and overall outcome). This was to distinguish explicitly between validated measures of patient-reported function and activities of daily living and other commonly used composite scores such as the Constant score.</P>
<P>Examples of the secondary outcome 'Other complications' added.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Update in 2010</HEADING>
<P>Most of the changes to methods in Issue 12, 2010 reflected the uptake of new methodology and reporting as described in the Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008b</LINK>). These include risk of bias assessment and more explicit reporting of data analysis and collection. Types of outcome measures have been revised to define primary and secondary outcomes. Patient-reported measures of upper-limb function and a separate category for serious adverse events have been added.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Update in 2007</HEADING>
<P>The order of the main categories of outcome measures was altered in Issue 2, 2007 to reflect the greater priority given to functional and clinical outcomes.</P>

The present study uses meta-analytical techniques to compare conservative and operative management of proximal humeral fractures with respect to morbidity and functional outcomes. &lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt; Studies published between 1970 and 2007 comparing conservative and operative treatment of proximal humeral fractures were included. The end points evaluated were morbidity and functional outcomes. A random effects model was used and sensitivity analysis was performed to account for bias in patient selection. &lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt; Ten studies matched the selection criteria, reporting on 486 patients. Two hundred and nineteen (45%) were managed conservatively, 174 (36%) underwent operative fixation and 93 (19%) underwent hemiarthroplasty. Mean follow-up ranged from 6 months to 156 months. No significant difference was demonstrated in post-treatment Constant scores (weighted mean difference = 1.62, ?7.12, 10.36), rate of avascular necrosis [odds ratio (OR) = 0.92, confidence interval (CI) = 0.37&amp;#150;2.30] ongoing pain or non-union (OR = 1.28, CI = 0.11&amp;#150;15.46) between the groups. These findings remained consistent when considering studies matched for three- and four-part fractures and fracture dislocations. &lt;b&gt;Conclusion&lt;/b&gt; On the basis of available comparative data, there is no demonstrable difference in outcomes between fractures managed surgically or conservatively. There is a need for large, randomised trials to guide management of these fractures.

<P>Randomisation was performed in the first week after fracture.<BR/>1. Surgery: operation within 7 days of injury. Under general anaesthesia. Humeral head replacement using a deltopectoral approach with the Global Fx shoulder fracture endoprosthesis (DePuy, Leeds, UK). All prostheses were cemented. Cancellous bone graft from the head fragment was applied on the proximal stem before restoration of the tuberosities. Nonabsorbable sutures used to encircle the tuberosities to "enhance anatomic restoration". (All patients had prophylactic antibiotics.) Post surgery: shoulder immobiliser for 6 weeks.<BR/>2. Non-surgical treatment: shoulder immobiliser for 6 weeks.</P>
<P>Rehabilitation was same in both groups: Experienced shoulder physical therapists instructed the patients for 40-minute sessions three times a week up to 12 weeks. Up to 2 weeks light passive ROM movements; between 2 and 6 weeks, passive ROM up to 45 degrees forward flexion and abduction and active ROM up to 30 degrees forward flexion and abduction were allowed if pain control adequate; no external rotation. After 6 weeks, unlimited passive glenohumeral exercise, with active ROM up to 90 degrees in forward flexion and abduction. External rotation was allowed up to 30 degrees. After the 3-month visit, patients were seen by the physical therapist every month until the 12-month follow-up, with an emphasis on maximizing ROM, strength and return to daily activities.<BR/>Assigned: 25/25<BR/>Completed (at 1 year): 23/24 (based on text account)</P>

Tore Fjalestad also provided in an email (April 2012) the following clarification on the use of closed reduction for 8 non-surgically treated participants (this had not been described in the protocol): "The primary X-rays were assessed for classification and decision-making for closed reduction. Those eight patients had a new radiographic examination after allocation to non-surgical treatment and after the procedure in the operating room, to confirm an acceptable position of the fragments. If not acceptable, the patients had to be treated with ORIF. Surprisingly, only one patient demonstrated unacceptable re-displacement after two weeks, and was analyzed according to intention-to-treat principle in the non-surgical group at one year."</P>

<P>A modular shoulder replacement system (SMR; Lima, Udine, Italy) was used in both groups. The system allows the choice of cementless shoulder prostheses: hemiarthroplasty, reverse and anatomic arthroplasty). A common cementless humeral stem with porous coating titanium was assembled with one of two prostheses. The same deltopectoral approach and basic surgical technique was used at each shoulder; the tuberosities were repositioned as anatomically as possible and reattached with nonabsorbable sutures. Regional anaesthesia. In both groups, a suction drain was placed postoperatively for 24 hours. Standard antibiotic and antithrombotic prophylaxis was given.</P>
<P>1. Reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA): an SMR Reverse prosthesis was used in all shoulders. Of note is that the reverse liner of polyethylene (cross-link) had a chamfer in its inferior portion designed to decrease the risk of impingement and the consequent scapular notching. The proximal humeral body was in titanium alloy with a hole to allow suture of the tuberosities. Shoulders were postoperatively immobilised in sling for 2 weeks in a regimen similar to that of the HA group. Patients then continued with physiotherapy in a rehabilitation centre for at least 4 weeks to perform deltoid activation exercises and activities as tolerated.</P>
<P>2. Hemiarthroplasty: an SMR Trauma prosthesis was implanted. The proximal humeral body had holes to allow suture of the tuberosities to the stem, and the modular head was in titanium alloy. Rotator cuff tears repaired if possible. Sling immobilisation after surgery, gradually discontinued around 3 weeks. Passive mobilisation and pendulum exercises were allowed immediately. At week 2, passive- and active-assisted exercises were allowed in a rehabilitation centre with forward elevation and abduction limited to 100 and external rotation limited to 30. When consolidation of tuberosities was observed on the radiographs (around 6 weeks), active and resisted exercises were started.</P>

<P>1. Open reduction with internal fixation using a locking plate: Locking Proximal Humeral Plate (LPHP; Synthes) or the Proximal Humeral Internal Locking System (PHILOS; Synthes). General anaesthesia combined with an interscalene block. Indirect reduction under image intensifier, with reduced fracture temporarily fixed by a Kirschner wire. After placement, position of the locking plate checked with the image intensifier intraoperatively, and the plate was fixed with locking screws. Finally, a thorough fluoroscopic screening was done to ensure that no screw was penetrating the articular surface of the humeral head.</P>
<P>2. Open reduction with internal fixation using a locking nail: the Proximal Humeral Nail (PHN; Synthes). An interscalene brachial plexus block was used. Nail was inserted under image control without reaming after the fracture was fully reduced. After insertion of the spiral blade and the distal locking screws, an end cap was screwed in to lock the spiral blade. The rotator cuff tendon and the deltoid were carefully repaired during wound closure.</P>
<P>The affected extremity was protected by a sling for six weeks postoperatively. Passive range-of-motion exercises, supervised by a physical therapist, were initiated on the first postoperative day. Active and active-assisted exercises began after six weeks, when early callus formation could be seen on radiographs.

<P>This was a randomised clinical trial (sealed envelopes - computer-generated sequence - held in a box), recruitment 03/11/1997 to 14/01/1999, that compared Rush pins fixation with Polaris nail fixation of displaced two-part fractures of the proximal humerus. Contact with a Dr Sharma in July 2000 revealed 65 of the 80 patients in the trial had reached 2-year follow-up. Abstract by Bing et al published in 2002 indicated 40 patients of whom 30 had been followed-up for one year.

Its results were reported in a systematic review (ref 69* in <LINK REF="REF-Lo-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lo 2012</LINK>). This reported that "While promising, the published results from the Phase II studies for humeral and femoral fractures showed little enhancement over traditional treatments [69,70]. A positive risk/benefit ratio for these treatments was not demonstrated leading to Pfizer no longer pursuing the clinical development of rhBMP-2/CPM for these applications."

<P>There has been no response from the lead author of this &#8216;trial&#8217; (last contact attempted 8 June 2012), which appears to have been reported in a conference abstract only. In 2003, 50 patients with 3- and 4-part fractures and fracture dislocations of the proximal humerus were "random selected" for surgery (closed or open reduction and external fixation or hemiarthroplasty) or non-surgical treatment. The very limited results are split descriptively according to three groups (2 reflecting the 2 different surgical methods). There is currently insufficient evidence to support this being a randomised trial.</P>

<P>While the English abstract claims that "58 patients with 3 parts and 4 parts fractures of proximal humerus were randomly treated with AO locked compressive plates (LCP) or humeral head replacement." the characteristics (fracture type) of the patients in the two groups indicated serious selection bias and implied this was not a randomised trial. Thus, 25 of 28 patients in the plate group had 3-part fractures (1 with a dislocation) and 3 had 4-part fractures (1 with dislocation) whereas 11 of 30 in the replacement group had 3-part fractures (2 with dislocation), 16 with 4-part fractures (4 with dislocation) and the other three had humeral head split fractures.

<LI>Correspondence from Stig Brorson (June 11 2012) reveals a slower than anticipated recruitment. (Start date: April 2009; End date: March 2013 (final date for primary outcome measure))</LI>
<LI>Entry for trial (clinicaltrials.gov) on January 19 2015, indicated that "The recruitment status of this study is unknown because the information has not been verified recently". Status as "recruiting" had been last verified on June 2012 by Herlev Hospital. The study completion date had been changed from March 2012 to March 2013.</LI>
<LI>Correspondence from Stig Brorson (January 28 2015) revealed: "Unfortunately, we had to stop inclusion after 25 patients. They all followed the protocol and were evaluated accordingly. However, 9 out of 11 centres withdrew from the study because they found allocation of patients with 4-part fractures to non-surgical treatment ethically problematic. Ironically, we are now unable to continue the study as most surgeons find plating of 4-part fractures problematic! All data on the 25 patients are available." Stig Brorson further clarified (February 6 2015): "We enrolled 25 patients and randomly allocated them to non-surgical treatment, ORIF with locking plate or HA. Two died before the first evaluation, no drop-outs. The remaining 23 patients were evaluated after 12 months with blinded and non-blinded Constant Score, Oxford Shoulder Score and Short-Form 36. All data are available and unpublished."</LI>

<P>In response to a query on the status of Torrens 2012a, Carlos Torrens (25 May 2015): "Unfortunately this study was stopped because of lack of money so we just could recruit 40 patients.

<P>1. The inclusion/exclusion criteria varied among the trials: one (30 participants) included 2-, 3- or 4-part fractures; one (60 participants) included only 3-part fractures that included surgical neck; two (90 participants) included 3- or 4-part fractures, three (137 participants) included only 4-part fractures. The final trial (250 participants) included "displaced fracture of the proximal humerus that involved the surgical neck", resulting in a few 1-part (but confirmed as still "displaced") as well as 2-, 3- and 4-part fractures. The majority of the fractures (146/250 = 58.4%) in the largest trial were either 2-part (128) or 1-part (18) fractures. Several trials included further criteria; for example, the largest trial explicitly excluded fracture dislocations (i.e. fractures with an associated dislocation of the injured shoulder joint). Consideration is also needed of other inclusion and exclusion criteria, including multiple trauma, clear indications for surgery (severe soft-tissue compromise), and co-morbidities precluding surgery or anaesthesia<BR/>2. Patient-reported functional scores were the Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire (DASH; 2 trials), the Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS; 1 trial); the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES; 1 trial) and Simple Shoulder Test (SST; 1 trial)<BR/>3. Although the evidence was first downgraded by one level for study limitations, reflecting a high risk of performance bias relating to lack of blinding in four single-centre trials, the consistency in the results of these and the fifth and largest trial, where the analysis indicated that the study design limited the risk of bias relating to the inevitable lack of blinding, resulted in an upgrade<BR/>4. Patient-reported functional scores were the Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire (DASH; 2 trials), the Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS; 1 trial); and the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES; 1 trial)<BR/>5. The evidence was downgraded by one level for study limitations, reflecting a high risk of performance bias relating to lack of blinding in 3 single-centre trials. There was, however, consistency in the results of these and the fourth and largest trial, where the analysis indicated that the study design limited the risk of bias relating to the inevitable lack of blinding, resulting in an upgrade<BR/>6. The evidence was downgraded by one level for inconsistency, reflecting the statistical heterogeneity (Chi = 6.76, df = 3 (P = 0.08); I = 56%), but also data from two trials (102 participants) from the same centre that found minimal clinically important differences favouring surgery<BR/>7. The evidence was downgraded one level for imprecision, reflecting that these data were from one trial alone<BR/>8. A minimal clinically important difference for the SF-12 PCS was assumed to be 6.5. Notably, a similar finding applied for the between-group differences in SF-12 Mental Component Scores, but the direction of effect favoured non-surgical treatment<BR/>9. Assumed risk is the median control group risk across studies<BR/>10. The evidence was downgraded one level for imprecision.<BR/>11. The evidence was downgraded one level for inconsistency (heterogeneity: Chi = 8.50, df = 6 (P = 0.20); I = 29%), which was greater for the two years follow-up data (heterogeneity: Chi = 7.29, df = 3 (P = 0.06); I = 59%). At two years, three trials (160 participants) reported more additional surgery in the surgery group, but the trial (250 participants) contributing 65% of the weight of the evidence recorded equal numbers of participants (11 versus 11) undergoing additional surgery.</P>

<P>Rajan Madhok (RM) and Panos Thomas initiated the review and wrote the protocol. Helen Handoll (HH) searched for trials and provided a set of potential studies for inclusion. Alastair Gibson (JNAG) and HH assessed trial quality, tabulated the data and were the main authors of first published version of the review. JNAG, HH and RM contributed to the final manuscript.</P>
<P>For the first and third (both substantive) updates, Helen Handoll initiated the update by extending the search for trials and relevant materials, contacting trialists and preparing the first drafts. JNAG, HH and RM assessed the newly identified trials and contributed to the final manuscripts. All authors contributed to rewording of the discussion in the second minor update (amendment).</P>
<P>For the fourth (minor) update, Helen Handoll initiated the update by extending the search for trials and relevant materials, contacting trialists and preparing the first drafts. RM performed study selection and contributed to the final manuscript.</P>
<P>For the fifth update (sixth version), Helen Handoll initiated the update by extending the search for trials and relevant materials, contacted trialists, revised text and tables to conform to new methodology and formatting requirements, performed risk of bias assessment for already included trials and prepared the first full draft. Both authors piloted forms, performed study selection, and assessed risk of bias and extracted data for the new included trials. Benjamin Ollivere provided feedback on interim drafts and contributed to the final manuscript.</P>
