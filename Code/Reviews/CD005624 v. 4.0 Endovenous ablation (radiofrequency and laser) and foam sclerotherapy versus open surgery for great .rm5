<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-07-28 08:45:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Varicose veins are dilated, tortuous superficial veins. When they are in the legs they can be painful, itchy or unsightly, especially when patients are standing and walking. Varicose veins are conventionally treated with surgery to remove the veins, by stripping them to the level of the knee (so-called high ligation and stripping). New less invasive treatments seal the main leaking vein in the thigh using foam sclerotherapy, laser (endovenous laser therapy) or radiofrequency ablation. These techniques may result in less pain after the procedure, fewer complications, and a quicker return to work and normal activities with improved patient quality of life, as well as avoiding the need for a general anaesthetic.</P>
<P>Our review brought together all available randomised controlled trials that compared the new techniques to surgery in the treatment of varicosities in the great saphenous vein. We found 13 trials, with a combined total of 3081 randomised patients, which met our inclusion criteria. Three trials compared foam sclerotherapy with surgery, eight trials compared endovenous laser therapy with surgery and five compared radiofrequency ablation with surgery (two studies had two or more comparisons with surgery). Overall the quality of the studies was acceptable, however none of the studies tried to conceal the treatment type from the participants, researchers and clinicians, or those who measured the outcomes. Most of the studies also had other biases.</P>
<P>For foam compared with surgery, there was no difference between the treatment groups in the rate of recurrence as measured by a clinician and the rate of recurrence that was noted by patient symptoms. There was also no difference between the treatment groups for technical failure. Comparing laser therapy and surgery, there was no difference between the recurrence rates (either clinician noted or by symptoms) or for reopening of the treated vein (recanalisation). New vein growth (neovascularisation) and technical failure were both higher in the surgery group than in the laser group. For the comparison between radiofrequency ablation and surgery there were no differences between the treatment groups for recurrence, recanalisation, neovascularisation or technical failure. Outcomes that measure changes in patients' quality of life, operative complications and pain were not able to be compared directly, however quality of life generally increased similarly in all treatment groups and complications were generally low, especially major complications. Pain reporting varied greatly between the studies but in general pain was similar between the treatment groups.</P>
<P>The limited evidence that is available supports that foam sclerotherapy, endovenous laser therapy and radiofrequency ablation are no worse than open surgery. However, it should be noted that there were large differences between the way the studies reported their outcomes, which included definitions and collection time points. These differences limited the findings of our review. We need more data from randomised controlled trials comparing these novel therapies to surgery before we really know their true potential.</P>

<P>For this update<I> </I>the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co-ordinator searched the Specialised Register (last searched January 2014) and CENTRAL (2013, Issue 12). Clinical trials databases were also searched for details of ongoing or unpublished studies.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2014-07-26 05:56:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of UGFS, EVLT, RFA and HL/S were considered for inclusion. Primary outcomes were recurrent varicosities, recanalisation, neovascularisation, technical procedure failure, patient QoL scores and associated complications.</P>

<P>CN and RB independently reviewed, assessed and selected trials which met the inclusion criteria. CN and RB extracted data and used the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias. CN and RB contacted trial authors to clarify details as needed.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-07-28 08:47:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For this update, eight additional studies were included making a total of 13 included studies with a combined total of 3081 randomised patients. Three studies compared UGFS with surgery, eight compared EVLT with surgery and five compared RFA with surgery (two studies had two or more comparisons with surgery). Study quality, evaluated through the six domains of risk of bias, was generally moderate for all included studies, however no study blinded participants, researchers and clinicians or outcome assessors. Also, nearly all included studies had other sources of bias. The overall quality of the evidence was moderate due to the variations in the reporting of results, which limited meaningful meta-analyses for the majority of proposed outcome measures. For the comparison UGFS versus surgery, the findings may have indicated no difference in the rate of recurrences in the surgical group when measured by clinicians, and no difference between the groups for symptomatic recurrence (odds ratio (OR) 1.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97 to 3.12; P = 0.06 and OR 1.28, 95% CI 0.66 to 2.49, respectively). Recanalisation and neovascularisation were only evaluated in a single study. Recanalisation at &lt; 4 months had an OR of 0.66 (95% CI 0.20 to 2.12), recanalisation &gt; 4 months an OR of 5.05 (95% CI 1.67 to 15.28) and for neovascularisation an OR of 0.05 (95% CI 0.00 to 0.94). There was no difference in the rate of technical failure between the two groups (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.57). For EVLT versus surgery,<B> </B>there were no differences between the treatment groups for either clinician noted or symptomatic recurrence (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.22; P = 0.22 and OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.62; P = 0.67, respectively). Both early and late recanalisation were no different between the two treatment groups (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.09 to 12.77; P = 0.97 and OR 4.14, 95% CI 0.76 to 22.65; P = 0.10). Neovascularisation and technical failure were both statistically reduced in the laser treatment group (OR 0.05, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.22; P &lt; 0.0001 and OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.60; P = 0.0009, respectively). Long-term (five-year) outcomes were evaluated in one study so no association could be derived,but it appeared that EVLT and surgery maintained similar findings. Comparing RFA versus surgery,<B> </B>there were no differences in clinician noted recurrence (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.39; P = 0.47); symptomatic noted recurrence was only evaluated in a single study. There were also no differences between the treatment groups for recanalisation (early or late) (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.01 to 81.18; P = 0.87 and OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.39 to 3.04; P = 0.87, respectively), neovascularisation (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.65; P = 0.17) or technical failure (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.07 to 10.10; P = 0.88).</P>
<P>QoL scores, operative complications and pain were not amenable to meta-analysis, however quality of life generally increased similarly in all treatment groups and complications were generally low, especially major complications. Pain reporting varied greatly between the studies but in general pain was similar between the treatment groups.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-07-26 06:21:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Currently available clinical trial evidence suggests that UGFS, EVLT and RFA are at least as effective as surgery in the treatment of great saphenous varicose veins. Due to large incompatibilities between trials and different time point measurements for outcomes, the evidence is lacking in robustness. Further randomised trials are needed, which should aim to report and analyse results in a congruent manner to facilitate future meta-analysis.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-07-28 08:46:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Varicose veins are dilated, tortuous superficial veins (varices) which usually affect the lower extremities. There are two main superficial venous systems, the great (GSV) and small (SSV) saphenous veins and their tributaries.</P>
<P>The surgical management of GSV varices has traditionally consisted of saphenofemoral ligation and stripping of the GSV to the knee (HL/S) (<LINK REF="STD-Rutgers-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Rutgers 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sarin-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sarin 1992</LINK>). Visible truncal and non-saphenous varices in the calf as well as varicose GSV branches in the thigh are treated with hook phlebectomies (stab avulsions), sclerotherapy or (more recently) transilluminated powered phlebectomy. These procedures have often been performed under general anaesthetic (<LINK REF="REF-Dwerryhouse-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dwerryhouse 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rautio-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rautio 2002a</LINK>), however increasingly no anaesthesia is required or local block techniques have been adopted (<LINK REF="STD-Hamel_x002d_Desnos-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hamel-Desnos 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wright-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wright 2006</LINK>). The recurrence rate at five years following saphenofemoral junction ligation and GSV HL/S is reported to be between 20% and 28% (<LINK REF="REF-Darke-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Darke 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fischer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fischer 2002</LINK>) and in the absence of HL/S (saphenofemoral ligation only) the recurrence rate is doubled (<LINK REF="REF-Sarin-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sarin 1992</LINK>). For primary GSV surgery the overall complication rate is between 17% and 20% (<LINK REF="REF-Critchley-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Critchley 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wigger-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wigger 1998</LINK>) while the rate for recurrent varicose veins is 40% (<LINK REF="REF-Hayden-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hayden 2001</LINK>). These complications include wound haematoma, wound infections, lymphatic leaks, common femoral vein and artery injuries and neurological complications. Patients are encouraged to mobilise immediately after surgery and are usually advised to return to work after 10 to 14 days. Bruising along the tract of the avulsed GSV is common and can last for up to six weeks following surgery.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-07-28 08:48:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three newer techniques have been developed as alternatives to open surgery to treat GSV incompetence. They have been advocated to offer benefits over open surgical stripping of the above-knee portion of the GSV in eliminating saphenofemoral reflux (<LINK REF="REF-Bergan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bergan 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Navarro-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Navarro 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rautio-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rautio 2002</LINK>) and in reducing complication rates, patient discomfort and the length of time before return to work (<LINK REF="STD-EVOLVeS-Study" TYPE="STUDY">EVOLVeS Study</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rautio-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rautio 2002</LINK>). These three techniques are foam injection sclerotherapy, endovenous laser therapy and radiofrequency ablation.</P>
<P>Endovenous laser therapy and RFA require duplex ultrasound localisation of the GSV for endovenous insertion of the device, identification of the device at the saphenofemoral junction and direct visualisation of the device during treatment. Foam sclerotherapy is also carried out under ultrasound visualisation.</P>
<P>1. Foam sclerotherapy relies on the basic principle of inducing fibrosis of the vein and obliteration of the lumen by causing inflammation in the endothelial and subendothelial layers of the vein wall. The GSV is cannulated under ultrasound guidance and sclerosant foam injected. The foam replaces blood in the vein, which enhances the efficacy of the sclerosing agent by reducing the volume of sclerosant required for treatment and increasing the effective surface area of the sclerosant in contact with the vein wall. Ultrasound monitoring during the procedure is necessary to prevent spread of the foam into the femoral vein. A major proposed advantage of foam sclerotherapy over conventional sclerotherapy is that larger veins appear to be successfully treated with the foam technique compared with liquid sclerotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Baccaglini-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baccaglini 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tessari-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tessari 2001</LINK>). The success rate varies between 88% and 93% depending on the technique employed to produce the foam (<LINK REF="REF-Frullini-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frullini 2002</LINK>) and the types of complications and the complication rate are reported to be the same as with liquid sclerotherapy.</P>
<P>2. EVLT involves insertion of a bare tipped optical laser fibre into the GSV under ultrasound guidance with partial compression applied to the vein as some intravascular blood is necessary for heating of the vein; intravascular coagulation therefore occurs with this method. The optical fibre is then withdrawn along the length of the vein from just below the saphenofemoral junction to the knee, producing obliteration of the vein lumen. This procedure can be performed under local or general anaesthetic with the addition of tumescent anaesthesia. Tumescent anaesthesia is the injection of local anaesthetic around and along the vein length to form a cuff that protects the skin from burns and also protects the adjacent cutaneous nerves, especially the saphenous nerve, from damage in addition to providing local anaesthesia. Patients are encouraged to mobilise immediately after the procedure. The recurrence rate is reported as 7% after two years (<LINK REF="REF-Min-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Min 2003</LINK>), with most recurrences occurring within the first three months. A low incidence of bruising and induration around the site of local (tumescent) anaesthetic infiltration has been reported with only few instances of reports of either superficial or deep phlebitis or thermal skin and nerve injuries.</P>
<P>3. RFA uses radiofrequency energy supplied via a catheter electrode inserted into the GSV under ultrasound guidance. Compression of the vein around the catheter is maintained as the catheter is withdrawn from just below the saphenofemoral junction to the knee, resulting in heating of the vein wall which is kept at a constant temperature by a thermocouple. The procedure can be performed under local or general anaesthetic with tumescent anaesthesia. Immediate mobilisation is encouraged following the procedure. Wound haematoma and infection are reported to be infrequent following this procedure, however superficial phlebitis, thermal skin injuries and nerve injuries have been reported.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Jones-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 1996</LINK> have proposed that open surgery groin haematoma and disrupted superficial pudendal venous drainage are stimulants for neovascularisation (development of new blood vessels) in the groin, which are a source of venous reflux recurrence. The newer techniques preserve the pudendal and lower abdominal wall venous drainage, do not involve a surgical incision, and prevent haematoma formation in the groin thus potentially removing the stimulus for neovascularisation and perhaps reducing longer-term recurrence (<LINK REF="REF-Pichot-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pichot 2004</LINK>). Additionally, as they are less invasive they may be advantageous in relation to issues such as pain and recovery times compared with open surgery.</P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2014-07-26 07:39:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Due to the nature of the disease and interventions, the studies relating to this subject matter often have mixed units of analysis (that is some studies may randomise by patient and some randomise by legs, including patients with both uni- and bilateral venous incompetence). For the purposes of the analyses we tried to use patients as our unit of analysis, but in some cases this was not possible and the number of limbs was used.

<LINK REF="STD-EVOLVeS-Study" TYPE="STUDY">EVOLVeS Study</LINK> reported an initial decrease in the QoL CIVIQ2 scores for the surgery group in the first week, which was not observed in the RFA group (which had an initial increase). After three weeks the differences between the two groups were not significant as they both saw increases in CIVIQ2 scores. After one year there was once again a statistically significant difference between the two groups, favouring RFA, which was maintained at the two-year follow-up. A significant difference in VCSS score between the groups was observed at 72 h and one week after treatment favouring RFA. These differences were lost after three weeks, when both groups continued to see improvement. The C-classification in the CEAP score saw general improvements from baseline to two years with no differences between the treatment groups.

<LINK REF="STD-Rautio-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rautio 2002</LINK> evaluated generic QoL measures with the RAND-36 (a variation of SF-36 validated for Finland) and found general improvements across all subgroups at week four, with no differences between the treatment groups. The average improvement of the VCSS at three years was similar between the treatment groups (P = 0.7). The pre-operatively evaluated VDS was improved in all but two patients (one in each group) who occasionally needed compression stockings while working. The Venous Segmental Disease Score (VSDS) decreased in all but three patients in the RFA group and one patient in the surgical group (P = 0.6).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Post-operative complications</HEADING>
<P>All studies declared and reported post-operative complications. Terminology was the main factor that prevented accurate meta-analysis. For example, 'post-operative wound infection', 'wound discharge' and 'wound breakdown' were reported separately across the studies. Similarly, 'post-operative paraesthesia along the distribution of the great saphenous nerve', 'numbness' and 'saphenous nerve injury' were reported separately. In an attempt to display such a wide and varying collection of complications we have constructed a table which combines many of these 'similar' events (<LINK REF="TBL-09" TYPE="TABLE">Table 9</LINK>). Across the studies, adverse events were recorded at varying times post-operatively. We have divided them into early (within three months) and late (beyond three months), again for simplicity. We have also characterised adverse events as major and minor depending on whether or not these events required intervention: minor requiring no intervention and major requiring intervention. When events were presented more than once within the first three months, as in the <LINK REF="STD-EVOLVeS-Study" TYPE="STUDY">EVOLVeS Study</LINK>, which presented adverse events at 72 hours, one and three weeks post-operatively, the highest value for any given event was recorded in our summary table.<BR/>

<LINK REF="STD-FOAM_x002d_Study" TYPE="STUDY">FOAM-Study</LINK> determined that the treatment did not greatly influence pain, with similar scoring for 'more', 'stable' or 'less' pain between the three time points (3, 12 and 24 months) and no differences between the groups.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">(ii) Laser versus surgery</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Darwood-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Darwood 2008</LINK> showed a decrease in pain for all treatment groups in the first week after treatment, with no significant differences between the groups. <LINK REF="STD-Flessenkaemper-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Flessenkaemper 2013</LINK> reported no statistically significant difference in the experience of pain for more than five days or for persisting pain after treatment between the treatment groups (P = 0.12). <LINK REF="STD-HELP_x002d_1" TYPE="STUDY">HELP-1</LINK> reported less pain in the laser group compared with the surgical group from day one (P = 0.004 to P &lt; 0.001). In the <LINK REF="STD-Pronk-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Pronk 2010</LINK> study it was reported that there was significantly more pain during treatment in the surgery group compared with laser (P = 0.02). For days 7, 10 and 14 the laser group experienced significantly more pain than those patients who underwent surgery (P &lt; 0.001, P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.01, respectively). <LINK REF="STD-Rasmussen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rasmussen 2007</LINK> reported that the mean analgesic intake was 12.9 tablets in laser patients versus 12 tablets in surgery patients within the six months post-procedure. There were no statistically significant differences in the visual analogue scale (VAS) scores for pain between the two groups, although pain was initially slightly higher after surgery. There were no differences between the laser and surgery treatment groups in the <LINK REF="STD-Rasmussen-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Rasmussen 2011</LINK> study, and the number of phlebectomies did not influence pain scores (P = 0.136). The <LINK REF="STD-RELACS-Study" TYPE="STUDY">RELACS Study</LINK> reported significantly higher pain in the laser group in the first post-operative week (P = 0.005) but a significantly shorter duration of pain (by days) in the laser group compared with the surgery group (P = 0.03).</P>
<P>From the above descriptions of the studies there are clearly conflicting findings on pain for the comparison between ELVT and surgery: <LINK REF="STD-Darwood-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Darwood 2008</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Flessenkaemper-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Flessenkaemper 2013</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rasmussen-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Rasmussen 2011</LINK> showed no difference between the groups; in contrast <LINK REF="STD-HELP_x002d_1" TYPE="STUDY">HELP-1</LINK> showed less pain following EVLT compared to HL/S; while <LINK REF="STD-Pronk-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Pronk 2010</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-RELACS-Study" TYPE="STUDY">RELACS Study</LINK> clearly showed that EVLT was associated with significantly more early post-operative pain. <LINK REF="STD-Rasmussen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rasmussen 2007</LINK> had mixed results with the EVLT group using more pain medication but reporting initially higher levels of pain after surgery.</P>
<P>The type of anaesthetic was one explanation for these observed differences as four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Pronk-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Pronk 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rasmussen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rasmussen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rasmussen-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Rasmussen 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-RELACS-Study" TYPE="STUDY">RELACS Study</LINK>) performed HL/S under tumescence and three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Darwood-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Darwood 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Flessenkaemper-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Flessenkaemper 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-HELP_x002d_1" TYPE="STUDY">HELP-1</LINK>) used general or spinal anaesthesia. This suggested a trend towards less post-operative pain with tumescence anaesthesia, and therefore a benefit to HL/S over EVLT.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-07-26 11:52:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A total of 13 studies were included in this systematic review, with 3081 randomised participants. Three studies with a total of 870 randomised participants compared foam sclerotherapy to surgery, a total of eight studies with 1760 randomised participants compared endovascular laser ablation therapy (EVLT) to surgery, and five studies compared radiofrequency ablation (RFA) to surgery with a total of 642 participants randomised. Some of the included studies included several relevant comparison groups to surgery, and one study evaluated a comparison group not relevant to this review, therefore the individual comparison group participant numbers do no add up to the overall number of randomised participants.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">(i) Foam versus surgery</HEADING>
<P>Within this comparison, rates of recurrence that were noted by clinicians and recurrence as noted by patients showed no difference between the treatment groups. Recanalisation (early and late) and neovascularisation were only evaluated in a single study. Early recanalisation showed no difference between the treatment groups and late recanalisation favoured surgery. As no neovascularisation events occurred in the foam group, the analysis favoured ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy (UGFS). There were no differences between the treatment groups for technical failure. Although meta-analysis could not be carried out to compare quality of life (QoL) and severity scoring, both treatment groups showed very similar QoL and disease improvements by the final follow-up time point. Complications were few and generally equal between the groups. However, early haematoma and saphenous nerve injury were more frequent in the surgical group and the foam group had a higher rate of phlebitis. Major complications were very few.</P>
<P>Two studies in this comparison reported that the surgical procedures were performed under general or spinal anaesthesia, with no indication of anaesthesia type for the foam treatment group. The third study reported that all patients in both comparison groups were given tumescent local anaesthesia, with light sedation at the surgeon's discretion. Length of procedure was only evaluated in one study and therefore could not be compared; and only a single study reported that their surgical group participants were treated as day patients, with no indication for the foam participants. For the two studies reporting costs, although they were measuring different specific costs both had decreased costs within the foam treatment group compared with surgical patients. Time to return to work and normal activity was only reported in a single study but showed decreased recovery time for the foam group. Two studies reported on pain, with one reporting no large change in pain for either treatment group from baseline and the other study reporting less pain during the procedure in the foam group compared with the surgical group.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">(ii) Laser versus surgery</HEADING>
<P>Of the outcomes that were amenable to meta-analysis, rates of recurrence and recanalisation were no different between the two treatment groups. Neovascularisation and technical failure were both less in the laser treated groups compared with surgery. QoL and disease severity scoring was generally uniform throughout the studies, with worsening within the first few days or weeks followed by an overall improvement over the follow-up period, with no difference between the groups. Early and late complications were distributed between the groups and with very few major adverse events.</P>
<P>For treatment anaesthesia, four studies used general or spinal anaesthesia for their surgical groups and local tumescent anaesthesia for their laser groups. Four studies used local tumescent anaesthesia in both treatment groups, some with light sedation administered at the discretion of the surgeon. Length of surgery was evaluated in two studies, with one reporting less time for the EVLT group and the other reporting more. It should be noted that these studies were using different definitions and metrics for measurement, so any conclusion should be drawn with this in mind. Of the four studies reporting on this, nearly 100% of patients were treated as day cases. Procedural costs were only evaluated in two studies and both found marginally higher costs associated with laser ablation, although this is a highly subjective measure. Time to return to work or normal activity was reported for six studies within this comparison. Most studies showed less time needed in the laser group to return to work or normal activity, but as this was measured in the different studies with different metrics, and with different definitions, this conclusion is tentative. The measures of pain varied greatly between studies therefore no overall conclusion can be drawn at this time, but it is of importance that two robust trials included in this comparison found increased post-operative pain in the EVLT treatment group, which is a new finding that requires further evaluation.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">(iii) Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) versus surgery</HEADING>
<P>Of the outcomes that were amenable to meta-analysis, recurrence (noted by clinicians or patients), recanalisation (early and late), neovascularisation and technical failure had no statistically significant differences between the two treatment groups. As with the previous treatment comparisons, QoL and disease severity scores saw general improvements over the length of the follow-up for both treatment groups, with most studies reporting no overall differences between the groups. For early complications, there were higher rates of haematoma and wound problems in the surgical group compared with RFA; and the increased rate of haematoma and saphenous vein injury in the surgical group were still evident in later complications. Overall, the numbers of complications were low, especially for major complications.</P>
<P>Three studies used general anaesthesia in surgical patients and local tumescent anaesthesia for the RFA group. One study used local tumescent anaesthesia in both treatment groups and a final study had a mixture of both general and local tumescent anaesthesia in both treatment groups. Length of procedure was evaluated in four studies with two studies reporting less time for the RFA procedure and two studies reporting more time for the RFA procedure. All four studies were most likely evaluating slightly different definitions of procedure time, which should be kept in mind as this is a subjective measure. Two studies reported the comparison of in-patient stays versus day cases, with one reporting all surgical procedures as in-patient stays and all RFA patients as day cases, while the other study reported over 80% of day cases in both treatment groups. Procedural costs were similar for both treatment groups, as evaluated in three studies, however one study reported slightly higher costs in the RFA group and two reported slightly higher costs in the surgical groups. All five studies reported either time to return to work or time to return to normal activities, all with less time for the RFA group. It should be noted this outcome was reported differently between studies, and this should be kept in mind when drawing any conclusions.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-07-26 11:53:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite an apparent congruity in the outcome measures of the studies (<LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>) there was a serious lack of compatible data, including differences in the outcome definitions, metrics and follow-up time points, with which any meaningful meta-analysis could be performed. This has seriously limited the overall effectiveness of this Cochrane review. However, all of the included studies were considered applicable to this review and reported most if not all of the review's primary and secondary outcomes. The studies all included relevant participants and interventions, and there is now the emergence of much needed longer-term data although currently only from a single study.</P>
<P>The inclusion and treatment of patients with bilateral great saphenous varicose veins has also impeded accurate meta-analysis. <LINK REF="STD-Darwood-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Darwood 2008</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-EVOLVeS-Study" TYPE="STUDY">EVOLVeS Study</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Magna-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Magna 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pronk-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Pronk 2010</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rasmussen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rasmussen 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rasmussen-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Rasmussen 2011</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Subramonia-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Subramonia 2010</LINK> all permitted bilateral treatment. <LINK REF="STD-Darwood-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Darwood 2008</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pronk-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Pronk 2010</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rasmussen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rasmussen 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rasmussen-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Rasmussen 2011</LINK> treated patients with bilateral veins on the same day and ensured that both limbs received the same treatment, whereas in the <LINK REF="STD-Magna-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Magna 2007</LINK> trial bilaterally treated patients could have different treatments for each leg. <LINK REF="STD-EVOLVeS-Study" TYPE="STUDY">EVOLVeS Study</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Subramonia-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Subramonia 2010</LINK> had a waiting period between leg treatments. It should be noted that <LINK REF="STD-Subramonia-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Subramonia 2010</LINK> did not end up including any bilaterally treated patients. The authors were contacted, where possible, but overall little could be done as this was such a widescale problem. <LINK REF="STD-Helmy-ElKaffas-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Helmy ElKaffas 2011</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Flessenkaemper-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Flessenkaemper 2013</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-FOAM_x002d_Study" TYPE="STUDY">FOAM-Study</LINK> did not indicate if bilateral patients were permitted, and did indicate the number of legs. It is therefore assumed that bilaterally treated patients were not included (the authors were contacted for explanation, with no response). There were a total of 172 included bilateral limbs, which made up approximately 6% of the total randomised population. Bilateral limb proportions ranged from 0% (<LINK REF="STD-Subramonia-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Subramonia 2010</LINK>) and 1% (<LINK REF="STD-EVOLVeS-Study" TYPE="STUDY">EVOLVeS Study</LINK>) up to 22% in the <LINK REF="STD-Magna-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Magna 2007</LINK> study.</P>
<P>High ligation and stripping (HL/S) under tumescence anaesthesia was used in some of the later trials and although it is not common or routine practice it was associated with enhanced post-operative comfort compared to EVLT in some of the trials. This may alter the applicability of the evidence in regard to pain scores or other outcomes that could be altered by general versus local anaesthesia.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Rasmussen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rasmussen 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rasmussen-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Rasmussen 2011</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Subramonia-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Subramonia 2010</LINK> included patients who had undergone previous high ligation of their saphenofemoral junction (SFJ) with ultrasound evidence of residual SFJ reflux. However, the number of such limbs was small and was unlikely to affect the outcome variables.</P>
<P>An additional point that should not be forgotten is the strict inclusion criteria used in all trials regarding patients' suitability for endovenous treatment. When considering treatment options for patients, if they are deemed unsuitable for endovenous management (&gt; 1.2 cm, tortuous veins etc) open surgery remains their only viable option, for which there is robust, long-term evidence for its safety and efficacy.</P>

<P>We were able to include 13 RCTs with a total of 3081 randomised participants, with a reasonable number of studies within each treatment comparison.

<P>To limit potential bias, where uncertainty was encountered in aspects of the included studies, authors of the relevant papers were contacted. Most authors who were contacted provided swift and full replies, which are documented in full within the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> tables for the trials. However, some authors did not respond, which led to assumptions that could have created biases. </P>
<P>Using all patients that were randomised for the meta-analysis is generally the objective of the intention-to-treat method. However for this review, due to the nature of the disease and intervention, it was inappropriate to use all patients randomised as these numbers were often very different from the numbers analysed. For this reason we used the analysed number of patients for most studies.</P>
<P>Where trials included treatment of both the great saphenous vein (GSV) and small saphenous vein (SSV), the authors were contacted to ascertain if any subgroup analysis had been performed which would enable us to include the trial. Not all authors responded. Of those that did, on no occasion had any author performed such an analysis and subsequently these trials were excluded from the review. </P>
<P>Two-year recurrence and neovascularisation figures were published by <LINK REF="STD-Darwood-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Darwood 2008</LINK>. Unfortunately this publication included both the randomised patients and patients who had refused randomisation. No subanalysis was made and subsequently no two-year follow-up data were available for the <LINK REF="STD-Darwood-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Darwood 2008</LINK> study.</P>
<P>The selection criteria of all the included trials introduces a bias into any interpretation of these procedures for the population as a whole. Any potential advantage of these novel therapies is obviated in patients with veins deemed 'unsuitable' for endovascular techniques. In these patients surgery remains the only viable treatment option. </P>
<P>The inclusion in some trials of patients with bilateral varicose veins and the presentation of results by numbers of limbs introduce a large potential bias. Clearly bilateral treatment has implications for length of hospital stay, pain scores, operative time and adverse events. Without stratification of results on a per patient basis this remains a potential source of confounding bias.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2014-07-28 09:31:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A recent meta-analysis from 2012 evaluated the same three methods UGFS, EVLT and RFA compared with surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Siribumrungwong-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siribumrungwong 2012</LINK>). However, this study also evaluated comparisons between UGFS, EVLT and RFA, studies that included non-conventional treatment methods, heterogenous populations and non-original work. The <LINK REF="REF-Siribumrungwong-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siribumrungwong 2012</LINK> review included nine studies that we included and 12 studies that we excluded. For the recurrence outcome <LINK REF="REF-Siribumrungwong-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siribumrungwong 2012</LINK> found no difference between EVLT or RFA and surgery (EVLT versus surgery: RR 0.6, 95% CI 0.3 to 1.1; RFA versus surgery: RR 0.9, 95% CI 0.6 to 1.4), which is consistent with our review. The authors were able to include complications and time to return to work or normal activity for meta-analysis and found that EVLT and RFA were associated with fewer haematomas and wound infections, less pain and a quicker return to normal activities.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Brar-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brar 2010</LINK> compared EVLT and RFA techniques to surgery. Of the nine studies that were included, four were also included in our own review and five were excluded for reasons such as they were of non-conventional techniques, a non-randomised study and included veins other than the GSV. For the comparison between EVLT and surgery at three months there was no difference between the treatment groups but this was borderline (RR 2.19, 95% CI 0.99 to 4.85; P = 0.05). For RFA there was also no difference in recurrence between the two treatment groups, measured at two years (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.60 to 2.67; P = 0.53). These findings are consistent with our own.</P>
<P>A meta-analysis published in 2009 evaluated recurrence rates when comparing endovenous ablation techniques versus ligation and stripping (<LINK REF="REF-Xenos-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xenos 2009</LINK>). Differing from our review, <LINK REF="REF-Xenos-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xenos 2009</LINK> did not include any studies evaluating sclerotherapy, they required at least one year of follow-up and they allowed non-conventional techniques in both the surgical and endovenous treatment groups. This meta-analysis included four studies that we also included and an additional four studies that we excluded for various reasons. Instead of reporting the comparisons of EVLT and RFA versus surgery separately, the primary outcome of the <LINK REF="REF-Xenos-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xenos 2009</LINK> review was recurrence (by duplex ultrasound or symptoms, or both) after endovenous treatment (EVLT or RFA) compared with surgery. Despite the differences they found an OR of recurrence that showed no difference between the different treatment methods, which does agree with our own results (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.96; P = 0.95).</P>
<P>The systematic review by the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) in collaboration with the American Venous Forum (AVF) reviewed available evidence in 2009, comparing endovenous ablation (RFA and EVLT) and foam sclerotherapy versus open surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Eklof-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eklof 2009</LINK>). Regarding EVLT versus surgery, the findings concur with those summarised above and they considered that the RCTs did not report bias protection measures and therefore that the available evidence was of low quality. With regard to RFA versus surgery, they concluded that none of the RCTs reported allocation concealment or blinded outcomes and hence the quality of the evidence was considered low.</P>
<P>Despite the lack of evidence within our review to support one method of treatment over another, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published their recommendation in July 2013 that endovenous treatment should constitute the first treatment of choice for people with confirmed varicose veins and truncal reflux (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-_x0028_CG168_x0029_-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE (CG168) 2013</LINK>): "If endothermal ablation is unsuitable, offer ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy", "If ultrasound&#8209;guided foam sclerotherapy is unsuitable, offer surgery". It should be noted that our Cochrane review does not constitute a guideline nor does it offer any recommendations for clinicians, our conclusions are open to interpretation.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-07-26 12:10:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Current data suggest that foam sclerotherapy and endovenous ablation (laser and radiofrequency) have similar overall outcomes as open surgery involving high ligation and stripping (HL/S). However, these findings still lack robustness due to a paucity of compatible data.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-07-26 12:15:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The long-term rates of recanalisation following foam sclerotherapy, RFA and EVLT need to be assessed as there appears to be more recanalisation in the second and third years of follow-up in the included studies. While one study has reported five-year outcome data, the issues of the longer-term effect of leaving a proximal segment of GSV open and leaving the GSV tributaries intact still remain unidentified.</P>
<P>As previously discussed, there were several new studies that performed HL/S under tumescent anaesthesia, with decreased post-procedure pain in the HL/S group compared with EVLT. Further investigation of this potential association could show a method of maximizing post-operative comfort following this well established therapy. It is also acknowledged that newer therapies have been developed that do not require the use of tumescence, for example Clarivein&#8482;. Research comparing these therapies to surgery could be included in future updates of our Cochrane review, or could alternatively form the basis of a separate primary review.</P>
<P>Regarding timing of additional mini-phlebectomies there remains great variation in practice. We have acknowledged the limitation of this variation and its impact on outcomes in the included trials and future research could focus attention on this issue.</P>
<P>Although we were able to include 13 RCTs in this review, the ability to combine outcomes in meaningful ways was limited due to incompatibility between studies. Future trials should aim to standardise their outcomes and follow-up schedules to allow for more accurate meta-analysis. This is especially true for outcomes such as QoL, pain and procedural costs, and for clinical definitions. In addition, in future trials efforts could be made to blind the post-operative procedure assessors to increase the quality of the related outcome measures. Techniques to blind assessors could include patients wearing a dressing in the groin region, regardless of procedure type, and to restrict assessors from being able to determine the presence or absence of a scar that would alert them to the treatment type.</P>

<P>The title was altered for clarity: the term 'conventional surgery' can be misleading, 'open surgery' was used in its place. This term has been changed throughout the text, as well.</P>
<P>Additional outcome data were collected on post-operative pain and time to return to work and normal activities.</P>
<P>For the primary outcome 'recurrence or recanalisation', the description 'determined by ultrasound imaging, at set time intervals post-procedure' was removed. The included studies had many different definitions and ways of evaluating this outcome, which are presented in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>, and therefore using only 'determined by ultrasound imaging' was limiting the scope of the outcome.</P>
<P>The third primary outcome 'need for re-intervention due to failure of a procedure (technical failure)' was amended to 'technical failure' as re-intervention and technical failure are not necessarily the same thing. <LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK> shows the available data for re-intervention.</P>
<P>The term 'operative costs' was changed to 'procedural costs'. This is more inclusive as UGFS is not technically considered an operation.</P>
<P>'Type of anaesthetic' was removed from the secondary outcomes list as it is a characteristic rather than an outcome. It is reported under 'Additional outcomes' and information is provided in <LINK REF="TBL-14" TYPE="TABLE">Table 14</LINK>.</P>

<P>Author contacted 2/2/2010</P>
<P>Replied 8/2/2010:<BR/>"The 36 patients had their preoperative diagnostic done in an earlier trial (Accuracy of HHD in planning the operating for primary varicose veins. Eur J Vasc Endovasc Surg 2002). After examining these patients and ensuring their suitability to the study they were included.<BR/>The patients were given the study information and after getting informed consent from all of them, I put 36 named tags to identical envelopes, which were sealed. After shuffling the envelopes I numbered them randomly. List of numbers for randomization was done earlier according to instructions of the biostatistician of our department. I opened the envelopes in numerical order.<BR/>Randomisation was done this way, because our strict schedule. Resource allocations (operating theatres, angiography suites etc.) forced us to perform the operations and procedures during a period of two weeks.<BR/>We also thought, that it was better to inform the result of randomisation to patients in good time beforehand. Four patients withdrew because of the disappointment of having been assigned to the stripping group. Three patients discontinued the study because of an unsuitable schedule. One patient was excluded because of pregnancy. As a result we missed three patients from the RFA group and five patients from the stripping group.<BR/>I do not see any chance of bias because of selection process itself. Withdrawal of eight patients might have had some influence to the results."<BR/>

<LINK REF="STD-Christenson-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Christenson 2010</LINK> included the treatment of 200 limbs, randomised to receive open surgery or endovenous laser ablation. After contacting the author it was confirmed that 40 patients underwent bilateral varicose vein treatment. It was also confirmed that patients 'limbs' were randomised, not patients. In fact, eight patients underwent surgery on one limb and laser on the other. All patients with bilateral varicose veins were treated on the same day.</P>
<P>This clearly biases any results regarding post-operative quality of life scores. The high proportion of bilaterally treated patients also affects pain scores. Time to return to work is also published, but limbs cannot return to work independently of one another and subsequently these results are not suitable for our Cochrane review.</P>
<P>Trials randomising and analysing results according to number of limbs rather than number of patients as the unit of analysis means that the standard error of the treatment effect is much smaller than it should be.

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>Age and sex were 'judged most likely to influence outcome in the two groups'. Author contacted for further details:</P>
<P>"A web-based randomisation method was used (with assistance from the Institute of Health and Society, Newcastle University, UK) with stratification to ensure appropriate balance between the arms with respect to variables that might influence outcome in the two groups and to minimise the risk of confounding. The method used two stratification variables, age and sex, that were judged most likely to influence the outcome in the two groups. Two levels of each stratification variable were employed:<BR/>· Age - &#8804; 50 years and &gt; 50 years<BR/>· Sex - male or female<BR/>Simple randomisation without stratification does not guarantee equivalence between the two groups and several levels of stratification can make the randomisation system more complicated and also result in some small strata. The same procedure was allocated to those with bilateral varicose veins both of which were suitable for the trial with a minimum period of 3 months between the procedures. Access to the website was protected by password and the file server maintained by the University of Newcastle had high security protocols. The researcher alone had knowledge of the password to access the website. No problems were encountered either in accessing the website or in randomising patients during the trial."</P>
