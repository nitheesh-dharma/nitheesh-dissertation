<P>Carotid artery dissection means a tear in the lining in one of the main blood vessels carrying blood to the brain. Dissection can be caused by injury to the neck, but can sometimes develop for no obvious reason. Blood clots can form where the artery is torn. These blood clots can then block the artery and cause a stroke. Blood thinning drugs such as aspirin and anticoagulants might prevent clots forming and so prevent stroke in people with carotid artery dissection. We did not find any completed randomised trials testing these drugs in people with carotid artery dissection. However, there is one ongoing trial. We found only poor quality non-randomised studies that compared anticoagulants with aspirin. There was no evidence that anticoagulants were better than aspirin. Aspirin is likely to be similarly effective and safe as anticoagulants in such patients. More research is needed.</P>

</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2010-05-21 14:59:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched 3 October 2009). In addition, we performed comprehensive searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library </I>Issue 2, 2009), MEDLINE (January 1966 to November 2009) and EMBASE (January 1980 to November 2009), checked all relevant papers for additional eligible studies and contacted authors and researchers in the field.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2010-05-19 15:48:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Randomised controlled trials, controlled clinical trials and non-randomised studies (if they reported on outcome stratified by antithrombotic treatment and included at least four patients) of anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents for the treatment of extracranial internal carotid artery dissection. Two review authors independently extracted data.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2010-05-19 14:29:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Primary outcomes were death (all causes) and death or disability. Secondary outcomes were ischaemic stroke, symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage, and major extracranial haemorrhage during the reported follow-up period. The first choice treatment was taken for analyses.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-06-07 13:32:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We did not find any completed randomised trials. Comparing antiplatelets with anticoagulants across 36 observational studies (1285 patients), there were no significant differences in the odds of death (Peto odds ratio (Peto OR) 2.02, 95% CI 0.62 to 6.60), or the occurrence of ischaemic stroke (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.86) (34 studies, 1262 patients). For the outcome of death or disability, there was a non-significant trend in favour of anticoagulants (OR 1.77, 95% CI 0.98 to 3.22; P = 0.06) (26 studies, 463 patients). Symptomatic intracranial haemorrhages (5/627; 0.8%) and major extracranial haemorrhages (7/425; 1.6%) occurred only in the anticoagulation group; however, for both these outcomes, the estimates were imprecise and indicated no significant difference between the two treatment modalities.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-05-19 14:31:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>There were no randomised trials comparing either anticoagulants or antiplatelet drugs with control, thus there is no evidence to support their routine use for the treatment of extracranial internal carotid artery dissection. There were also no randomised trials that directly compared anticoagulants with antiplatelet drugs and the reported non-randomised studies did not show any evidence of a significant difference between the two.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-06-07 13:43:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Extracranial internal carotid artery dissection (eICAD) can lead to the occlusion of the artery. It is the underlying stroke mechanism in approximately 2.5% of all strokes (<LINK REF="STD-Bogousslavsky-1987b" TYPE="STUDY">Bogousslavsky 1987b</LINK>), compared with between 5% and 22% in young stroke patients, hence being among the leading causes of stroke in patients younger than 45 years (<LINK REF="REF-Bogousslavsky-1987a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bogousslavsky 1987a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gautier-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gautier 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leys-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leys 2002</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Lisovoski-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Lisovoski 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rouhart-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rouhart 1993</LINK>). It was first recognised as a cause of ischaemic stroke in the mid-1950s (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-1959" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 1959</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jentzer-1954" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jentzer 1954</LINK>), although there are pathological reports on the condition dating from 1872 (<LINK REF="STD-Richaud-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Richaud 1980</LINK>). The incidence is about 1.7 to 3/100,000 per year (<LINK REF="REF-Giroud-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giroud 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schievink-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schievink 1993</LINK>). The recurrence rate of CAD is less than 1% per year (<LINK REF="REF-Beletsky-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beletsky 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Giroud-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giroud 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schievink-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schievink 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Touze-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Touze 2003</LINK>) except for familial cases. It is still debated whether, in eICAD patients, anticoagulation or antiplatelet agents are superior, balancing risk and benefits of either approach (New Reference; <LINK REF="REF-Lyrer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lyrer 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lyrer-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lyrer 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Norris-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norris 2005</LINK>). Anticoagulation is widely advocated (<LINK REF="REF-Cimini-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cimini 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hart-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hart 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sturzenegger-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sturzenegger 1995</LINK>) and often used (<LINK REF="REF-Menon-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Menon 2008b</LINK>). However, there is no reliable evidence from randomised trials for the efficacy of this therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Leys-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leys 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schievink-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schievink 2001</LINK>). The beneficial effect of anticoagulants over antiplatelets may be offset by an increase in the number of bleedings (<LINK REF="REF-IST-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">IST 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Case observations of worsening of carotid stenosis suggested the occurrence of anticoagulation-mediated perpetuation of intramural bleeding in some patients with eICAD (<LINK REF="REF-Dreier-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dreier 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fluri-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fluri 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mokri-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Mokri 1986</LINK>). As a consequence, haemodynamic worsening might occur, which implies the risk of low-flow infarcts (<LINK REF="STD-Arauz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Arauz 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dreier-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dreier 2004</LINK>).</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2010-06-07 13:27:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of anticoagulants (AC) versus antiplatelet drugs (AP) in patients with eICAD. Our primary objective was to determine whether patients with eICAD receiving AC were more likely to have a better functional outcome such as not being dead or not being disabled, compared with those receiving AP.</P>
<P>Our secondary objectives were to evaluate:</P>
<UL>
<LI>whether patients had fewer ischaemic strokes, defined as the occurrence or recurrence of cerebral or retinal ischaemic events lasting more than 24 hours, when treated with AC compared with AP;</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>whether patients had more haemorrhages (symptomatic intracranial or major extracranial bleedings) when treated with AC compared with those treated with AP.</LI>

<P>All randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs), non-randomised studies or case series including at least four patients with eICAD that allowed comparisons between antithrombotic treatments for eICAD were eligible.</P>
<P>We sought information on the description of the diagnostic methods, the clinical presentation and the diagnostic findings. We searched for all information concerning treatment and all outcomes stratified to the used antithrombotic option (i.e. AP and AC). We included all studies that reported at least one primary outcome comparing patients treated with AC versus those treated with AP. We excluded studies reporting on a single treatment modality.</P>

<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2010-06-07 13:27:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Studies and series reporting patients who had experienced eICAD were eligible. Patients with stroke, transient ischaemic attacks or local neurological deficits as an initial event were taken together. Studies with patients whose diagnosis of eICAD was made by arterial angiography, duplex scanning, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging demonstrating the specific features of dissection were eligible. We accepted the following angiographic signs consistent with eICAD: mural haematoma, pseudoaneurysm, long tapering stenosis, intimal flap, double lumen, or occlusion more than 2 cm above the carotid bifurcation revealing a pseudoaneurysm or a long tapering stenosis after recanalisation.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2010-05-19 14:48:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We sought to identify all trials and studies where antithrombotic treatment (AP or AC) was given for eICAD. Antithrombotic treatment was defined as administration of any AP drug (i.e. acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), ticlopidine, clopidogrel, sulfinpyrazone, dipyridamole) or administration of full dose AC (such as intravenous or subcutaneous fractionated or unfractionated heparin or oral coumarin).</P>
<P>We only analysed the initially-used antithrombotic treatment. For example, if a patient had AC and later AP, the patient was analysed in the AC treatment group. If surgical intervention was mentioned as a treatment modality, we excluded the patient from the comparative analysis of AC versus AP treatment.</P>
<P>In patients receiving thrombolysis, the first antithrombotic agent used thereafter was deemed the 'initially-used antithrombotic treatment'. In cases of bleeding complications, we sought information on whether the bleed was associated with the thrombolytic treatment (rather than with the antithrombotic treatment).</P>

<P>We did not identify any completed RCTs or CCTs. There is one ongoing RCT comparing AC with AP in cervical artery dissection - Cervical Artery Dissection in stroke (<LINK REF="STD-CADISS" TYPE="STUDY">CADISS</LINK>). The trial started in August 2006. The randomisation goal is 250 patients (<LINK REF="REF-CADISS-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">CADISS 2009</LINK>). As at 21 November 2009, 51 randomised and 66 non-randomised participants have participated in the trial and three endpoints have occurred (personal communication) (<LINK REF="REF-CADISS-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">CADISS 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>We contacted the authors of an abstract about a planned trial (<LINK REF="REF-ECAD-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">ECAD 1993</LINK>); the trial never started because of lack of funding (personal communication).</P>

Among the 16 patients in whom details about the timing were provided, strokes occurred or recurred in 10/16 patients within eight days after treatment with antithrombotic agents had been started; i.e. on day one (two patients), at day three (three patients), at day four (two patients), at day seven (two patients) and at day eight (one patient). In one patient, a stroke occurred at day 12. In another five patients, strokes happened "within two weeks". In four patients, strokes recurred or occurred at 80 days (one patient) and in between 30 to 39 months (three patients). In three patients no information about the time to recurrent ischaemic strokes was provided. The stroke rate in the anticoagulation group was 1.87% (18/962) and 2.0% (6/300) in the AP group. The Peto odds ratio of 0.63 (95% CI 0.21 to 1.86, P = 0.41) indicated no significant difference between treatment options.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-06-09 11:26:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Extracranial internal carotid artery dissection (eICAD) is a major cause of ischaemic stroke in young individuals (<LINK REF="STD-Biller-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Biller 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bogousslavsky-1987b" TYPE="STUDY">Bogousslavsky 1987b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leys-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leys 2002</LINK>) but currently there are no data based on randomised trials available to assess the effects of anticoagulation versus antiplatelets. Thus, it is impossible to draw any definite conclusions. Nevertheless, this systematic review of all relevant observational case studies provides findings important for the design and promotion of antithrombotic RCTs in eICAD. In addition, the findings about the frequency of outcome events and complications stratified to the type of antithrombotic treatment may also be useful for management decisions and counselling of individual eICAD patients.</P>
<P>There was no significant difference in the odds of death comparing antiplatelet drugs with anticoagulants among 1285 patients. Interestingly, the frequency of death (i.e. 1.6%, 95% CI 1.0 to 2.4%) was low, and certainly lower than originally suggested (<LINK REF="STD-Richaud-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Richaud 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saver-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saver 1992</LINK>). However, some patients with severe infarctions from several studies were excluded because they had received neither anticoagulants nor antiplatelet agents (<LINK REF="STD-Ast-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ast 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bogousslavsky-1987b" TYPE="STUDY">Bogousslavsky 1987b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Colella-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Colella 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wahl-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Wahl 2002</LINK>) or had malignant infarctions (<LINK REF="STD-Georgiadis-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Georgiadis 2009</LINK>) without information about antithrombotic treatment. Therefore, the estimated death rate of this review reflects not that of eICAD patients in general but that of patients who are well enough to receive any kind of antithrombotic treatment. The assumption that the risk of dying due to eICAD is probably higher than 2.4% (i.e. the upper end of the 95% CI) is supported by the three-month death rate of 5.5% in a recent series of 55 dissection patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis (<LINK REF="REF-Engelter-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Engelter 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>For the outcome death or disability, this systematic review showed a trend towards superiority of anticoagulants over antiplatelets across all relevant observation case series. The point estimate indicates that patients treated with anticoagulants might have a more than 70% higher chance of avoiding death or disability compared with patients treated with antiplatelets. However, the wide confidence interval (0.98 to 3.22) indicates that this effect could be either much smaller or larger.</P>
<P>For the outcome ischaemic strokes during follow up, there was no significant difference between patients treated with anticoagulants versus those who were treated with antiplatelets. Interestingly, the point estimate of 0.63 might suggest rather a superiority of antiplatelets over anticoagulants than vice versa. This is perhaps surprising as it might be assumed that emboli arising from the distal part of the dissected artery may be of clinical importance and may cause fatal or disabling strokes (<LINK REF="REF-Anson-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anson 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Droste-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Droste 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Koennecke-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Koennecke 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oliveira-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Oliveira 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steinke-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steinke 1996</LINK>). Approximately, two out of three strokes occurred (or recurred in those with an initial stroke) within a week and three out of four (16 of 21 patients) within two weeks. These findings support the main results of a smaller previous series (<LINK REF="STD-Biousse-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Biousse 1995</LINK>). Interestingly, while stroke recurrence/occurrence within one day was most common in the series reported by <LINK REF="STD-Biousse-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Biousse 1995</LINK>, such a very early stroke occurrence was rare (2/16) in this review. These observations may have important implications. Firstly, there might be a chance to prevent strokes in eICAD patients, but preventive means have to start early. Secondly, randomising patients more than two weeks after the first symptom bears a remarkable risk of missing the most important treatment period in a randomised controlled trial.</P>
<P>For bleeding complications (i.e. symptomatic intracranial haemorrhages or major extracranial haemorrhages) there were no significant differences between the AC and the AP group. Such bleeding complications were rare (0.8% for symptomatic intracranial haemorrhages, 1.6% for major extracranial haemorrhages). Interestingly, they occurred exclusively in patients with anticoagulation. Likewise, the point estimates may suggest the possibility of a higher risk of relevant bleeding complications associated with anticoagulation - similar to the results from the International Stroke Trial (<LINK REF="REF-IST-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">IST 1997</LINK>). The lack of a statistically significant difference might be a matter of the sample size in combination with the infrequency of bleeding events.</P>
<P>Although there was an apparent trend in favour of anticoagulants (non-significant) for the outcome death or disability, this may have arisen from methodological biases. Antiplatelets could have been primarily applied in patients who were considered to have a poor prognosis, for example due to large infarcts (<LINK REF="STD-Bogousslavsky-1987b" TYPE="STUDY">Bogousslavsky 1987b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 1984</LINK>) or who were in a poor condition. Anticoagulation might be preferred in patients with a transient ischaemic attack (TIA). The lack of information on baseline characteristics including stroke severity prevented us from studying whether imbalances in baseline variables might have influenced the seemingly better result for the anticoagulation group in avoiding death or disability.</P>
<P>We are aware of other limitations. Outcome measurement was not applied uniformly in the included studies and the studies differed in their focus. It is therefore likely that there are important biases. Non-randomised studies are known to be highly susceptible to bias and outcome events may be under-represented (<LINK REF="REF-Chalmers-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalmers 1983</LINK>). Such biases encountered in the reported studies may be: reporting favourable cases; reports on selected cases as well as editorial biases, such as not allowing reports on already published issues by different authors; the choice of treatments may have been biased by the preference and experience of the treating physicians, and the habits and infrastructure of the institutions (<LINK REF="REF-Sackett-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sackett 1979</LINK>). In addition, the sample size of the only outcome with a result close to significance (i.e. death or disability P = 0.06) was much smaller than that of the other outcomes, as several studies did not provide data about disability. Thus, the trend towards superiority of anticoagulation with regard to death or disability among less than 500 patients might also be a chance finding.</P>
<P>As another limitation, we did not further study the impact of surgery in eICAD. As already shown in the 2003 update of this review, surgery appeared to have a higher rate of death (6% in excluded studies, 11% in included studies) compared with those who received antithrombotic drugs (i.e. 1.6%) (New Reference). We also did not study the effect of hyperacute treatment options such as thrombolysis or intra-arterial interventions including stenting, which was beyond the scope of this review. Furthermore, we focused on eICAD rather than on craniocervical artery dissections as it remains unclear whether carotid artery dissection and vertebral artery dissection as well as extracranial and intracranial dissections can be regarded as one entity.</P>
<P>This review attempted to systematically assess the evidence on antithrombotic eICAD treatment. Further steps could be to establish an international systematic registry for eICAD with standardised recording of diagnosis, therapeutic modalities and outcome. This would allow the gathering of more uniform information on the disease and its prognosis. The Cervical Artery Dissection and Ischemic Stroke Patients (CADISP) Group (<LINK REF="REF-CADISP-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">CADISP 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CADISP-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">CADISP 2009b</LINK>) has initiated such a registry. Results are expected in early 2011.</P>
<P>A large RCT comparing anticoagulants with antiplatelets in eICAD is important and could solve the decades-long debate whether to use immediate anticoagulation or not. Indeed, a UK-based feasibility study is ongoing (<LINK REF="REF-CADISS-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">CADISS 2009</LINK>). If possible, randomisation of eICAD patients in such a RCT is encouraged. Other groups intend to initiate RCTs too (<LINK REF="REF-CADISP-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">CADISP 2009a</LINK>). All current and planned RCTs should consider predefining an individual patient data meta-analysis - as done in the carotid stenting versus endarterectomy trials - in order to gather the best evidence for antithrombotic treatment in eICAD. Taking into account our findings, protocols for RCTs should include a stringent definition of carotid dissection, a standardised diagnostic protocol, strictly random allocation to antiplatelet agents versus anticoagulants, as well as accurate unbiased assessment of outcome. In addition, imbalances in important prognostic variables must be avoided.</P>
<P>Our findings allow some estimation about the sample sizes. On the basis of our results, we recommended using death or disability as the outcome measure. We estimate a sample size of at least 1600 patients in each treatment arm in order to detect (power 90%) a 5% difference in the proportion of patients dead or disabled from 30% to 25% (a 25% relative odds reduction). For ischaemic stroke, the sample size to detect a 1% absolute odds reduction (from 2.5% to 1.5 %) is estimated to be at least 8000 patients (4000 in each arm) (power 90%, significance level 5%). Interestingly, if we had based a sample size calculation on the figures observed for either antithrombotic modality in this review, a sample size greater than 300,000 patients would have been required to detect a significant difference for ischaemic stroke (power 80%, significance level 5%). Fewer than 300 patients would have been necessary to detect a significant difference for the outcome death or disability (power 90%, significance level 5%).</P>
<P>Until more evidence-based information is available, our data showed that patients with eICAD are unlikely to be harmed by antiplatelet drugs and there seems little justification for giving anticoagulants as a first line therapy in all patients.</P>
