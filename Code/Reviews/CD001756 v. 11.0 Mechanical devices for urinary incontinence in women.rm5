<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-12-15 10:33:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Urinary incontinence is involuntary loss of urine. The common types are stress and urge incontinence. Mechanical devices are made of plastic or other materials. They are placed within the urethra or vagina in order to stop or control the leakage of urine. This review of trials found that using mechanical devices might be better than no treatment but the evidence is weak. There was not enough evidence to recommend any specific type of device or to show whether mechanical devices are better than other forms of treatment such as pelvic floor muscle training.</P>

<P>For this second update we searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE in process, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings (searched 21 August 2014), EMBASE (January 1947 to 2014 Week 34), CINAHL (January 1982 to 25 August 2014), and the reference lists of relevant articles.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-12-15 10:33:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>One new trial was identified and included in this update bringing the total to eight trials involving 787 women. Three small trials compared a mechanical device with no treatment and although they suggested that use of a mechanical device might be better than no treatment, the evidence for this was inconclusive. Four trials compared one mechanical device with another. Quantitative synthesis of data from these trials was not possible because different mechanical devices were compared in each trial using different outcome measures. Data from the individual trials showed no clear difference between devices, but with wide confidence intervals. One trial compared three groups: a mechanical device alone, behavioural therapy (pelvic floor muscle training) alone and behavioural therapy combined with a mechanical device. While at three months there were more withdrawals from the device-only group, at 12 months differences between the groups were not sustained on any measure.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-04-13 09:33:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The place of mechanical devices in the management of urinary incontinence remains in question. Currently there is little evidence from controlled trials on which to judge whether their use is better than no treatment and large well-conducted trials are required for clarification. There was also insufficient evidence in favour of one device over another and little evidence to compare mechanical devices with other forms of treatment.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-12-17 09:36:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-12-17 09:36:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Efficient urinary control depends on normal functioning detrusor (bladder) muscles, nerves, proximal urethral support, bladder neck closure and a normal urethra (<LINK REF="REF-Bourcier-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bourcier 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Stress urinary incontinence is the most common type of incontinence, occurring in about half of incontinent women when lack of support at the bladder neck inhibits urethral closure. As a result, activities that increase intra-abdominal pressure can cause involuntary leakage during effort, exertion, sneezing or coughing. Urgency urinary incontinence accounts for around 10% of incontinence and occurs when involuntary detrusor muscle contraction causes a rise in intravesical (bladder) pressure, a condition known as detrusor overactivity. In another 30% of cases, both stress and urgency urinary incontinence are present, with either type being predominant, known as mixed urinary incontinence (<LINK REF="REF-Hannestad-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hannestad 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Hay_x002d_Smith-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hay-Smith 2009</LINK>,)</P>
<P>It is widely believed that the most effective treatment for severe or persistent stress urinary incontinence is surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Downs-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Downs 1996</LINK>). Nevertheless, to avoid surgical risk, non-surgical measures are usually the first line of management for stress urinary incontinence. Non-surgical treatments include lifestyle interventions (such as weight reduction), pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT; <LINK REF="REF-Dumoulin-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dumoulin 2014</LINK>), vaginal cones (<LINK REF="REF-Herbison-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herbison 2013</LINK>), electrical stimulation devices (<LINK REF="REF-Berghmans-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berghmans 2013</LINK>), oral medication (for example alpha-adrenergic agonists (<LINK REF="REF-Alhasso-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alhasso 2005</LINK>) or selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (<LINK REF="REF-Mariappan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mariappan 2005</LINK>)), scheduled voiding regimens (<LINK REF="REF-Ostaszkiewicz-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ostaszkiewicz 2004</LINK>), local or systemic oestrogen treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Cody-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cody 2012</LINK>) and mechanical devices within the urethra or the vagina (the subject of the current review). These modalities, which might be able to provide some extrinsic support for the bladder neck and urethra, are relatively inexpensive and do not compromise future surgical treatment.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-12-15 10:35:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The use of mechanical devices for urinary incontinence in women has been said to date back to Egyptian times (<LINK REF="REF-Edwards-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 1970</LINK>). Despite this long tradition, and perhaps because of the lack of evidence, mechanical devices are not often used in the management of incontinence today.</P>
<P>Over the past three decades efforts have been made to develop devices with evidence-based designs to control urinary incontinence. The devices that have been used include:<BR/>

</UL>
<P>New devices periodically appear on the commercial market, initially espoused enthusiastically by the manufacturers, only to vanish within a short span of time. In most cases the clinical data supporting the use of these devices appears to be of poor quality.</P>
<P>This review addresses the role of various mechanical devices in the management of urinary incontinence,including those designed to control urinary leakage by being inserted into the urethra or vagina or applied to the external surface of the urethra.</P>
<P>We excluded weighted vaginal cones (<LINK REF="REF-Herbison-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herbison 2013</LINK>) and electrical devices (<LINK REF="REF-Berghmans-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berghmans 2013</LINK>) since these treatment modalities aim to improve the function of pelvic floor musculature and have been examined in other Cochrane reviews. We have also excluded pads, catheters and other collecting devices since their function is to collect or divert the urine rather than controlling the incontinence. Urinary incontinence in men may be managed by mechanical devices (for example penile clamps) and are also the subject of a separate Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 2012</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-12-15 12:35:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Women suffering from stress incontinence commonly have excessive mobility of the urethrovesical junction and proximal urethra. During increases in intra-abdominal pressure, normal spatial relationships between the urethra, bladder and pelvis are disrupted. This results in deficient transmission of pressure to the proximal urethra, causing inadequate closure pressure and allowing leakage. Many intravaginal devices aim to restore the position of the upper urethra to above the level of the pelvic floor. The devices are thought not to be effective in patients with a fibrotic urethra, in which the fibrosis limits the transmission of pressure. In women with intrinsic sphincter deficiency, intraurethral devices may have a role in controlling incontinence by applying external pressure to the bladder base to keep it closed.</P>
<P>Although mechanical devices are most commonly used in stress incontinence, urethral plugs or external meatal devices, which act by blocking the leakage of urine, may occasionally be used in other types of urinary incontinence such as mixed and urgency.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-12-15 10:39:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Incontinence can have a devastating effect on the lives of sufferers and their families. Women suffer the physical discomfort associated with incontinence as well as potential social isolation and psychological distress. Incontinence also results in substantial cost to service providers and society. The aim of this review is to address the use of mechanical devices by systematically bringing together the best evidence available.</P>

<P>The title and abstract of all references identified by the search strategy were assessed by both update review authors. The reports of all possibly eligible studies were evaluated for appropriateness for inclusion by the review authors without prior consideration of the results. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion and, where this was not possible, a final decision was made by a third person. Studies were excluded from the review if they were not randomised or quasi-randomised trials or if they made comparisons other than those specified.

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2014-12-15 10:40:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Data extraction was undertaken independently by the two update review authors using a standard data extraction form. Where data were possibly collected but not reported, clarification was sought from the trialists. Included trial data were processed as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Trial data were considered according to the type of management against which the devices were being compared. Trials were also grouped by type of incontinence: either stress, urge or mixed incontinence based on symptom classification or urodynamic criteria. Any differences of opinion were resolved by discussion with a third party.</P>
<P>The review was conducted using the standard Cochrane RevMan software. Quantitative synthesis was planned if more than one eligible study was identified. Where appropriate, a pooled estimate of treatment effect across similar studies was to be calculated for each prespecified outcome, using standard statistics such as odds ratio for dichotomous data or weighted mean differences for continuous outcomes. The 95% confidence intervals were generated, where possible. For categorical (dichotomous) outcomes, the risk ratios (RR) were calculated. For continuous variables, means and standard deviations were used aiming to derive a mean difference. A fixed-effect approach to the analysis was planned unless there was evidence of heterogeneity across studies.</P>
<P>A narrative review of eligible studies was undertaken where statistical synthesis of data from more than one study was not possible or not considered appropriate. Data from cross-over trials were analysed using the generic inverse variance approach, if possible. When insufficient information was reported and no estimates were available from the other studies, a value of 0.5 was imputed for the correlation between repeat outcomes on the same patient. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken to investigate the robustness of results to imputed correlation values. Data on the number of women with each outcome event, by allocated treated group (irrespective of compliance and whether or not the patient was later deemed ineligible or otherwise excluded from treatment or follow-up) were sought to allow intention-to-treat analysis.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2014-12-15 10:40:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Assessment of risk of bias for each included study was undertaken individually by each review author using the Cochrane Collaboration's 'Risk of bias' tool. This tool is used to determine the quality of random allocation and allocation concealment, appropriate handling of of dropouts and withdrawals, whether intention to treat analysis was used, and whether blinding was employed during treatment and at outcome assessment. It was appreciated that blinding is not possible for women in studies involving the use of mechanical devices, but it might be possible for those assessing some outcomes.

One three-arm trial contained an intervention group, a behavioural therapy group and a combined intervention-and-behavioural therapy group (<LINK REF="STD-Richter-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Richter 2010</LINK>). Four out of the eight trials were cross-over trials (<LINK REF="STD-Glavind-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Glavind 1997b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nielsen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Nielsen 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nygaard-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Nygaard 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thyssen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Thyssen 2001</LINK>).

<P>Three trials compared the use of a mechanical intravaginal device versus no treatment. Two trials were cross-over and the comparison with no treatment was during exercise (<LINK REF="STD-Glavind-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Glavind 1997b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nygaard-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Nygaard 1995</LINK>).

<P>Nygaard's three-arm cross-over trial (<LINK REF="STD-Nygaard-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Nygaard 1995</LINK>) compared a pessary versus a tampon versus no device or treatment: eighteen women were randomised but fourteen were included in the analysis as four were stated to be continent during the trial. Although the pad weight was highest in the no-device group, the confidence intervals around the difference were wide and the results were not statistically significant for tampon compared with no treatment (Mean difference in grams (MD) -14.30, 95% CI -38.41 to 9.81, <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>.1).

<P>The published report of the <LINK REF="STD-Nygaard-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Nygaard 1995</LINK> trial showed a statistically significant difference between the tampon and pessary treatment groups and the control group. This could be due to the imputed correlation being too low though a very high value was required to show a significant difference (approximately 0.9). Alternatively, it could be due to the skewness in the data, for which the analysis used in the paper compensated. Nygaard dichotomised the data for the pad weight test and reported zero out of 14 had low weights (less than 4 g) with no device compared with eight out of 14 with the tampon and five out of 14 with a pessary.</P>
<P>Women in the Nygaard trial were asked about discomfort. Four of the 18 women found the pessary uncomfortable (RR 9.00, 95% CI 0.52 to 155.86, p= 0.13, <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>.1).

One in each of the groups found the device useful.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Cornu-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Cornu 2012</LINK> trial measured the change in incontinence episodes from baseline and then compared the change score between groups (rather than using the absolute score at outcome) in 55 women.

In the results of a 24 hour pad test the confidence intervals were wide and the results did not show a statistically significant improvement in incontinence (MD -32.90, 95% CI -109.41 to 43.61, <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>).</P>

There was no difference in the mean reduction in urine loss (67.6% for NEAT and 59.3% for Reliance; p = 0.72). Instead of using the number of pad changes to grade incontinence, the trial used leakage score. At four months, the NEAT group had a higher leakage score than the Reliance group but this was not statistically significant (2.25 versus 1.50; p &gt; 0.05). The ease of use was also assessed using a score and there was no difference between the devices (2.18 for NEAT versus 2.14 for Reliance; p &gt; 0.05). The two groups were combined to assess side effects and adverse symptoms because of the small sample size and, therefore, no comparison can be made.

<P>In one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Boos-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Boos 1998</LINK>), based on an intention to treat analysis, nineteen of 48 women (39%) were reported as subjectively dry at six months with a Reliance device compared to 20 of 53 (38%) with a FemAssist device, but this difference was not statistically significant (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.72, <LINK REF="CMP-006.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.1</LINK>). Numbers improved (excluding those subjectively dry) at six months: 12 out of 48 women using a Reliance device reported improvement of incontinence. This difference was not statistically significant when compared with 13 out of 53 using a FemAssist device (RR 1.02; 95% CI 0.52 to 2.01, <LINK REF="CMP-006.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.2</LINK>).</P>
<P>At the six month assessment, pad test weights decreased significantly in both groups from baseline: the Reliance group had a mean pad weight of 1.3 g compared to a baseline of 33.8 g and those using FemAssist had a mean value of 3.6 g compared to a baseline of 36 g. The difference between the devices at 6 months was statistically significant favouring Reliance (RR -2.30, 95% CI -3.52 to -1.08, <LINK REF="CMP-006.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.3</LINK>). Pad changes over five days at six months also significantly favoured the Reliance device (MD -0.92, 95% CI -1.20 to -0.64, <LINK REF="CMP-006.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.4</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was no statistically significant difference in urinary tract infection rates (UTI) at six months (six out of 40 versus five out of 31;RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.36 to 3.20, <LINK REF="CMP-006.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.5</LINK>). However, there were significantly fewer incontinence episodes in the FemAssist group at six months (MD 0.33 per day, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.59, <LINK REF="CMP-006.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.6</LINK>).</P>
<P>There were no incidents of migration of the Reliance device into the urethra and on three occasions a smaller size was required at one-month follow-up. Subjectively, the FemAssist device was more comfortable although it required a greater degree of user skill for appropriate insertion.</P>
<P>Several quality of life measures were taken and both the King's Health Questionnaire and SF-36 were relevant to this review. There was no significant difference between the two devices on any of the domains of the King's Health Questionnaire:</P>

<P>In this comparison and Comparison 8, data were given for outcomes at three and 12 months.</P>
<P>Using an intention to treat analysis, after three months fewer women (59/149, 40%) reported continence as being much or very much better with the pessary compared with those using behavioural therapy (PFMT; 72/146, 49%) on the Patient Global Impression of Improvement rating, although this was not statistically significant (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.04, <LINK REF="CMP-007.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.1</LINK>.1). At 12 months the difference between the groups was less: 47/149 (32%) reported their continence as being much or very much better with the pessary compared with 48/146 (33%) with behavioural therapy (RR 0.96. 95% CI 0.69 to 1.34, <LINK REF="CMP-007.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.1</LINK>.4).</P>
<P>Women were asked about bothersome symptoms using the Urinary Distress Inventory sub-scale (UDIS) of the Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI). At three months the data favoured the PFMT-only group, withno bothersome symptoms of stress incontinence in 49/149 (33%) of the pessary group versus 71/146 (49%) of the behavioural group which was statistically significant (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.90, p=0.007, <LINK REF="CMP-007.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.1</LINK>.2). This difference narrowed at 12 months to 35% and 40% respectively (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.16, <LINK REF="CMP-007.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.1</LINK>.5).</P>
<P>There was little difference between the groups in incontinence episodes according to bladder diaries; more than 75% reduction in weekly incontinence episodes in 69 (46%) of the pessary group and 68 (47%) of the behavioural group at three months (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.27, <LINK REF="CMP-007.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.1</LINK>.3); and 34% versus 37% respectively at 12 months (RR 0.96, 99% CI 0.78 to 1.27, <LINK REF="CMP-007.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.1</LINK>.6). Neither of these results were significant but the confidence intervals were wide.</P>
<P>Another outcome, not originally listed but judged to be important during the update of the review was patient satisfaction: 94/146 (64%) of the pessary group and 110/149 (74%) of the behavioural group were satisfied with their treatment at three months (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.02, <LINK REF="CMP-007.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.2</LINK>.1).

<P>Withdrawal after three months due to failure/lack of efficacy/dissatisfaction was 26% (39/149) in the pessary group and 15% (22/146) in the behavioural group (RR 1.74, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.78, <LINK REF="CMP-007.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.3</LINK>.1) By 12 months this had increased to 36% (53/149) and 32% (47/146) respectively (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.52, <LINK REF="CMP-007.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.3</LINK>.2).</P>

<P>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Richter-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Richter 2010</LINK>) compared an intravaginal pessary alone with combined treatment (an intravaginal pessary plus PFMT).</P>
<P>In this comparison, results are given at three and 12 months.

No data were available regarding numbers of women who may have dropped one element of therapy. Using an intention to treat analysis after three months, fewer women (59/149, 40%) reported their continence as being much or very much better with the pessary alone compared to combined treatment (pessary and PFMT; 80/150 (53%) on the Patient Global Impression of Improvement rating (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.95, p= 0.02, <LINK REF="CMP-008.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.1</LINK>.1).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2014-12-15 10:45:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The ideal mechanical device is one which can adequately control urine leakage, is easy to insert, has few adverse effects and is of low cost; the use of the device should improve health status and quality of life for users.</P>
<P>Two main types of mechanical device were identified: those that are placed inside the vagina; and those that are used to occlude or plug the urethra. It is possible that intravaginal tampons may perform as well as more formal mechanical devices. They are widely available and familiar to women. They are also without significant adverse effects and are the least expensive option. It would be useful to conduct a large well-designed trial comparing the use of intravaginal tampons with no treatment in women with stress urinary incontinence. As one of the management strategies for incontinence, especially in the elderly, is use of collection devices such as pads or catheters, a useful comparison might also be mechanical device use versus use of a collecting device.</P>
<P>In summary, from the trials included in this review the value of mechanical devices in the management of urinary incontinence remains uncertain. Six of the eight included studies were of a very small sample size, not large enough to reliably detect a difference. There is a lack of evidence to suggest whether the use of mechanical devices is better than no treatment and a large well-conducted trial is required for clarification. There was insufficient evidence to favour one device over another and the evidence to compare mechanical devices with behavioural therapy remains inconclusive.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-12-15 10:44:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Is a mechanical device better than no treatment or a combined treatment? Of the eight trials that addressed this question, all reported data (suitable for analysis) for the outcomes of interest. None had a high risk of bias.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, we found only very limited evidence from controlled trials on which to judge whether or not any device was effective. One trial included in this update compared a mechanical device with behavioural therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Richter-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Richter 2010</LINK>). This trial, together with the additional trial identified for this update (<LINK REF="STD-Cornu-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Cornu 2012</LINK>), and a newly released electronic PhD thesis (<LINK REF="STD-Boos-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Boos 1998</LINK>) attempted to address some of this review's broader outcomes, namely women's perception of their health status related to incontinence, and quality of life. It was interesting to note that the addition of behavioural therapy (PFMT) to the use of an incontinence device (pessary) does not appear to result in improved outcomes, apart from small but statistically significant effects for satisfaction, withdrawal and perceived improvement at three months. However, this result should be interpreted with caution as participants receiving behavioural therapy had four clinic visits whereas most of those in the device-only group had only one clinic visit. Higher levels of clinician contact could impact on participant perceptions of satisfaction and improvement. To establish definitively whether combining PFMT with a mechanical device providespatient benefits, the clinician contact must be controlled for, and a more robust range of outcome measures would be required.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-12-15 10:44:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite the addition of extra data from one trial and addition of a new trial, the review remains underpowered to assess the effectiveness of mechanical devices for female urinary incontinence.</P>
<P>Although there were several types of mechanical devices used in these studies, including different versions of each device, few are commercially available. Whilst it is not immediately obvious why so many devices seem to have been developed but never withstood the test of time, we can speculate that the lack of good quality supportive clinical trial data was a contributory factor. Another reason might be that women do not like using a mechanical device and would prefer to use the other available options such as PFMT or surgery.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-12-15 10:44:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The quality of the evidence was generally fair. However, some trial reports were unclear regarding randomisation, allocation concealment methods and methods of blinding participants and outcome assessors.</P>
<P>The review was limited by few trials that were generally of small size (hence giving wide confidence intervals around estimated differences), each addressing a different comparison and with short follow-up. Assessment was generally confined to objective measures of urine loss using a weighed pad tests. However, this latest update begins to address other parameters of a device's value to women in the form of quality of life measures, with cost effectiveness yet to be considered. The data were too few and the results too statistically imprecise to provide useful assessment of whether any device is better than no device and whether one device is better than another.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, we recognise that the conduct of trials involving interventions such as mechanical devices for incontinence management is fraught with difficulties. Clearly, one of the difficulties faced by trialists remains the problem of how to deal with the issue of blinding and the definition of an appropriate 'placebo' arm. Patient blinding may not be entirely feasible and blinding of care givers would not be possible in this type of trial. In one trial, a ring diaphragm was inserted into the vagina and then immediately removed when women were allocated to no treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Nygaard-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Nygaard 1995</LINK>). Thirteen of the 18 participants correctly identified that no mechanical device was in place.</P>

<P>We are unaware of another systematic review on this topic.

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The available evidence is insufficient to clarify the current place of mechanical devices in the management of female urinary incontinence.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-12-15 10:45:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three broad issues need to be addressed through new research. The first is whether a device is better for selected women than not using the device. Such a trial might be particularly appropriate amongst women where incontinence is not sufficient to justify surgery. The second issue is whether one type of device is more helpful than another. It is striking how many commercially developed devices have come and gone and an appropriate comparator for a new device might be intravaginal tampons. Such a trial might be mounted amongst women who would normally have surgery but who choose not to or are unfit for surgery. The third issue is the extent to which mechanical devices are an alternative to current standard approaches to management, such as PFMT, periurethral injection therapy or minimally invasive sling surgery.</P>
<P>Evaluations should address all aspects of the devices that are important to women and to those providing care: do they satisfactorily control urine leakage; are they sufficiently easy to use to be practical; do they have any unwanted effects; what are their costs to women or the local health service; are they acceptable to women; and do they make women feel better? Including well-validated quality of life measures in future studies would add to the knowledge of what is important for women who are incontinent.</P>
<P>As discussed in the review, there are challenges to designing rigorous trials of mechanical devices. Standard parallel-group designs have advantages, particularly for assessing longer-term effects. However, cross-over designs may be more practical, acceptable and statistically 'efficient'.</P>
