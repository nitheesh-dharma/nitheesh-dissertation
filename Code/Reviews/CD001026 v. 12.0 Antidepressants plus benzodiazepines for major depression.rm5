<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>The reviewers report that a combination of benzodiazepines with antidepressants works in favour for the treatment of depression, because it decreases drop outs from treatment and it increases short-term response up to four weeks. However, there are downsides to this combination therapy because benzodiazepines can induce dependence, which is estimated to occur in one third of patients, as well as a decline in the drug's effect over time. Benzodiazepines have been associated with an increase in accident proneness. </P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Anxiety frequently coexists with depression. Adding benzodiazepines to antidepressants is commonly used to treat people with depression, although there has been no convincing evidence to show that such a combination is more effective than antidepressants alone. There are suggestions that benzodiazepines may lose their efficacy with long-term administration and their chronic use carries risks of dependence.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of adding benzodiazepines to antidepressants for adults with major depression.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR) (March 1999), The Cochrane Library (issue 3, 1997), MEDLINE (1972 to September 1997), EMBASE (1980 to September 1997), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1972 to September 1997), Biological Abstracts (1984 to September 1997), LILACS (1980 to September 1997), PsycLIT (1974 to September 1997), combined with handsearching, reference searching, SciSearch and personal contacts. We did an updating search of the CCDANCTR in December 2004.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All randomised controlled trials that compared combined antidepressant-benzodiazepine treatment with antidepressants alone for adults with major depression. Exclusion criteria were: antidepressant dosage lower than 100 mg of imipramine, or its equivalent daily, and trial duration of less than four weeks. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers independently extracted the data and assessed the eligibility and quality of the studies. Standardised weighted mean differences and relative risks were estimated with random effects models. The dropouts were assigned the least favourable outcome. Two sensitivity analyses examined the effect of this assumption as well as the effect of including medium quality studies. Three a priori subgroup analyses were performed with regard to the patients with or without comorbid anxiety and with regard to the type of benzodiazepines.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>We identified 10 studies involving a total of 731 patients. The standardised mean difference for combined therapy over antidepressants alone was -0.33 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.51 to -0.15) at one week, and -0.29 (95% CI -0.51 to -0.08) at four weeks, but was no longer statistically significant at six to twelve weeks. If one qualitatively outlying study was excluded, patients on the combination therapy were less likely to drop out than those on antidepressant alone (relative risk (RR) 0.63, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.81). The patients allocated to the combination therapy were less likely to drop out from the treatment due to side effects than those receiving antidepressants alone (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.91). However, these two groups of patients were equally likely to report at least one side effect (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.23).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The potential benefits of adding a benzodiazepine to an antidepressant must be balanced judiciously against possible harms including development of dependence and accident proneness, on the one hand, and against continued suffering following no response and drop out, on the other.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Depression often presents with anxiety. The rate of anxiety comorbidity among patients with depression varies between 33% to 85% (<LINK REF="REF-Wetzler-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wetzler 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murphy-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murphy 1990</LINK>). Reviews of randomised controlled trials show, however, that anxiolytic benzodiazepines, with the possible exception of some triazolo-benzodiazepines for mild to moderate depression, are less effective than standard antidepressants in treating major depression (<LINK REF="REF-Birkenhager-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Birkenhager 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schatzberg-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schatzberg 1978</LINK>). The advantages of adding benzodiazepines to antidepressants are unclear. There are suggestions that benzodiazepines may lose their efficacy with long term administration (<LINK REF="REF-CRM-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">CRM 1980</LINK>) and that their chronic use carries risks of dependence (<LINK REF="REF-Schweizer-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schweizer 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Combination prescriptions appear to be common in many parts of the world. For example, a multi-centre study in Japan found that approximately 60% of the first visit psychiatric patients with major depression were prescribed benzodiazepines (excluding those used as hypnotics) in addition to antidepressants (<LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2000</LINK>). In the USA, among depressed outpatients visiting general medical and psychiatric clinics, one out of three patients receiving antidepressant medications also received minor tranquillisers concurrently (<LINK REF="REF-Wells-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wells 1994</LINK>). The older patients tended to receive more benzodiazepines than the younger patients among HMO patients with depression (49% and 33% respectively) (<LINK REF="REF-Bartels-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bartels 1997</LINK>). In another study primary care physicians prescribed antidepressants to more than half (56%) of their patients diagnosed as depressed; of these, 16% were co-prescribed benzodiazepines (<LINK REF="REF-Olfson-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olfson 1992</LINK>). In England, of 100 patients attending general practitioners with non-psychotic psychiatric disorders (mostly depression), 91 received some psychotropic drugs; 43% of these were on a combination of antidepressants and 'tranquillisers' (<LINK REF="REF-Mann-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mann 1981</LINK>). In a survey of primary care practices in Holland, 5% of the patients presenting with depression and anxiety received an antidepressant only, 16% an anxiolytic only and 5% a combination of antidepressant and anxiolytic (<LINK REF="REF-van-den-Brink-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">van den Brink 1991</LINK>). In France, a general population survey revealed that slightly less than two thirds of antidepressant users were also prescribed benzodiazepines (anxiolytic or hypnotic) concomitantly (<LINK REF="REF-Bouhassira-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bouhassira 1998</LINK>). At a university psychiatric clinic in Germany, monotherapy was applied in only 37% of all cases, and a combined psychopharmacotherapy in 63% of cases (<LINK REF="REF-Grohmann-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grohmann 1980</LINK>). In Italy, among 281 cases treated in acute psychiatric in-patient services, only two patients were prescribed an antidepressant alone while 44 received a combination of benzodiazepine and antidepressant (<LINK REF="REF-de-Girolamo-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Girolamo 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>Unfortunately, "standard practice" does not always reflect the best available evidence. There have been several randomised controlled trials examining the combined antidepressant-benzodiazepine treatment in depression but the results vary (<LINK REF="REF-Birkenhager-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Birkenhager 1995</LINK>) and, to the best of the present reviewers' knowledge, they had not been systematically reviewed. The first version of this systematic review was published in 2002 with literature search up to 1999, and we hereby present its first major updated version, with literature search up to December 2004.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>1. To determine whether combining antidepressants with benzodiazepines confers any benefit over and above treatment with antidepressants alone among adult patients with major depression. The benefits in terms of the speed and magnitude of symptomatic recovery and the side-effects profile will be investigated. </P>
<P>2. The short term (less than eight weeks) and long term (more than two months) effects will be separately examined, because there are suggestions that benzodiazepines may lose their efficacy with long term administration (<LINK REF="REF-CRM-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">CRM 1980</LINK>) and that their chronic use carries risks of dependence (<LINK REF="REF-Schweizer-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schweizer 1998</LINK>). </P>
<P>3. To see if additional benzodiazepines benefit those depressive patients with high anxiety but not those with low anxiety (by conducting subgroup analyses of severity of comorbid anxiety). </P>
<P>4. To see if short-acting benzodiazepines given at bedtime influence daytime mood (by conducting subgroup analyses of use of short acting benzodiazepines). </P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>All relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) meeting the below criteria were included.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Participants had to be adults (aged 18 or older) with major depression, diagnosed according to any one of the Feighner criteria, the Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC), the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 3rd Edition (DSM-III), 3rd Revised Edition (DSM-III-R) or 4th Edition (DSM-IV), or the 10th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). Comorbidities with anxiety disorders were included.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>The comparisons had to be between any combination of antidepressants and benzodiazepines versus antidepressants alone. Antidepressants had to be prescribed, on average, at a dosage higher than the minimum known to be effective in depression, i.e. 100 mg daily of imipramine or its equivalent (<LINK REF="REF-Blashki-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blashki 1971</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Thompson-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 1989</LINK>). The combination therapy must have lasted at least four weeks, the minimum time required for antidepressants to show effect.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>
<U>Primary outcome</U>: </P>
<P>1. Depressive severity - studies had to include at least one measure of depressive severity. The symptom severity could be measured by either self-report or observer-rating (our preference).</P>
<P>
<U>Secondary outcomes</U>: </P>
<P>1. Response in depression, usually defined as 50% or greater reduction in depression severity measures, and global response.<BR/>2. Acceptability of treatment as measured by leaving study early for any reason.<BR/>3. Anxiety severity<BR/>4. Insomnia severity<BR/>5. Side effects were evaluated by counting numbers of drop outs due to side effects and total number of patients experiencing at least one side effect.</P>
</CRIT_OUTCOMES>
</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>See: Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group search strategy </P>
<P>We searched The Cochrane Library and the trials register of the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group for studies since January 1972. We limited the search to studies since 1972 because none of the operationalized diagnostic criteria listed in the study selection criteria existed before this period. In Septermber 1997, we searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, Biological Abstracts, LILACS and PsycLIT. In September 1998 and in March 1999, we did an updating search with the Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis trials register (CCDANCTR: Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group Controlled Trials Register). After publication of the first version of this sytematic review, we ran the first major updating search with the CCDANCTR in December 2004.</P>
<P>No language restriction was imposed (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>). The references of the selected studies were also inspected for more published reports and citations of unpublished research. All the selected studies were sought as a citation in the Scisearch in order to identify more studies. </P>
<P>1. Electronic searching</P>
<P>The Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group Strategy for controlled trials have been undertaken for the following databases: <BR/>MEDLINE (1966-present)<BR/>EMBASE (1980-present) <BR/>Biological Abstracts (1984-present) <BR/>PsycLIT (1974-present) <BR/>LILACS (1980-present) <BR/>Cochrane Library <BR/>See: Collaborative Review Group search strategy</P>
<P>A subset of the Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis trials register was obtained by combining the following search terms in September 1997, September 1998 and March 1999: <BR/>#1 antidepress* <BR/>OR tricycl* <BR/>OR heterocycl* <BR/>OR TCA <BR/>OR "serotonin reuptake inhibitor*" <BR/>OR SSRI <BR/>OR "monoamine oxidase inhibitor*" <BR/>OR MAOI <BR/>OR amitriptylin* <BR/>OR amoxapin* <BR/>OR benactyzin* <BR/>OR bupropion* <BR/>OR citalopram* <BR/>OR clomipramin* <BR/>OR clorgylin* <BR/>OR deanol* <BR/>OR dothiepin* <BR/>OR doxepin* <BR/>OR fluoxetin* <BR/>OR fluvoxamin* <BR/>OR imipramin* <BR/>OR iprindol* <BR/>OR iproniazid* <BR/>OR isocarboxazid* <BR/>OR lofepramin* <BR/>OR maprotilin* <BR/>OR mianserin* <BR/>OR moclobemid* <BR/>OR nialamid* <BR/>OR nortriptylin* <BR/>OR opipramol* <BR/>OR paroxetin* <BR/>OR phenelzin* <BR/>OR pizotylin* <BR/>OR protriptylin* <BR/>OR quipazin* <BR/>OR sulpirid* <BR/>OR timipramin* <BR/>OR tranylcypromin* <BR/>OR trazodon* <BR/>OR viloxazin* <BR/>#2 benzodiazepin* <BR/>OR anti-anxiety <BR/>OR anxiolyt* <BR/>OR alprazolam* <BR/>OR anthramycin* <BR/>OR bromazepam* <BR/>OR chlordiazepoxid* <BR/>OR clonazepam* <BR/>OR clorazepat* <BR/>OR diazepam* <BR/>OR diltiazem* <BR/>OR estazolam* <BR/>OR flumazenil* <BR/>OR flunitrazepam* <BR/>OR flurazepam* <BR/>OR lorazepam* <BR/>OR medazepam* <BR/>OR midazolam* <BR/>OR nitrazepam* <BR/>OR nordazepam* <BR/>OR oxazepam* <BR/>OR pirenzepin* <BR/>OR prazepam* <BR/>OR temazepam* <BR/>OR triazolam* <BR/>#3 #1 AND #2 <BR/>#4 depression* (keyword) <BR/>OR depressive-disorder* (keyword) <BR/>#5 #3 AND #4 <BR/>For International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, in addition to #1 - #3 above, RCTs were sought with the following terms in September 1997. <BR/>#6 randomized controlled trial* OR controlled trial* OR clinical trial* <BR/>#7 random* <BR/>#8 (singl* OR doubl* OR tripl* OR trebl*) AND (blind* OR mask*) <BR/>#9 crossover <BR/>#10 versus OR vs <BR/>#11 #6 OR #7 OR #8 OR #9 OR #10 <BR/>Strategy #4 to limit the search to articles dealing with depression was not employed for the International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, as we were not sure if all the relevant studies would have such words either in their title, abstract or keyword field. </P>

<P>All the selected studies were sought as a citation in the Scisearch in order to identify more studies.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>
<B>Selection of studies</B>
</P>
<P>In 1997 and 1999, one reviewer (TAF) assessed every report identified by the search strategy described above for relevance to this review. The criteria for selection at this stage were simple and broad so as not to miss any relevant study and were: </P>
<P>1. Randomisation;<BR/>2. Diagnosis of depression (not necessarily by operationalized criteria);<BR/>3. Comparison between antidepressant-benzodiazepine versus antidepressant alone. The reviewer at this stage was not blind to the names of the authors, institution, journal of publication and results when he made the selection of trials. </P>
<P>The eligibility and the methodological quality of the selected trials were then assessed by two independent reviewers (LTY and DLS), blind to the authors, institution, journal of publication and results of the study. There are some studies suggesting that blind assessments of trial quality may lead to significantly different scores than open assessments (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McNutt-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">McNutt 1990</LINK>). The eligibility criteria consisted of six items using the criteria listed above for considering studies. </P>
<P>In December 2004, an updating search was done in the following manner: Two reviewers (TAF and YK) assessed every report identified by the above search strategy from the CCDANCTR. Full reports of all the studies that were rated positive by either reviewer according to the above mentioned rough eligibility criteria were obtained and further checked for the above mentioned strict eligibility and methodological quality by TAF. </P>
<P>
<B>Quality assessment</B>
</P>
<P>The criteria for the quality assessment were based on the recommendations of the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Mulrow-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mulrow 1997</LINK>). Firstly, on the basis of explicit criteria, quality of randomisation in treatment conditions was assessed and trials were assigned to one of the three categories: A: adequate concealment, B: unclear concealment, and C: inadequate concealment. There is empirical evidence that lack of quality of randomisation can produce biased results (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chalmers-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalmers 1983</LINK>). Secondly, based on the statements in the studies, the quality of double blinding was rated as A: double-blind, B: unclear blinding, and C: not blind. There is some evidence to suggest that trials that are not double blind yield biased results (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Colditz-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colditz 1989</LINK>). The inter-rater reliability of the two validity criteria for these studies was represented by weighted kappas.</P>
<P>
<B>Data extraction</B>
</P>
<P>Two reviewers (TAF and DLS) independently extracted the data from the original reports using data extraction forms. They covered: name and type of study setting; diagnostic criteria used; number of subjects allocated (their diagnostic composition, age, sex, previous treatment, baseline depressive and anxiety severity, medical comorbidity); details of intervention, duration of intervention, co-intervention (if any), number of dropouts for any reason (their depressive and anxiety severity and response rate at one, two, four and eight weeks); and later the number of dropouts due to side effects, and number of those with at least one side effect.</P>
<P>
<B>Data synthesis</B>
</P>
<P>The selected studies employed a variety of outcome measures at different time intervals. If more than 50% of the subjects were lost to follow up in any group of the study, this study was considered to be of low methodological quality and the effects of including or excluding it were examined in the sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>Continuous outcome variables of depressive and anxiety severity at approximately the same time point were combined using standardised weighted mean differences (SMD). Continuous data from different measures were transformed into standard effect size by dividing mean values by standard deviations. The DerSimonian Laird random effects model was employed because this tends to produce wider confidence intervals and is hence more conservative than Mantel-Haenzel fixed effects model (<LINK REF="REF-Berlin-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berlin 1989</LINK>). The primary outcome for depressive severity was based on the observer-rated scale, preferably the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD).</P>
<P>The "response" for the primary outcome of depressive severity was defined as 50% reduction of the depression scale from baseline or equivalent according to the primary study authors' definition. This dichotomous measure of response was included in our data analysis because it is intuitively easier to understand, is more amenable to worst case scenario intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis and because it was expected that some studies may not have reported all the necessary data to enable meta-analytic summary of a continuous measure but still contain the data to enable the dichotomous analysis. Dichotomous outcome variables such as response rates, dropout rates, and presence or absence of side effects at approximately the same time point were combined using the relative risk (RR) of the DerSimonian and Laird random effects model, because this has been found to be more interpretable and more generalisable than risk differences, odds ratios or fixed effect model relative risk (<LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2002</LINK>). </P>
<P>The number needed to treat (NNT) was calclated by taking the average event rate among the controls and then applying RR to this rate. That is, NNT=1/(RR * mean - mean).</P>
<P>Where studies did not report the response rates for depressive severity, usually defined by the original authors as 50% or greater reduction in the HRSD score, we imputed the values by assuming the normal distribution for the HRSD scores at each time point and calculated the number of subjects below half the baseline HRSD score. This way of imputing response rates, especially in the case of the HRSD, has strong empirical support; when the same strategy was employed in four completed meta-analyses of depression and anxiety, the agreement between the actually observed versus the imputed numbers of responders was almost perfect with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.97 (95%CI 0.95 to 0.98) (<LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the "as reported" analyses of both continuous and dichotomous variables, we used the numbers reported by the original authors, who often relied on the last observation carried forward method to impute the values for dropouts who had at least some post-randomisation data. For dichotomous variables, the worst case scenario ITT analyses were possible, in which we accounted for those dropouts who had been randomised but were not included in the origial authors' reports by assigning them the least favorable outcome.</P>
<P>Where studies did not report the standard deviations of continuous measure scores and original authors were unable to provide standard deviations, we used the pooled standard deviation obtained from all the studies examined in our previous systematic overview on the antidepressant treatment of depression (<LINK REF="REF-Joffe-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joffe 1996</LINK>). Empirical evidence suggests that imputing missing standard deviations this way in meta-analyses can provide quite accurate results (<LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-in-press" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa in press</LINK>).</P>
<P>If the scores of continuous variables for a particular time point were missing but those for the time points before and after that particular one were reported, we interpolated the values, assuming a linear change between these time points.</P>
<P>Statistical heterogeneity among the combined studies was evalued by means of the Q statistics and I squared statistics. P values smaller than 0.1 and I squared greater than 30% were considered to be suggestive of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two sensitivity analyses were performed, first to see the influence of including studies judged low in methodological quality (category B for allocation concealment, or categories B or C for double blinding, or loss to follow up greater than 50%), and second to examine whether the decision to perform an ITT analysis affected the final results of the review, compared to an analysis that did not count people who were completely lost to follow up. </P>
<P>Subgroup analyses should be performed and interpreted with caution because multiple analyses will lead to false positive conclusions (<LINK REF="REF-Oxman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oxman 1992</LINK>). However, because there were reasons to suspect that differences in the severity of comorbid anxiety, and differences between short-acting benzodiazepines given at bedtime and the others (such as long-acting benzodiazepines taken at bedtime and anxiolytic benzodiazepines taken during the day) may affect the outcome measures, we performed these a priori subgroup analyses when there were sufficient subjects involved.</P>

<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>The search yielded 1075 articles, of which 28 papers describing 20 studies were judged to meet our initial broadly set of selection criteria. Reference searching of these articles revealed five more papers describing four more studies. SciSearch of these papers revealed 400 more references, from which no new studies were found. Our personal files and consultation with colleagues added one more study. All in all, we were able to locate 34 articles, representing 25 studies. </P>
<P>Excluding two studies in German and in Japanese (rated by TAF), the agreement between the two independent reviewers with regard to the six criteria for eligibility was excellent, with quadratic weighted kappas between 0.77 to 1.0 (mean: 0.88). According to the consensus among the reviewers whereby any remaining discrepancies were resolved, nine studies were finally judged eligible out of the 25 studies.</P>
<P>One new study was identified and was incorporated into the updated review (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). One new article (<LINK REF="REF-Londborg-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Londborg 2000</LINK>) reporting on a re-analysis of data from <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1998</LINK> was identified and the findings were incorporated into this updated review. </P>
<P>Another RCT was identified which compared antidepressant plus serotonergic anxiolytic and antidepressant alone for major depression, but the antidepressant dosage was inadequate and therefore it was not included (<LINK REF="STD-Yamada-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Yamada 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Ten studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dominguez-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Dominguez 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fawcett-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Fawcett 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feet-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Feet 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jacobson-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobson 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nolen-1993-b" TYPE="STUDY">Nolen 1993 b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Calcedo-Ordonez-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Calcedo Ordonez 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scharf-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Scharf 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yamaoka-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Yamaoka 1994</LINK>) were judged eligible. </P>
<P>Five of the included studies lasted four weeks, two lasted six weeks, two lasted eight weeks and one lasted 12 weeks. For further information on the included trials, see the "Characteristics of Included Trials" table.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>Only two out of the eligible ten studies provided enough details about their randomisation scheme to allow confidence about their adequacy. Seven studies were described as double blinded. We designated two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Jacobson-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobson 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1998</LINK>) whose allocation was adequately concealed and which were double blind as high quality, four studies which used double blinding as intermediate quality (<LINK REF="STD-Dominguez-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Dominguez 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fawcett-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Fawcett 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feet-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Feet 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scharf-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Scharf 1986</LINK>), and four studies which were not clear about double blinding or whose drop out rate was high (&gt;50% in either arm) as low quality (<LINK REF="STD-Nolen-1993-b" TYPE="STUDY">Nolen 1993 b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Calcedo-Ordonez-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Calcedo Ordonez 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yamaoka-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Yamaoka 1994</LINK>). Only trials rated as A or B on the criteria for concealment of random allocation were included in the quantitative analyses. We decided to be more lenient with regard to the blinding because there is good evidence that even allegedly double-blind or triple-blind studies may not be able to keep the participants blind (<LINK REF="REF-Margraf-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Margraf 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brownell-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brownell 1982</LINK>). The inter-rater reliability of the two validity criteria for these studies was represented by weighted kappas of 1.0 and 0.90.</P>
<P>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dominguez-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Dominguez 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nolen-1993-b" TYPE="STUDY">Nolen 1993 b</LINK>) did not report the standard deviations of their HRSD scores and, when contacted, the original authors were unable to provide standard deviations. We therefore substituted them with the pooled standard deviation obtained from all the studies examined in our previous systematic overview on the antidepressant treatment of depression (<LINK REF="REF-Joffe-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joffe 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>In one out of 42 measurements of depression severity (at zero, one, two, four and eight weeks or later) of the trial it was necessary to interpolate missing values (<LINK REF="STD-Feet-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Feet 1985</LINK>). </P>
<P>Seven studies did not report the response rates for depressive severity, usually defined by the original authors as 50% or greater reduction in the HRSD score (<LINK REF="STD-Yamaoka-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Yamaoka 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scharf-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Scharf 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nolen-1993-b" TYPE="STUDY">Nolen 1993 b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feet-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Feet 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fawcett-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Fawcett 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dominguez-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Dominguez 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Calcedo-Ordonez-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Calcedo Ordonez 1992</LINK>). We therefore imputed the values by assuming the normal distribution for the HRSD scores at each time point and calculated the number of subjects below half the baseline HRSD score. The comparisons between the actually reported and the imputed values were possible for 10 time points and their correlation was as high as 0.98 (95% CI 0.93 to 1.00). </P>
<P>More than half of the patients allocated to the antidepressant alone arm were lost to follow up in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yamaoka-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Yamaoka 1994</LINK>). These studies were classified as low quality and the effect of their inclusion was examined in sensitivity analyses. </P>
<P>Funnel plot analyses of response rates or of depressive severity were not suggestive of publication bias, although the number of studies included in the present review was rather small and the visual inspection cannot completely rule out the possibility of publication bias.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>Altogether, we included 731 patients in the present meta-analysis.</P>
<P>
<B>Depression severity<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>The severity of depression was measured by the HRSD in nine out of ten studies; one study (<LINK REF="STD-Feet-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Feet 1985</LINK>) employed the Comprehensive Psychiatric Rating Scale Visual Analog Scale.</P>
<P>When the outcome was expressed on a continuous scale, the SMD for depression severity was -0.33 (95% CI -0.51 to -0.15) at one week, -0.40 (95% CI -0.69 to -0.10) at two weeks, -0.29 (95% CI -0.51 to -0.08) at four weeks, -0.15 (95% CI -0.47 to 0.16) at six to eight weeks, and -0.39 (95%CI -0.95 to 0.17) at twelve weeks. The results at two weeks were highly heterogeneous but they were not so at one, four or six to eight weeks.</P>
<P>
<B>Depression response<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>The rates of patients showing greater than 50% reduction from their baseline depressive severity at one, two, four and six to eight weeks and beyond are summarised. Neither statistical testing for heterogeneity nor graphical inspection showed strong heterogeneity among the studies combined.</P>
<P>According to the worst case scenario ITT analyses, the pooled RR was 1.65 (95% CI 1.20 to 2.29) at one week, 1.42 (95% CI 1.15 to 1.76) at two weeks, 1.31 (95% CI 1.07 to 1.59) at four weeks, 1.08 (95% CI 0.84 to 1.37) at six to eight weeks, and 0.97 (95%CI: 0.73 to 1.29) at twelve weeks.</P>
<P>Taking the average control event rate of the included RCTs, the obtained RRs can be translated into the numbers needed to treat (NNTs) as follows. The NNT for improvement in depression was 12 (95%CI 6 to 40) at one week, 9 (95%CI 5 to 26) at two weeks and 8 (95%CI 4 to 37) at four weeks, according to the ITT (worst case scenario) analysis. </P>
<P>According to the "as reported" analyses, the combination group was more likely to show greater than 50% reduction from their baseline depressive severity than the antidepressant alone group at one to two weeks (RR 1.57 95% CI 1.14 to 2.17 at one week; RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.50 at two weeks) but this difference was no longer statistically significant after this period (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.29 at four weeks, RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.19 at six to eight weeks, and RR 1.05, 95%CI 0.81 to 1.36 at twelve weeks).</P>
<P>Excluding those studies of low quality (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yamaoka-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Yamaoka 1994</LINK>), the people in the combination therapy group were 1.62 (95% CI 1.15 to 2.27) times at one week, 1.37 (95% CI 1.09 to 1.72) times at two weeks, 1.18 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.41) times at four weeks, and 0.95 (95% CI 0.75 to 1.19) times more likely to show improvement in their depression at six to eight weeks. The two high quality studies produced RR 2.45 (95% CI 1.45 to 4.15) at one week, 1.58 (95% CI 1.15 to 2.16) at two weeks, and 1.40 (95% CI 1.08 to 1.81) at four weeks. These sensitivity analyses of study quality were in line with the overall findings, although the higher quality studies generally tended to show somewhat greater differences in improvement between combination therapy and antidepressant alone. These sensitivity analyses were done on an ITT (worst case scenario) basis.</P>
<P>
<B>Anxiety<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>Two studies reported repeated measurements of the study participants' anxiety severity by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (<LINK REF="STD-Calcedo-Ordonez-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Calcedo Ordonez 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fawcett-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Fawcett 1987</LINK>). Another study employed the State Anxiety Scale (<LINK REF="STD-Scharf-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Scharf 1986</LINK>). Because no criteria to define response on these scales were reported, we report the SMD for these three studies. The results suggest the superiority of the combination therapy in alleviating anxiety even up to six to eight weeks, with statistically significant SMDs between -0.50 and -0.64. The Q statistics for heterogeneity were not significant and the I squared were suggestive of some heterogeneity.</P>
<P>
<B>Insomnia<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>Some might argue that the response in terms of HRSD may reflect changes in sleep and anxiety only and not in core depressive symptoms. Only two studies examined these possibilities. By calculating anxiety subscale and insomnia subscale scores out of the total HRSD, <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1998</LINK> found significant superiority of the combined fluoxetine plus clonazepam treatment for all subscales, whereas <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2002</LINK> employing basically identical procedures confirmed superiority in terms of insomnia subscale only.</P>
<P>
<B>Acceptability of treatment<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>Premature drop out from the treatment for any reason was taken as a surrogate measure of acceptability of treatment. Patients allocated to the combination treatment were as likely to drop out from the treatment as those on antidepressant alone (RR 0.73, 95% CI: 0.48 to 1.12). However, the test of heterogeneity was significant (chi squared=17.33, df=8, P=0.03), with I squared of 53.8%, and visual inspection of individual RRs suggests <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2002</LINK> to be a clear, qualitative outlier. Excluding this study, which was the only study to extend the co-administration to 12 weeks, instead of six to eight weeks in the other studies, RR was significantly in favour of the combined treatment (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.82), and the test of heterogeneity was not significant (chi squared=6.78, df=7, P=0.45; I squared=0%). If we excluded this study and studies of low quality or those of low and intermediate quality, the results were not changed materially (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.89, and RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.75, respectively).</P>
<P>
<B>Side-effects<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>Side effects were measured from two perspectives: (a) the number of people dropping out due to side effects before the end of the study, and (b) the number of people reporting at least one adverse event. The patients allocated to the combination therapy were less likely to drop out from the treatment due to side effects than those receiving antidepressants alone (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.91). No discernible difference in the likelihood of reporting at least one side effect was seen between the two groups of patients (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.23). The test of heterogeneity was not significant in the former case (chi squared=7.15, df=8, P=0.52 and I squared 0%) but was marginally significant for the latter case (chi squared=11.71, df=6, P=0.07 and I squared 48.8%). This again seemed to be due to Smith 2002. </P>
<P>The NNT to prevent dropout due to side effects was 18 (95%CI 12 to 87).</P>
<P>Four reports enumerated details of observed side-effects. However, because individual symptoms of side-effects varied greatly from study to study and we have simply listed the reported values:<BR/>---Calcedo Ordonez 1992 reported dry mouth (79% in the combination arm, 76% in the antidepressant alone arm), drowsiness (44%, 15%), asthenia (24%, 17%), myalgia (15%, 12%), heartburn (3%, 10%), dyspepsia (12%, 2%), constipation (12%, 10%), dizziness (35%, 27%), tachycardia (6%, 10%), blurred vision (26%, 17%), and tremor (15%, 20%).<BR/>---Fawcett 1987 reported dry mouth (32%, 77%), drowsiness (73%, 61%), sedation (73%, 46%), unsteadiness (64%, 46%), lightheaded (41%, 58%), nervousness (55%, 46%), constipation (50%, 58%), appetite loss (50%, 15%), hypotension (41%, 42%), forgetfulness (41%, 35%), blurred vision (41%, 38%), confusion (36%, 23%), weakness (32%, 23%) and nasal congestion (32%, 23%).<BR/>---Jacobson 1978 reported sedative effects such as drowsiness and oversedation (60%, 40%), anticholinergic effects such as dry mouth, constipation and blurred visiion (48%, 48%), dizziness (6%, 14%), potency problems (8%, 8%), tremor (1%, 6%), fatigue (3%, 2%), and slurred speech (4%, 0%).<BR/>---Smith 1998 reported drowsiness/sedation (44%, 33%), nausea (17%, 25%), gastrointestinal disturbance (17%, 20%), headache (15%, 20%), nervousness (15%, 33%), sleep disturbance (7%, 20%), diarrhea (22%, 15%), weight loss (12%, 13%), diaphoresis (10%, 13%), delayed ejaculation (20%, 22%), decreased appetite (12%, 8%) and dry mouth (22%, 5%).</P>
<P>
<B>Subgroup analyses</B>
</P>
<P>We could not find enough trials for our first subgroup analysis with regard to comorbid anxiety. Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Jacobson-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobson 1978</LINK>) specifically targeted subjects with moderate to severe (high) anxiety, while only one other (<LINK REF="STD-Feet-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Feet 1985</LINK>) was conducted with patients with mild to moderate (low) anxiety. The former showed superiority of combination therapy at one and two weeks, while the latter did not find any statistically significant difference between the two groups throughout their eight week trial, as measured by improvement of depression. It should be noted that the latter trial allowed flunitrazepam 2 mg prn for insomnia as co-intervention. These two studies are not mutually incompatible as all the 95% CIs of their RRs easily overlap with each other (except at one week). </P>
<P>Our second subgroup analysis to see if short-acting benzodiazepines given at bedtime may also be effective on daytime mood led to some more interpretable findings. Pooling two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dominguez-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Dominguez 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nolen-1993-b" TYPE="STUDY">Nolen 1993 b</LINK>) which both used a short-acting benzodiazepine at bedtime produced RRs of 1.65 (95%CI 0.69 to 3.99) at one week, 1.14 (95%CI 0.67 to 1.96) at two weeks, and 1.43 (95%CI 0.68 to 3.03) at four weeks for depression improvement. Comparison of the other seven studies, which did not use this short-acting benzodiazepine at bedtime produced RRs of 1.65 (95%CI 1.17 to 2.34) at one week, 1.48 (95%CI 1.17 to 1.87) at two weeks, 1.30 (95%CI 1.04 to 1.62) at four weeks, 1.08 (95%CI 0.84 to 1.37) at six to eight weeks, and 0.97 (95%CI 0.73 to 1.29) at twelve weeks. None of these were strongly heterogeneous.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Aggregating ten studies involving a total of 731 patients, patients on combination therapy were more likely at one week, two weeks and four weeks to show response than those on antidepressant monotherapy, and the combination therapy group was less likely to drop out than the antidepressant alone group.</P>
<P>Numbers needed to treat (NNT) analysis suggest that one needs to treat only eight patients with an antidepressant plus a benzodiazepine over a four week period for one additional patient to show 50% or greater reduction in his or her depressive severity from baseline. Although the available studies were limited, we could not find evidence to suggest that the baseline comorbid anxiety level or the types of benzodiazepine co-administered would alter these general findings. At six to eight weeks, the relative risk for response was not significant and the possibility that the combination therapy might actually lessen or might not influence the response rate cannot be ruled out, although it is also possible that the corresponding NNT could be as small as four. </P>
<P>These are clinically meaningful figures. For example, chlorpromazine prevents one patient out of fourteen from dropping out of treatment, and promotes global improvement in one out of seven people with schizophrenia who are treated with it instead of placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Thornley-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thornley 2000</LINK>). The NNT of lithium in acute mania is about four (<LINK REF="REF-Bowden-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bowden 1994</LINK>) and that of selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for major depression is about five (<LINK REF="REF-Trindade-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trindade 1997</LINK>). In other words, combining a benzodiazepine with an antidepressant is as effective as chlorpromazine over placebo for acute schizophrenia, and nearly as effective as lithium over placebo for acute mania or SSRI over placebo for major depression.</P>
<P>The benefits of adding a benzodiazepine to an antidepressant must be balanced judiciously against possible harms, including development of dependence, tolerance, accident proneness, teratogenicity and costs among others. </P>
<P>It is now well recognized that benzodiazepines can induce dependence, defined as development of clinically meaningful symptoms upon its discontinuation. Although the reported incidence differs widely among studies, dependence is generally estimated to occur in almost one third of patients receiving regular prescription of a benzodiazepine for four weeks or longer (<LINK REF="REF-Noyes-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noyes 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schweizer-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schweizer 1998</LINK>). Predictors of severity of discontinuation symptoms have been identified and include drug variables (higher dosage, longer duration, shorter half-life, more rapid taper) and patient variables (higher pre-taper anxiety and depression, higher neuroticism, history of panic disorder, history of unsuccessful discontinuation, history of recreational alcohol or drug abuse). Studies of putatively dependent patients seen in psychiatric and primary care settings suggest that, once dependence develops, only about half of those who try can successfully discontinue the benzodiazepine. Gradual taper of long-half life benzodiazepines appear to increase the rate of successful discontinuation (<LINK REF="REF-Schweizer-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schweizer 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rickels-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rickels 1990</LINK>). However, a uniformly successful taper outcome is reported for first-time users overall (<LINK REF="REF-Bjerrum-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bjerrum 1996</LINK>). </P>
<P>In the case of the antidepressant-benzodiazepine combination therapy, discontinuation of benzodiazepine may cause, in addition to the above mentioned discontinuation symptoms of benzodiazepines, worsening of symptoms due to loss of synergistic treatment effects or to unmasking of adverse effects of antidepressants. Two RCTs have addressed the effects of tapering a benzodiazepine out of the combination therapy under a double-blind, placebo-controlled condition. <LINK REF="REF-Feet-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feet 1988</LINK> followed the participants in an RCT of combination therapy (included in this review). After the patients were on imipramine (100-200 mg/day) in combination with diazepam (10 mg/day) or placebo for three and a half months, those who were practically symptom free had their diazepam or placebo discontinued under double-blind condition. Out of 14 patients who had been on imipramine plus diazepam, 11 rated their own condition as impaired after discontinuation and three needed concomitant medication. Out of 13 patients who had been on imipramine plus placebo, four evaluated themselves as impaired and none needed additional medication. The number needed to harm (NNH) for impairment after discontinuation is two (95% CI 1 to 7) and that for unsuccessful discontinuation is five (not significant). </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Smith-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1998</LINK> conducted an RCT comparing fluoxetine plus clonazepam (0.5 to 1.0 mg/day) versus fluoxetine plus placebo in major depression. The investigators started tapering clonazepam and placebo after three weeks of the combination therapy and over two weeks. Out of 40 patients who were on fluoxetine and clonazepam, the number of patients who showed 50% or greater reduction from baseline on the HRSD was 18 at the beginning of taper and 21 at the end of taper, but decreased to 15 approximately 10 days after taper and returned to 24 approximately 20 days after taper. Out of 40 patients on fluoxetine plus placebo, the corresponding numbers were 11, 15, 16 and 21. More patients in the placebo group (10 out of 35, excluding those who dropped out before tapering) complained of new or worsened side effects during this gradual taper and immediately after taper than did patients in the clonazepam augmentation group (4 out of 40). None in the former group and one in the latter dropped out of the treatment because of side effects during or after the taper. The NNH for losing the "response" within 10 days after taper is seven (95% CI 4 to 25). The NNH for significant side effects for discontinuation is -5 (95% CI -3 to -105) and for unsuccessful discontinuation is 40 (not significant). On the other hand, Smith 2002 conducted a very similarly designed study comparing fluoxetine plus clonazepam versus fluoxetine plus placebo, but this time extended over 18 weeks. In addition, this study tapered off clonazepam between 12 and 15 weeks, i.e. over three weeks, and did not observe any rebound phenomenon.</P>
<P>Benzodiazepines are also believed to be subject to development of tolerance, which is a decline in a drug's effects over time. Thus the UK Committee on the Review of Medicines concluded 'there was little convincing evidence that benzodiazepines were efficacious in the treatment of anxiety after four months' continuous treatment" (CRM 1980). Since then, however, several studies suggest that tolerance develops to motor impairments and sedative effects but not to anti-anxiety effects of benzodiazepines (<LINK REF="REF-Lucki-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucki 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fabre-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fabre 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rickels-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rickels 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rickels-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rickels 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Burrows-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burrows 1993</LINK>). </P>
<P>Benzodiazepines have also been associated with accident proneness. Firstly, a cohort study on the association between first prescription of a benzodiazepine in the elderly and a subsequent hospitalisation due to a fall revealed a NNH around 110 to 190 (<LINK REF="REF-Neutel-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neutel 1996</LINK>). This NNH is comparable to the NNH of SSRIs or secondary-amine tricyclic antidepressants increasing hip fractures in elderly people (220, 95% CI 180 to 300; and 250, 95% CI 170 to 380, respectively) (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 1998</LINK>). Secondly, some epidemiological studies hint at an increase of motor vehicle accidents among benzodiazepine users. A cohort study on this problem (<LINK REF="REF-Neutel-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neutel 1995</LINK>) suggests that approximately 2900 persons need to be treated with a benzodiazepine for two months in order to cause one hospitalisation due to traffic accidents (NNH=2860, 95% CI 2050 to 4760). This increase in accident proneness with benzodiazepine use may be comparable to that with cyclic antidepressant use (<LINK REF="REF-Ray-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ray 1992</LINK>). A short-term experiment using healthy adults suggests that combining a benzodiazepine with an antidepressant might cause greater motor impairment than an antidepressant alone (<LINK REF="REF-Moskowitz-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moskowitz 1988</LINK>). </P>
<P>Teratogenicity of benzodiazepines is also an important clinical concern for women of child-bearing age, especially because they represent high-risk groups for major depression and because many pregnancies are unplanned. Older case-control studies proposed odds ratios around two to four after multiple searches for many possible causative agents (<LINK REF="REF-Saxen-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saxen 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Safra-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Safra 1975</LINK>). A recent meta-analysis of three cohort studies was unable to confirm this association (RR 0.9, 95% CI 0.6 to 1.4) (<LINK REF="REF-Dolovich-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dolovich 1998</LINK>). </P>
<P>Finally, the costs do not appear to pose an important problem against combination therapy. In Japan a one day supply of diazepam (15 mg) costs 33 yen and that of lorazepam (1.5 mg) costs 27 yen, while that of imipramine or amitriptyline (150 mg) costs 84 yen, that of trazodone (150 mg) 150 yen, that of fluvoxamine (100 mg) 187 yen and that of paroxetine (20 mg) 148 yen. If there is any reason to prescribe a newer, more expensive antidepressant over a classical tricyclic, then the cost consideration for adding a benzodiazepine should pose no concern. The relative costs of medications vary widely from country to country and clinicians need to reconsider the cost problem in each country.</P>
<P>In order to judge whether these apparent risks of therapeutic use of a benzodiazepine outweigh the benefits, we need to take into consideration the possibility that dropout from treatment with a major depressive does not mean "no therapy" nor simple suffering of the patients and those around them. It is more likely to mean use of alcohol, excessive smoking and possibly even use of illicit drugs. Such risk/benefit considerations may indeed offer a partial explanation for the fact that, even after all the above mentioned adverse effects have become widely recognised, there has been a limited amount of corresponding reduction in the prescriptions of benzodiazepines and these are still among the most frequently prescribed psychotropic medications world-wide. In the USA, a recent survey of nationally representative office-based physicians and psychiatrists revealed that in 1993 to 1994, anxiolytic or hypnotic drugs were being prescribed in one out of three visits for which psychotropic medications were prescribed (<LINK REF="REF-Pincus-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pincus 1998</LINK>). All in all, 29 million new prescriptions for benzodiazepines were written in the continental USA in 1989 (<LINK REF="REF-Anon-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anon 1991</LINK>). The prevalence of benzodiazepine hypnotic and anxiolytic use was 11% in a community survey of the people aged 65 years or older in Liverpool, UK in the year 1989 to 1991 (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 1998</LINK>). In 1989 to 1990 primary care physicians in Finland prescribed psychotropic drugs to a third of their patients, three quarters were receiving benzodiazepines in contrast to one quarter receiving antidepressants (<LINK REF="REF-Joukamaa-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joukamaa 1995</LINK>). In 1987 Italian general practitioners prescribed psychotropic drugs to 14% of their patients; over 70% of these were benzodiazepines and approximately 20% were antidepressants (<LINK REF="REF-Bellantuono-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bellantuono 1989</LINK>). Out of 162 recent RCTs of SSRIs, 58% allowed for use of chloral hydrate or short-acting benzodiazepines for insomnia and sleep disturbances (<LINK REF="REF-Trindade-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trindade 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>The strengths of the present meta-analysis include its reasonably comprehensive search for relevant studies, likely avoidance of publication bias (although we cannot be completely confident as the number of included trials was rather small), language bias, robustness of the obtained results as corroborated by various outcome measures and sensitivity analyses as well as by lack of heterogeneity. The obtained results were in dissonance with the philosophical or theoretical prediction of one of the authors of this systematic review.</P>
<P>The first and foremost of its weaknesses is that only one trial followed the patients beyond eight weeks. The present meta-analysis can therefore provide information only up to four weeks and, with less statistical power, up to twelve weeks. Three studies examined withdrawal of acute-phase benzodiazepines and two demonstrated some rebound (Feet 1988; Smith 1998) whereas another, which extended the use up to 12 weeks did not (Smith 2002). Secondly, it is of note that all but two of the antidepressants in the studies reviewed were tricyclics. The two studies employing fluoxetine were, however, not out of line with the other eight studies in terms of response rates according to tests of heterogeneity. Thirdly, some might argue that the response in terms of HRSD may reflect changes in sleep and anxiety only and not in core depressive symptoms. Only two studies examined these possibilities. By calculating anxiety subscale and insomnia subscale scores out of the total HRSD, <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1998</LINK> found significant superiority of the combined fluoxetine plus clonazepam treatment for all subscales, whereas <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2002</LINK>, employing basically identical procedures, confirmed superiority in terms of insomnia subscale only. The one study focusing on anxious depression demonstrated superiority of the combined treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Jacobson-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobson 1978</LINK>) whereas the other study focusing on non-anxious depression reported equivalence (<LINK REF="STD-Feet-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Feet 1985</LINK>). These conflicting findings are hard to interpret and generalise. Fourthly, no included study checked patients' compliance. Lastly, some numbers had to be imputed from data reported in the RCT itself or from data of other RCTs. We must note that the imputed values turned out to be remarkably consistent with the reported values, when both could be calculated. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The implications of the present meta-analysis for practice may be as follows. Unless you as a physician are among the few who never ever prescribe a benzodiazepine, there are good reasons to consider adding a benzodiazepine (including a short-acting hypnotic benzodiazepine given at bedtime) to the antidepressant you prescribe to the next patient you see with major depression, especially if he or she shows some anxiety or insomnia (which many patients with depression do), after carefully balancing and discussing with the patient the available evidence for and against such a combination. Whether or not the potential harms of benzodiazepines are important enough to offset the benefits of the combination therapy found in this review requires deliberation both on the part of the physicians and the patients. Individualizing the evidence to the particular patient (for example, with regard to the potential of abuse, the possibility of developing discontinuation syndromes, and the probability of other harms) should be tried. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The implications for research are clear. We need a long-term, pragmatic RCTs to compare the combination therapy (preferably involving two arms, one for continued combination and another withdrawing the benzodiazepine within a month or so) against the monotherapy of antidepressant in major depression. We can derive more information of clinical importance if such trials are complemented by non-treatment long term follow-up. We also hope that such trials may elucidate if different classes of antidepressants and/or benzodiazepines, and severity of baseline comorbid anxiety may matter.</P>
