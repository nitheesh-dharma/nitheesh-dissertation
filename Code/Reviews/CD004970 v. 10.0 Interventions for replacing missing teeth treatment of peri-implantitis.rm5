<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-12-05 12:38:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As with natural teeth, dental implants can be lost due to gum disease (peri-implantitis). This review looked at which are the most effective treatments to arrest peri-implantitis.<BR/>Nine studies were included in the review and evaluated eight different treatment modalities. In one small study of short duration (4 months), it was shown that the use of locally applied antibiotics in addition to the deep manual cleaning of the diseased implants decreased the depth of the pockets around the implants by an additional 0.6 mm in patients affected by severe forms of peri-implantitis. In another small study of 4-year duration, it was shown that placing an animal-derived bone substitute with a resorbable barrier decreased the depth of the pockets by an additional 1.4 mm than synthetic bone. The majority of trials testing more complex and expensive therapies did not show any statistically or clinically significant advantages over the deep mechanical cleaning around the affected implants. In conclusion, at present, there is too little evidence to determine which is the most effective way to treat peri-implantitis. This is not to say that currently used interventions are not effective.</P>

</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2011-12-05 12:49:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE. Handsearching included several dental journals. We checked the bibliographies of the identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and relevant review articles for studies outside the handsearched journals. We wrote to authors of all identified RCTs, to more than 55 dental implant manufacturers and an Internet discussion group to find unpublished or ongoing RCTs. No language restrictions were applied. The last electronic search was conducted on 9 June 2011.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2010-05-06 16:50:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Screening of eligible studies, assessment of the methodological quality of the trials and data extraction were conducted in duplicate and independently by two review authors. We contacted the authors for missing information. Results were expressed as random-effects models using mean differences for continuous outcomes and risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Heterogeneity was to be investigated including both clinical and methodological factors.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-12-05 12:36:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Fifteen eligible trials were identified, but six were excluded. The following interventions were compared in the nine included studies: different non-surgical interventions (five trials); adjunctive treatments to non-surgical interventions (one trial); different surgical interventions (two trials); adjunctive treatments to surgical interventions (one trial). Follow-up ranged from 3 months to 4 years. No study was judged to be at low risk of bias.</P>
<P>Statistically significant differences were observed in two small single trials judged to be at unclear or high risk of bias. After 4 months, adjunctive local antibiotics to manual debridement in patients who lost at least 50% of the bone around implants showed improved mean probing attachment levels (PAL) of 0.61 mm (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 0.82) and reduced probing pockets depths (PPD) of 0.59 mm (95% CI 0.39 to 0.79). After 4 years, patients with peri-implant infrabony defects &gt; 3 mm treated with Bio-Oss and resorbable barriers gained 1.4 mm more PAL (95% CI 0.24 to 2.56) and 1.4 mm PPD (95% CI 0.81 to 1.99) than patients treated with a nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-12-05 12:37:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is no reliable evidence suggesting which could be the most effective interventions for treating peri-implantitis. This is not to say that currently used interventions are not effective.</P>
<P>A single small trial at unclear risk of bias showed the use of local antibiotics in addition to manual subgingival debridement was associated with a 0.6 mm additional improvement for PAL and PPD over a 4-month period in patients affected by severe forms of peri-implantitis. Another small single trial at high risk of bias showed that after 4 years, improved PAL and PPD of about 1.4 mm were obtained when using Bio-Oss with resorbable barriers compared to a nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite in peri-implant infrabony defects. There is no evidence from four trials that the more complex and expensive therapies were more beneficial than the control therapies which basically consisted of simple subgingival mechanical debridement. Follow-up longer than 1 year suggested recurrence of peri-implantitis in up to 100% of the treated cases for some of the tested interventions. As this can be a chronic disease, re-treatment may be necessary. Larger well-designed RCTs with follow-up longer than 1 year are needed.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-11-01 11:31:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Missing teeth and supporting oral tissues have traditionally been replaced with removable dentures or fixed bridges permitting restoration of masticatory, phonetic function, and aesthetics. In 1977, Brånemark presented his research work carried out over 10 years showing that bone can grow intimately onto the surface of titanium implants (<LINK REF="REF-Br_x00e5_nemark-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brånemark 1977</LINK>). The now well-accepted concept, termed osseointegration, has undoubtedly been one of the most significant scientific breakthroughs in dentistry over the past 30 years. A multitude of implant designs have been marketed since, and the clinical situations in which osseointegrated implant-retained prostheses are used have expanded enormously.</P>
<P>One of the key factors for the long-term success of dental implants is the maintenance of healthy tissues around them. A cause-effect relationship between bacterial plaque accumulation and the development of inflammatory changes in the soft tissues surrounding dental implants has been shown (<LINK REF="REF-Pontoriero-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pontoriero 1994</LINK>). If this reversible condition, called 'peri-implant mucositis', is left untreated, it may lead to the progressive destruction of the tissues supporting an implant (peri-implantitis) and ultimately to its failure (<LINK REF="REF-Mombelli-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mombelli 1999</LINK>). In order to maintain healthy tissues around dental implants it is important to institute an effective preventive regimen (supportive therapy) and when a pathological condition of the tissues around implants is diagnosed a therapeutic intervention should be initiated as soon as possible (<LINK REF="REF-Esposito-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esposito 1999</LINK>). Different treatment strategies for peri-implantitis (failing implants) have been suggested, however, it is unclear which are the most effective (<LINK REF="REF-Esposito-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esposito 1999</LINK>). A prospective study on the treatment of peri-implantitis with surgical exposure and cleaning of the implant surfaces with hydrogen peroxide together with systemic antibiotics of 26 implants in nine patients indicated that 5 years after treatment seven implants failed, four had additional peri-implant bone loss, nine had unchanged bone levels, whereas six implants showed some bone gain (<LINK REF="REF-Leonhardt-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leonhardt 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The occurrence of peri-implantitis is not rare. In a recent single-cohort study (<LINK REF="REF-Roos_x002d_Jans_x00e5_ker-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roos-Jansåker 2006</LINK>), peri-implantitis, defined as a marginal bone loss of 3 mm or more in combination with bleeding on probing or pus or both, was diagnosed in 16% of patients treated with turned (machined) Brånemark implants 9 to 14 years after loading. The occurrence of peri-implantitis around implants with roughened surfaces is likely to be even higher, since it was observed in another Cochrane systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Esposito-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esposito 2007</LINK>) that statistically significantly more peri-implantitis occurred at 3 years of loading around implants with roughened surfaces when compared to turned (machined) Brånemark implants.</P>
<P>Marginal bone loss around dental implants may also be caused by occlusal overload as suggested by an experimental animal study (<LINK REF="REF-Isidor-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Isidor 1996</LINK>). However, the present review will focus exclusively on the treatment of peri-implantitis induced by plaque infection.</P>
<P>In the case of peri-implantitis, various interventions (often combined) have been suggested including: (a) mechanical debridement; (b) pharmaceutical therapy (subgingival chlorhexidine irrigation, local or systemic antibiotics); and (c) surgical procedures including: open flap debridement aimed at (1) removing bacteria (also using soft lasers), (2) smoothing the implant surface (to decrease surface roughness) and removing unsupported implant threads that protect bacterial plaque, (3) 'decontamination' or 'detoxification' of the implant surface using various chemical agents or laser beam. After the primary goal of surgical intervention (i.e. bacteria-free implant surface) has been achieved, it may be necessary to correct the anatomical conditions for improving plaque control and for eliminating the favourable environment for anaerobic bacteria (elimination of pathological peri-implant pockets). This may be achieved either with resective procedures or alternatively with bone regenerative procedures, including guided bone regeneration, autologous or allogenic bone grafts, etc. (<LINK REF="REF-Roos_x002d_Jans_x00e5_ker-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roos-Jansåker 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schou-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schou 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sahrmann-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sahrmann 2011</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Study selection</HEADING>
<P>The titles and abstracts (when available) of all reports identified through the electronic searches were scanned independently by two review authors. For studies appearing to meet the inclusion criteria, or for which there were insufficient data in the title and abstract to make a clear decision, the full report was obtained. The full reports obtained from all the electronic and other methods of searching were assessed independently by two review authors to establish whether the studies met the inclusion criteria or not. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. Where resolution was not possible, a third review author was consulted. All studies meeting the inclusion criteria then underwent validity assessment and data extraction. Studies rejected at this or subsequent stages were recorded in the table of excluded studies, and reasons for exclusion recorded.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction</HEADING>
<P>Data were extracted by two review authors independently using specially designed data extraction forms. The data extraction forms were piloted on several papers and modified as required before use. Any disagreement was discussed and a third review author consulted where necessary. All authors were contacted for clarification or missing information. Data were excluded until further clarification was available if agreement could not be reached.</P>
<P>For each trial the following data were recorded.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Year of publication, country of origin and source of study funding.</LI>
<LI>Details of the participants including demographic characteristics.</LI>
<LI>Details on the type of intervention.</LI>
<LI>Details of the outcomes reported, including method of assessment and time intervals.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Risk of bias in included studies</HEADING>
<P>The risk of bias assessment of the included trials was undertaken independently and in duplicate by at least two review authors as part of the data extraction process. In the case that the paper to be assessed had one or more review authors in the authors list, it was independently evaluated only by those review authors not involved in the trial.</P>
<P>This was conducted using the recommended approach for assessing risk of bias in studies included in Cochrane reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). It is a two-part tool, addressing the six specific domains (namely sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and 'other issues'). Each domain includes one specific entry in a 'Risk of bias' table. Within each entry, the first part of the tool involves describing what was reported to have happened in the study. The second part of the tool involves assigning a judgement relating to the risk of bias for that entry.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Summarising risk of bias for a study:</HEADING>
<P>After taking into account the additional information provided by the authors of the trials, studies were grouped into the following categories. We assumed that the risk of bias was the same for all outcomes and each study was assessed as follows.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Measure of treatment effect</HEADING>
<P>For dichotomous outcomes, the estimate of effect of an intervention was expressed as risk ratios (RR) together with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous outcomes, mean differences and standard deviations were used to summarise the data for each group using mean differences and 95% CIs.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Unit of analysis issues</HEADING>
<P>The statistical unit was the patient and not the implant unless the clustering of the implants within the patients had been taken into account in the analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dealing with missing data</HEADING>
<P>Attempts were made to retrieve missing data from authors of trials. Methods for estimating missing standard deviations in section 7.7.3 of the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) were to be used. Change data were used and if only cross-sectional data were available the standard deviation (SD) of the change was to be estimated assuming no within patient correlation, which would give rise to a conservative estimate of the SD for change (<LINK REF="REF-Follmann-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Follmann 1992</LINK>). The techniques described by Follmann (<LINK REF="REF-Follmann-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Follmann 1992</LINK>) were to be used to estimate the standard error of the difference for split-mouth studies, where the appropriate data were not presented and could not be obtained.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>The significance of any discrepancies in the estimates of the treatment effects from the different trials was to be assessed by means of Cochran's test for heterogeneity and heterogeneity would have been considered significant if P &lt; 0.1. The I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic, which describes the percentage total variation across studies that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance, was to be used to quantify heterogeneity with I<SUP>2 </SUP>over 50% being considered moderate to high heterogeneity.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of reporting biases</HEADING>
<P>If there had been sufficient numbers of trials (more than 10) in any meta-analysis, publication bias would have been assessed according to the recommendations on testing for funnel plot asymmetry (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>) as described in the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). If asymmetry was identified we would have examined possible causes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data synthesis</HEADING>
<P>Only if there were studies of similar comparisons reporting the same outcome measures a meta-analysis was done. Risk ratios were to be combined for dichotomous data, and mean differences for continuous data, using random-effects models provided there were more than three studies in the meta-analysis. Data from split-mouth studies were combined with data from parallel group trials with the method outlined by Elbourne (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>), using the generic inverse variance method in Review Manager (RevMan).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>Clinical heterogeneity was to be assessed by examining the types of participants and interventions for all outcomes in each study. It was decided not to formulate any hypotheses to be investigated for subgroup analyses since no significant meta-analysis was expected. However, this may be done in future updates of this review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analyses</HEADING>
<P>It was planned to undertake sensitivity analyses to examine the effect of the study quality assessment on the overall estimates of effect. In addition, the effect of including unpublished literature on the review's findings was also to be examined, but there were insufficient trials to undertake this.</P>

<U>Local antibiotics versus ultrasonic debridement</U>. Metronidazole gel 25% injected into the pocket at a depth of 3 mm versus ultrasonic debridement with carbon fibre tip inserted 1 to 2 mm into the gingival sulcus at the lowest power for 15 seconds. Both interventions were repeated a second time 1 week after (<LINK REF="STD-Tang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tang 2002</LINK>). The trial included IMZ and Frialit-2 implants.</LI>
<LI>
<U>Air-abrasive device versus manual debridement</U>. The test sites were treated with the Vector system (Dürr Dental, Bietigheim-Bissingen, Germany) with the straight or curved flexible Vector carbon fibre tip combined with aerosol spray of Vector fluid polish with hydroxyapatite particles (grain size approximately 10 µm) whereas the control sites with carbon fibre curettes (<LINK REF="STD-Karring-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Karring 2005</LINK>). No local anaesthesia was provided and the instrumentation of each implant was carried out for 2 to 3 minutes. The same treatment was repeated after 3 months. Following each treatment patients received oral hygiene instructions. The trial included two pairs of Brånemark, four of ITI and five of Astra implants.</LI>
<LI>
<U>Er:YAG laser versus manual debridement with chlorhexidine subgingival application</U>. Both trials were conducted by the same authors in a similar manner (<LINK REF="STD-Schwarz-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Schwarz 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schwarz-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Schwarz 2006a</LINK>). Oral hygiene instructions two to four times and supragingival cleaning with rubber caps and polishing paste were given prior to the initiation of the trials. In one group a Er:YAG laser (Key 3, KaVo, Biberach, Germany) emitting a pulsed infrared radiation at a wavelength of 2.94 µm<B> </B>was used.<B> </B>The laser parameters were set at 100 mJ/pulse, 10 Hz, and pulse energy at the tip was approximately 85 mJ/pulse. The laser beam was guided onto the implant surface under water irrigation with a specially designed periodontal handpiece (2061, KaVo, Biberach, Germany) and a cone-shaped glass fibre tip emitting a radial and axial laser beam. The fibre tip was guided in a circular motion from coronal to apical parallel to the implant surface in contact mode. In the control group manual debridement was performed with plastic curettes followed by pocket irrigation with 0.2% chlorhexidine and subgingival application of 0.2% chlorhexidine gel, followed by 2 weeks of mouthrinses with 0.2% chlorhexidine, twice a day for 2 minutes. For both groups, instrumentation was carried out until the operator felt that the implant surfaces were adequately debrided, on the average 6 minutes per implant. The trials included Brånemark System® (Nobel Biocare, Göteborg, Sweden), Camlog Screw Line® (Camlog, Wimsheim, Germany), Frialit (Dentsply Friadent, Mannheim, Germany), IMZ Twin Plus (Dentsply Friadent, Mannheim, Germany), ITI both SLA and TPS (Straumann, Waldenburg, Switzerland), Spline Twist MTX (Zimmer Dental, Freiburg, Germany), and ZL-Duraplant Ticer (ZL Microdent, Breckerfeld, Germany) implants.</LI>

<U>Er:YAG laser versus air-abrasive device</U>. Before enrolment in the study, any periodontal lesions at remaining teeth was treated (<LINK REF="STD-Renvert-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Renvert 2011</LINK>). Before the treatments, the supra-structures were removed. One group was treated with an air-abrasive device (Perio-Flow®, EMS, Nyon, Switzerland). The nozzle was placed in the pocket and used for approximately 15 seconds in each position circumferentially around the implant. Careful attempts were made to cover the full circumference of the implant. The Perio-Flow® device utilizes a 25 mm hydrophobic powder and a flexible tip allowing access to periodontal and implant pockets. The other group was treated with an Er:YAG laser (Key Laser 3 Perio, KaVo, Biberach, Germany) at an energy level of 100 mJ/pulse and 10 Hz (12.7 J/cm<SUP>2</SUP>) using a cone-shaped sapphire tip. The instrument tip was used in a parallel mode using a semicircular motion around the circumferential pocket area of the implant. Routine local anaesthesia was used as needed.

After flap elevation and removal of granulation tissues, implants were debrided using plastic curettes and rinsed with saline solution. Sites were filled or with nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite (Ostim, Heraeus Kulzer, Hanau, Germany) injected using a ready-to-use paste in a syringe or with a bovine-derived xenograft (Bio-Oss, Geistlich, Wolhusen, Switzerland, particle size 0.25 to 1 mm) in combination with a resorbable collagen barrier (Bio-Gide, Geistlich, Wolhusen, Switzerland) of porcine origin. Authors confirmed that no prophylactic antibiotics were given. The trial included Brånemark System® (Nobel Biocare, Göteborg, Sweden), Camlog Screw Line® (Camlog, Wimsheim, Germany), KSI Bauer Schraube (Bad Nauheim, Germany), ITI both SLA and TPS (Straumann, Waldenburg, Switzerland), Spline Twist MTX and Tapered Screw Vent (Zimmer Dental, Freiburg, Germany), and ZL-Duraplant Ticer (ZL Microdent, Breckerfeld, Germany) implants.</LI>

<U>Surface debridement with laser versus plastic curettes and saline solution before augmentation</U>. Two weeks after a single-course of non-surgical instrumentation with plastic curettes followed by pocket irrigation with 0.2% chlorhexidine and subgingival application of chlorhexidine gel (<LINK REF="STD-Schwarz-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Schwarz 2011</LINK>), patients were treated with access flap surgery, granulation tissue removal, and implantoplasty at buccally and supracrestally exposed implant surfaces. Implantoplasty was performed in a way to completely plane the threatened areas and smooth the structured implant surface using diamond burs and Arkansas stones under copious irrigation with sterile saline. Particular care was taken to completely remove any titanium deposits/dust from the surrounding tissues. The remaining intra-bony defects were randomly allocated to two different surface treatments:</LI>
</UL>
<OL>
<LI>Er:YAG laser (Elexxion Delos, Elexxion AG, Radolfzell, Germany) emitting a pulsed infrared radiation at a wavelength of 2.940 nm. The laser beam was guided onto the exposed implant surfaces under water irrigation with a specially designed periodontal handpiece and a lancet-shaped sapphire tip emitting a lateral laser beam (Experimental Duros Yip, Elexxion AG). Laser parameters were set at 100 mJ/pulse (11.4 J/cm2), 10 Hz, and pulse energy at the tip was approximately 90 mJ/pulse. The fibre tip was guided in a semicircular motion from coronal to apical parallel to the implant surface in the contact mode.</LI>
<LI>Plastic curettes plus cotton pellets soaked in saline solution followed by a thorough irrigation with saline solution.</LI>
</OL>
<P>In both groups, the intra-bony component was augmented with BioOss spongiosa granules, particle size 0.25 to 1 mm (Geistlich, Wolhusen, Switzerland). Before its application, the graft material was moistened in sterile saline for 5 minutes. Following grafting, a bioresorbable barrier porcine origin (BioGide, Geistlich) was trimmed and adapted over the entire defect so as to cover 2 to 3 mm of the surrounding alveolar bone. Neither sutures nor pins were used for membrane fixation. Finally, the mucoperiosteal flaps were repositioned coronally and fixed with mattress sutures to ensure a non-submerged healing procedure.</P>

<UL>
<LI>
<U>Adjunctive implant surface smoothening to systemic antibiotics plus resective surgery plus two different local antibiotics</U>. Systemic antibiotics (amoxicillin 50 mg/kg/die for 8 days per os) were administered and subgingival debridement with a plastic scaler was performed prior to the initiation of the trial. An apically repositioned flap was performed. Vertical releasing incisions were made, the granulomatous tissue and the inner pocket epithelium were removed with hand curettes, and alveolar bone peaks were removed with bone chisels. A gel of metronidazole (Elyzol 25%, Cabon S.p.A, Milan, Italy) followed by a solution of tetracycline hydrochloride (Ambramicina, Sharper S.p.A, Milan, Italy) was rubbed on the contaminated implant surface for 3 minutes and then washed off with cold sterile physiological saline solution. The exposed titanium plasma-sprayed (TPS) surface of the implants in the test group were polished with the following sequence of burs assembled on a handpiece rotating at 15,000 rpm: diamond/30 µm particle size egg-shaped bur and diamond/15 µm particle size egg-shaped bur (Komet, Gerb. Brasseler GmbH, Lemgo, Germany); Arkansas burs (Dura-Green and Dura-White, Shofu Inc, Kyoto, Japan); silicone polishers (Brownie, Greenie, Shofu Inc). The flaps were then apically repositioned.

After 6 months the authors reported no statistically significant difference for marginal bone levels and PPD, however, although the mean values appeared very similar, we were unable to use the data as we did not have the standard deviations.

<LI>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Schwarz-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Schwarz 2005</LINK>) of parallel group design compared YAG laser versus manual debridement and chlorhexidine irrigation/gel. Twenty patients with 32 implants affected by peri-implantitis were enrolled (10 patients with 16 implants in each group). One patient with two implants from the chlorhexidine group was withdrawn due to persisting pus formation 8 weeks after treatment. This patient was re-treated with Er:YAG laser treatment. We therefore substituted the 3-month for the missing 6-month data for this patient, so no patients were excluded from the analysis. There were no baseline imbalances for plaque, BOP, PPD, PAL and gingival recession (REC). No implant failures or complications occurred in any of the groups. After 6 months there were no statistically significant differences for changes in PAL, PPD and REC (<LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-003.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.4</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-003.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.5</LINK>).

<LI>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Schwarz-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Schwarz 2006a</LINK>) of parallel group design compared YAG laser versus manual debridement and chlorhexidine irrigation/gel. Twenty patients with 40 implants affected by peri-implantitis were enrolled (10 patients with 20 implants in each group). Two patients with four implants from the chlorhexidine group were withdrawn due to persisting pus formation between 4 and 12 weeks after treatment. These patients were re-treated with Er:YAG laser treatment. It was unclear whether there were baseline imbalances for plaque, BOP, PPD, PAL and REC. No implant failures occurred but one patient from the laser group had one perforation of the buccal keratinised mucosa which healed with an increased gingival recession (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>). After 1 year the authors reported there were no statistically significant differences for PAL, PPD and REC, however we were unable to use their data since original figures were not presented in the article and were not provided to us. After the 1-year follow-up all patients were re-treated with laser and augmentation therapies due to deterioration of BOP and PAL.

Twenty-one patients with 45 implants were treated with the air-abrasive and 21 patients with 55 implants with laser. Fourteen implants of the air-abrasive group and 17 implants of the laser group had pus on probing. There were no baseline imbalances for the groups. After 6 months there were no drop-outs, implant failures or complications and the study reported no statistically significant differences between the two procedures for PPD, peri-implant marginal bone levels and peri-implantitis recurrence (authors reported data: <LINK REF="CMP-007.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-007.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-007.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.3</LINK>).

Thirty-two patients with 36 implants affected by peri-implantitis were randomised to Er:YAG laser (16 patients with 19 implants) versus manual debridement (16 patients with 17 implants). One patient, from each group withdrew, for personal reasons. There were no baseline imbalances for smoking habits, type of implants, type of defects, plaque, BOP, PPD, PAL and REC.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-09-12 15:29:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Peri-implantitis is one of the complications affecting dental implants. Its real incidence is probably underestimated and might be influenced by various factors including the characteristics of the implant surface and design (<LINK REF="REF-Esposito-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esposito 2007</LINK>). If left untreated is very likely that peri-implantitis will lead to the failure of the affected implant(s) (<LINK REF="REF-Esposito-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esposito 1999</LINK>). This topic has grown in importance in the dental implant research agenda possibly because of the increased number of dental implants being placed and their longer follow-up periods which inevitably means more cases of peri-implantitis.</P>
<P>Six out of nine included studies were considered to be of high risk of bias. We shall briefly describe some issues which might help readers and investigators to critically evaluate randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in this area.<BR/>(1) Inclusion criteria. In several trials the initial degree of pathology (in particular the marginal bone loss) around the implants was not accurately described (<LINK REF="STD-Romeo-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Romeo 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schwarz-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Schwarz 2005</LINK>). If these parameters are not accurately described it will be difficult to compare trials or to extrapolate the study findings to other populations of interest. This might be particularly important in those situations in which a different degree of pathology may influence the prognosis and the therapy planning. Another four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Renvert-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Renvert 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Renvert-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Renvert 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Renvert-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Renvert 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sahm-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Sahm 2011</LINK>) had to be excluded since they clearly included an unknown quota of patients affected by peri-implant mucositis and not by frank peri-implantitis. The response to treatment and the prognosis of patients affected by peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis could be different, the former having a better response/prognosis since treated when the disease was at its early stages.<BR/>(2) Exclusion criteria. Some of the trials adopted too strict exclusion criteria. For instance the exclusion of smokers, of subjects lacking of attached mucosa (this could be quite difficult to evaluate when the peri-implant marginal tissues are very inflamed, as for many of the subjects in these trials), and patients with systemic diseases that could influence the outcome of the therapy, may limit the extrapolations of the findings to a broader population.<BR/>(3) Outcome measures. No trial clearly stated that implant failure was the main outcome measure, though information on implant failures was presented or provided by various authors. Among the secondary outcomes it may be that marginal bone level changes provide the most reliable information on the progression of the disease. This was used only in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Karring-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Karring 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Romeo-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Romeo 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Renvert-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Renvert 2011</LINK>), though we were unable to use the data in the way they were presented. No trial evaluated outcome measures such as patient preference or aesthetic outcomes with the exception on data on soft tissue recessions.<BR/>(4) Interventions. A lot of different interventions or combination of interventions were investigated. Even more therapy variations are currently used in clinical practice. However, if too many treatments are used at the same time, it could be very difficult to discriminate between useful and ineffective ones. In addition, operative procedures become more complicated, treatment time become longer, costs can increase considerably without necessarily providing tangible improvements for the patient. Studies should test those procedures believed to be the most effective and should not use whatever is available to obtain the 'ideal' results, particularly when there is not strong evidence about which could be the most effective interventions. The majority of the trials were sponsored by manufacturers of antibiotics (<LINK REF="STD-B_x00fc_chter-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Büchter 2004</LINK>), air-abrasive devices (<LINK REF="STD-Karring-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Karring 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Renvert-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Renvert 2011</LINK>), lasers (<LINK REF="STD-Schwarz-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Schwarz 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schwarz-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Schwarz 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Renvert-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Renvert 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schwarz-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Schwarz 2011</LINK>), and biomaterials (<LINK REF="STD-Schwarz-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Schwarz 2006b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schwarz-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Schwarz 2011</LINK>), therefore there might be some commercial 'pressure' to evaluate some interventions and not others.<BR/>(5) Sample sizes. The number of patients included in the various trials was very small. While it is true that it is not easy to collect large number of patients affected by peri-implantitis, it should be remembered that existing differences of efficacy among different interventions may not be detected by small sample sizes, therefore conclusions of the majority of these studies are in fact inconclusive. This is however a widespread problem in dentistry.<BR/>(6) Randomisation and blinding. More efforts should be invested at the protocol design stage to limit bias by using adequate randomisation and allocation concealment procedures as well as blinding at least of the outcome assessors. Trials judged to be at high risk of bias can be less reliable and even misleading in their results, particularly when the proponents have 'a priori very clear ideas' of which are the most reliable interventions.<BR/>(7) Follow-up. This question cannot be answered by short-term follow-up trials. Peri-implantitis progresses over the years and years are required to see whether the intervention was effective in saving the implants. However, the majority of the included trials had a follow-up shorter or up to 6 months. Only two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Romeo-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Romeo 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schwarz-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Schwarz 2006b</LINK>), presented data at 2 and 4 years, respectively.<BR/>(8) Statistical analysis. The patients and not the implants should be the unit of the statistical analyses. Two or more implants in the same mouth are not independent from each other, but are depending on numerous 'patient' factors such as the level of oral hygiene, the type of bacterial flora, the design of the prosthesis, the immunocompetent characteristics and habits (i.e. smoker, etc.) of the subject, etc. The trials should be designed as a split-mouth or parallel group, or the analysis should take the clustering of the implants within patient into account. One way of doing this would be to use multilevel modelling.<BR/>(9) Drop outs, withdrawals and failures. There is a clear difference between drop outs, withdrawals and recurrence of peri-implantitis. Some authors systematically withdrew from the study patients having recurrence of peri-implantitis (<LINK REF="STD-Schwarz-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Schwarz 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schwarz-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Schwarz 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schwarz-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Schwarz 2006b</LINK>). These patients were re-treated and this is obviously correct, but the outcome of the re-treatment was not presented any longer in the original reports. Recurrence of the diseases means that the treatment was not successful according to certain set parameters, however, if they are considered as drop outs or withdrawals, i.e. excluded from the calculations, results will be biased. When drop outs or withdrawals occur, it is important that the authors clearly describe from which group they occurred and for which reason, since the reason of the drop out/withdrawals may again influence the interpretation of the results.</P>
<P>After these preliminary considerations we can try to evaluate the results of the included trials and their potential impact on clinical practice. Seven out of the nine included studies did not display any statistically significant difference among the tested interventions, but since the sample sizes were small, the absence of the difference could be either true or hidden by an insufficient sample size. So it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions.</P>
<P>In four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Tang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tang 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karring-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Karring 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schwarz-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Schwarz 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schwarz-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Schwarz 2006a</LINK>) the control therapy which basically consisted of a simple subgingival mechanical debridement seemed to be sufficient to achieve short-term results similar to more complex and expensive therapies. In particular two studies with identical design (<LINK REF="STD-Schwarz-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Schwarz 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schwarz-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Schwarz 2006a</LINK>) compared Er:YAG laser versus manual debridement and chlorhexidine irrigation/gel. Forty patients with 72 implants affected by peri-implantitis were enrolled (20 patients with 36 implants in each group). Three patients with six implants from the debridement group were withdrawn due to persisting pus formation 4 to 12 weeks after treatment and were treated with the Er:YAG laser. The meta-analysis for recurrence of peri-implantitis displayed no statistically significant differences though trends indicated that early recurrence was less likely with laser treatment, however after 1 year all patients were discontinued from the trial (<LINK REF="STD-Schwarz-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Schwarz 2006a</LINK>) due to increased bleeding on probing (BOP) values and slight deterioration of mean PAL. All patients were therefore re-treated with the laser and subjected to bone augmentation procedures. Unfortunately no data were presented, but this may indicate that both plastic curettes and the laser could have been rather ineffective 1 year after treatment despite what appeared to be a good supragingival plaque control. In another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Renvert-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Renvert 2011</LINK>), at baseline about out one third of the patients presented pus on probing. Six months after non-surgical treatments with Perio-Flow, an air-abrasive device, or an Er:YAG laser, 11% of the patients had still pus on probing. These examples emphasise the need for long-term trials and the need for also publishing negative results. Therefore the actual results of those trials are difficult to interpret and more studies are definitively needed to evaluate which could be the most effective interventions in the long term.</P>
<P>Only two trials showed some statistically significant differences. One investigation<B> </B>(<LINK REF="STD-B_x00fc_chter-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Büchter 2004</LINK>) showed, after 4 months, that<B> </B>the adjunctive use of a local antibiotic (doxycycline; Atridox) to manual debridement,<B> </B>improved PAL and PPD of about 0.6 mm. The patients included in this trial were affected by a severe form of peri-implantitis (bone loss exceeding 50% of the implant length at baseline). Even though an overall 0.6 mm of improvement for PAL and PPD is a positive finding, although difficult to be noticed clinically, the follow-up was limited to 4 months which is definitively too short to provide useful indications of the outcome of the interventions. The other study (<LINK REF="STD-Schwarz-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Schwarz 2006b</LINK>), showing a significant difference, compared two bone augmentation techniques at implants with peri-implant infrabony defects superior to 3 mm: a resorbable nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite (Ostim) and a bovine-derived xenograft with a resorbable barrier (Bio-Oss). All augmentation procedures were conducted without prophylactic antibiotic coverage and no complications were reported, however, two patients from the Ostim group and one from the Bio-Oss group were withdrawn from the study because of severe pus formation 1 and 3 years after initial treatment, respectively.<B> </B>Four years after treatment, both procedures significantly improved PAL and PPD (PAL 0.6 mm and 2.0 mm;<B> </B>PPD 1.1 and 2.5 mm<B> </B>for Ostim and Bio-Oss, respectively). Unfortunately data of radiographic bone level assessments were not given, therefore it is difficult to fully interpret the results. The combination between a bovine-derived xenograft and resorbable barrier seemed to provide better results (about 1.4<B> </B>mm more gain for PAL and in PPD reduction). The different chemical stability characteristics of the bone substitutes could provide a possible explanation for the different clinical outcome. It may be speculated that an almost non-resorbable anorganic bovine bone could be better suited to fill and remain stable over time in infrabony defects than a synthetic resorbable hydroxyapatite. This study suggests that it is possible to use bone augmentation procedures at infrabony defects induced by peri-implantitis minimising soft tissue recessions (0.4 to 0.5 mm in both groups) and possibly maintaining an acceptable aesthetics, however, larger trials are needed to confirm these preliminary results. While not a single complication occurred in the previous trial, in a subsequent study by the same authors (<LINK REF="STD-Schwarz-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Schwarz 2011</LINK>) on GBR at implants affected by peri-implantitis, all barriers became exposed though without developing any infection. Such differences are difficult to explain. The same study (<LINK REF="STD-Schwarz-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Schwarz 2011</LINK>) failed again to show any benefit of using an Er:YAGlaser over manual debridements with plastic curettes and cleaning with saline solution.</P>
<P>Another interesting study (<LINK REF="REF-Roos_x002d_Jans_x00e5_ker-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roos-Jansåker 2007a</LINK>) evaluated a bone substitute (Algipore, Friadent, Malmö, Sweden) with and without a resorbable barrier (Osseoquest, W L Gore &amp; Associates) for treating implants (mostly Brånemark implants with a machined surface) affected by peri-implantitis. Nineteen patients were included in each group though two patients from the group treated with the barrier died before the 1-year control. Unfortunately patients were not allocated randomly and the first 19 patients were treated with the adjunctive use of a barrier, whereas the following 19 patients only with the bone substitute. Antibiotic coverage was initiated the day before surgery and continued for 10 days. After 1 year data of 29 implants from the bone substitute plus barrier group and of 36 implants from the bone substitute group were presented. Calculations were conducted at implant level ignoring the patient clustering effect, however, it was reported that there were no statistically significant differences between the different interventions and both therapies achieved a bone gain of 1.5 and 1.4 mm, respectively on intraoral x-ray. It was also reported that after 2 weeks 44% of the implants treated with the membrane had a barrier exposure versus none of the bone substitute group. While this finding is not surprising, it is in contradiction with another study (<LINK REF="STD-Schwarz-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Schwarz 2006b</LINK>) in which no prophylactic antibiotic therapy was administered and not a single complication was reported in the group treated with the resorbable barriers. The same group reported a cases series of 12 patients (<LINK REF="REF-Roos_x002d_Jans_x00e5_ker-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roos-Jansåker 2007b</LINK>) who were treated with a bone substitute (Algipore) plus a resorbable membrane (Osseoquest). The implants were then covered by flaps and left healing submerged for 6 months. After 6 months the abutment was reconnected to the suprastructure. After 1 year a mean defect fill of 2.3 mm was obtained. Unfortunately the lack of a proper control group precludes us from understanding whether there could be any advantage when using a submerged healing technique.</P>
<P>We wish to stress that the lack of reliable evidence on which are the most effective interventions for treating peri-implantitis should not be wrongly interpreted as that the currently used therapies may not be effective. There is some evidence that some treatments may be effective (<LINK REF="REF-Mombelli-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mombelli 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haas-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haas 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mombelli-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mombelli 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leonhardt-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leonhardt 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Romeo-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Romeo 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schwarz-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Schwarz 2006b</LINK>), however, at present we do not know which interventions are the most effective, and for the interventions having similar degrees of effectiveness we do not know which one has less side effects, is simpler and cheaper to use.</P>

<P>There is no reliable evidence suggesting which could be the most effective interventions for treating peri-implantitis. This is not to say that currently used interventions are not effective. The use of adjunctive antibiotic therapy (Atridox) to manual debridement was associated with probing attachment level (PAL) and probing pocket depth (PPD) improvements in the range of 0.6 mm after 4 months in patients who had severe forms of peri-implantitis (i.e. having lost at least 50% of the supporting bone around the implants) in one trial. The use of a bovine-derived xenograft (Bio-Oss) with a resorbable barrier (Bio-Gide) was associated with PAL and PPD improvements of about 1.4 mm after 4 years in infrabony defects deeper than 3 mm when compared to nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite (Ostim) in one trial. In four other trials evaluating local antibiotics, the Vector system and a laser therapy, respectively, no statistically significant differences were observed when compared with subgingival debridement. Follow-up longer than 1 year suggested recurrence of peri-implantitis up to 100% of the treated cases for some of the tested interventions which suggests that repeated intervention may be needed. However, sample sizes were very small, therefore these findings have to be considered with great caution.</P>

<P>More randomised controlled trials powered to detect a difference, using primary outcome measures such as implant failure and with a follow-up of several years should be conducted. It may be easier to start assessing simpler interventions such as debridement with or without additional antibiotics and placebos using a double-blind study design and then gradually testing more complex treatments. Clinical trials should evaluate the efficacy of plastic versus metal curettes and ultrasounds tips, implant surface smoothening with elimination of unsupported threads, and adjunctive local or systemic antibiotics. In the presence of deep peri-implant infrabony defects both resective and regenerative procedures should be evaluated as well as various bone augmentation procedures. Such trials should be reported according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines (<A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org">www.consort-statement.org</A>).</P>

<P>Before enrolment in the study, any periodontal lesions at remaining teeth were treated. Before the treatments, the supra-structures were removed. One group was treated with an air-abrasive device (Perio-Flow®, EMS, Nyon, Switzerland). The nozzle was placed in the pocket and used for approximately 15 seconds in each position circumferentially around the implant. Careful attempts were made to cover the full circumference of the implant. The Perio-Flow® device utilizes a 25 mm hydrophobic powder and a flexible tip allowing access to periodontal and implant pockets. The other group was treated with an Er:YAG laser (Key Laser 3 Perio, KaVo, Biberach, Germany) at an energy level of 100 mJ/pulse and 10 Hz (12.7 J/cm<SUP>2</SUP>) using a cone-shaped sapphire tip. The instrument tip was used in a parallel mode using a semicircular motion around the circumferential pocket area of the implant.
