<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-09-27 12:43:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Induction and augmentation of labour are common procedures within obstetric practice with various indications for mother and child. When contractions are stimulated by intravenous oxytocin, registration of the frequency of contractions is important for determination of the right dosage of medication. Uterine contractions can be monitored through the abdominal wall of the mother by using a small device that is placed on the skin using a belt to hold it in position, where the device measures changes in the shape of the uterus (external tocodynamometry (ET)), or by positioning an intrauterine pressure catheter inside the uterus next to the baby (internal tocodynamometry (IT)). Use of IT is only possible after rupture of the membranes and is an easy, painless procedure done during vaginal examination by the midwife or doctor in charge. During induction or augmentation of labour with intravenous oxytocin, some clinicians choose to monitor contractions with an IT rather than with ET. An intrauterine pressure catheter measures the contractions more accurately and could result in a better dosage of the oxytocin. This could, therefore, reduce the risk of hyperstimulation, for example too frequent contractions, and subsequently reduce the risk for fetal distress. Moreover with the modern central monitoring systems and the accurate registration with the use of IT there is no need for the caregivers to be physical present in the labour room to assess the frequency of contractions. However, besides higher costs of IT, insertion of an intrauterine catheter in the uterus of the mother has rare but potentially hazardous risks for both mother and child, like placental and fetal vessel damage.</P>
<P>The aim of this review was to compare the effectiveness of IT compared with ET. We included three randomised controlled studies (1945 women). The methodological quality of the studies was considered to be moderate. When comparing internal registration of contractions with external registration of contractions during induced or augmented labour, there were no differences in any of the outcomes for mother or child: adverse neonatal outcomes, instrumental deliveries, caesarean section, use of analgesia or time to delivery. No increased risk for infection was reported when an intrauterine catheter was used in these studies. </P>
<P>There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of one form of tocodynamometry over another for women where intravenous oxytocin is administered for induction or augmentation of labour.</P>

<P>Uterine contractions can be registered by external tocodynamometry (ET) or, after rupture of the membranes, by internal tocodynamometry (IT). Monitoring of the frequency of contractions is important especially when intravenous oxytocin is used as excessive uterine activity (hyperstimulation or tachysystole) can cause fetal distress. During induction of labour as well as during augmentation with intravenous oxytocin, some clinicians choose to monitor frequency and strength of contractions with IT rather than with ET as an intrauterine pressure catheter measures intrauterine activity more accurately than an extra-abdominal tocodynamometry device. However, insertion of an intrauterine catheter has higher costs and also potential risks for mother and child.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Oxytocin in labour</HEADING>
<P>Since 1906 the contractile properties of oxytocin on uterine myometrial smooth muscle has been described (<LINK REF="REF-Dale-1906" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dale 1906</LINK>). Initially, an extract of the posterior pituitary was used for treatment of postpartum bleeding. Since the cloning of the gene in 1983, synthetic oxytocin is now produced in different forms by pharmaceutical companies (<LINK REF="REF-Land-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Land 1983</LINK>). Oxytocin is usually administered in a diluted intravenous infusion; it cannot be administered orally because it is quickly metabolized in the gastrointestinal tract. Uterine muscle cells respond rapidly to administration, within three to five minutes, and a steady state is achieved within 40 minutes (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2006</LINK>). Oxytocin is quickly metabolized by several enzymes including peptidases in the kidneys and oxytocinase excreted by the placenta (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Adminstration of intravenous oxytocin is the most common intervention in obstetrical care and is used for induction of labour as well as for augmentation in cases of arrest of labour. Oxytocin has a positive impact on the strength and frequency of contractions. Some obstetricians combine low amniotomy with intravenous oxytocin titrations immediately following or within an hour, while others advocate a delay of four to six hours (<LINK REF="REF-MacKenzie-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacKenzie 2006</LINK>). A Cochrane review demonstrated that the combination of oxytocin administration for induction with amniotomy compares well with other forms of induction (<LINK REF="REF-Howarth-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howarth 2001</LINK>). Another Cochrane review demonstrated that use of prostaglandins is more effective than oxytocin alone for ripening of the cervix in the case of an unfavourable cervix, but that oxytocin is as effective when used alone in women with ruptured membranes (<LINK REF="REF-Alfirevic-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alfirevic 2009</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Oxytocin complications</HEADING>
<P>Potential complications caused by the use of intravenous oxytocin for induction or augmentation of labour are hyponatraemia, hypotension and hyperstimulation (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2006</LINK>).<BR/>Hyponatraemia is an electrolyte disturbance in which the sodium concentration in the serum is below 135 mEq/L. Excessive uterine activity (hyperstimulation or tachysystole) is defined by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) as more than five contractions in 10 minutes, lasting at least two minutes, or contractions of normal duration within one minute of each other (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2009</LINK>). When contractions are too frequent, the recovery period between contractions shortens and this may affect fetal oxygenation, cause fetal hypoxia and even lead to brain damage. On the other hand, signs of fetal hypoxia increase the risk for instrumental delivery and consequently iatrogenic damage to mother and child. Reducing the risk of hyperstimulation and thus fetal hypoxia by accurate measurement of contractions could therefore lead to a reduction in fetal and maternal morbidity.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Internal tocodynamometry complications</HEADING>
<P>Intrauterine pressure catheter placement, a routine procedure in labour and delivery, has the possibility of infrequent but potentially hazardous risks for mother and child. Insertion of an intrauterine catheter during labour is usually an easy procedure to accomplish. In the literature, however, there have been reports of an increased risk of intrauterine infections and repeated case reports of placental or fetal vessel damage despite management lege artis (<LINK REF="REF-Soper-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soper 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Handwerker-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handwerker 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soper-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soper 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lind-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lind 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilmink-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilmink 2008</LINK>). Extramembranous placement occurs 14% to 38% of the time (<LINK REF="REF-Lind-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lind 1998</LINK>), with adverse events occurring in one in 1400 placements (<LINK REF="REF-Chan-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Trudinger-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trudinger 1978</LINK>). More recently two cases were reported with an anaphylactoid syndrome of pregnancy, previously known as amniotic fluid embolism, after Intrauterine pressure catheter placement. This was expressed as a life threatening anaphylactic reaction with acute onset of severe hypoxia, neurologic sequelae, and haemodynamic collapse with subsequent cardiopulmonary failure followed by disseminated intravascular coagulation (<LINK REF="REF-Matsuo-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matsuo 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harbison-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harbison 2010</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Internal tocodynamometry versus external tocodynamometry</HEADING>
<P>Uterine contractions can be assessed by palpation of the fundus of the uterus and observation of the mother. With this method the obstetrician gets a snapshot and no long term hard copy registration of the contraction in relation to the fetal heart rate. Therefore, this method will not be included.</P>
<P>External tocodynamometry (ET) is a method that continuously records contractions by using a belt to place a transducer on the fundus; these recordings are affected by maternal movements. ET measures the change of the shape of the uterus in relation to the abdominal wall during a contraction. This method is used to measure the frequency of the contractions, but not the intrauterine change of pressure.</P>
<P>Internal tocodynamometry (IT) monitors uterine activity with a strain gauge (an intrauterine pressure catheter) inserted into the cavity of the uterus next to the fetus, which provides data on the frequency and duration of uterine contractions. Insertion of an intrauterine pressure catheter is done during a vaginal examination and is a simple procedure that is carried out by both midwives and doctors. The device measures the intrauterine pressure, expressed in Montevideo units, at rest and during contractions.</P>
<P>All methods provide good information on the frequency of contractions and an indication of their duration.</P>
<P>Both during induction of labour as well as augmentation, some clinicians choose to monitor the frequency and strength of contractions with IT rather than ET, as IT measures intrauterine activity more accurately (<LINK REF="REF-Bakker-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bakker 2008</LINK>). There are several arguments in favour of IT.</P>
<OL>
<LI>When using oxytocin, exact monitoring of contractions is demanded in order to prevent hyperstimulation. ET does not accurately register contractions in all women and in all positions of the labouring woman so it can underestimate the uterine contractions, which may lead to excessive use of oxytocin and thus hyperstimulation. Some state that the use of IT, by accurately measuring uterine contractions, leads to a more moderate amount of oxytocin and reduces the risk of hyperstimulation.</LI>
<LI>Among women in their child bearing years, 8% have severe obesity with a body mass index above 40 kg/m<SUP>2</SUP> (Euliano 2007). This group have more obstetric complications such as pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes. Induction of labour is common in this group of women and uterine activity can be difficult to assess with ET. The distance from the external tocodynamometer on the skin to the uterine wall could be such that reliable measurement of uterine contractions is not possible. IT could therefore be more useful in this group of women.</LI>
<LI>Some argue that the use of IT might facilitate the clinical diagnosis of uterine rupture, especially in women with a previous caesarean section, because the expectation is that the pressure inside the uterine cavity flattens and lowers when the uterine wall is ruptured. This, however, is not supported by the literature (<LINK REF="REF-Rodriquez-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodriquez 1989</LINK>). In this review of 76 cases of uterine rupture, 39 were monitored with an intrauterine pressure catheter. The classic description of a loss of intrauterine pressure or cessation of labour was not observed in any of the patients. </LI>
</OL>
<P>Furthermore, routine use of IT in every induced or augmented woman is costly as the rates of induction and augmentation are increasing. Labour induction rates in the United States has risen from less than 10% of deliveries to more than 22% between 1990 and 2008; and augmentation took place in more than 20% of all deliveries in 2008 according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (<LINK REF="REF-Osterman-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osterman 2011</LINK>). Routine use of IT in 40% of all deliveries would add significant public health costs, of roughly USD 200 million/year.</P>

<P>For included studies, we noted levels of attrition.

For all outcomes we carried out analyses, as far as possible, on an intention-to-treat basis. That is, we attempted to include all participants randomised to each group in the analyses, and all participants were analysed in the group to which they were allocated regardless of whether or not they received the allocated intervention. The denominator for each outcome in each trial was the number randomised minus any participants whose outcomes were known to be missing.</P>

<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>). We used fixed-effect model meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect; that is where trials were examining the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods were judged sufficiently similar. If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects would differ between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we explored the reason for the heterogeneity by subgroup analysis. We discussed the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect was not clinically meaningful we did not combine trials.</P>

<P>If we identified substantial heterogeneity, we investigated it using subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses.

<P>In future updates of this review, as more data become available, we will carry out sensitivity analysis to explore the effect of trial quality if trials of differing quality are included in the review. This will involve analysis based on our assessment of whether trials are at risk of selection bias or attrition bias. Studies of poor quality (those rated as 'high' or 'unclear' risk of bias for sequence generation, allocation concealment, or incomplete outcome data) will be excluded in the analysis in order to assess any substantive difference compared to the overall result.</P>

<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Bakker-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bakker 2010</LINK> trial used a central, computerised randomisation program that provided the allocation of included women at the different study sites, so it was ensured that the sequence was concealed. Women in the studies of <LINK REF="STD-Chia-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Chia 1993</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Chua-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Chua 1990</LINK> were randomly allocated to the different methods of tocography by using a random number table; this method was acceptable at the time and has a low risk of selection bias. <LINK REF="STD-Chia-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Chia 1993</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Chua-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Chua 1990</LINK> reported no losses to follow up and they did not keep a record of eligible non-randomised women. The trial by <LINK REF="STD-Bakker-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bakker 2010</LINK> reported no losses to follow up cases but had a substantial number of non-participants. More than 72% of the eligible women declined participation or were not informed about the trial due to various reasons, mostly workload of the caregivers (information first author).

<P>The neonatal outcome was no different between the control group which used ET and the intervention group which used an intrauterine pressure catheter. An Apgar score less than seven at five minutes was reported in all included trials and was not statistically significantly different between groups (RR 1.78, 95% CI 0.83 to 3.83; N = 1945; <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). Umbilical artery pH less than 7.15 was reported in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Bakker-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bakker 2010</LINK>) (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.79; N = 1456; <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>); pH less than 7.16 was reported in the trial of <LINK REF="STD-Chia-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Chia 1993</LINK> (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.39 to 3.92;N = 239; <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Secondary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>There were no serious complications, like placenta or vessel perforation, or abruptio placentae, reported in the trials from the use of the intrauterine pressure catheter, and no neonatal deaths or serious maternal complications (defined as death, coma, cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest, use of a mechanical ventilator, admission to intensive care unit) occurred in either study group. All three studies reported rates of instrumental vaginal delivery and caesarean section. The pooled risk for instrumental delivery (caesarean section, ventouse and forceps extraction) was not statistically significant different (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.9 to 1.2; three studies, N = 1945; <LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>). There was variance between the studies. The differences in crude percentages between the studies were probably due to the different policies and increasing interventions in obstetrics over time (1993 versus 2010), but most of all the variance was due to different etiology: induced labour versus augmented labour in cases of arrest of labour. Therefore, we performed a subgroup analysis. The pooled risk for instrumental delivery for women with induced labour was more in favour of IT yet not statistically significantly different (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.1; two studies, N = 1195; <LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>). The pooled risk for instrumental delivery for women with augmented labour, however, was in favour of ET and just statistically significantly different (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.5; two studies, N = 750; <LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>). The interaction test for subgroup differences was significant for this subgroup analysis (P = 0.02; <LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>) suggesting a difference between the induced and augmented subgroups. When the risk for instrumental delivery was specified as vaginal instrumental delivery or operative delivery (that is caesarean section) the difference between the augmented group women and the induced group women disappeared. The pooled risk for a caesarean section was not statistically significant between study groups (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.29; three studies, N = 1945; <LINK REF="CMP-001.13" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.13</LINK>). This CI corresponds to a plausible reduction of the caesarean section rate of 15% up to a nearly 30% increase. The risk for caesarean section was not different between the subgroups. The pooled risk for vaginal instrumental deliveries (ventouse or forceps extraction) was not statistically significant different (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.32; three studies, N = 1945; <LINK REF="CMP-001.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.12</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was no increased risk of infection when an intrauterine catheter was used: infection during labour (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.08; one study, N = 1456; <LINK REF="CMP-001.17" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.17</LINK>), and no increased risk of infection in mother or child up to three weeks postpartum (<LINK REF="REF-van-Halem-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Halem 2011</LINK>) (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.16; one study, N = 1435; <LINK REF="CMP-001.16" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.16</LINK>).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-09-27 12:42:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The aim of this review was to compare the effectiveness of IT compared with ET. We included three randomised controlled studies (1945 women) of moderate quality. The results suggest no benefit for the routine use of internal tocodynamometry (IT) for monitoring contractions in women with induced or augmented labour with intravenous oxytocin. However, there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of one form of tocodynamometry over another form for women where intravenous oxytocin is administered for induction or augmentation of labour.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-09-16 09:14:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jannet Bakker">
<P>Three studies were included in this review. Although on theoretical grounds one might expect a better neonatal outcome and a more effective stimulation when the contractions are accurately measured, the robust results of the included studies do not support this concept. The pooled risk for instrumental delivery was not statistically different between study groups, however in the subgroup of women with augmented labour there was a just statistically significant difference in favour of ET. When the variable instrumental delivery was specified into instrumental vaginal delivery or caesarean section, this benefit for ET was not found; moreover we lack a clinical explanation for a possible advantage of external registration of contractions when labour is augmented. This review found insufficient evidence for a benefit of the routine use of IT on rates of adverse neonatal outcomes, rates of instrumental deliveries, use of analgesia, infection, or time to delivery. Moreover, case reports state that IT has rare but serious risks, including placental or fetal-vessel damage, infection and anaphylactic shock. In this review involving 922 women who were monitored with IT tocodynamometry, no such events occurred.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-09-16 09:22:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jannet Bakker">
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Bakker-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bakker 2010</LINK> trial, 12% of the women assigned to external monitoring were nonetheless treated with an intrauterine pressure catheter at the physician&#8217;s discretion. The protocol of this study permitted crossover if cervical progression was absent for two hours, the frequency of uterine contractions was not sufficient, or caesarean section was being considered. These 12% of women were more likely to be primiparous (82.6% versus 63.2%), had a higher mean pre-pregnancy BMI (27.4 versus 25.3), and were more likely to have hypertension or pre-eclampsia (33.8% versus 10.3%); they were also more likely to have a caesarean section (33.0% versus 16.0%). Analysis per protocol, for example according to the treatment actually given, had similar results in the rate of operative deliveries and for adverse neonatal outcomes. The two smaller studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chua-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Chua 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chia-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Chia 1993</LINK>) did not report crossover between study groups.</P>
<P>The study population of this review included women who were treated with intravenous oxytocin to stimulate contractions but did not involve women with a previous caesarean section. Whether an intrauterine pressure catheter should be used in these women is still controversial. Some clinicians state that the risk for uterus rupture is increased because of insertion of the catheter; others advocate the use of IT in women with a previous caesarean section, because they expect that the diagnosis of uterus rupture is easier. This review does not answer this question for this subgroup of women.</P>

<P>We acknowledge that there is always a possibility of introducing bias at every stage of the review process. We attempted to minimise bias in a number of ways; two review authors independently assessed eligibility for inclusion and risk of bias, and carried out data extraction; moreover, assessment and data extraction of the largest trial (<LINK REF="STD-Bakker-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bakker 2010</LINK>) was done by a review co-author (BG) who was not involved in the trial.</P>
