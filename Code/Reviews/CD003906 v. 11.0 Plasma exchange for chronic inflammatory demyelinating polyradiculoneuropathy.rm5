<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-10-09 12:36:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sophie Maprayil">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>What are the benefits and harms of plasma exchange for chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP)?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>CIDP is an uncommon paralysing disease caused by inflammation of the peripheral nerves. Plasma exchange, also called plasmapheresis, removes blood from one vein, passes it through a machine, and then returns it into another vein. The machine replaces the plasma, which is the fluid part of the blood, with a substitute and preserves the red blood cells. The procedure removes potentially harmful substances, including antibodies. It takes several hours and is usually repeated about five times over two weeks. We wanted to discover whether plasma exchange is helpful in CIDP.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We found two randomised controlled trials. Both studies compared plasma exchange with sham exchange (in which blood was removed and returned but not exchanged). One trial aimed to compare four weeks' plasma exchange with sham exchange. The 18 participants received both treatments, being randomised to either treatment in the first period of the trial, crossing over to the other treatment for the second period. The other trial compared three-weeks' plasma exchange in 15 participants with sham exchange in 14 participants. We considered both trials at low risk of bias, which means largely free of flaws that could have influenced the results.</P>
<P>
<B>Study funding sources</B>
</P>
<P>A charitable grant supported the cross-over trial. The other did not report any support.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>The cross-over trial showed on average two points more improvement on an 11-point disability scale with plasma exchange than sham exchange. This was unlikely to have occurred by chance. The parallel-group trial did not report this outcome. When we combined the results of both trials, plasma exchange produced significantly more improvement in severity of disease signs measured by neurologists than sham exchange. The results reported were short term. In practice, people with CIDP receive repeated courses or combinations of plasma exchange with additional agents. Another Cochrane review includes a trial showing similar improvement after plasma exchange to that after intravenous infusion of immunoglobulin (the antibody portion of blood). According to non-randomised evidence, plasma exchange causes adverse events in 3% to 17% of procedures. These are sometimes serious.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence </B>
</P>
<P>Because of the small size of the only trial reporting changes in disability, the quality of the evidence that plasma exchange reduces disability is moderate. The quality of the evidence that plasma exchange improves the signs of disease measured by a neurologist is high.</P>
<P>The evidence is up to date to 30 June 2015.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-06-28 14:23:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) is an uncommon progressive or relapsing paralysing disease caused by inflammation of the peripheral nerves. If the hypothesis that it is due to autoimmunity is correct, removal of autoantibodies in the blood by plasma exchange should be beneficial.</P>

<P>To assess the effects of plasma exchange for treating CIDP.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-08-17 09:22:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth  Brassington">
<P>On 30 June 2015, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL Plus, and LILACS. We also scrutinised the bibliographies of the trials, contacted the trial authors and other disease experts, and searched trials registries for ongoing studies.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-06-28 14:23:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs in participants of any age comparing plasma exchange with sham treatment or no treatment.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-08-17 09:20:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth  Brassington">
<P>Two review authors independently selected the trials, extracted the data, and assessed risk of bias. Where possible the review authors combined data according to the methods of the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Review Group.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-11-02 14:44:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>Primary outcome measure: one cross-over trial including 18 participants showed after four weeks, 2 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.9 to 3.1) points more improvement on an 11-point disability scale with plasma exchange (10 exchanges over four weeks) than with sham exchange. Rapid deterioration after plasma exchange occurred in eight of 12 who had improved.</P>
<P>Secondary outcome measures: when we combined the results of this cross-over trial and a trial with 29 participants treated in a parallel-group design, there were 31 points (95% CI 18 to 45) more improvement on an impairment scale (maximum score 280) after plasma exchange (six exchanges over three weeks) than after sham exchange. There were significant improvements in both trials in an electrophysiological measure, the proximally evoked compound muscle action potential, after three or four weeks. Non-randomised evidence indicates that plasma exchange induces adverse events in 3% to 17% of procedures. These events are sometimes serious. Both trials had a low risk of bias. A trial that showed no significant difference in the benefit between plasma exchange and intravenous immunoglobulin is included in the Cochrane review of intravenous immunoglobulin for this condition.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-08-17 09:20:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth  Brassington">
<P>Moderate- to high-quality evidence from two small trials shows that plasma exchange provides significant short-term improvement in disability, clinical impairment, and motor nerve conduction velocity in CIDP but rapid deterioration may occur afterwards. Adverse events related to difficulty with venous access, use of citrate, and haemodynamic changes are not uncommon. We need more research to identify agents that will prolong the beneficial action of plasma exchange.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-08-17 09:22:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth  Brassington">
<P>Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) causes progressive or relapsing weakness or numbness of the limbs. It affects males and females of all ages and has a population prevalence of two to three per 100,000 people (<LINK REF="REF-Mahdi_x002d_Rogers-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahdi-Rogers 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vallat-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vallat 2010</LINK>). Early reports of large series (<LINK REF="REF-Barohn-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barohn 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dyck-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dyck 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dyck-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dyck 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCombe-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCombe 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prineas-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prineas 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thomas-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 1969</LINK>) described the clinical picture but did not precisely define the disease. An expert committee proposed research criteria for the diagnosis in 1991 (<LINK REF="REF-Ad-Hoc-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ad Hoc 1991</LINK>). These included clinical, electrophysiological, cerebrospinal fluid, and histopathological criteria. The clinical criteria consisted of progressive or relapsing motor or sensory dysfunction, or both, of more than one limb, developing over at least eight weeks. Strict electrophysiological criteria failed to capture all the people accepted as cases of CIDP in subsequent case series. Fulfillment of the clinical and electrophysiological criteria are sufficient for a diagnosis of 'probable' CIDP according to these criteria. A diagnosis of 'definite' CIDP requires additional fulfilment of pathological criteria. However, nerve biopsies often show only nonspecific changes or loss of axons in CIDP and they are commonly not performed. We considered it inappropriate to insist on pathological confirmation for the diagnosis in this review. This is in line with the criteria of the European Federation of Neurological Societies/Peripheral Nerve Society guideline (<LINK REF="REF-EFNS_x002f_PNS-CIDP-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">EFNS/PNS CIDP 2010</LINK>), which has acceptable specificity and higher sensitivity (<LINK REF="REF-Breiner-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Breiner 2014</LINK>). Since there is no absolute diagnostic test it is always necessary to exclude alternative diagnoses, such as hereditary, metabolic, vasculitic, paraneoplastic, and paraproteinaemic neuropathies. There is a debate about whether some cases of neuropathy associated with diabetes mellitus, systemic lupus erythematosus, and monoclonal gammopathy are due to CIDP. Because of the uncertainty we excluded such cases from this review.</P>
<P>The aetiology of CIDP is presumed to be autoimmune (<LINK REF="REF-K_x00f6_ller-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Köller 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vallat-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vallat 2010</LINK>). Peripheral nerve biopsies and autopsy studies often reveal characteristic histopathologic features of nerve oedema, scarce lymphocytic infiltrates, and macrophage-mediated segmental demyelination and remyelination (<LINK REF="REF-Prineas-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prineas 1976</LINK>). Similar histological appearances are seen in the chronic form of experimental autoimmune neuritis (<LINK REF="REF-Hahn-1996a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hahn 1996a</LINK>). Humoral and cell-mediated responses against a variety of myelin-derived autoantigens have been detected in some people with CIDP (<LINK REF="REF-Fredman-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fredman 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ilyas-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ilyas 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-K_x00f6_ller-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Köller 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koski-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koski 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lehmann-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lehmann 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Querol-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Querol 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Doorn-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Doorn 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yan-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yan 2001</LINK>). However, no consistent or diagnostically helpful immune response has been identified.</P>
<P>CIDP is a heterogeneous disorder. It is usually symmetrical with motor and sensory dysfunction, but asymmetrical (<LINK REF="REF-Lewis-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saperstein-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saperstein 2001</LINK>) and predominantly sensory forms (<LINK REF="REF-Oh-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oh 1992</LINK>) have also been described. We planned to include variants that fulfil the <LINK REF="REF-Ad-Hoc-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ad Hoc 1991</LINK> criteria in this review. However, multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) with conduction block is considered a separate condition (<LINK REF="REF-Lewis-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parry-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parry 1988</LINK>). Electrophysiological features of multifocal partial conduction block with almost complete sparing of sensory nerve fibres characterise MMN. Unlike CIDP, MMN may worsen following treatment with corticosteroids, and may have a different pathogenesis (<LINK REF="REF-Nobile_x002d_Orazio-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nobile-Orazio 2013</LINK>). Consequently, MMN has been excluded from this review and has appeared in another (<LINK REF="REF-Umapathi-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Umapathi 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>The findings that sera of people with CIDP caused demyelination or functional peripheral nerve deficits following intraneural or systemic transfer provided a rationale for use of plasma exchange (PE) in CIDP (<LINK REF="REF-Heininger-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heininger 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pollard-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pollard 1983</LINK>). The observation of temporary improvement following PE in CIDP supported this evidence. PE (also called plasmapheresis) involves removing blood from the person with CIDP, separating the plasma by filtration or centrifugation, and then re-infusing the red blood cells with a plasma substitute. It requires the insertion of two cannulae into veins, one to remove the blood and the other to re-infuse the red blood cells and plasma substitute. The plasma substitute is usually a mixture of human albumin solution and saline. It is customary to exchange about one plasma volume at a time, which is sufficient to reduce the plasma IgM concentration by about 45% and the IgG concentration by about 60% (<LINK REF="REF-Khatri-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khatri 1985</LINK>). PE has been extensively used for removal of abnormal proteins in haematological disorders and for the treatment of autoimmune diseases (<LINK REF="REF-Cortese-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cortese 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Current treatments for CIDP aim to modulate the abnormal immune response with the intention of suppressing the ongoing activity. The treatments used in CIDP include corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2015</LINK>), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) (<LINK REF="REF-Eftimov-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eftimov 2013</LINK>), immunosuppressive agents such as azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate or ciclosporin (<LINK REF="REF-Mahdi_x002d_Rogers-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahdi-Rogers 2013</LINK>), as well as PE (<LINK REF="STD-Dyck-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Dyck 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hahn-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Hahn 1996b</LINK>), combinations of steroids, PE and IVIg (<LINK REF="REF-Briellmann-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Briellmann 1998</LINK>), or PE followed by IVIg (<LINK REF="REF-Walk-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walk 2004</LINK>). Case series and case reports have reported other agents like rituximab, interferons, fludarabine, mycophenolate, and etanercept to benefit some people with CIDP (<LINK REF="REF-Brannagan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brannagan 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vallat-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vallat 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Levy and Server et al. were the first to report improvement with PE in CIDP (<LINK REF="REF-Levy-1979a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levy 1979a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Levy-1979b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levy 1979b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Server-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Server 1979</LINK>). Since then many papers reported benefit in individual case reports or small uncontrolled series, which are subject to bias (<LINK REF="REF-Abe-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abe 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bromberg-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bromberg 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Choudhary-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Choudhary 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Donofrio-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donofrio 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gibbels-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibbels 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gross-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gross 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hanaoka-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanaoka 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Iwatsubo-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iwatsubo 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kumazawa-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumazawa 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kumazawa-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kumazawa 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maas-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maas 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pollard-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pollard 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tanaka-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tanaka 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Toyka-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toyka 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Nunen-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Nunen 1982</LINK>). The people with CIDP in these reports also received treatment with immunosuppressive drugs, which could have influenced the clinical response (<LINK REF="REF-Dyck-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dyck 1982</LINK>). We knew of only two randomised, double-blind, controlled studies comparing PE with sham when the protocol for this review was written (<LINK REF="STD-Dyck-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Dyck 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hahn-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Hahn 1996b</LINK>). Both reported short-term benefit. It is important to know the long-term outcome but there is paucity of information in the published literature. Another randomised study compared PE with IVIg infusion and found no difference between the two treatments (<LINK REF="STD-Dyck-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Dyck 1994</LINK>). The Cochrane review of IVIg for CIDP included this trial (<LINK REF="REF-Eftimov-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eftimov 2013</LINK>). Another randomised study compared immunoabsorption, an alternative technique to PE for removing antibodies, with IVIg (<LINK REF="STD-Zinman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Zinman 2005</LINK>). The authors of the Cochrane review of IVIg for CIDP considered this study but assessed it as at high risk of bias and excluded it (<LINK REF="REF-Eftimov-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eftimov 2013</LINK>). We know of no other systematic review of PE for treating CIDP, but there have been many nonsystematic reviews of treatment for CIDP (<LINK REF="REF-Lehmann-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lehmann 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saperstein-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saperstein 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vallat-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vallat 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-den-Bergh-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van den Bergh 2001</LINK>).

<P>We included all people who had been diagnosed by the trial authors as having CIDP according to defined criteria, which are similar to those of the Ad Hoc Subcommittee (<LINK REF="REF-Ad-Hoc-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ad Hoc 1991</LINK>). Participants had to have symptoms and signs of polyradiculoneuropathy characterised by progressive or relapsing motor and sensory dysfunction of more than one limb, of more than eight weeks' duration. The diagnosis must have been confirmed by an electrophysiological diagnosis of demyelinating polyneuropathy based on reduced nerve conduction velocities or partial motor nerve conduction blocks. The diagnosis was usually to have been confirmed by the finding of a raised cerebrospinal fluid protein. It might, but need not, have been confirmed by the demonstration of inflammation and macrophage-associated demyelination in a nerve biopsy. We excluded people with clinical features or investigations suggestive of hereditary neuropathy, paraproteinaemia, or systemic diseases.</P>

<P>We included any method or dose of PE treatment. If PE had been combined with another treatment and compared with no exchange or sham exchange and then some other treatment, we would have included the results in the analysis of the effects of PE. If PE had been combined with another treatment and compared with no exchange or sham exchange and no other treatment, we would have reported the results separately and not combined them with the results of PE alone. If PE had been compared with another treatment we would also have reported this comparison separately. We excluded the comparison of PE with intravenous immunoglobulin, which had already been reviewed (<LINK REF="REF-Eftimov-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eftimov 2013</LINK>).</P>

<P>Two review authors (MMM and RACH) checked the titles and abstracts identified. The review authors obtained the full text of all potentially relevant studies for independent assessment. The review authors independently decided which trials fitted the inclusion criteria and graded their risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' methods, described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two review authors performed data extraction independently. They did not obtain missing data from the trial authors.</P>
<P>We calculated a treatment effect across trials using the Cochrane statistical package, Review Manager (RevMan) 5. We expressed results as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and risk differences with 95% CI for dichotomous outcomes, and mean differences (MDs) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. If the results had indicated heterogeneity, we would have undertaken these tests with a random-effects model, but we used a fixed-effect model. If there had been heterogeneity, we would have investigated its source by repeating the analysis after elimination of trials which we judged to have a high risk of bias. We initially treated the data from cross-over trials as if they were parallel-group trials without taking into account the possibility of a cross-over effect. As a sensitivity analysis, we repeated the analyses with the generic inverse variance (GIV) method considered more appropriate for cross-over trials.</P>

<P>The first trial had a parallel-group design comparing PE with sham exchange twice weekly for three weeks and took place at the Mayo Clinic in the USA (<LINK REF="STD-Dyck-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Dyck 1986</LINK>) (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). The study recruited 34 participants but investigators removed five; four due to possible incorrect diagnosis and one for myocarditis possibly related to an indwelling subclavian catheter. The trialists measured impairment using the NIS and neurophysiological parameters after the first, second and third weeks. Of the 29 participants, 15 were assigned to PE, and 14 to sham exchange.</P>
<P>The second trial was a Canadian multicentre study with a cross-over design (<LINK REF="STD-Hahn-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Hahn 1996b</LINK>). Of the 18 participants recruited one did not receive PE because she wished to leave the trial during the first (SPE) phase of the trial, one did not receive PE because of failed venous access, and one did not receive SPE because of a stroke at the end of the first (PE) phase of the trial. The authors included all three participants in their analyses using the last observation carried forward. The participants received 10 PE or sham exchanges over four weeks and after an intended washout period of five weeks, participants crossed over to their alternate treatments. Outcome measures were NIS, functional clinical grade, grip strength, and electrophysiological studies at the end of each treatment compared with the start.</P>

<P>Both included trials were of high quality but small in size, reflecting the rarity of people with CIDP for whom PE might be considered. Both trials used concealed randomisation to allocate participants and went to the length of sham exchange to disguise the nature of the true treatment from the observers and participants.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2015-08-14 15:31:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth  Brassington">
<P>The two available trials have shown that between 33% and 66% of people with CIDP have significant short-term improvement in disability, impairment and nerve conduction from PE. In observational studies, <LINK REF="REF-Pollard-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pollard 1987</LINK> reported improvement in 8 of 12 people with CIDP (66%) and <LINK REF="REF-Gorson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gorson 1997</LINK> reported improvement in 11 of 27 people (41%) (<LINK REF="REF-Gorson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gorson 1997</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Bromberg-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bromberg 1992</LINK> reported one person who responded to regular PE after failing to respond to vigorous immunosuppressive regimens. Various other open-label studies have reported benefit (<LINK REF="REF-Abe-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abe 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Choudhary-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Choudhary 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cocito-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cocito 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Donofrio-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donofrio 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gibbels-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibbels 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gross-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gross 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hanaoka-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanaoka 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Iwatsubo-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iwatsubo 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kumazawa-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumazawa 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maas-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maas 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pollard-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pollard 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tanaka-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tanaka 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Toyka-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toyka 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Nunen-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Nunen 1982</LINK>).</P>
<P>Neither included trial examined the long-term effects of PE, but in a follow-on study, <LINK REF="STD-Hahn-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Hahn 1996b</LINK> documented the short duration of effect, which is a feature of most observational studies. Eight out of 12 PE responders (66%) relapsed. In seven, relapse occurred within seven to 14 days after stopping PE. In six participants the deterioration was rapid and severe. Observational studies in which PE has been combined with steroids or immunosuppressive drugs have not reported this abrupt deterioration. For instance, <LINK REF="REF-Donofrio-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donofrio 1984</LINK> treated 11 participants with PE in combination with steroids (except in one case) for two weeks and noted sustained improvement three months later in seven participants.</P>
<P>Several observational studies have documented the beneficial effect of repeated PE in order to maintain improvement. The authors of <LINK REF="STD-Hahn-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Hahn 1996b</LINK> evaluated the duration of effect and long-term implications of PE prospectively. Eight out of 12 PE responders (66%) relapsed within seven to 14 days after stopping PE. All these participants improved with subsequent open PE. Fourteen participants were monitored monthly for six months while being treated with prednisone alone or, in seven participants, in combination with PE. Ten recovered almost completely but four needed repeated treatment with PE or, in one case IVIg. In a retrospective follow-up study (<LINK REF="REF-Choudhary-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Choudhary 1995</LINK>), 33 of 105 participants underwent treatment with PE, and 23 responded. Of these 23, seven participants required repeated treatment for between eight months and five years. These participants were eventually transferred to IVIg, but one did not respond to IVIg and continued to receive PE for six more years. In this participant, an n-of-1 trial showed that PE was more effective than immunoadsorption (<LINK REF="REF-Hadden-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hadden 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Hahn-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Hahn 1996b</LINK> proposed that because of the frequency of rebound worsening after treatment, PE should be repeated and tailed off slowly and that PE should be used in combination with immunosuppressive drugs. Another Cochrane review considered the available evidence concerning immunosuppressive drugs but there is a paucity of randomised trials and no clear preferred agent (<LINK REF="REF-Mahdi_x002d_Rogers-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahdi-Rogers 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>IVIg was introduced for the treatment of CIDP soon after PE and another Cochrane review has confirmed that it produces short-term benefit in disability and impairment (<LINK REF="REF-Eftimov-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eftimov 2013</LINK>). The same review included <LINK REF="STD-Dyck-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Dyck 1994</LINK>, which showed that the amount of improvement following IVIg was not significantly different from that following treatment with a course of PE of similar cost.</P>
<P>The pathogenesis of CIDP is not well understood (<LINK REF="REF-Vallat-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vallat 2010</LINK>). According to one hypothesis, it is due to an antibody directed against a component of myelin, which causes demyelination and conduction block. However, no diagnostically helpful antibody has been discovered and the removal of a harmful antibody has not been demonstrated, although antibodies to the myelin glycoprotein P0 are possible candidates (<LINK REF="REF-Yan-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yan 2001</LINK>). A treatment response to PE is not necessarily due to an effect on antibody reduction, since it might alternatively be due to a removal of complement components or alteration of cytokines or T cells. In support of the last is a report that PE in CIDP induces a restoration of suppressed nonspecific T cell suppressor function to normal (<LINK REF="REF-De-Luca-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Luca 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The usefulness of PE is limited by its inconvenience, requirement for hospital attendance and specially trained staff, and the occurrence of adverse events. In <LINK REF="STD-Dyck-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Dyck 1986</LINK>, reactions complicated 12 (6.8%) out of 174 procedures (real or sham), eight arising from hypocalcaemia due to citrate toxicity and four from hypotension. In an open follow-up of <LINK REF="STD-Hahn-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Hahn 1996b</LINK>, one participant had a myocardial infarction within minutes of being connected to the cell separator. In a series of PE procedures for various indications, complications, usually from the use of a central venous catheter, were reported in 17% of 381 procedures. There were two deaths: one from arterial haemorrhage caused by the insertion of a central venous catheter and one from cerebral haemorrhage thought to be due to the underlying disease (thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura) (<LINK REF="REF-Couriel-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Couriel 1994</LINK>). In a larger series, adverse reactions occurred in 3.9% of 17,940 procedures on 3583 people (<LINK REF="REF-Kiprov-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kiprov 2001</LINK>). Events included citrate toxicity (3%), vasovagal reactions, vascular access complications, cardiac arrhythmia, haemolysis, hepatitis B, and fresh frozen plasma reactions. There was one death unrelated to the procedure.</P>
<P>In addition to the risks, the benefits of PE have to be balanced against the costs. Although the cost is considerable, PE now costs less than IVIg in most countries. For people who require repeated procedures, these costs are additive. Furthermore, the costs of providing repeated venous access with the possible need for an indwelling intravenous line and the attendant risks of sepsis need careful consideration. For these reasons, IVIg is usually the preferred treatment option (<LINK REF="REF-EFNS_x002f_PNS-CIDP-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">EFNS/PNS CIDP 2010</LINK>). A comparative trial showing no significant difference in the efficacy of the two treatments supported its preferential use (<LINK REF="STD-Dyck-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Dyck 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eftimov-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eftimov 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>The small number of trials and participants limited this review. We based its analyses on the assumption that there was no cross-over effect in the trial with a cross-over design (<LINK REF="STD-Hahn-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Hahn 1996b</LINK>). This assumption may be justified by the theoretical expectation that the duration of effect of PE is limited, as was shown to be the case in <LINK REF="STD-Hahn-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Hahn 1996b</LINK>.</P>
<P>An expert panel of the European Federation of Neurological Societies and Peripheral Nerve Society considered references retrieved from MEDLINE and the Cochrane Systematic Reviews published between August 2004 and July 2009. Based on this evidence the panel gave its highest level of recommendation to the statement that if IVIg and corticosteroids are ineffective, PE should be considered (<LINK REF="REF-EFNS_x002f_PNS-CIDP-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">EFNS/PNS CIDP 2010</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-08-17 09:22:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth  Brassington">
<P>Plasma exchange produces significant short-term improvement in disability and motor nerve conduction velocity (both moderate-quality evidence) and in clinical impairment (high-quality evidence) in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy but rapid deterioration may occur afterwards. According to observational studies, adverse events related to difficulty with venous access, use of citrate and haemodynamic changes occur in 3% to 17% of procedures.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-06-18 13:07:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth  Brassington">
<P>More research is needed to identify agents which will prolong the beneficial action of plasma exchange.</P>

<P>In the 2010 revision, we reassessed risk of bias according to the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> 2008 methods, and added a sensitivity analysis and 'Summary of findings' table. The terminology for the 'Risk of bias' assessments changed in 2012 from yes/no/unclear to high/low/unclear (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Puneet Agarwal withdrew from authorship prior to the 2012 update of the review.</P>

<PUBLIC_NOTES MODIFIED="2017-11-02 14:45:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>The authors consider that further trials are unlikely; therefore, the next planned update of this review will be four years from the current date of search rather than the usual two years. If new evidence emerges contrary to this, an earlier update will be scheduled.</P>
<P>In July 2017 the first author of <LINK REF="STD-Hahn-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Hahn 1996b</LINK> pointed out that this review had omitted the three participants who had only completed one period of the crossover trial from the meta-analysis. The authors of <LINK REF="STD-Hahn-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Hahn 1996b</LINK> had included these participants imputing the missing data from the last observation carried forward in their published paper. The analyses and text of the review have now been amended to correct this omission which, however, has not affected the conclusions of the review.</P>
