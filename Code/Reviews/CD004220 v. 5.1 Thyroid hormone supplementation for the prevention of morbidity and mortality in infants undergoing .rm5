<P>There is insufficient evidence to advocate the use of triiodothyronine supplementation for the prevention of postoperative morbidity and mortality in infants who undergo cardiopulmonary bypass.Thyroid hormones are integral in cellular metabolism and haemodynamic stability. A transient acquired hypothyroidism occurs after cardiopulmonary bypass and is thought to be associated with low cardiac output, left ventricular dysfunction, increased vascular resistance and impaired ventilatory drives. Thyroid hormone supplementation has been postulated as a possible therapeutic option to improve postoperative outcome measures. This review highlights the lack of evidence concerning the benefits and harms of triiodothyronine supplementation in infants who undergo cardiopulmonary bypass.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used. This included searches of The Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials, MEDLINE (1966 - October 2007), EMBASE (1980 - October 2007), CINAHL (1982 - October 2007), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2007), previous reviews including cross references, abstracts, conferences, symposia proceedings, expert informants and journal handsearching in the English language.</P>

<P>All trials using random allocation to perioperative thyroid hormone therapy (supplementation or replacement) compared to control (placebo or no therapy) in infants (birth to one year of age) undergoing cardiac surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass.

<P>Primary clinical outcomes included measures of postoperative morbidity and mortality. The standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group were used in the assessment of trial quality. Treatment effects were expressed using relative risk (RR) and mean difference (MD). </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-02-11 14:59:04 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three small studies were identified that tested perioperative thyroid hormone supplementation or replacement in infants aged less than one year undergoing cardiac surgery (Mackie 2005; Portman 2000; Chowdhury 2001). In the Chowdhury 2001 study, a subgroup of nine neonates was eligible for this review.</P>
<P>No deaths occurred during the studies. Chowdhury 2001 and Mackie 2005 found no significant effect of perioperative thyroid hormone supplementation in neonates on either length of hospital stay or duration of mechanical ventilation. Portman 2000 found no significant difference in dopamine requirements for the treatment versus control groups for the first 24 hours postoperatively and in Mackie 2005 for up to five days, while in the Chowdhury neonatal subgroup, inotrope requirements were significantly lower in the treatment group. Portman 2000 reported significant differences between the two groups at one and 24 hours postoperatively for free T3 and at one hour postoperatively for total T3 levels. Total T4 levels showed no significant difference between groups, either pre-cardiopulmonary bypass or up to 72 hours postoperatively. In Mackie 2005, total and free T3 levels were significantly higher in the T3 group at 24, 48 and 72 postoperative hours but were similar between groups immediately before and after CPB and at seven postoperative days. The study drug was ceased 33 hours prematurely in one subject in Mackie 2005 due to a seven minute episode of ectopic atrial tachycardia.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-02-11 15:21:29 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2007-12-14 11:14:34 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Thyroid hormones and iodine play an essential role in the development of the nervous system including cerebral neogenesis and migration as well as myelogenesis (<LINK REF="REF-Stein-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stein 1991</LINK>). They are also important in growth regulation, metabolism and organ function (<LINK REF="REF-Larsen-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Larsen 1992</LINK>). Thyroid hormones are integral in cellular metabolism and haemodynamic stability - effects include increased heart rate, enhanced myocardial contractility, improved diastolic function, decreased systemic vascular resistance and enhanced myocardial oxygen consumption (Dillmann 1993). Suppression of circulating thyroid hormone levels occurs during critical illness and after surgical procedures.</P>
<P>Alterations of plasma thyroid hormone concentration in non-thyroidal illness have been postulated to represent an adaptive response of the organism to minimise metabolic demands during the stress of non-thyroidal illness (<LINK REF="REF-Utiger-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Utiger 1980</LINK>). To date, there has been particular interest in the postoperative course of infants undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass procedures for repair of congenital heart defects. Thyroid hormone suppression in infants and children post-cardiopulmonary bypass is associated with increased length of mechanical ventilation, intensive care treatment, and requirements of inotropic drugs, vasoactive catecholamines and frusemide (<LINK REF="REF-Bettendorf-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bettendorf 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are several proposed mechanisms to explain this phenomenon. Firstly, the surgical procedure itself triggers suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary thyroid axis (<LINK REF="REF-Mainwaring-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mainwaring 1994</LINK>). Secondly, the cardiopulmonary bypass, hypothermia, haemodilution, dopamine infusion (<LINK REF="REF-Bettendorf-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bettendorf 1997</LINK>) and probable iodine antiseptic contamination (<LINK REF="REF-Brogan-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brogan 1997</LINK>) augment the inhibitory effect. Low postoperative triiodothyronine concentration after cardiopulmonary bypass may also be triggered by endogenous release of mediators such as glucocorticoids (<LINK REF="REF-Milne-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Milne 1986</LINK>), tumour necrosis factor (<LINK REF="REF-van-der-Poll-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Poll 1990</LINK>) or IL-6 (<LINK REF="REF-Butler-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Butler 1992</LINK>). Several non-specific insults which occur in all major surgery such as fasting, anaesthetic agents and surgical stress may also contribute to a decline in the levels of free triiodothyronine. In addition, certain drugs such as dopamine (<LINK REF="REF-Van-den-Berghe-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van den Berghe 1994</LINK>) and glucocorticoids (<LINK REF="REF-Brabant-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brabant 1987</LINK>), which may be administered after major surgery, have also been observed to produce a thyroid hormone deficiency.</P>
<P>Findings from paediatric studies suggest that cardiopulmonary bypass is associated with a decline in thyroid hormone levels with a trough at between 12 and 48 hours post-bypass (<LINK REF="REF-Murzi-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murzi 1995</LINK>) and lasts for five to seven days postoperatively (<LINK REF="REF-Mitchell-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitchell 1992</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Mainwaring-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mainwaring 2001</LINK> has demonstrated a decline in the levels of free triiodothyronine in serum by more than three-fifths in infants who undergo the first stage of the Norwood reconstruction for hypoplastic left heart syndrome. These peri and postoperative T3 levels are substantially lower when compared to a normal value range for age matched normals (<LINK REF="REF-Zurakowski-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zurakowski 1999</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Mainwaring-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mainwaring 1994</LINK> demonstrated an 80% decrease in TSH, free T3 and thyroglobulin levels in neonates following cardiopulmonary bypass and hypothermia. This transient, acquired hypothyroidism is thought to be associated with low cardiac output, left ventricular dysfunction, increased vascular resistance and impaired ventilatory drives (<LINK REF="REF-Bettendorf-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bettendorf 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Adult patients who undergo open heart surgery and receive triiodothyronine supplementation have demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in cardiac output (<LINK REF="REF-Klemperer-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klemperer 1995</LINK>) that has been associated with an improved clinical outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Novitzky-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Novitzky 1996</LINK>). The changes in thyroid function after cardiopulmonary bypass in infants and neonates differ significantly from those of adults. Infants and neonates display a reduction in TSH, T3 and T4, whereas adults show decline in T3 only (<LINK REF="REF-Mainwaring-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mainwaring 1994</LINK>). Also, greater reductions have been reported in T3 in infants and neonates than adults (<LINK REF="REF-Mitchell-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitchell 1992</LINK>), hence, the question of thyroid hormone supplementation assumes a much greater importance.</P>
<P>The use of thyroid hormone supplementation in infants undergoing cardiac surgery has been reported as a possible therapeutic option to improve outcome measures. This intervention would be of most clinical benefit in infants who have low cardiac output via an enhancement in left ventricular performance, a significant decrease in systemic vascular resistance and improved myocardial oxygen consumption. A recent case series reported on six paediatric patients who underwent complex open heart surgery and had low serum T3 levels in the postoperative period (<LINK REF="REF-Chowdhury-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chowdhury 1999</LINK>). The single most important benefit observed was the conversion to sinus rhythm within 24 hours of T3 administration. In three patients in whom cardiac output could be reliably measured, the cardiac output increased by greater than 50% and systemic vascular resistance decreased by 25%. Urine output increased by 50% in all patients, resolution of metabolic acidosis was seen in four patients, and a reduction of additional inotropic support of up to 50% was reported. No side effects of treatment were documented in this series. <LINK REF="REF-Bialkowski-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bialkowski 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Mainwaring-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mainwaring 1994</LINK> have also published non-randomised data which demonstrate an improvement in specific outcome measures with administration of intravenous triiodothyronine.</P>
<P>While it might seem relatively simple to administer thyroid hormone supplements in these infants perioperatively, that might not be without risks. Supplementation may aggravate a reduction in TSH secretion which may prolong the duration of transient hypothyroidism (<LINK REF="REF-Murzi-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murzi 1995</LINK>). Maternal thyroxine treatment has been associated with newborn encephalopathy (<LINK REF="REF-Adamson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adamson 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Badawi-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Badawi 2000</LINK>) and cerebral palsy (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Girling-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Girling 2001</LINK>) and there have been concerns about supplementation of premature babies with transient hypothyroxinaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Osborn-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osborn 2002</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Van-Wassenaer-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Wassenaer 1999</LINK> showed lower developmental index and higher risk of cerebral haemorrhage in infants born between 27 and 30 weeks gestation when treated thyroid hormone supplementation compared with infants that were not treated.</P>
<P>Other direct signs of thyroid hormone toxicity include tachycardia, cardiac dysrhythmia and hyperthermia.</P>
<P>Triiodothyronine has a half life of seven hours (<LINK REF="REF-Mainwaring-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mainwaring 2000</LINK>) and achieves its peak effects by two hours when administered intravenously. T4, however, may take up to two weeks to reach steady state and hence would not be an appropriate drug of choice in the perioperative cardiac surgery setting in infants. A supplementation dose of triiodothyronine would specifically aim to restore serum T3 levels to within normal limits. Published dosage for the replacement of triiodothyronine intravenously in infants is 0.1-0.4 micrograms/kg/dose, 8 to 12 hourly (<LINK REF="REF-Shann-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shann 2001</LINK>). The optimal timing of the commencement of thyroid hormone supplementation, whether intraoperatively or postoperatively, and the duration of therapy are at present uncertain and will require subgroup analysis within this review.</P>
<P>Bolus doses and intermittent infusions of triiodothyronine may need to be considered separately. It has been shown that T3 adsorbs onto plastic and therefore the type of plastic materials employed in the intravenous fluid administration system and the use of specific drug carriers in dilute solutions must be considered when calculating appropriate dosage for intermittent infusion. A polypropylene syringe with minimum volume polyvinyl chloride (PVC) extension tubing with albumin as a drug carrier is most efficacious in limiting T3 adsorption (<LINK REF="REF-Odgers-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Odgers 1984</LINK>).</P>
<P>Both biological plausibility and some observational evidence suggest that perioperative thyroid hormone therapy for infants undergoing cardiac surgery might lead to improved postoperative cardiac function and improved outcomes. However, the benefits and possible harms of supplementation of triiodothyronine in this clinical setting are not clear.</P>

<P>Five studies were identified; however, only three were included in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Chowdhury-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Chowdhury 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Portman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Portman 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mackie-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mackie 2005</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Mainwaring-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Mainwaring 1997</LINK> was excluded as all subjects were older than one year. <LINK REF="STD-Bettendorf-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bettendorf 2000</LINK> included subjects aged between two days and 10 years, but did not report these subjects according to age groups. This meant that an analysis of a population of infants within this study aged from birth to one year was not possible. The study was therefore excluded.</P>
<P>
<B>Types of participants:</B> All participants were undergoing surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass for congenital heart defects. Their ages ranged from birth to one month (<LINK REF="STD-Mackie-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mackie 2005</LINK>), birth to one year (<LINK REF="STD-Portman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Portman 2000</LINK>), and up to 18 years of age (<LINK REF="STD-Chowdhury-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Chowdhury 2001</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Chowdhury-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Chowdhury 2001</LINK> included a subgroup analysis of nine neonates (up to one month of age), however, they did not report their findings for the remainder of study subjects according to age. The neonatal subgroup was able to be included in this review, while the remainder of the subjects have been excluded from the review.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Mackie-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mackie 2005</LINK> included neonates who had a diagnosis of hypoplastic left heart syndrome or another functional single-ventricle lesion with aortic arch obstruction who was scheduled to undergo the Norwood procedure with either a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt or a right ventricle to pulmonary artery conduit or neonates who had ventricular septal defect and interrupted aortic arch who were scheduled to undergo two ventricle repair. <LINK REF="STD-Portman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Portman 2000</LINK> included infants less than one year undergoing repair of a ventricular septal defect or tetralogy of Fallot, while <LINK REF="STD-Chowdhury-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Chowdhury 2001</LINK> included subjects whose serum total T3 level was less than 40ng/dL (or &lt; 60 ng/dL for newborns) on postoperative days 0, 1 or 2 and who required mechanical ventilation.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Mackie-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mackie 2005</LINK> excluded infants with birth weight lower than 2.3 kg, preoperative tachyarrhythmia, clinical sepsis confirmed by culture, serum creatinine greater than 133 µmol/L (1.5 mg/dL) within 24 hours of surgery or infants with a known thyroid or metabolic disorder. It was not clear from the study of <LINK REF="STD-Chowdhury-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Chowdhury 2001</LINK> as to the exclusion criteria of this study. <LINK REF="STD-Portman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Portman 2000</LINK> excluded infants with pulmonary atresia or severe pulmonary artery hypoplasia and those requiring additional surgical procedures such as repair of coarctation of the aorta.</P>
<P>
<B>Interventions:</B> In <LINK REF="STD-Mackie-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mackie 2005</LINK> the treatment group received a continuous T3 infusion of 0.05 µg/kg/h for 72 hours after the completion of CPB, compared to the control group who received 0.9% sodium chloride solution. In <LINK REF="STD-Chowdhury-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Chowdhury 2001</LINK> the treatment group received a continuous T3 infusion at 0.05 - 0.15 µg/kg/hr to maintain serum levels within the normal range (80 - 200ng/dL), compared to the control group who received no treatment. In <LINK REF="STD-Portman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Portman 2000</LINK>, the treatment group received triiodothyronine 0.4 µg/kg immediately before the start of cardiopulmonary bypass and again with myocardial reperfusion. The control group received saline placebo solution or no treatment.</P>
<P>
<B>Outcome measures:</B>
<BR/>Primary outcome measures for this review that were reported in <LINK REF="STD-Chowdhury-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Chowdhury 2001</LINK> included the length of postoperative hospital stay and duration of mechanical ventilation (days). In <LINK REF="STD-Mackie-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mackie 2005</LINK> the length of hospital stay and length of mechanical ventilation was included. All three studies reported mortality.</P>
<P>The secondary outcome measures for this review that were reported in <LINK REF="STD-Chowdhury-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Chowdhury 2001</LINK> were serum T3 level (24 hours postoperatively) and degree of inotrope support. In <LINK REF="STD-Portman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Portman 2000</LINK>, the secondary outcome measures evaluated in this study included: Serum thyroid hormone levels measured at 1, 24 and 72 hours (free T3, total T3, total T4), inotropic requirements for the initial 24 hour postoperative period and adverse events (cardiac dysrhythmias). In <LINK REF="STD-Mackie-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mackie 2005</LINK>, degree of inotrope support, adverse events (cardiac dysrhythmias) and serum thyroid hormone levels (free and total T3 and total T4) up to one week postoperatively.</P>
<P>Outcome measures included <I>post hoc</I> in this review included Therapeutic Interventional Scoring System (TISS) score from <LINK REF="STD-Chowdhury-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Chowdhury 2001</LINK> and postoperative heart rate.</P>
<P>Ongoing research into perioperative thyroid hormone supplementation in infants undergoing cardiac surgery on cardiopulmonary bypass with an aim to improve postoperative morbidity and mortality is currently being undertaken by two groups whose studies were included in this review. Portman and colleagues are currently undertaking the Triiodothyronine for Infants and Children Undergoing Cardiopulmonary bypass (TRICC) study. This is a multicentre randomised clinical trial that aims to enrol 200 subjects under the age of two years undergoing cardiac surgery utilising cardiopulmonary bypass. The primary outcome measure is duration of mechanical ventilation after completion of cardiopulmonary bypass. Secondary clinical outcome measures include fluid balance, length of time dependent on inotropic agents, duration of critical care unit stay, postoperative mortality within the first 72 hours, requirement for mechanical-circulatory support, requirement for delayed chest closure. Triiodothyronine will be administered as a bolus of 0.4 &#956;g/kg immediately prior to CPB, 0.4 µg/kg on the release of the aortic cross clamp and then 0.2 µg/kg at 3, 6 and 9 hours after cross clamp release.</P>
<P>Dr Irwin Klein, a member of the Chowdhury group, is continuing with the randomised controlled trial discussed in this review and to date has enrolled a further 71 subjects (<I>See Table, Characteristics of ongoing studies</I>).</P>

<P>All included studies conducted random patient allocation.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Chowdhury-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Chowdhury 2001</LINK> evaluated 75 consecutive patients undergoing cardiac surgery between the ages of birth and 18 years. Subjects were assigned to the treatment arm of the study if the serum total T3 level was less than 40ng/dL (or &lt; 60 ng/dL for newborns) on postoperative days 0, 1 or 2 and the subject required mechanical ventilation. Twenty-eight subjects were deemed eligible and were randomised using a standard biostatistical randomisation method. This included five neonates who were randomised to the treatment group and four to the control group. There were no significant differences after randomisation between the neonate treatment and control groups in number of subjects requiring cardiopulmonary bypass, total bypass time, duration of cross clamping and the duration of hypothermic cardiac arrest. The control group was not treated, hence, blinding of the intervention was not undertaken. The length of follow-up was five days post-randomisation and all patients were appropriately accounted for at the conclusion of the study period. Whether outcome assessments were blinded was not stated by the authors.</P>
<P>Although the authors state that randomisation was conducted, the specific randomisation procedure used in the study of Portman and co-workers (<LINK REF="STD-Portman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Portman 2000</LINK>) was not stated. The control and treatment groups showed no significant differences after randomisation in age, cardiopulmonary bypass time or aortic cross clamping time. The intervention, which was administered during the surgery, was not blinded. Although some of the control group received a saline solution placebo, other control subjects received no treatment. The outcome assessment was blinded as staff responsible for postoperative care were blinded to subject allocation. The duration of follow-up was 72 hours postoperative and all subjects were treated in their allocated groups with no exclusions after subject randomisation.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Mackie-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mackie 2005</LINK> initially conducted an open label, dose finding phase. Five subjects received 0.0625 µg/kg/h. Two subsequent subjects received 0.05 µg/kg/h based on the analysis of the first five subjects. Forty-two subjects were then randomised using a computer-based random number generator in permuted blocks of two and four. This was stratified by surgeon and surgical procedure (Norwood palliation or ventricular septal defect and interrupted aortic arch repair). The control and intevention groups showed no differernce in gestational age and age at surgery, APGAR scores, ethnicity, birthweight, preoperative serum creatinine and lactate, number of subjects preoperatively ventilated, diagnosis, surgical procedure, duration of CPB, duration of aortic cross clamping and duration of circulatory arrest. The duration of follow-up was 14 days postoperative. All subjects were accounted for at the conclusion of the study. Method of blinding of outcome assessment was not stated.</P>

<P>The three studies included in this review enrolled a total of 84 subjects (65 were eligible for this review). <LINK REF="STD-Chowdhury-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Chowdhury 2001</LINK> included subjects whose ages ranged from one day to 18 years. This study conducted a subgroup analysis of nine neonates who are included in this review. The data for the remainder of subjects were excluded from this review as they were not reported according to age group.</P>
<P>
<B>Primary clinical outcome measures:<BR/>Mortality:</B>
<BR/>There were no deaths in either the treatment or control groups in the <LINK REF="STD-Chowdhury-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Chowdhury 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mackie-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mackie 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Portman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Portman 2000</LINK> studies.

<P>
<B>Morbidity:</B>
<BR/>
<B>Length of hospital stay in days (Outcome 01.01):</B>
<BR/>In the neonate subgroup of <LINK REF="STD-Chowdhury-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Chowdhury 2001</LINK>, there was a mean length of hospital stay 38 days shorter in neonates treated with T3 compared with neonates in the control group. In <LINK REF="STD-Mackie-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mackie 2005</LINK>, the median length of hospital stay was 16.5 days (range 8 - 95 days) in the treatment group and 18 days (9 - 112 days) in the placebo group. This was not statistically significant in either study. <LINK REF="STD-Portman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Portman 2000</LINK> did not report length of hospital stay as a study outcome.</P>

<B>Duration of respiratory assistance (IPPV, CPAP, oxygen supplementation) in days (Outcome 01.02):</B>
<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Chowdhury-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Chowdhury 2001</LINK> reported the mean duration of mechanical ventilation was two days less in neonates treated with T3 compared with neonates in the control group. In <LINK REF="STD-Mackie-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mackie 2005</LINK>, median duration was six days (3 - 17 days) in the T3 group and six days (4 - 13 days) in the placebo group. In both studies. This was not statistically significant in either study. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was utilised in two subjects in the placebo arm. No data was provided regarding the length of time this was required. <LINK REF="STD-Portman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Portman 2000</LINK> did not consider duration of respiratory assistance as a study outcome.</P>

<B>THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTIONAL SCORING SYSTEM (TISS) (POST-HOC OUTCOME):</B>
</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Chowdhury-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Chowdhury 2001</LINK> analysed the overall degree of postoperative care by using the Therapeutic Interventional Scoring System (TISS) score. This involved the scoring of 76 different therapeutic and monitoring procedures that were scaled according to the degree of invasiveness, intensity and complexity of care with which the patient was provided. For the neonatal subgroup within this study, on post-randomisation days one to three these scores were significantly lower (P = 0.037) in the treatment group (40 +/- 3 ng/dL) compared with the untreated group (49 +/- 3 ng/dL). While this was not a primary outcome measure of this review, this score is a potentially important clinical tool and may be interpreted as an indirect measure of the review's primary outcomes.</P>
<P>
<B>Secondary clinical outcome measures:<BR/>Morbidity:</B>
<BR/>The studies did not provide data on subsequent growth (weight, length and head circumference) and neurodevelopment (cerebral palsy or developmental delay) in subjects.</P>
<P>
<B>Adverse effects of thyroid hormone supplementation:</B>
<BR/>
<B>Tachycardia (&gt;160 beats per minute):</B>
<BR/>In <LINK REF="STD-Portman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Portman 2000</LINK>, dichotomous values for heart rate were unable to be obtained. It can be extrapolated from the study graph that an unspecified number of treatment group subjects had a heart rate of greater than 160 beats per minute at one and three hours post-cardiopulmonary bypass. A <I>post hoc</I> analysis of heart rate values from this study (Outcome 01.08) showed the mean postoperative heart rate was also significantly higher for the treatment group versus the control group at these two specific points in time (P &lt; 0.05). At one and three hours postoperatively the treatment group means were 155.7 and 156.8 respectively vs. 131.0 and 142.0 for the control group respectively.</P>
<P>
<B>Cardiac dysrhythmia (Outcome 01.03):</B>
<BR/>In the <LINK REF="STD-Portman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Portman 2000</LINK> study, a brief period of supraventricular tachycardia was experienced by one subject in the treatment group. No dysrhythmias were reported in the control group. <LINK REF="STD-Chowdhury-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Chowdhury 2001</LINK> reported that there were no cardiac dysrhythmias in the treatment or control groups. In <LINK REF="STD-Mackie-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mackie 2005</LINK> the study drug was ceased 33 hours prematurely in one subject due to ectopic atrial tachycardia. This was a 7 minute episode, during which the maximum heart rate was 231 beats per minute. This subject subequently had episodes of tachyarrhythmia up to six days after termination of the study drug.</P>
<P>
<B>Hyperthermia (&gt; 37.5 degrees C):</B>
<BR/>Temperature measurements in subjects were not reported in any of the studies.</P>
<P>Thyroid depression (&lt; 79 nmol/L for T4, &lt; 1.58 nmol/L for T3 and 0.8 nmol/L for TSH) for greater than one week on cessation of thyroid hormone replacement was not reported in the studies.</P>
<P>
<B>Cardiac dysfunction:</B>
<BR/>Use of support such as postoperative cardiopulmonary bypass (in hours) was not assessed in any of the three studies.</P>
<P>
<B>Inotropes (duration, dose, number):</B>
<BR/>The authors of <LINK REF="STD-Chowdhury-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Chowdhury 2001</LINK> used an equation first described by <LINK REF="REF-Wernovsky-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wernovsky 1995</LINK> for calculating total inotrope dose by adding the doses of dopamine and dobutamine in micrograms per kilogram per minute and assigning an arbitrary equivalent value of 10 µg · kg-1 · min-1 inotrope for each 0.1 µg · kg-1 · min-1 epinephrine. For the neonatal subgroup in this study, the treatment group had a score of five with a standard deviation of three, while the score for the control group was 23 with a standard deviation of 26. This was reported as being a statistically significant difference in inotrope usage (P = 0.04). In <LINK REF="STD-Mackie-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mackie 2005</LINK>, the mean five day inotrope scores (also using the <LINK REF="REF-Wernovsky-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wernovsky 1995</LINK> equation) were 63.2 mg/kg (standard deviation 32.4) and 69.1mg/kg in the placebo group. This was not significant. Similarly, there was no significant differnence between the mean inotrope scores at 12, 24 and 48 hours.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Portman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Portman 2000</LINK> reported that mean dopamine dose ranged between 1 to 3 ug/kg/min through the initial 24 hour postoperative period for both the treatment and control groups. Dopamine requirements were not significantly different between groups evaluated at one and six hours after cardiopulmonary bypass. Two patients from each group received identical doses of amrinone during the same time period.</P>
<P>
<B>Thyroid hormone levels in the first week postoperatively - T3, T4, rT3, TSH (Outcomes 01.04, 01.05, 01.06):</B>
<BR/>In <LINK REF="STD-Chowdhury-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Chowdhury 2001</LINK>, measures of thyroid hormone levels were not reported for the specific age group required for this review. <LINK REF="STD-Portman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Portman 2000</LINK> reported that free and total T3 levels were substantially different between the two groups, being higher in the treatment group for the first 24 hours postoperatively (significant difference (P &lt; 0.05) at one and 24 hours for free T3 and at one hour postoperatively for total T3 levels). Free and total T3 levels were similar between groups by 72 hours postoperatively. Total T4 levels were similar between treatment and control groups at all times from pre-cardiopulmonary bypass to 72 hours postoperatively.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Mackie-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mackie 2005</LINK>, total and free T3 levels were significantly higher in the T3 group at 24, 48 and 72 postoperative hours but were similar between groups immediately before and after CPB and at seven postoperative days. Levels of total and free T4, thyroid stimulating hormone and T3 resin uptake did not differ between the groups at any time before or after surgery.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-02-11 15:21:29 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Main findings:</B>
<BR/>The main finding arising from this review is the lack of evidence from randomised trials as to whether thyroid hormone therapy is beneficial or harmful in infants up to one year of age undergoing cardiac surgery. There is no information for many outcomes pre-specified by the reviewers. Several secondary outcomes of this review that were not addressed by either of the eligible studies included: subsequent growth parameters and neurodevelopmental outcome, adverse effects of thyroid hormone supplementation (hyperthermia and thyroid depression for greater than one week on cessation of thyroid hormone replacement). In addition to this, differences in methods, timing (prophylactic versus therapeutic) and dose of thyroid hormone used in these studies raise questions regarding the most efficacious supplementation regime should this form of therapy prove beneficial. Triiodothyronine supplementation in preterm infants can cause a worse outcome in terms of developmental index at 24 months of age (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Wassenaer-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Wassenaer 1999</LINK>). This may also have implications in this group of very sick newborns and infants.</P>
<P>
<B>Major limitations of the review:</B>
<BR/>Three studies were identified in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Chowdhury-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Chowdhury 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Portman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Portman 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mackie-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mackie 2005</LINK>). These studies differed in inclusion criteria, the age of subjects they recruited and in the method, dose and timing of tri-iodothryonine administration. The included studies were small (total numbers of subjects were 14, 28 and 42) which limited the power of this review.</P>
<P>The three studies assessed in this review used different dosing and timing of tri-iodothryonine administration. These differences limit the ability of this review to make specific conclusions regarding both the efficacy and optimal administration of perioperative triiodothyronine. No single outcome, either primary or secondary, could be assessed using a meta-analysis of the three studies.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2007-12-14 10:03:46 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a lack of evidence from randomised trials concerning the benefits and risks of triiodothyronine supplementation in perioperative cardiac surgery for infants. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Portman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Portman 2000</LINK> demonstrated that an unspecified number of thyroid-treated subjects developed a postoperative tachycardia (&gt;160 beats per minute) at one and three hours. Whether this has any clinical significance remains to be seen. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2007-12-14 11:19:23 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further randomised controlled trials which include sufficiently large subject numbers in a variety of different age strata (neonates, infants and older children) need to be undertaken. The studies will also need to examine whether thyroid hormone should be used prophylactically for all patients undergoing cardiac surgery or therapeutically once the patient demonstrates low serum thyroid hormone levels. Efficacy of this treatment should be assessed in terms of effects on specific cardiac parameters, postoperative morbidity and mortality, and neurodevelopment.</P>
<P>The results of the TRICC study by Portman and colleagues, with 200 subjects, is greatly anticipated as it will provide further data regarding the benefits and the risks of the administration of tri-iodothryonine to infants undergoing cardiac surgery utilising cardiopulmonary bypass.</P>
