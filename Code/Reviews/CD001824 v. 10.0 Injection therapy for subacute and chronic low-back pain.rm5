These are topics of current or future Cochrane reviews.</P>
<P>As before, the review authors concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support the use of injection therapy in subacute and chronic low-back pain. However, it cannot be ruled out that specific subgroups of patients may respond to a specific type of injection therapy.</P>

<TITLE>Injection therapy for subacute and chronic low-back pain</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-05-12 13:53:19 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Injection therapy is one of many treatments available for patients with subacute (longer than six weeks) and chronic (longer than 12 weeks) low-back pain. Where the injection is given, what drug is used and why the injection is given can all vary.</P>
<P>The injection can be given into different parts of the spine (the space between the vertebrae, around the nerve roots, or into the disc), ligaments, muscles or trigger points (spots in the muscles that when pressed firmly will produce pain). Drugs that reduce swelling (corticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAIDs)) and pain (morphine, anaesthetics) are used. Injection therapy can be used for individuals with low-back pain with or without pain and other symptoms in the leg.</P>
<P>A number of electronic databases of healthcare articles were searched up to March 2007. This search identified 18 randomized controlled trials (RCTs; 1179 participants) that looked at injections with a variety of drugs compared to a placebo drug or other drugs. The injections were given into the epidural space (between the vertebrae of the back and outside the coverings that surround the spinal cord), the facet joints (the joints of two vertebrae), or tender spots in the ligaments or muscles.</P>
<P>The review authors rated ten of the 18 RCTs as having a low risk of bias in the way the trials were conducted and reported. They were unable to statistically pool the results because the injection sites, drugs used and outcomes measured were too varied. Only five of the 18 trials reported significant results in favour of one of the treatment arms. The reviewer authors considered the likely treatment benefits to be worth the potential harms in only two studies.<BR/>In nine out of the 18 studies, side effects such as headache, dizziness, transient local pain, tingling and numbness and nausea were reported in small numbers of patients. The use of morphine was more frequently associated with itching, nausea and vomiting. Rare but more serious complications of injection therapy have been mentioned in the literature, such as cauda equina syndrome, septic facet joint arthritis, discitis, paraplegia, paraspinal abscesses. Although the absolute frequency of these complications may be rare, these risks should be taken into consideration.<BR/>
<BR/>Based on these results, the review authors concluded that there is no strong evidence for or against the use of any type of injection therapy for individuals with subacute or chronic low-back pain.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>The effectiveness of injection therapy for low-back pain is still debatable. Heterogeneity of target tissue, pharmacological agent and dosage generally found in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) points to the need for clinically valid comparisons in a literature synthesis.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine if injection therapy is more effective than placebo or other treatments for patients with subacute or chronic low-back pain. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We updated the search of the earlier systematic review and searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE and EMBASE databases from January 1999 to March 2007 for relevant trials reported in English, French, German, Dutch and Nordic languages. We also screened references from trials identified.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>RCTs on the effects of injection therapy involving epidural, facet or local sites for subacute or chronic low-back pain were included. Studies which compared the effects of intradiscal injections, prolotherapy or Ozone therapy with other treatments, were excluded unless injection therapy with another pharmaceutical agent (no placebo treatment) was part of one of the treatment arms. Studies about injections in sacroiliac joints and studies evaluating the effects of epidural steroids for radicular pain were also excluded. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two review authors independently assessed the quality of the trials. If study data were clinically and statistically too heterogeneous to perform a meta-analysis, we used a best evidence synthesis to summarize the results. The evidence was classified into five levels (strong, moderate, limited, conflicting or no evidence), taking into account the methodological quality of the studies. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>18 trials (1179 participants) were included in this updated review. The injection sites varied from epidural sites and facet joints (i.e. intra-articular injections, peri-articular injections and nerve blocks) to local sites (i.e. tender- and trigger points). The drugs that were studied consisted of corticosteroids, local anesthetics and a variety of other drugs. The methodological quality of the trials was limited with 10 out of 18 trials rated as having a high methodological quality. Statistical pooling was not possible due to clinical heterogeneity in the trials. Overall, the results indicated that there is no strong evidence for or against the use of any type of injection therapy. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is insufficient evidence to support the use of injection therapy in subacute and chronic low-back pain. However, it cannot be ruled out that specific subgroups of patients may respond to a specific type of injection therapy. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-05-14 12:25:46 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-05-12 13:53:45 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Numerous treatments have been promoted as useful to reduce the individual and socio-economic burden of low-back pain, but many controversies still exist on the effectiveness of the available treatment options (<LINK REF="REF-Weinstein-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weinstein 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Airaksinen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Airaksinen 2006</LINK>). Injection therapy is one of the treatments for patients with subacute and chronic low-back pain that needs careful evaluation with respect to its effectiveness for short- and long-term pain relief. In order to investigate the effects of injection therapy for low-back pain in a systematic review, it should be realized that the content of this treatment method, as studied in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), may show a large degree of variation. The same holds for daily clinical practice, which underlines the need to make clinically valid comparisons of injection therapy interventions. The first source of variation in the content of injection therapy is the location of the injection and the tissue that is targeted for injection. The injection can be given into the facet joints, the epidural space, the spinal nerve root, the intervertebral disc, the lumbar sympathetic chain, sacro-iliac joints and also into local ligaments, muscles or trigger points (<LINK REF="REF-Airaksinen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Airaksinen 2006</LINK>). Second, the pharmacological agent that is used for the injection varies from different types of corticosteroids aimed at reducing inflammation and anaesthetics aimed at pain relief, to a variety of other drugs, all with potentially different dosages. Third, the indications for the injection therapy may also be different. Injection therapy can be applied in cases of acute, subacute or chronic low-back pain with or without signs of nerve root compression. For obvious reasons, the specific characteristics of the injection therapy with respect to target tissue, pharmacological agent and dosage depends on the presumed pathophysiological mechanisms leading to pain. In some cases, injections are used for diagnostic purposes rather than treatment. Injections into facet joints, for example, have been presented as a diagnostic test for the so-called lumbar facet joint syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Mooney-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mooney 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mooney-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mooney 1987</LINK>). Furthermore, in some RCTs, injection therapy is only one part of a multimodal treatment package. These issues may challenge a valid assessment and summation of the effects of injection therapy in patients with low-back pain.</P>
<P>The present systematic review is an update of an earlier Cochrane review on the effectiveness of injection therapy for subacute and chronic low-back pain (<LINK REF="REF-Nelemans-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelemans 2000</LINK>). Many of the 21 studies that were included in this prior systematic review were rated as being of low methodological quality and in 11 of the 21 studies, injection was compared with placebo. The authors concluded that convincing evidence for the effectiveness of injection therapy was still lacking and recommended large well-designed trials in this field, preferably placebo-controlled (<LINK REF="REF-Nelemans-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelemans 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Since <LINK REF="REF-Nelemans-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelemans 2000</LINK> et al was published, several new RCTs on the effects of injections for low-back pain were published and the method guidelines for systematic reviews in the field of low-back pain were updated (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 2003</LINK>). In order to reduce the clinical heterogeneity identified in the earlier review, several more specific injection therapies have been covered in separate Cochrane reviews. Therefore, the present systematic review does not include the effects of intradiscal therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Niemisto-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Niemisto 2003</LINK>), prolotherapy (i.e. injection of sclerosants) (<LINK REF="REF-Dagenais-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dagenais 2007</LINK>) or epidural steroids for radiculopathy due to disc herniation (registered as a title for an upcoming Cochrane review). Although some overlap cannot always be prevented since radiculopathy is not an exclusive diagnosis, we aim to exclude studies dealing specifically with epidural steroids for this particular study population from the present update. <LINK REF="REF-Nelemans-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelemans 2000</LINK> et al had included studies on epidural steroids for radiculopathy in the earlier review. This update further differs from the previous review with regard to the internal validity criteria that were used. We rated the studies according to the eleven internal validity items recommended by <LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 2003</LINK> whereas <LINK REF="REF-Nelemans-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelemans 2000</LINK> et al used a fifteen item list according to <LINK REF="REF-ter-Riet-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">ter Riet 1990</LINK> et al. In addition, we also added an assessment of clinical relevance to the present review.</P>
<P>Because many studies in the review by <LINK REF="REF-Nelemans-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelemans 2000</LINK> et al were clinically heterogeneous, a major concern for the present update, as stated before, was to come up with comparisons that made sense from a clinical perspective. Therefore, we chose to classify studies first according to the target tissue of the injection and second according to the therapeutic agent that was used. If possible, these strata were further subdivided into placebo-controlled trials and those that compared injections with other treatments.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this systematic review was to asses the effectiveness of injection therapy for patients with subacute or chronic low-back pain. </P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Only RCTs were included. Non-randomized studies were excluded. </P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Patients aged from 18 to 70 years were included if they had low-back pain with symptoms persisting for at least one month. Subacute low-back pain was defined as lasting for four weeks or longer and chronic as lasting for 12 weeks or longer. </P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>The treatment had to include injection therapy for pain relief. The injection therapy was studied at three different injection sites: facet joints, epidural sites, and local sites. Studies that compared the effects of epidural steroids for radicular pain, intradiscal injections, prolotherapy or Ozone therapy with other treatments were excluded unless injection therapy with another pharmaceutical agent (no placebo treatment) was part of one of the treatment arms. Studies about injections into sacroiliac joints and studies in which the drugs were administered by means of a catheter and not directly by means of an injection were also excluded. <BR/>Additional treatments were allowed.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>Pain was considered to be the most important outcome measure. In order to be included for the present review, studies should at least have incorporated this outcome measure. This could be expressed as the percentage of patients with pain relief or as mean improvement on a continuous scale. Other important outcome measures were: a global measure of improvement (e.g. overall improvement, proportion of patients recovered, subjective improvement of symptoms), back-specific disability (expressed on a back-specific index, such as the Roland Disability Questionnaire or the Oswestry Disability Index), generic health status or well-being, disability for work, and patient satisfaction (<LINK REF="REF-Bombardier-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bombardier 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 2003</LINK>). These outcomes were evaluated on both a short-term (less than six weeks) and long-term basis (longer than six weeks). Side effects were also considered. </P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Study selection and data extraction</HEADING>
<P>For the 2007 update, two authors (JBS, RdB) independently selected new studies, assessed the methodological quality, and extracted the data (using a standardized form). This was conducted in the same way, described in the following sections, as in the previously published systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Nelemans-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelemans 2000</LINK>). A consensus method was used to solve disagreements about the selection of RCTs, and a third author (PN) was consulted if disagreement persisted. First, the two authors screened the titles, abstracts and keywords of all references identified by the literature search to determine if they met the inclusion criteria. Second, the full text of the article was retrieved for studies for which it was unclear from the screening procedure whether or not the study had to be included.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Methodological quality assessment</HEADING>
<P>The methodological quality of the RCTs was independently assessed by two authors (JBS, RdB), using the methodological criteria recommended by the Cochrane Back Review Group (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 2003</LINK>). A consensus method was used to resolve disagreements and a third author was consulted if disagreements persisted (PN). The items were scored as either positive (+), negative (-) or unclear (?). The criteria used, and their operationalization are listed in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Clinical relevance</HEADING>
<P>Two authors (JBS and RdB) independently assessed the clinical relevance of the included studies according to several questions which were recommended by the Cochrane Back Review Group (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 2003</LINK>). Each question was scored positive (+) if the clinical relevance item was met, negative (-) if the item was not met and unclear (?) if data were not available to answer the question. We considered a 20% improvement in pain scores (<LINK REF="REF-Salaffi-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salaffi 2004</LINK>) and a 10% improvement in functioning outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Bombardier-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bombardier 2000</LINK>) to be clinically important. See <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> for the questions used.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Analysis</HEADING>
<P>The results of each RCT were plotted as point estimates with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) as far as possible. The clinical homogeneity was evaluated by exploring the differences between the RCTs, taking into consideration the study population, the injection sites, the content of the injection therapy with regard to medication and dosage, reference treatments, timing of follow-up measurements and measurement instruments. Furthermore, a distinction was made between studies that compared injection with a placebo injection and studies that compared two or more active agents (<LINK REF="REF-Nelemans-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelemans 2000</LINK>). Attempts were made to statistically pool the data of homogeneous studies for the outcome measures pain, overall improvement and disability for short and long-term follow-up. If subgroups of studies were considered to be clinically homogeneous, the statistical homogeneity was formally tested. If studies were considered clinically heterogeneous and/or studies did not report their results in a way that enabled us to perform statistical pooling (for example, for continuous data, means were presented but no standard deviations) we refrained from following a formal meta-analytic approach. In stead of this, we summarized the results according to a rating system with five levels of evidence (best evidence synthesis), based on the quality and the outcome of the studies (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 2003</LINK>). The following levels of evidence were distinguished:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<B>Strong evidence</B> - Consistent findings among multiple high quality RCTs;</LI>
<LI>
<B>Moderate evidence</B> - Consistent findings among multiple low quality RCTs or one high quality RCT;</LI>
<LI>
<B>Limited evidence </B>- one low quality RCT;</LI>
<LI>
<B>Conflicting evidence</B> - inconsistent findings among multiple trials;</LI>
<LI>
<B>No evidence</B> - no RCTs.</LI>
</UL>
<P>High quality studies were defined as RCT which fulfilled six or more of the internal validity criteria. The results were considered to be consistent if 75% of the studies showed results in the same direction.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Study selection</HEADING>
<P>The original 1998 search yielded 40 relevant papers (<LINK REF="REF-Nelemans-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelemans 2000</LINK>). After detailed reading, 19 studies were excluded because they included acute patients (pain for less than one month), they did not describe the duration of the reported symptoms, they appeared to be non-randomized or the anesthetic agent was injected into the wound during surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Nelemans-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelemans 2000</LINK>). From the remaining 19 studies that were covered by <LINK REF="REF-Nelemans-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelemans 2000</LINK> et al, nine studies were excluded from the present update due to the modified inclusion criteria. As stated earlier, studies on the effects of corticosteroids for radiculopathy will be summarized in another Cochrane review. This means that four studies which investigated the effects of corticosteroids in patients with radiculopathy in comparison with a placebo injection (<LINK REF="STD-Cuckler-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Cuckler 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mathews-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Mathews 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bush-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Bush 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rogers-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rogers 1992</LINK>) were excluded. Furthermore, one study dealt with intradiscal injection (<LINK REF="STD-Simmons-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Simmons 1992</LINK>), one study dealt with prolotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Ongley-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Ongley 1987</LINK>), both of which are covered in another Cochrane review, and another study included patients who had cervical symptoms and did not present separate results for the lower back (<LINK REF="STD-Hameroff-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Hameroff 1981</LINK>). Two studies were excluded because the drugs were administered by means of a catheter (<LINK REF="STD-Dallas-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Dallas 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glynn-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Glynn 1988</LINK>) and not directly by means of an injection. In addition, the study population of one of them consisted of patients with chronic pain with only a small subgroup of patients labeled as having low-back pain (<LINK REF="STD-Glynn-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Glynn 1988</LINK>). Consequently, from the previous search by <LINK REF="REF-Nelemans-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelemans 2000</LINK> et al, only 10 studies were incorporated into the present update.</P>
<P>The March 2007 literature search update resulted in the identification of 11 new references from MEDLINE, eight references from EMBASE and one reference from additional reference checking. Four references were included in both the MEDLINE and EMBASE search results, leaving 16 references potentially relevant for the purpose of the review. After careful reading of the papers, the two reviewers (JBS and RdB) decided that eight studies had to be excluded. Two of them compared two different needling techniques (<LINK REF="STD-Stojanovic-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Stojanovic 2005</LINK>) or injection sites (<LINK REF="STD-Pneumaticos-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pneumaticos 2006</LINK>). One study compared radiofrequency denervation with an injection of a small amount of lidocaine which was considered a sham treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Oh-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Oh 2004</LINK>). Other studies dealt with patients with radiculopathy (sciatic nerve pain) (<LINK REF="STD-Bonetti-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bonetti 2005</LINK>), with acute patients (<LINK REF="STD-Tuzun-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tuzun 2003</LINK>), patients with osteoporosis (<LINK REF="STD-Ofluoglu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ofluoglu 2007</LINK>), or made use of epidural catheterization (<LINK REF="STD-Fredman-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Fredman 1999</LINK>). One study appeared not to be a RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Ney-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ney 2006</LINK>). Together with 10 studies from the earlier review, we ended up with 18 studies that were considered relevant for the purpose of this review.</P>

Among the placebo-controlled studies, three used an anesthetic (i.e. procaine, bupivacaine and lidocaine) as part of their reference injections (<LINK REF="STD-Beliveau-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Beliveau 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Breivik-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Breivik 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Garvey-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Garvey 1989</LINK>). Nevertheless, we still considered these studies placebo-controlled since the experimental treatments in these studies consisted of corticosteroids with a similar amount of anesthetic added to the solution as in the reference treatment. Anesthetics in general have a relatively short duration of action and from a pharmacological standpoint it seems unlikely that they will result in lasting pain relief (<LINK REF="REF-Nelemans-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelemans 2000</LINK>).</P>

<P>For the assessment of the methodological quality of the trials, we combined the information from all papers reporting on the same trial. The two reviewers disagreed on 72 of 198 items (36%) scored. After discussing the results, they reached consensus on the scoring of all items. Therefore, the assistance of a third reviewer was not needed. Nine of the 18 studies included met six or more internal validity criteria and were therefore considered to be at an acceptable level of methodological quality (<LINK REF="STD-Breivik-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Breivik 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Garvey-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Garvey 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rocco-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Rocco 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carette-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Carette 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Collee-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Collee 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marks-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Marks 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Revel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Revel 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lierz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lierz 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Takada-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Takada 2005</LINK>). The most prevalent shortcomings were: a lack of clarity regarding the concealment of random treatment allocation (N = 17), no reporting of co-interventions (N = 14) and no reporting of an intention-to-treat analysis (N = 13). The internal validity criteria that were most frequently met were: the acceptability of the level of compliance of patients to the treatment protocol (N = 18), the description and acceptability of the drop-out rate (N = 14) and the similarity of the timing of the outcome assessments (N = 13).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Feasibility of statistical pooling</HEADING>
<P>As stated in the method section, statistical pooling was only considered if subgroups of studies were clinically homogeneous and the authors provided sufficient information on study characteristics, outcome measures and study results. After reviewing the study characteristics of the studies included, only two subgroups of two studies seemed to be sufficiently clinically homogeneous to perform statistical pooling. <LINK REF="STD-Beliveau-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Beliveau 1971</LINK> et al and <LINK REF="STD-Breivik-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Breivik 1976</LINK> et al compared the effect of epidural corticosteroid injections to placebo injections and looked at short-term results of pain relief, measured on a subjective dichotomous scale. However, in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Breivik-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Breivik 1976</LINK> et al, the patients who were allocated to a particular treatment and who did not improve were also treated with injections of the alternative group. The timing of the outcome measurements in this study was not clear either. Therefore, we thought these two studies were too heterogeneous to pool their results. <LINK REF="STD-Carette-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Carette 1991</LINK> et al and <LINK REF="STD-Lilius-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Lilius 1990</LINK> et al compared the effects of facet joint injections with corticosteroids to placebo injections (<LINK REF="STD-Lilius-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Lilius 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carette-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Carette 1991</LINK>). However, the study by <LINK REF="STD-Carette-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Carette 1991</LINK> et al used a dichotomous outcome for pain improvement, whereas <LINK REF="STD-Lilius-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Lilius 1990</LINK> et al reported mean pain scores and no proportions of patients with pain relief. Therefore, it was not possible to pool the results of these two studies. Consequently, instead of statistical pooling, we had to perform a best-evidence synthesis for both subgroups of studies.</P>

In their high quality study, <LINK REF="STD-Carette-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Carette 1991</LINK> et al pre-selected and only included patients who responded positively to a facet joint injection with lidocaine (more than 50% reduction in pain score). These patients were randomly allocated to either corticosteroids or placebo injections. No significant differences for self-rated improvement, pain or functional status were found between the groups at one and three months. At six months, significant differences were found with regard to self-rated improvement, pain and functional status in favour of the corticosteroids group (<LINK REF="STD-Carette-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Carette 1991</LINK>). In a low quality study, <LINK REF="STD-Lilius-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Lilius 1990</LINK> et al compared corticosteroids injected intra-articularly to corticosteroids injected peri-capsularly and to placebo injections. No significant differences between the groups were reported for pain, disability and work attendance at one hour, two weeks, six weeks and three months (<LINK REF="STD-Lilius-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Lilius 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is moderate evidence (2 trials; 210 patients) that facet joint injections with corticosteroids are not significantly different from placebo injections for short term pain relief and improvement of disability. There is conflicting evidence (2 trials; 210 patients) whether facet joint injections with corticosteroids are more effective for intermediate term pain reduction and improvement of disability than placebo injections.

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Facet joint injections with corticosteroids versus other treatments</HEADING>
<P>In four studies, the effects of corticosteroids injections into the facet joints were compared with other treatments. In a low quality study, <LINK REF="STD-Manchikanti-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Manchikanti 2001</LINK> et al compared the effects of multiple medial branch blocks, consisting of corticosteroids combined with local anaesthetics and Sarapin, to multiple medial branch blocks consisting of only local anaesthetics and Sarapin. No significant differences between the groups were found in pain relief, overall health, physical, functional, and psychological status and return-to-work at different follow-up moments throughout a 2.5-year follow-up period. In a low quality study, <LINK REF="STD-Mayer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mayer 2004</LINK> et al made a comparison between facet joint injections on one to three levels bilaterally, with mixtures of local anaesthetics and corticosteroids combined with a home stretching exercise program, and the home stretching exercise program only. No significant post-treatment differences between the groups were found for pain and disability. In the high quality study by <LINK REF="STD-Marks-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Marks 1992</LINK> et al, facet joint injections with corticosteroids and lignocaine were compared with facet nerve blocks using similar medication. The facet joint injections provided slightly better pain relief than facet nerve blocks, although statistical significance was only reached at one month, not immediately post-treatment, at two weeks or three months (<LINK REF="STD-Marks-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Marks 1992</LINK>). In a low quality study, <LINK REF="STD-Fuchs-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Fuchs 2005</LINK> et al compared the effects of facet joint injections with sodium hyaluronate to similar injections with corticosteroids. No significant differences in pain relief, disability and quality of life between the groups were found at different follow-up points over a 180-day period.</P>
<P>There is limited evidence (1 trial; 84 patients) that facet joint injections consisting of corticosteroids, local anaesthetics and Sarapin are not more effective than similar injections, consisting of local anaesthetics and Sarapin, in influencing pain relief, overall health, physical, functional, psychological status and return-to-work at short- and long- term follow-up. There is limited evidence (1 trial; 70 patients) that facet joint injections with mixtures of corticosteroids and local anaesthetics combined with a home stretching exercise program are not more effective than a home stretching exercise program alone in providing long term effects on pain and disability. There is moderate evidence (1 trial; 86 patients) that facet joint injections with corticosteroids and local anaesthetics are not more effective in improving short- and long-term pain scores, disability scores and work attendance than facet nerve blocks using similar medication. There is limited evidence (1 trial; 60 patients) that facet joint injections with sodium hyalorunate are not more effective than similar injections with corticosteroids in providing short- and long- term pain relief, better function and improved quality of life.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-05-12 15:07:52 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The overall methodological quality of the studies included in this review was limited and only six of the 18 trials (<LINK REF="STD-Sonne-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Sonne 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Collee-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Collee 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carette-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Carette 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marks-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Marks 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Revel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Revel 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mauro-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mauro 2000</LINK>) showed significant results for at least one outcome at a follow-up time point in favour of one of the treatment arms. Four of these six studies reported effects that could be considered to be clinically important (<LINK REF="STD-Breivik-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Breivik 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mauro-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mauro 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Revel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Revel 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sonne-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Sonne 1985</LINK>). We conclude there is no strong evidence to support the use of any type of injection therapy (epidural, facet joint or local sites) for subacute or chronic-low-back pain in patients without radicular pain. In the earlier Cochrane review on this topic, <LINK REF="REF-Nelemans-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelemans 2000</LINK> et al also concluded that convincing evidence was lacking on the effects of injection therapy for low-back pain, which means that the general picture on the effectiveness of injection therapy has not changed since then. The scientific basis for these injections for low-back pain has not improved.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Nelemans-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelemans 2000</LINK> et al proposed several recommendations for future research. These recommendations involved the priority for placebo-controlled trials instead of trials that compared injections to other treatments, the need for methodologically sound RCTs, and more of a focus on long-term effects of the treatment instead of only short-term effects (<LINK REF="REF-Nelemans-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelemans 2000</LINK>). Among the 18 studies included in this review, seven new studies were covered in the present update (<LINK REF="STD-Mauro-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mauro 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Manchikanti-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Manchikanti 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Aldrete-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Aldrete 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lierz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lierz 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fuchs-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Fuchs 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Takada-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Takada 2005</LINK> ). Of these seven new studies, only <LINK REF="STD-Mauro-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mauro 2000</LINK> et al compared intramuscular Vitamin B12 with placebo injections, which resulted in a total of seven placebo-controlled versus 12 studies that compared injections to other treatments or to each other. </P>
<P>According to the methodological quality assessment, the new studies in this update had no higher methodological quality than the studies of the earlier review. On the contrary, the mean number of positive items was even lower (4.1 versus 6.3 positive scores; Table 2; Table 3) in this group of studies compared to the studies included in the earlier review. The most prevalent shortcomings, which were a lack of clarity regarding the concealment of random treatment allocation, no reporting of co-interventions and no reporting of an intention-to-treat analysis, could easily have been avoided and nowadays, researchers should be aware that these are generally accepted principles of methodological quality for studying the effectiveness of treatments. Only four out of the 18 studies included had outcome assessments performed at six months post-randomization and beyond (<LINK REF="STD-Rocco-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Rocco 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carette-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Carette 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Manchikanti-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Manchikanti 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fuchs-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Fuchs 2005</LINK>). The outcome assessments of the other studies were either performed post-treatment or at another short-term time interval. Of course, from a pharmacological standpoint, the agent under study may act upon the target tissue rather quickly, for example, by reducing inflammation. However, it is advantageous that the favourable effects on pain and disability will also stand at the longer term. Since the course of sub-acute and chronic low-back pain can be described as consisting of spontaneous remissions and exacerbations (<LINK REF="REF-Croft-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Croft 1998</LINK>) short-term effects of injections do not necessarily reflect a successful treatment result in clinical practice. Outcome measures which were used in the studies included visual analogues scales for pain relief and questions regarding self-perceived improvement or other outcomes. Only six studies used well-known and validated questionnaires for measuring disability (<LINK REF="STD-Rocco-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Rocco 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carette-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Carette 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Serrao-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Serrao 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mauro-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mauro 2000</LINK> ; <LINK REF="STD-Mayer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mayer 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fuchs-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Fuchs 2005</LINK>). </P>
<P>For the purpose of this review, we subdivided the studies according to injection sites (i.e. epidural, facet joint and local sites), to pharmaceutical agents (i.e. corticosteroids, anaesthetics and other agents) and according to the comparison that was made (i.e. placebo-controlled versus comparison of two or more treatments). By following this approach, our aim was to come up with groups that were clinically comparable without ending up with groups consisting of only one study. Despite the fact that this approach seemed logical, there were still differences among the studies that ended up in a group with regard to inclusion criteria, target tissue (e.g. intra-articular facet joint injections, peri-capsular facet joint injections and medial branch blocks), injection dosage, co-interventions, reference treatments and outcome measures. This should be kept in mind when reading the evidence statements in the results section of this paper. Furthermore, it should be emphasized that we only separated trials on the basis of whether the comparator was a placebo injection or other treatment. Other aspects of the studies, such as meticulous patient selection by diagnostic injections or experience and skills of the treatment providers were not assessed. <BR/>
<BR/>One of the main problems when studying the effects of injection therapy in low-back pain is the lack of diagnostic criteria for determining the injection site. According to our view, it is extremely difficult to accurately diagnose and determine the localisation of tissues that cause the pain and other symptoms. Some researchers have tackled this problem, for example, by only including patients for facet joint injections who responded positively to facet blocks with anaesthetics (<LINK REF="STD-Carette-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Carette 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Manchikanti-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Manchikanti 2001</LINK>) or patients with radiologically confirmed facet joint osteoarthritis (<LINK REF="STD-Fuchs-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Fuchs 2005</LINK>). From these three studies, only the study by <LINK REF="STD-Carette-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Carette 1991</LINK> et al had positive results. They showed significant effects for pain and the physical dimension of the Sickness Impact Profile in favour of a methylprednisolone group compared to a placebo group, even after six-month follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Carette-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Carette 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>The rationale behind the application of a particular pharmaceutical agent among the included studies was variable. In 13 studies, the effects of corticosteroids were investigated. This may be a reasonable choice since this agent aims to reduce inflammation. In four studies, the main pharmaceutical agent under study was anaesthetics (<LINK REF="STD-Collee-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Collee 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Revel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Revel 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lierz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lierz 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Takada-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Takada 2005</LINK>). The reason for choosing an injection with anaesthetics is not always immediately clear. Due to the relatively short duration of action of these pharmaceutical agents, they do not seem to be the first choice for pain relief in sub-acute and chronic patients. <LINK REF="STD-Lierz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lierz 2004</LINK> et al and <LINK REF="STD-Takada-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Takada 2005</LINK> et al compared the short- term analgesic effects of epidural blocks with ropivacaine and bupivacaine and found no significant differences between the groups. The authors of both studies explained that epidural blocks may provide analgesia to allow for exercise and active physiotherapy, thus facilitating more active therapies. <LINK REF="STD-Collee-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Collee 1991</LINK> et al compared a local injection of lignocaine versus saline into a tender point over the medial part of the iliac crest. The study authors state that the injection with lignocaine may somehow affect the ascending or sensory input and its varying modulating systems. However, no significant differences in improvement rates were found. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Revel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Revel 1999</LINK> et al was carried out from a diagnostic perspective. They compared facet joint injections with lidocaine to placebo injections in order to determine several clinical criteria which were predictive of significant relief of back pain after facet joint anaesthesia (<LINK REF="STD-Revel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Revel 1999</LINK>). Other applied pharmaceutical agents were: indomethacin (<LINK REF="STD-Aldrete-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Aldrete 2003</LINK>), sodium hyaluronate (<LINK REF="STD-Fuchs-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Fuchs 2005</LINK>), Sarapin (<LINK REF="STD-Manchikanti-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Manchikanti 2001</LINK>), morphine (<LINK REF="STD-Rocco-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Rocco 1989</LINK>) and Vitamin B12 (<LINK REF="STD-Mauro-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mauro 2000</LINK>). In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Mauro-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mauro 2000</LINK> et al, daily intramuscular injections for a two-week period with Vitamin B12 appeared to be effective for short-term pain and disability compared to placebo injections. </P>
<P>Half of the included studies reported side effects in small numbers of patients (see <I>Characteristics of included studies</I> table). These side effects ranged from headache, dizziness and transient local pain to nausea and vomiting. Although these are not life threatening complications and have only been reported in a limited number of patients, this does not mean that the application of injection therapy in low-back pain is always without risk. Rare but more serious complications of injection therapy have been mentioned in the literature, such as, cauda equina syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Bilir-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bilir 2006</LINK>), septic facet joint arthritis (<LINK REF="REF-Weingarten-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weingarten 2006</LINK>), discitis (<LINK REF="REF-Hooten-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hooten 2006</LINK>), paraplegia (<LINK REF="REF-Houten-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Houten 2002</LINK>) and paraspinal abscesses (<LINK REF="REF-Cook-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 1999</LINK>). In another study, it was found that eight out of 128 consecutive patients referred to a hospital with meningitis had a history of single or repeated injections for low-back pain one to three weeks before their hospital admission (<LINK REF="REF-Gaul-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gaul 2005</LINK>). Although the absolute frequency of these complications may be rare, these risks should be taken into consideration, especially given the fact that convincing evidence on the effects of injection therapy for low-back pain is still lacking. </P>
<P>Seven out of the 18 trials included in this review reported significant but short-lasting effects in favour of the intervention group, with interventions varying from facet joint injections with corticosteroids (<LINK REF="STD-Carette-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Carette 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mayer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mayer 2004</LINK>) and anaesthetics (<LINK REF="STD-Revel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Revel 1999</LINK>), epidural injections with corticosteroids (<LINK REF="STD-Breivik-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Breivik 1976</LINK>), local injections with anaesthetics (<LINK REF="STD-Sonne-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Sonne 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Collee-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Collee 1991</LINK>) to intramuscular injections with Vitamin B12 (<LINK REF="STD-Mauro-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mauro 2000</LINK>). The overall picture of the results of this review reveals that there is currently insufficient scientific evidence on the effects of injection therapy, regardless of type and dosage, for patients with subacute and chronic low-back pain. It is discouraging that the average methodological quality of the trials published since the earlier review has not improved while the validity criteria for effectiveness research have become more familiar to back pain researchers. Most studies dealt with heterogeneous groups of patients, which on average, may mask potential treatment effects. Therefore, we can not rule out that some type of injection therapy might be effective for a particular subgroup of patients. Therefore, accurate diagnostic criteria are needed. However, this remains merely a theoretical consideration, which is not based on the results of the present review. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Based on the current state of the literature there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of injection therapy, regardless of type and dosage, for patients with subacute and chronic low-back pain without radicular pain.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>We can not rule out that some type of injection therapy is effective for a particular subgroup of patients. More research is needed to study the accuracy of diagnostic criteria to identify which, if any, subgroups of patients are likely to respond to injection therapy and if established, the effectiveness of injection therapy for these subgroups. Corticosteroids seem to be the most logical therapeutic agent, while anaesthetics seem only useful for diagnostic purposes. If injection therapy turns out to be an effective treatment strategy for a subgroup of low-back pain patients, it has to be embedded in the current, widely supported active approach directed at reassurance and self management. </P>
