<P>No evidence that applying sprays, creams or powders are any better than keeping the baby's cord clean and dry at birth.</P>
<P>The umbilical cord connects the baby to its food and oxygen supply in the womb, and is clamped and cut at birth. The cord stump dries, shrivels and becomes black before falling off the baby's belly button, five to 15 days after birth. Without proper care, the baby may become infected through the stump. Usually the cord is kept clean and dry by loosely covering it with clean clothes. Hand washing is critical. The review found that not enough trials had been done to show if antiseptics or antibiotics were any better at keeping infection away. More research is needed.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Umbilical cord infection caused many neonatal deaths before aseptic techniques were used. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of topical cord care in preventing cord infection, illness and death.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (September 2003) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (<I>The Cochrane Library</I>, Issue 2, 2003). We also contacted experts in the field.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomized and quasi-randomized trials of topical cord care compared with no topical care, and comparisons between different forms of care.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers assessed trial quality and extracted data.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Twenty-one studies (8959 participants) were included, the majority of which were from high-income countries. No systemic infections or deaths were observed in any of the studies reviewed. No difference was demonstrated between cords treated with antiseptics compared with dry cord care or placebo. There was a trend to reduced colonization with antibiotics compared to topical antiseptics and no treatment. Antiseptics prolonged the time to cord separation. Use of antiseptics was associated with a reduction in maternal concern about the cord.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Good trials in low-income settings are warranted. In high-income settings, there is limited research which has not shown an advantage of antibiotics or antiseptics over simply keeping the cord clean. Quality of evidence is low.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-09-22 13:52:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>The umbilical cord which connects the baby and placenta <I>in utero </I>(the womb) is made of blood vessels and connective tissue. It is covered by a membrane which is bathed in amniotic fluid. After birth, cutting the cord physically and symbolically separates the mother and her baby. The cord stump dries, falls off and the wound heals. </P>
<P>As the umbilical stump dries, it shrivels turning black in colour. An area of separation forms between the drying cord and the abdominal wall in which polymorphonuclear leucocytes, a form of white blood cells, are present (<LINK REF="REF-OudesluysMurphy-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">OudesluysMurphy 1990</LINK>). During the normal separation process, material may collect at this junction which sometimes looks like pus and is often wrongly identified as an infection. The cord usually separates between five and 15 days after birth. Before the separation, the remaining stump can be considered to be a healing wound and thus a possible route for infection through the vessels into the baby's blood stream.</P>
<P>Soon after a normal delivery, the skin of the newborn baby including the umbilical stump is colonized mainly by non-pathogenic (non-infection causing) bacteria such as coagulase-negative <I>Staphylococci</I> and <I>Diphtheroid</I> bacilli. Pathogenic bacteria such as <I>Coliforms</I> and <I>Streptococci</I> may also be present on the skin (<LINK REF="REF-Sarkany-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sarkany 1967</LINK>) and can track up the umbilical stump causing infection. It is therefore essential to keep the cord clean.</P>
<P>An umbilical cord infection may be clinically obvious, but is also sometimes hidden. In frank infections, the cord may be swollen, the surrounding skin inflamed, or the cord may be 'smelly' if infected with anaerobic bacteria. Tracking of bacteria along the umbilical vessels is not obvious to the eye, but can cause septicaemia (blood poisoning), or result in other focal infections as a result of blood-borne spread such as septic arthritis (<LINK REF="REF-Cullen-1916" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cullen 1916</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Forshall-1957" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forshall 1957</LINK>). In such cases, affected babies may also present with fever, lethargy or poor feeding.</P>
<P>Cord cutting and care of the umbilical stump varies according to accepted practice and culture (<LINK REF="REF-Elhassani-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elhassani 1984</LINK>). In many parts of the world the cord is cut with unsterile tools such as used razors or scissors after which various substances are applied including charcoal, grease, cow dung or dried banana to speed up cord separation. These practices are important sources of bacterial infection and neonatal tetanus (<LINK REF="REF-Bennett-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meegan-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meegan 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>While there is a general agreement about the 'clean' technique for cutting the cord using a sterile cutting instrument (blade or scissors) and clean hands to avoid infection, there is less agreement on what is the best care of the cord stump. Most frequent modern practice is applying antiseptic agents to the cord (usually alcohol, silver sulphadiazine, iodine, chlorhexidine; and dyes such as triple dye, gentian violet, acriflavine and eozine). Some authorities recommend routine topical application of antibiotics, including bacitracin, neomycin, nitrofurazone, or tetracycline, or moisture absorbing powders. These may be used as solutions in water, alcohol, detergent or ointments. </P>
<P>A practice often forgotten is to do nothing other than keep the cord clean and dry without applying anything(<LINK REF="STD-Dore-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dore 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mugford-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Mugford 1986</LINK>). </P>
<P>Bathing the baby soon after birth with an antimicrobial such as hexachlorophene may reduce skin contamination. However, hexachlorophene is no longer recommended in new born babies as it is absorbed through the skin and is neurotoxic (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1998a</LINK>). Cord separation may be delayed by topical antimicrobials, premature delivery, caesarean section or low birthweight (<LINK REF="REF-Novack-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Novack 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-OudesluysMurphy-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">OudesluysMurphy 1987</LINK>) which can potentially increase the risk of bacterial entry. Delays in cord separation increase the midwives' workload in countries where there is a policy of continued home visits until cord separation (<LINK REF="STD-Mugford-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Mugford 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>Other practices can significantly contribute to preventing infection in the early neonatal period. Rooming-in (nursing babies in rooms with their mothers) has been shown to be protective to babies who become colonized with their mothers' non-pathogenic bacteria as opposed to other harmful micro-organisms. This is now widely practiced in high-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-Enkin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Enkin 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite the advent of asepsis (<LINK REF="REF-Cullen-1916" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cullen 1916</LINK>), umbilical cord infections continue to cause many deaths in neonates in low and middle-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1998a</LINK>). Contamination of the cord remains a common cause of neonatal tetanus in deprived populations (<LINK REF="REF-Thayaparan-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thayaparan 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Woodruff-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woodruff 1984</LINK>). Around 200,000 neonatal deaths (5%) that occur every year are the result of neonatal tetanus (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1998b</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-CHRPSR-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">CHRPSR 1999</LINK>). </P>
<P>The World Health Organization and others emphasize good hygiene at delivery, and promote good cord care practice. However, recommendations for cord care are often based on traditional assessments of published literature and opinion. The aim of this review is to provide data useful for identifying good practice in both high and low-income countries. The findings of the original review were incorporated in a review summarizing available consensus on best and appropriate practice (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1998a</LINK>). </P>

<P>To assess the effectiveness of topical cord care compared with no routine care, and comparisons between different forms of care, in preventing cord infection, illness and death.</P>
<P>In particular, to answer the following questions:<BR/>Is any intervention better than no routine cord care?</P>
<P>If so, which care is preferable:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Antiseptic or no antiseptic?</LI>
<LI>Antibiotic or no antibiotic?</LI>
<LI>Antibiotic or antiseptic?</LI>

<P>For any intervention, what is the optimal frequency, formulation and duration of application?</P>
<P>Hypotheses to be explored:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Cord antiseptics or antibiotics are effective in reducing neonatal infection and death when babies are nursed together in a nursery but are less likely to have an impact on health when babies are roomed-in or nursed at home.</LI>
<LI>When people are living in poverty such that basic hygiene at home delivery and postnatally is constrained, cord antiseptics or antibiotics are more likely to have an impact on serious illness or death in the neonate.</LI>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>There were few trials, considering the millions of newborns whose umbilical cords are treated with topical applications. All but two of the trials were conducted in high-income countries, despite the fact that most neonatal deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries where a significant proportion are due to tetanus associated with sub-optimal cord care. </P>
<P>Most of the trials did not report our outcomes of interest as well as factors affecting methodological quality. We were, therefore, not able to assess trial quality. Follow up was generally to cord separation and outcomes subsequent to this (such as bacterial infection, whether local or generalized) would not have been detected. One of the studies that routinely followed all infants up to six weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Meberg-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Meberg 1985</LINK>) showed relatively high levels of skin infections of various kinds, but there were no differences between the intervention and treatment group.</P>
<P>Over 40 different comparisons were seen with few trials using the same antiseptics or antibiotics. Meta-analysis was therefore limited to few outcomes. Antiseptics such as triple dye; alcohol; silver sulfadiazene; and povidone-iodine were used more frequently than antibiotics. This may be because their role is seen as more preventative than curative as antiseptics inhibit micro-organisms and don't necessarily kill them whereas antibiotics both inhibit and kill micro-organisms. Another important factor could be that antiseptics are cheaper than antibiotics. </P>
<P>Most trials reported on umbilical cord infections. They were rare. Information on disseminated infections as well as other topical infections (such as skin and eye infections) was limited. Death as an outcome was only reported in one study, which is probably because most of the trials were conducted in high-income countries were neonatal mortality rates are low.</P>
<P>Eleven studies examined colonization of the skin. Measurement and reporting of these outcomes varied between studies, and was sometimes difficult to interpret. Colonization was reduced with antibiotic and antiseptic use, but the clinical significance of skin colonization is not known.</P>
<P>There were trends towards shorter cord separation times with no topical care compared to antiseptics, and shorter separation times with powder preparations compared to no intervention. Multiple applications compared to single applications of triple dye prolonged cord separation time in one trial. The clinical impact of delays of cord separation is unknown, but it has social and cost implications: delay makes mothers anxious, and increases the number of domiciliary midwife visits to the home (<LINK REF="STD-Mugford-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Mugford 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two studies were on well preterm infants. Such infants are at higher risk of infection because of their prematurity and are also have a higher risk of nosocomial infections. Prematurity is associated with longer cord separation times but there was no difference when alcohol was compared to placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Bain-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Bain 1994</LINK>). One trial specifically looked at bacterial colonization by methicillin-resistant <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I> (MRSA) which was significantly reduced by triple dye compared with alcohol. None of the two trials reported on the potential risk of the topical antiseptic/antibiotic being absorbed systemically (percutaneous absorption) (<LINK REF="REF-Aggett-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aggett 1981</LINK>), which is associated with prematurity. As the trials were small, it is difficult to know how the findings relate to this particular subgroup of infants. Larger studies should be conducted in future.</P>
<P>Overall care fashions have changed over the period of the studies reviewed, and this is likely to impact on the comparative effectiveness of various interventions. For example, there has been a shift from nursery care to rooming-in high-income countries, thus reducing the risk of infection.</P>
<P>Much of the concern from mothers and health workers relates to uncertainty about the normal process of drying and separation, including appearance and odour of decomposing tissue. Interventions in the West mainly relate to modifying this process in some way. Oudesluys-Murphy et al described the histological findings during normal drying and separation of the umbilical stump and the perinatal factors modifying the process (<LINK REF="REF-OudesluysMurphy-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">OudesluysMurphy 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-OudesluysMurphy-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">OudesluysMurphy 1990</LINK>). Good research documenting the range of clinical variations of this normal process of cord separation is required. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Based on the studies meeting the inclusion criteria for this review, we are unable to be sure what is best practice for cord care in institutions and at home in high-income countries. Studies to date have insufficient evidence to know whether antiseptics or antibiotics have any additional advantage over keeping the cord clean and dry. Cord separation time with no topical care was shorter. Since home visits for cord care in developed countries may need to be frequent, earlier separation of the cord stump could decrease the need for the visits and thus reduce cost of postnatal care (<LINK REF="STD-Mugford-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Mugford 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>Some infants are at high risk of infection in hospital (such as premature babies or babies nursed on intensive care units). We identified two trials with premature babies. Given the higher risk of bacterial sepsis in these infants, use of antiseptics is unlikely to be harmful, and has the potential for reducing nosocomial infection by reducing umbilical cord and skin colonization.</P>
<P>This review provides no evidence on best cord care practice for settings where babies are at a higher risk of bacterial contamination of the cord such as those delivered in sub-optimal hygienic conditions either at home or in institutions in poor-resource countries or where harmful cord care practices prevail. Where the risk of bacterial infection appears high it might be prudent to use topical antiseptics. However, quality of evidence is not adequate to recommend the best antiseptic and the regimen for cord care. It would seem sensible, in situations where packages of care around improving umbilical cord sepsis are introduced, to conduct randomized comparisons to identify the best agents and regimens.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>In high-income countries, where mortality is very low, important outcomes must include infections in the first month of life, maternal satisfaction, and time to cord separation. There is a good argument to conduct a study of existing inexpensive interventions with no specific topical cord care. </P>
<P>In low- and middle- income countries, neonates have a much higher risk of infection resulting in serious illness or death. The cord probably remains an important portal for bacteria, as demonstrated by neonatal tetanus. However, we still do not know what is the best cord care: what are the most appropriate agents (alcohol, antiseptics or antibiotics; powders, solutions or ointments) for routine use, and how often they should be applied. Any agent should be easily available, inexpensive and easy to apply. We also do not know what the best method is for cleaning the cord area. Trials should also address the best ways for replacing harmful cord practices.</P>
<P>Trials in low- and middle- income countries should be part of a package of care promoting good hygiene at delivery and until the cord separation in deprived areas where hygiene remains a problem. Within such an intervention programme, groups of women could be randomized to receive different preparations for the cord. The first set of trials could compare water and soap with an antiseptic (such as chlorhexidine, iodine or powders). Harmful effects of antimicrobials such as effect of iodine on thyroide gland function and possible interference with neonatal screening for congenital hypothyroidism, should be taken into account.</P>
<P>One potential intervention for cord care is colostrum which has bacteriostatic properties and could be applied to the cord stump. No research has been done and future trials should consider using this as one intervention arm.</P>
