<P>Organised stroke unit care is a form of care provided in hospital by nurses, doctors and therapists who specialise in looking after stroke patients and work as a co-ordinated team. This review of 28 trials, involving 5855 participants, showed that patients who receive this care are more likely to survive their stroke, return home and become independent in looking after themselves. A variety of different types of stroke unit have been developed. The best results appear to come from those which are based in a dedicated ward.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-09-02 10:02:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the trials registers of the Cochrane Stroke Group (January 2013) and the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group (January 2013), MEDLINE (2008 to September 2012), EMBASE (2008 to September 2012) and CINAHL (1982 to September 2012). In an effort to identify further published, unpublished and ongoing trials, we searched 17 trial registers (January 2013), performed citation tracking of included studies, checked reference lists of relevant articles and contacted trialists.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-07-12 18:03:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 28 trials, involving 5855 participants, comparing stroke unit care with an alternative service. More-organised care was consistently associated with improved outcomes. Twenty-one trials (3994 participants) compared stroke unit care with care provided in general wards. Stroke unit care showed reductions in the odds of death recorded at final (median one year) follow-up (odds ratio (OR) 0.81, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.69 to 0.94; P = 0.005), the odds of death or institutionalised care (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.89; P = 0.0003) and the odds of death or dependency (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.90; P = 0.0007). Sensitivity analyses indicated that the observed benefits remained when the analysis was restricted to securely randomised trials that used unequivocally blinded outcome assessment with a fixed period of follow-up. Outcomes were independent of patient age, sex, initial stroke severity or stroke type, and appeared to be better in stroke units based in a discrete ward. There was no indication that organised stroke unit care resulted in a longer hospital stay.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-08-20 10:16:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Stroke patients who receive organised inpatient care in a stroke unit are more likely to be alive, independent, and living at home one year after the stroke. The benefits were most apparent in units based in a discrete ward. We observed no systematic increase in the length of inpatient stay.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-09-02 10:03:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-09-02 10:03:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Stroke is now the third leading cause of disability (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 2012</LINK>) and the second leading cause of mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Lozano-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lozano 2012</LINK>) worldwide. The global disease burden of stroke increased by 19% between 1990 and 2010 (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 2012</LINK>) and current projections estimate the number of deaths worldwide will rise to 6.5 million in 2015 and to 7.8 million in 2030 (<LINK REF="REF-Strong-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strong 2007</LINK>). Interventions that are applicable to a majority of stroke patients and that aim to reduce associated mortality and disability are essential.</P>
<P>During their initial illness, stroke patients are frequently admitted to hospital where they can receive care in a variety of ways and in a range of settings. Traditionally, the care of stroke patients was provided within departments of general (internal) medicine, neurology or medicine for the elderly where they would be managed alongside a range of other patient groups. A more-focused approach to the management of stroke patients in hospital has been developed.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-02-11 17:26:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Organised inpatient (stroke unit) care is a term used to describe the focusing of care for stroke patients in hospital under a multidisciplinary team who specialise in stroke management (<LINK REF="REF-SUTC-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">SUTC 1997a</LINK>). This concept is not new and its value has been debated for more than 20 years (<LINK REF="REF-Ebrahim-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ebrahim 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Garraway-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garraway 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Langhorne-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langhorne 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Langhorne-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langhorne 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Langhorne-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langhorne 2012</LINK>). In essence, the debate has concerned whether the perceived effort and cost of focusing the care of hospitalised stroke patients within specially organised units would be matched by tangible benefits for the patients receiving that care. In particular, would more patients survive and make a good recovery as a result of organised inpatient (stroke unit) care?</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-02-11 19:57:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A systematic review of all available trials (<LINK REF="REF-SUTC-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">SUTC 1997a</LINK>) previously described the range of characteristics of stroke unit care and addressed the question of whether improving the organisation of inpatient stroke care can bring about improvements in important patient outcomes. This review continues to be extended and updated within The Cochrane Library (<LINK REF="REF-SUTC-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">SUTC 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-SUTC-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">SUTC 2007</LINK>).</P>

<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2013-07-30 16:13:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess the effect of stroke unit care compared with alternative forms of care for people following a stroke.</P>
<P>Originally, there were four broad objectives for this systematic review. To establish:</P>
<OL>
<LI>the characteristic features of organised inpatient (stroke unit) care;</LI>
<LI>if organised inpatient (stroke unit) care could provide better patient outcomes than alternative forms of care;</LI>
<LI>if benefits were apparent across a range of patient groups;</LI>
<LI>if different approaches to organised stroke unit care were effective (in particular, we hypothesised that organised care would be more effective than that of general medical wards, but that different forms of organised care would achieve similar outcomes).</LI>
</OL>
<P>Within the current version of this review, we wished to establish whether the previous conclusions were altered by the inclusion of new outcome data from recent trials and further subgroup analyses based on patient and intervention characteristics. We have structured the review to allow the inclusion of future trials that address important questions about the optimal ways to organise stroke patient care.</P>

<P>We included all randomised controlled clinical trials that compared an organised system of inpatient (stroke unit) care with an alternative form of inpatient care. This was usually the contemporary conventional care but could include an alternative model of organised inpatient care (see <LINK TAG="CRIT_INTERVENTIONS" TYPE="SECTION">Types of interventions</LINK>). Previous versions of this review (<LINK REF="REF-SUTC-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">SUTC 1997a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-SUTC-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">SUTC 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-SUTC-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">SUTC 2007</LINK>) have included trials with quasi-random treatment allocation (such as bed availability or date of admission). However, in an effort to ensure this ongoing systematic review focuses on data from trials with strict randomisation procedures we excluded all quasi-randomised trials for this update.</P>

<P>Any person admitted to hospital who had suffered a stroke was eligible. We recorded the delay between stroke onset and hospital admission but did not use this as an exclusion criterion. We used a clinical definition of stroke: focal neurological deficit due to cerebrovascular disease, excluding subarachnoid haemorrhage and subdural haematoma.</P>

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2013-09-02 10:04:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Organised inpatient (stroke unit) care can be considered a complex organisational intervention comprising multidisciplinary staffing providing a complex package of care to stroke patients in hospital. In the original version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-SUTC-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">SUTC 1997a</LINK>), the primary question was whether organised inpatient (stroke unit) care could improve outcomes compared with the contemporary conventional care (usually in general medical wards). We have now modified the analyses in a minor way to reflect the emerging hierarchy of service organisation and to allow the comparison of 'more-organised' versus 'less-organised' services. We have done this because some recent trials have addressed new questions and included comparisons of two services both of which met the basic definition of organised (stroke unit) care and so could not really be described as conventional care. However, the original service descriptions used in this review (<LINK REF="REF-SUTC-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">SUTC 1997a</LINK>) indicated that service organisation could be considered as a hierarchy which, in descending order, was as follows.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Stroke ward: where a multidisciplinary team including specialist nursing staff based in a discrete ward cares exclusively for stroke patients. This category included the following subdivisions:</LI>
<OL>
<LI>acute stroke units that accept patients acutely but discharge early (usually within seven days); these appear to fall into three broad subcategories:</LI>
<OL>
<LI>'intensive' model of care with continuous monitoring, high nurse staffing levels and the potential for life support;</LI>
<LI>'semi-intensive' with continuous monitoring, high nurse staffing but no life support facilities; and</LI>
<LI>'non-intensive' with none of the above;</LI>
</OL>
<LI>rehabilitation stroke units that accept patients after a delay, usually of seven days or more, and focus on rehabilitation; and</LI>
<LI>comprehensive (ie combined acute and rehabilitation) stroke units that accept patients acutely but also provide rehabilitation for at least several weeks if necessary. Both the rehabilitation unit and comprehensive unit models offer prolonged periods of rehabilitation.</LI>
</OL>
<LI>Mixed rehabilitation ward: where a multidisciplinary team including specialist nursing staff in a ward provides a generic rehabilitation service but not exclusively caring for stroke patients.</LI>
<LI>Mobile stroke team: where a peripatetic multidisciplinary team (excluding specialist nursing staff) provides care in a variety of settings.</LI>
<LI>General medical ward: where care is provided in an acute medical or neurology ward without routine multidisciplinary input.</LI>

<P>The primary analysis examined death, dependency and the requirement for institutional care at the end of scheduled follow-up of the original trial (four trials subsequently extended follow-up). We categorised dependency into two groups where we took 'independent' to mean that an individual did not require physical assistance for transfers, mobility, dressing, feeding or toileting. We considered individuals who failed any of these criteria 'dependent'. The criteria for independence were approximately equivalent to a modified Rankin score of 0 to 2, or a Barthel Index of more than 18 out of 20 (<LINK REF="REF-Wade-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wade 1992</LINK>).

For this updated review, for which data were available only from published sources, two review authors (PF, PL) independently extracted data using a standard data extraction form.</P>
<P>We sought subgroup information primarily for the combined outcome of death or requiring institutional care. We obtained unpublished aggregated data for a majority of trials but insufficient amounts of individual patient data were available to allow a comprehensive individual patient data analysis.</P>
<P>We obtained subgroup data regarding the following participant groups (see <LINK REF="REF-SUTC-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">SUTC 1997a</LINK> for details):</P>
<OL>
<LI>age: up to 75 years or greater than 75 years;</LI>
<LI>sex: male or female;</LI>
<LI>stroke severity: dependency at the time of randomisation (usually within one week of the index stroke):</LI>

<P>For this updated review, the searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL identified 5478 records and from these and the searches of the Cochrane trials registers and other sources, we identified 18 new potentially eligible trials for consideration using the four selection criteria (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Service characteristics within organised (stroke unit) care and conventional care settings</HEADING>
<P>Descriptive information was available for all trials: in seven trials we had access to published information only (<LINK REF="STD-Birmingham-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Birmingham 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guangdong-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Guangdong 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guangdong-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Guangdong 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huaihua-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Huaihua 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hunan-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hunan 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Illinois-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Illinois 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-New-York-1962" TYPE="STUDY">New York 1962</LINK>), in two trials we had detailed unpublished information (<LINK REF="STD-Beijing-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Beijing 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Joinville-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Joinville 2003</LINK>) and in the remaining 19 trials a structured interview was carried out with the trial co-ordinator to determine the service characteristics.</P>
<P>Our original publication outlined the features of the stroke unit trials (<LINK REF="REF-SUTC-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">SUTC 1997a</LINK>). In summary, organised inpatient (stroke unit) care was characterised by: (1) co-ordinated multidisciplinary rehabilitation, (2) staff with a specialist interest in stroke or rehabilitation, (3) routine involvement of carers in the rehabilitation process and (4) regular programmes of education and training. Several factors indicating a more intensive or more comprehensive input of care were also associated with the stroke unit setting. Various service models of care exist (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>) but the core characteristics (<LINK REF="REF-SUTC-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">SUTC 1997a</LINK>) that were invariably included in the stroke unit setting were: (1) multidisciplinary staffing - that is medical, nursing and therapy staff (usually including physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, social work); and (2) co-ordinated multidisciplinary team care incorporating meetings at least once per week. Where both the services compared could satisfy the description of stroke unit care the more-organised system of care was taken as the index service.</P>
<P>Service comparisons within the 28 trials with outcome data are detailed in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>. The total number of comparisons is greater than the number of trials because in three trials participants could be randomised to one of two alternatives to stroke unit care; two of these trials used a stratified randomisation procedure (<LINK REF="STD-Nottingham-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Nottingham 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Orpington-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Orpington 1993</LINK>) and one did not (<LINK REF="STD-Dover-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Dover 1984</LINK>). In two small trials the conventional care (general medical) group also received some input from a specialist nurse (<LINK REF="STD-Illinois-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Illinois 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-New-York-1962" TYPE="STUDY">New York 1962</LINK>). Although this was not strictly general medical ward care, we have included this information since relatively little novel nursing input appears to have been available. The exclusion of these trials would not alter the conclusions of the systematic review substantially. In one trial, some participants appear to have been treated outside the rehabilitation wards (that is by peripatetic team care) but the number is unclear (<LINK REF="STD-New-York-1962" TYPE="STUDY">New York 1962</LINK>). This trial is currently classified as a mixed rehabilitation ward.</P>
<P>Of the four trials newly identified for this update, three compared a model of stroke unit care using integrated traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) (e.g. acupuncture and herbal remedies) versus standard 'Western medicine' stroke unit care (<LINK REF="STD-Guangdong-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Guangdong 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hunan-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hunan 2007</LINK>) or a general medical ward (<LINK REF="STD-Guangdong-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Guangdong 2009</LINK>); one trial compared a comprehensive stroke ward within a neurology unit with a general medical ward (<LINK REF="STD-Huaihua-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Huaihua 2004</LINK>). The duration of rehabilitation provided in all four newly identified trials was unclear and in only two trials was the timing of randomisation reported (<LINK REF="STD-Guangdong-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Guangdong 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huaihua-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Huaihua 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Of the 24 previously included trials, 22 incorporated rehabilitation lasting several weeks if required; 16 of these units admitted participants acutely and eight after a delay of one or two weeks. Two trials evaluated an acute stroke (semi-intensive) unit with no continuing rehabilitation. One trial proved difficult to categorise as it contained elements of an acute (semi-intensive) unit but offered some rehabilitation (<LINK REF="STD-Athens-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Athens 1995</LINK>). It is classified here as a comprehensive stroke unit. No trials evaluated an 'intensive care' model of stroke unit.</P>

The summary result indicated a significant reduction in the odds of the combined adverse outcomes of death or dependency (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.97; P &lt; 0.00001) with no significant heterogeneity.

Mean (or median) length of stay ranged from 11 to 162 days in the stroke unit groups and from 12 to 129 days in the control groups. Twelve trials reported a shorter length of stay in the stroke unit group and six a more prolonged stay. The calculation of a summary result for length of stay was subject to major methodological limitations: length of stay was calculated in different ways (for example acute hospital stay, total stay in hospital or institution), two trials recorded median rather than mean length of stay and in two trials the SD had to be inferred from the P value or from the results of similar trials. Overall, using a random-effects model, there was no significant reduction in the length of stay in the stroke unit group (SMD -0.15, 95% CI -0.32 to 0.02; P = 0.09). The summary estimate was complicated by considerable heterogeneity that limits the extent to which more general conclusions can be inferred.</P>
<P>We reanalysed results according to whether length of stay was defined as stay in acute hospital only or the total length of stay in a hospital or institution in the first year after stroke (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>).

Seven trials met all of these criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Goteborg_x002d_Sahlgren-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Goteborg-Sahlgren 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Groningen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Groningen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Helsinki-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Helsinki 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kuopio-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Kuopio 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Manchester-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Manchester 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nottingham-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Nottingham 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Orpington-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Orpington 2000</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Subgroup analyses by patient characteristics</HEADING>
<P>Predefined subgroup analyses were based on previous versions of this review (<LINK REF="REF-SUTC-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">SUTC 1997a</LINK>) and each subgroup analysis included data from at least nine trials (at least 1111 participants). These were based on participants' age, sex and initial stroke severity. For this updated version we have incorporated additional data based on pathological stroke type (ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke).

<P>Caution is needed when interpreting these subgroup analyses particularly as a relatively small number of outcome events were observed, which limits the statistical power. Furthermore, the results may change depending on the outcome chosen. These results indicate that in general the magnitude of benefit seemed greater for participants with more-severe stroke. However, stroke unit benefits are apparent across a range of participant subgroups (that is age, sex, initial stroke severity and stroke type). Analysis by stroke severity confirmed that there was no statistically significant reduction in case fatality in mild stroke patients (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.58). However, mild stroke patients managed in stroke units had a reduced risk of dependency (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.00).</P>

However, for the comparison of rehabilitation stroke wards or mobile team care (peripatetic service) versus general medical wards there were no statistically significant differences.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sections 3, 4, 5 and 6: Comparisons of different forms of organised stroke unit care</HEADING>
<P>In planning our analyses we specified in advance that an important question for service planning would be whether the benefits of stroke unit care depended upon the establishment of a ward dedicated only to stroke care (stroke ward) or could be achieved through a mobile stroke team or a generic disability service (mixed rehabilitation unit) that specialises in the management of disabling illness including stroke. We therefore analysed those trials that directly compared two different forms of organised stroke unit care that met the basic descriptive criteria of stroke unit care (see 'Description of Studies'): multidisciplinary staffing co-ordinated through regular team meetings.</P>
<P>Of the eight trials identified for which outcome data were available, one compared an acute (semi-intensive) stroke ward with a comprehensive stroke ward (<LINK REF="STD-Groningen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Groningen 2003</LINK>), one compared an acute (semi-intensive) stroke ward with a mixed rehabilitation ward (<LINK REF="STD-Tampere-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Tampere 1993</LINK>), one compared a stroke ward that combined acute care and rehabilitation (comprehensive stroke ward) with a general medical ward where care was co-ordinated by a multidisciplinary team (mobile team care) (<LINK REF="STD-Orpington-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Orpington 2000</LINK>), two compared a stroke ward with integrated TCM with a 'Western medicine' stroke ward (<LINK REF="STD-Guangdong-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Guangdong 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hunan-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hunan 2007</LINK>) and three incorporated designs in which patients could be randomised either to a stroke rehabilitation ward or to conventional care in either a general medical ward or mixed rehabilitation ward within a Department of Geriatric Medicine (<LINK REF="STD-Dover-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Dover 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nottingham-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Nottingham 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Orpington-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Orpington 1993</LINK>).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Main analysis</HEADING>
<P>The updated information in Section 1 confirms our previous observations that people receiving organised inpatient (stroke unit) care were more likely to survive, regain independence and return home than those receiving a less-organised service. This apparent effect remains of moderate statistical significance for case fatality. The conclusions could be overturned by a number of unpublished randomised trials with neutral results. However, the observed reductions in the combined adverse outcomes (death or institutionalisation, death or dependency) are much more robust statistically. The three trials that have extended follow-up for five or 10 years have found a sustained benefit among stroke unit patients.</P>
<P>The requirement for long-term care is a useful surrogate for disability (<LINK REF="REF-Barer-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barer 1993</LINK>) and is likely to show good inter-observer agreement. The absolute rates of institutionalisation, however, will be influenced by a variety of national and cultural factors. The combined adverse outcome of death or dependency is a more direct measure of patient outcome, but is subject to potential observer bias where final assessments were not carried out in a blinded manner. The sensitivity analysis based on those trials that used an unequivocally blinded assessment suggested that such bias has not seriously influenced the results.</P>
<P>The analysis of length of stay is complicated by the different methods of reporting results, the widely varying control group lengths of stay and the statistically significant heterogeneity between different trials. The most reasonable conclusion appears to be that there was no systematic increase in length of stay associated with organised (stroke unit) care and there may have been a modest reduction.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analyses</HEADING>
<P>In any discussion of the comparison of results in different subgroups it is worth bearing in mind that the main issue is not whether a subgroup result is statistically different from zero but whether there is statistically significant heterogeneity between the estimates of effect in each of the relevant subgroups. Our analyses are limited by relatively low statistical power and so must be interpreted with great caution. The subgroup analyses indicate that the observed benefits of organised stroke unit care are not limited to any one subgroup of patients or models of stroke unit organisation that were examined. Apparent benefits were seen in people of both sexes, aged under and over 75 years, with ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke and across a range of stroke severities.</P>
<P>The apparent relation between stroke severity and outcome must be interpreted with caution. People with more severe stroke symptoms are at greater risk of death or requiring institutional care and hence stand to gain more from treatment. Patients with a mild stroke appeared to benefit from stroke unit care when death or dependency was the chosen outcome (<LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>), but this effect was less certain for the outcomes of death, or death or institutional care. Two approaches to stroke unit care, that is comprehensive units and mixed assessment/rehabilitation units, tended to be more effective than care in a general medical ward. There was a similar trend for rehabilitation stroke units. However, mobile stroke care appeared to have a more neutral effect. Apparent benefits were seen in units with acute admission policies as well as those with delayed admission policies and in units which could offer a period of rehabilitation lasting several weeks.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison of different types of stroke unit care</HEADING>
<P>Results Sections 3 to 6 of the review focused on those trials that directly compared two different forms of care, both of which met our basic definition of organised inpatient (stroke unit) care: multidisciplinary team care co-ordinated through regular meetings. The results of this analysis indicate statistically significantly improved results from a dedicated stroke ward over a mobile stroke team. There were also trends towards better outcomes within the dedicated stroke rehabilitation ward setting as opposed to the mixed rehabilitation ward, and within the acute (semi-intensive) ward as opposed to the comprehensive ward. However, in none of the three primary outcomes was there a convincing statistically significant result and more information is required. No firm conclusions could be drawn for the comparisons of a stroke ward integrated with TCM versus a 'Western medicine' stroke ward or an acute (semi-intensive) ward with a mixed rehabilitation unit.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Costs and benefits</HEADING>
<P>Stroke units appear to improve outcomes, but at what cost? In cost terms, length of stay is likely to dominate any individual component of acute patient care and rehabilitation. Longer-term costs are likely to be dominated by the need for nursing care. Studies from several developed countries (<LINK REF="REF-Warlow-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warlow 2008</LINK>) have shown that fixed costs (particularly nursing staff salaries) account for over 90% of spending on people with acute stroke. Remedial therapy represents only a small proportion of the total cost of hospitalisation. In one analysis, stroke unit care was not clearly associated with an increase in total health and social care costs, but these conclusions were sensitive to some variations in cost estimates (<LINK REF="REF-Major-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Major 1998</LINK>). More research is required to elucidate the cost implications of stroke units.</P>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-09-02 10:34:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our original systematic review of organised inpatient (stroke unit) care (<LINK REF="REF-SUTC-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">SUTC 1997a</LINK>) addressed the question of whether improving the organisation of inpatient stroke care could bring about important improvements in patient outcomes in comparison with the contemporary conventional care. This analysis has now been extended and updated in Section 1 to reflect the comparison of 'more-organised' versus 'less-organised' care. We have done this because some recent trials have included service comparisons where a stroke unit service based in a stroke ward was compared with a less-organised alternative service (such as mixed rehabilitation ward or mobile stroke team) that was not strictly conventional care. This approach to analysis allows one to view all service comparisons before focusing on various subgroup comparisons.</P>
<P>This update includes four new trials (763 participants), but the overall conclusions remain unaltered in comparison with previous versions. The review now summarises data from a total of 28 trials (5855 participants) from 12 countries in Asia, Australasia, Europe, North America and South America. The majority of trials have been performed in high-income countries; the applicability of stroke unit care in low- or middle-income countries is less clear (<LINK REF="REF-Langhorne-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langhorne 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>As discussed, our subgroup analyses suggest the benefits of organised inpatient (stroke unit) care are seen across a wide range of stroke patients. This is supported by evidence from observational studies of stroke unit care (<LINK REF="REF-Seenan-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seenan 2007</LINK>), which have established that stroke units can operate effectively in routine settings beyond a specialised research environment. The current analysis does not explain how stroke units may improve patient outcomes. This could be due to greater staff expertise, better diagnostic procedures, better nursing care, early mobilisation, the prevention of complications or more effective rehabilitation procedures (<LINK REF="REF-Langhorne-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langhorne 1998</LINK>).</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-09-02 10:34:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The quality of evidence in this updated review has been made more uniform by the exclusion of several quasi-randomised prospective controlled clinical trials that were previously included in the data synthesis (see <LINK TAG="STUDY_DESCRIPTION" TYPE="SECTION">Description of studies</LINK>). The main reason for this change was to simplify the inclusion criteria for this and future updates. However, it is worth noting that the exclusion of these trials did not affect the overall estimate of treatment effect.</P>
<P>We judged some trials to be at high risk of bias due to poor allocation concealment and unblinded outcome assessment; in others, these important methodological aspects were not clearly reported making a judgement of risk of bias difficult. The improvement in survival observed with stroke unit care no longer remained statistically significant in sensitivity analyses restricted to the seven trials at low risk of bias. It is possible that methodological limitations within the trials led to an overestimation of the effect size for this outcome. It is reassuring that effect sizes for the composite adverse outcomes of death or institutionalisation or death or dependency remained largely unaltered.</P>
<P>We recognise that some of the included trials are relatively old, possibly with entirely different standards of care from those used currently. Similarly, although a majority of included trials were fairly recent, most would still have been undertaken in an era without routine access to intravenous thrombolysis for acute stroke. While essentially all stroke patients would be eligible for admission to a stroke unit, only a small proportion would be eligible for treatment with thrombolysis even in the most established acute centres. Moreover, all included trials were randomised, therefore any differences in the standard of care should not have had a confounding effect on the final conclusions.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-09-02 10:34:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Through a comprehensive search strategy and established connections with other researchers in the field we are confident that we have identified all potentially relevant studies. We did not search the Chinese databases. However, we were unable to classify or obtain useable outcome data for seven of the 11 Chinese studies we did identify for this update (<LINK REF="STD-Anhui-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Anhui 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-China-_x0028_Hao_x0029_-2010" TYPE="STUDY">China (Hao) 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-China-_x0028_Pei_x0029_-2011" TYPE="STUDY">China (Pei) 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-China-_x0028_Wang_x0029_-2008" TYPE="STUDY">China (Wang) 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-China-_x0028_Wu_x0029_-2007" TYPE="STUDY">China (Wu) 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haikou-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Haikou 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shanghai-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Shanghai 2006</LINK>). We recognise that the absence of data from these studies in our meta-analysis could potentially introduce bias.</P>
<P>Methodological limitations may also have influenced the analysis of descriptive information about service organisation (<LINK REF="REF-SUTC-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">SUTC 1997a</LINK>). We collated service descriptions retrospectively through discussion with the trialists who ran the organised (stroke unit) care. Our findings may therefore be biased towards the expectations of the trialists and by a tendency to discuss the results with the trialists who ran the organised stroke unit care more so than with those who ran the conventional care. At best, this represents a strictly factual account of service characteristics; at worst, it represents a consensus view of the trialists about which features of stroke unit care were effective.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-09-02 10:35:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>People with acute stroke are more likely to survive, return home and regain independence if they receive organised inpatient (stroke unit) care. This is typically provided by a co-ordinated multidisciplinary team operating within a discrete stroke ward that can offer a substantial period of rehabilitation if required. There are no firm grounds for restricting access according to a person's age, sex, stroke severity or pathological stroke type (that is ischaemic or haemorrhagic).</P>
<P>Since the original publication of this review, stroke services in many developed countries have undergone substantial reorganisation in line with national strategies and clinical practice guidelines to enable improvements in access to stroke unit care. More recently, stroke services in many countries have been further reorganised to reflect a two-tiered (or hub-and-spoke) model of care in which a central 'comprehensive stroke centre' (or 'hyper-acute stroke unit') is equipped with facilities for acute intravenous or intra-arterial treatments, intensive monitoring, advanced imaging and neurosurgery. These then serve a number of 'primary stroke centres' or stroke units within a hospital network or geographical location. Although this approach seems almost intuitive to many stroke clinicians, it has never been formally tested in randomised controlled trials. Until such trials are available, stroke services should ensure that every stroke patient receives the core service characteristics identified in the randomised trials.</P>

<P>Future trials should focus on examining the potentially important components of stroke unit care and direct comparisons of different models of organised stroke unit care, particularly with regard to the hyper-acute stroke unit model. In low-income healthcare settings, appropriately powered clinical trials could help define how barriers to the establishment of stroke units could be overcome (<LINK REF="REF-Langhorne-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langhorne 2012</LINK>). Outcome measures should not only include the outcomes of death, dependency and institutionalisation, but also domains of patient satisfaction, quality of life and cost. Pre-planned collaboration between comparable trials could alleviate some of the problems of retrospective systematic reviews such as ensuring that similar variables and outcomes are recorded in any new trial.</P>
<P>Anyone carrying out a relevant randomised trial of a stroke service component is invited to contact Peter Langhorne regarding a future collaborative review.</P>

<P>The 95% CI includes 1.0 for patients with mild stroke. I would conclude that for this subgroup, there is no significant benefit insofar as preventing death or institutional care. I certify that I have no affiliations with or involvement in any organisation or entity with a direct financial interest in the subject matter of my criticisms.<BR/>Don Hess 2000-09-12 16:05</P>
<P>Criticism editor summary<BR/>Regarding the outcome 'death or institutional care' for patients with mild stroke, the 95% CIs around the odds ratio suggest that stroke unit care is not beneficial in this subgroup of patients. This is not made clear in the review's abstract, results and discussion.</P>

<FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2013-09-02 10:52:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Thank you for your comment. The proper test in a subgroup analysis is not whether a subgroup result is statistically different from zero but whether there is statistically significant heterogeneity between the estimates of effect in each of the relevant subgroups. In our subgroup analysis the mild stroke patient group does indeed have CIs which include no effect (odds ratio = 1.0). However, we do not believe we can at present conclude that this subgroup of patients have a different result from the totality of patients. First, the statistical power of this analysis is limited because the mild stroke subgroup had relatively few outcome events (death or institutional care). Second, the mild stroke subgroup result is not significantly different from that of the moderate and severe subgroups. These analyses are explored in more detail in Stroke Unit Trialists' Collaboration. How do stroke units improve patient outcomes? A collaborative systematic review of the randomised trials.

<P>Dr Zekowski is correct. There appears to have been an error when updating the review. In the abstract the correct OR for death should be (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.94; P = 0.005). This has now been corrected in the text.</P>

<P>To my knowledge, there are no published randomized controlled trials directly comparing long term health outcome in patients managed at defined stroke units with that of conventional care. I would much appreciate if you can comment on this and also refer med to scientific articles estimating the 'number needed to care for' (analogous to number needed to treat in RCTs) regarding various health outcomes as well as health care utilization effects in stroke patients.</P>
</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2017-01-06 12:00:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Thank you for your recent feedback submission on the stroke unit review. I will address your queries in turn.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Long-term health outcomes: to my knowledge three randomised trials (<LINK REF="STD-Trondheim-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Trondheim 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Athens-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Athens 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nottingham-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Nottingham 1996</LINK>) carried out a 5- and 10-year follow-up of all participants. However, this is limited to a few fundamental outcomes (death, place of residence, disability). As you can imagine almost all participants were dead or disabled at 10-year follow-up. There is very limited information on other outcomes.</LI>
<LI>Estimation of 'number needed to care for': I cannot reference a recent scientific article addressing your specific question. However, it is possible to calculate this information relatively easily from the current Cochrane review. For instance, in table 2.1 (Organised stroke unit care versus general medical ward) the absolute risk difference in deaths is -3 per 100 cared for (95% confidence interval -6 to -1). This translates into a number needed to care for of 33. The equivalent number needed to treat to avoid death or institutional care and death or disability are 20 and 17 respectively.</LI>
<LI>Other health outcomes (such as ADL score or quality of life) are not often reported in the trials. Where they are they tend to favour stroke unit care.</LI>
<LI>Information on health utilisation: once again healthcare utilisation has been measured different ways in different trials. Overall, stroke unit patients tended to have a shorter length of stay in hospital and length of stay is the main driver of costs in hospital. Several independent analyses have modelled potential healthcare utilisation effects of stroke unit care. Most have concluded that stroke unit costs are equivalent or slightly lower than general medical costs.</LI>
