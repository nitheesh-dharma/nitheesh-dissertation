<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Urinary incontinence is a common consequence of stroke and has many causes. In early stroke rehabilitation, structured assessment and management of care shows promise in reducing the number of people with urinary incontinence. In the later phases of stroke recovery the use of specialist advisors may be helpful in reducing symptoms associated with urinary incontinence. Even late after stroke, interventions targeted at specific causes of incontinence may be helpful. Unfortunately, all the conclusions were limited by a lack of robust information.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Urinary incontinence can affect 40-60% of people admitted to hospital after a stroke, with 25% still having problems on hospital discharge and 15% remaining incontinent at one year. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the optimal methods for treatment of urinary incontinence after stroke in adults.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Incontinence and Stroke Groups specialised registers (searched 15 March 2007 and 5 March 2007 respectively), CINAHL (January 1982 to January 2007), national and international trial databases for unpublished data, and the reference lists of relevant articles. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials evaluating the effects of interventions designed to promote continence in people after stroke.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data extraction and quality assessment were undertaken by two reviewers working independently. Disagreements were resolved by a third reviewer.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Twelve trials with a total of 724 participants were included in the review. Participants were from a mixture of settings, age groups and phases of stroke recovery. </P>
<P>Behavioural interventions<BR/>Three trials assessed behavioural interventions, such as timed voiding and pelvic floor muscle training. All had small sample sizes and confidence intervals were wide.</P>
<P>Specialised professional input interventions<BR/>Two trials assessed variants of professional input interventions. Results tended to favour the intervention groups: in a small trial in early rehabilitation, fewer people had incontinence at discharge from hospital after structured assessment and management than in a control group (1/21 vs. 10/13; RR 0.06, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.43); in the second trial, assessment and management by Continence Nurse Advisors was associated with fewer participants having urinary symptoms (48/89 vs. 38/54; RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.99) and statistically significantly more being satisfied with care.</P>
<P>Complementary therapy interventions<BR/>Three small trials all reported fewer participants with incontinence after acupuncture therapy (overall RR 0.44; 95% 0.23 to 0.86), but there were particular concerns about study quality.</P>
<P>Pharmacotherapy and hormonal interventions<BR/>There were three small trials that included groups allocated meclofenoxate, oxybutinin or oestrogen. There were no apparent differences other than in the trial of meclofenoxate where fewer participants had urinary symptoms in the active group than in the control group (9/40 vs. 27/40; RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.62).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Data from the available trials are insufficient to guide continence care of adults after stroke. However, there was suggestive evidence that professional input through structured assessment and management of care and specialist continence nursing may reduce urinary incontinence and related symptoms after stroke. Better quality evidence is required of the range of interventions that have been suggested for continence care after stroke.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-30 15:17:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Urinary incontinence is defined as the complaint of any involuntary leakage of urine (<LINK REF="REF-Abrams-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abrams 2002</LINK>). 40-60% of people admitted to hospital after a stroke can have problems with urinary incontinence, with 25% of stroke survivors still having problems on hospital discharge, and 15% remaining incontinent after one year (<LINK REF="REF-Barrett-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barrett 2001</LINK>). Not all the studies reviewed by <LINK REF="REF-Barrett-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barrett 2001</LINK> excluded people with pre-morbid incontinence, however, so figures presented may include old as well as new cases. Addressing problems with continence whilst the person is still in hospital may prevent long-term problems for the patient and family. </P>
<P>The more severe the stroke, the greater is the likelihood of urinary incontinence (<LINK REF="REF-Burney-1996a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burney 1996a</LINK>). Other risk factors for urinary incontinence include older age, female sex, speech difficulties, motor weakness, visual field defects or cognitive impairment (<LINK REF="REF-Barrett-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barrett 2001</LINK>). Problems experienced may range from urinary retention to complete incontinence. The most likely pattern of incontinence is urinary frequency, urgency (a sudden compelling desire to pass urine which is difficult to defer) and urge incontinence (involuntary leakage) (<LINK REF="REF-Marinkovic-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marinkovic 2001</LINK>). This is generally the result of detrusor overactivity (<LINK REF="REF-Arunabh-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arunabh 1993</LINK>), although this may depend on the site of the stroke lesion (<LINK REF="REF-Burney-1996b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burney 1996b</LINK>). </P>
<P>Damage to the frontal lobe, the area believed to be responsible for control of micturition, has been identified in several studies as associated with urinary dysfunction after stroke. However, evidence suggests that the size of the lesion, rather than its location, is more likely to predict urinary incontinence (<LINK REF="REF-Brittain-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brittain 1999</LINK>). It is unclear whether incontinence is a direct (i.e. site of brain lesion) or indirect (e.g. functional impairment preventing access) consequence of stroke. Other non-neurological factors contributing to urinary incontinence, including pre-morbid continence state, sphincter incompetence and polyuria (<LINK REF="REF-Barrett-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barrett 2001</LINK>), are regarded as prevalent in the population of patients with stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Brittain-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brittain 1998b</LINK>). </P>
<P>Because of their severity, the symptoms of urinary incontinence are reported to have more of an effect on the lives of stroke survivors, when compared with other groups of people with incontinence (<LINK REF="REF-Brittain-2000b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brittain 2000b</LINK>). Urinary symptoms had more impact on sleep, daily activities, quality of life, physical discomfort, social life and relationships. Incontinence is not just a physical problem, but impacts on what people can do and how they feel. Depression is twice as common in stroke survivors who are incontinent (<LINK REF="REF-Brittain-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brittain 1998a</LINK>). Urinary incontinence is distressing for both those affected and their carers (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 1993</LINK>). </P>
<P>Continuing incontinence is associated with poor outcome in both stroke survivor and carer (<LINK REF="REF-Nakayama-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nakayama 1997</LINK>). Conversely, stroke outcome is better in those stroke survivors who remain continent or regain continence (<LINK REF="REF-Barer-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barer 1989</LINK>). Improvement is common over time (<LINK REF="REF-Marinkovic-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marinkovic 2001</LINK>), which suggests that problems with continence may be transient in some stroke survivors, and/or amenable to intervention. Factors predicting early improvements in continence status are less impairment on admission, and the site of the stroke lesion (<LINK REF="REF-Ween-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ween 1996</LINK>). Factors associated with poor recovery of continence include stroke type and being aged 75 or over (<LINK REF="REF-Patel-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 2001</LINK>). </P>
<P>Incontinence is a strong predictor of stroke functional outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Meijer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meijer 2003</LINK>). While there are problems with attributing better stroke outcome to improvements in continence, it is possible that recovery from incontinence may improve morale and self esteem and therefore speed overall stroke recovery (<LINK REF="REF-Barer-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barer 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Patel-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 2001</LINK>). While differences in incontinence rates between centres will reflect difference in the case mix of individuals and the methods of reporting (<LINK REF="REF-Barrett-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barrett 2001</LINK>), they might also indicate variations in the processes of continence assessment and management.</P>
<P>It is known that early rehabilitation intervention in stroke results in better outcome overall (<LINK REF="REF-Cifu-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cifu 1999</LINK>). Some of the studies on which this conclusion is based have included incontinence as a measure of functional outcome. For example, a trial of a multidisciplinary rehabilitation intervention aiming to improve functional independence after stroke showed a positive impact on incontinence rates (<LINK REF="REF-Wikander-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wikander 1998a</LINK>). Other management techniques include biofeedback, pelvic floor muscle training, electrical stimulation, drug treatments, surgical interventions and mechanical devices. </P>
<P>Current guidelines for the management of urinary incontinence recommend an assessment to guide management (<LINK REF="REF-Thuroff-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thuroff 1999</LINK>). This begins with physical assessment and history-taking including identification of urological problems before the stroke occurred, such as bladder outlet obstruction in men or stress incontinence in women. The choice of method to promote continence will then depend on the individual's history and type of incontinence. Bladder training and/or anticholinergic drugs may be appropriate for urge incontinence, while problems with retention may require intermittent catheterisation. Alternatively, problems with memory loss or restriction of movement may benefit more from toileting assistance programmes such as prompted or timed voiding or habit retraining (<LINK REF="REF-Eustice-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eustice 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ostaszkiewicz-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ostaszkiewicz 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ostaszkiewicz-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ostaszkiewicz 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roe-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roe 2007</LINK> ).</P>
<P>A systematic review of methodologically robust studies - randomised controlled trials - is needed to identify interventions to promote continence that are effective in the stroke population. Trials that have evaluated different management strategies also need to be reviewed in relation to subgroups of stroke patients with specific patterns of incontinence, because the effects of management are likely to depend on the type of stroke that the person has suffered and the urinary problems they experienced.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this review was to determine the optimal methods for the treatment of urinary continence after stroke in adults. </P>
<P>The following hypotheses were addressed:<BR/>1. intervention is more effective than no intervention; <BR/>2. intervention is more effective than placebo; <BR/>3. a specific intervention is more effective in comparison with another intervention;<BR/>4. combined interventions are more effective than single interventions.</P>
<P>Within each hypothesis, interventions were considered within four categories:<BR/>1. behavioural interventions<BR/>2. specialised professional input interventions<BR/>3. complementary therapy interventions<BR/>4. pharmacotherapy interventions.</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>All randomised and quasi-randomised trials evaluating the effects of interventions designed to promote continence in people who have had a stroke. Quasi-random methods include: allocation by the person's date of birth, by the day of the week or month of the year, by a person's medical record number, or just allocating every alternate person.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Adults (i.e. 18 years of age and over) with a diagnosis of stroke, including people with incontinence who have had a stroke identified as a subgroup within a larger group for whom relevant data are reported. </P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>One arm of the study must include an intervention designed to promote urinary continence. Trials evaluating any of the following were included in the review:</P>
<UL>
<LI>pharmacotherapy e.g. anticholinergics, adrenergics, hormonal treatment;</LI>
<LI>physical therapy e.g. electrical stimulation, biofeedback;</LI>
<LI>physical aids e.g. catheters, pads, pessaries, other appliances;</LI>
<LI>behavioural interventions e.g. prompted or scheduled voiding, bladder training, habit retraining (i.e. identification of voiding pattern and development of an individualised toileting schedule), pelvic floor muscle training or other behavioural management programmes;</LI>
<LI>environmental or lifestyle interventions e.g. voiding position, diet and fluid management, alternative communication devices;</LI>
<LI>specialised professional input interventions e.g. provision of information or education, assessment schedules, generic multidisciplinary rehabilitation programmes, Continence Advisors, home-support programmes, nurse practitioners;</LI>
<LI>complementary interventions e.g. homeopathy, acupuncture.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>Trials relating solely to surgical or physical interventions for pre-existing continence problems that are not associated with stroke (e.g. transurethral resection of the prostate) were excluded, unless it was a co-intervention in a wider trial testing an included method of continence promotion. Trials relating to urological diagnosis, or to the management of incontinence or retention of urine in the acute phase of stroke were also excluded. The acute phase was defined as up to one month post stroke. Studies were excluded if solely in the acute phase because the aim of intervention is commonly to contain incontinence, monitor urine output and prevent adverse events, rather than promote continence. </P>

<P>The review used the search strategies developed for both the Cochrane Incontinence Group and the Cochrane Stroke Group. Relevant trials were initially identified from the Groups' specialised registers of controlled trials described under the groups' details in <I>The Cochrane Library </I>(<A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clabout/articles/INCONT/frame.html">For more details please see the &#8216;Specialized Register&#8217; section of the Incontinence Group&#8217;s module in The Cochrane Library</A>) (<A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/cochrane_clsysrev_crglist_fs.html">For details of the Stroke Group's Specialised Register please see the 'Specialized Register' section of their module</A>). The dates of the most recent searches of the registers for this review update were conducted on 15 March 2007 (Stroke Register) and 5 March 2007 (Incontinence Register).</P>
<P>To search the Stroke Group register the following search terms were used: "incontinence (urine/faecal) or (nursing and bladder care) or urinary retention or urinary tract infection".</P>

<P>Due to the comprehensive nature of the searches already performed by the Cochrane Stroke Group, no additional searches were performed other than on CINAHL, combining stroke terms with terms for urinary incontinence without a research methods filter. The search was combined with the CINAHL search from the Cochrane Stroke Group. This was done because of the potentially poor indexing of nursing research. The CINAHL search covered the years January 1982 to January 2007 (on Dialog Datastar). More details, including search terms are given in <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>Recent unpublished trial data were also searched for on national and international databases i.e. NHS National Research Register, NHS Research Findings Register, US Community of Science NIH Grants, MetaRegister of Controlled Clinical Trials and CRISP, by adapting terms drawn from the existing search strategies of the Incontinence and Stroke Review Groups.</P>

<P>Data extraction forms, based on the protocol, were piloted and checked for the coding of intervention, outcome and quality assessment. Data extraction and review of the methodological quality of the eligible studies was independently conducted by two reviewers for each study (SC, BF, ML, LT) using the quality assessment tool described by the Cochrane Incontinence Review Group. Extracted data and quality assessment were cross checked and any disagreements discussed and if necessary resolved by a third reviewer (LT). </P>
<P>Attempts were made to obtain missing data, as well as data collected but not reported, by contacting trialists. </P>
<P>Outcomes are reported as unfavourable events. Planned subgroup analyses for the effect of urological diagnosis (i.e. detrusor overactivity versus other) and time from stroke onset (1 to 6 months, greater than 7 months) were not possible as the data were not available in the original studies. Included trial data were processed as described in the Cochrane Authors' Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2006</LINK>), and analysed using the statistical analysis package RevMan Analyses. Effect estimates for continuous outcomes were summarised using weighted mean difference (WMD) and dichotomous outcomes were summarised using relative risk (RR). Where deemed appropriate, effects were summarised across studies using fixed or random effects meta-analysis techniques appropriate to the form of the data. Random effects meta-analysis (DerSimonian and Laird method) was used if the studies showed heterogeneity (defined by the studies' effects having an I-squared statistic of greater than 50%), otherwise a fixed effect analysis (Mantel-Haenszel for dichotomous and inverse variance for continuous data) was used. For continuous outcome data, if change from baseline data were available, these were used; otherwise the raw outcome data were used.</P>

<P>Diagnostic criteria for incontinence were given in only two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Brittain-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Brittain 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tibaek-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tibaek 2005</LINK>). Four trials specified a urological diagnosis, given as normal urodynamic studies (<LINK REF="STD-Gelber-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Gelber 1997a</LINK>), bladder hyperreflexia (<LINK REF="STD-Gelber-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Gelber 1997b</LINK>), urge incontinence (<LINK REF="STD-Lewis-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Lewis 1990</LINK>) and urge, stress and mixed stress/urge incontinence (<LINK REF="STD-Tibaek-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tibaek 2005</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Judge-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Judge 1969</LINK> reported data for two groups of participants defined as mildly or severely incontinent. <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2006</LINK> reported data for three groups of participants, classified according to the Barthel continence item: completely incontinent, partially incontinent and independent. <LINK REF="STD-Chu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Chu 1997</LINK> included participants who had "urinary frequency or urinary incontinence" but did not define urinary frequency further. Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Brittain-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Brittain 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wikander-1998b" TYPE="STUDY">Wikander 1998b</LINK>) did not include a urological diagnosis for participants, or group them by type of incontinence.</P>
<P>The trial by <LINK REF="STD-Tibaek-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tibaek 2005</LINK> stated that participants must be diagnosed according to the World Health Organisation definition of ischaemic stroke verified by CT scan.

Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2003</LINK>) included only participants with infarction, and the site of infarction is specified for all participants in the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2002</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Judge-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Judge 1969</LINK> included participants with cerebrovascular accident or "multiple little strokes". <LINK REF="STD-Brittain-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Brittain 2000a</LINK> included participants who self-reported that they had had a stroke, subarachnoid haemorrhage or transient ischaemic attack on a screening questionnaire. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Wikander-1998b" TYPE="STUDY">Wikander 1998b</LINK>) included side of stroke lesion in baseline comparison between groups.</P>
<P>It was not possible in all but one of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Tibaek-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tibaek 2005</LINK>) to determine whether only participants with a first stroke were included. Participants in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Wikander-1998b" TYPE="STUDY">Wikander 1998b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2003</LINK>) were in the acute phase of stroke (i.e. 0 to 1 month) on enrolment to the study, but in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Wikander-1998b" TYPE="STUDY">Wikander 1998b</LINK>) the study period extended into early rehabilitation, i.e. up to three months. Participants in the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2006</LINK> were 70.74 ± 35.26 days post-stroke, while <LINK REF="STD-Zhou-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 1999</LINK> presented findings for participants who were less than or more than three months post-stroke.

The trial by Zhu (<LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2003</LINK>) was a quasi-experimental study with subjects allocated in sequence according to the time of admission; allocation was therefore not concealed. The trial by Brittain (<LINK REF="STD-Brittain-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Brittain 2000a</LINK>) had a 2:1 randomisation.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Blinding</HEADING>
<P>In the trials of complementary therapies (<LINK REF="STD-Chu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Chu 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhou-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 1999</LINK>) and meclofenoxate (<LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2003</LINK>), blinding of staff, trial participants and outcome assessment was unclear. In the trials of professional input interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Brittain-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Brittain 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wikander-1998b" TYPE="STUDY">Wikander 1998b</LINK>) and pelvic floor muscle training (<LINK REF="STD-Tibaek-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tibaek 2005</LINK>), health care providers and trial participants could not be blind to treatment status. <LINK REF="STD-Brittain-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Brittain 2000a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Tibaek-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tibaek 2005</LINK> used independent outcome assessors. In the trial by Wikander (<LINK REF="STD-Wikander-1998b" TYPE="STUDY">Wikander 1998b</LINK>), outcomes were assessed by ward staff. In the cross-over trial of oestrogen versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Judge-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Judge 1969</LINK>), blinding of staff and trial participants is likely to have been effective, but it was unclear who undertook outcome assessment.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Follow-up and exclusions</HEADING>
<P>Loss to follow up was unclear in the trial of scalp acupuncture (<LINK REF="STD-Chu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Chu 1997</LINK>). The trial of rehabilitation governed by a functional independence measure (<LINK REF="STD-Wikander-1998b" TYPE="STUDY">Wikander 1998b</LINK>) reported no loss to follow up. It is unclear why there were fewer patients in the control group (n=13) than the intervention group (n=21). There was also no reported loss to follow up in the trials of acupuncture versus usual care (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2002</LINK>), eye and scalp acupuncture versus no acupuncture (<LINK REF="STD-Zhou-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 1999</LINK>) and meclofenoxate plus salvia miltirrhiza versus salvia mitirrhiza (<LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2003</LINK>). The cross-over trial of oestrogen versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Judge-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Judge 1969</LINK>) and the trials of pelvic floor muscle training versus usual care (<LINK REF="STD-Tibaek-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tibaek 2005</LINK>) and ginger-salt-partitioned moxibustion plus routine acupuncture versus routine acupuncture (<LINK REF="STD-Liu-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2006</LINK>) state numbers and reasons for withdrawals. In the trial of a Continence Nurse Advisor versus general practitioner care (<LINK REF="STD-Brittain-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Brittain 2000a</LINK>), the numbers of withdrawals at three and six months are stated and reasons given, but are not reported separately for intervention and control group. There was missing data at both three and six months, because some participants were not yet due for their assessment when results were reported. The proportions for which data are reported are 82% at three months, and 63% at six months. Comparisons on age and gender for those excluded from analyses showed no significant differences.<BR/>Power calculations and intention-to-treat analyses were not reported in any of the trials, although four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Wikander-1998b" TYPE="STUDY">Wikander 1998b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhou-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2003</LINK>) reported complete data and are therefore likely to have applied intention to treat.</P>

All five trials were of specialised professional input interventions or of complimentary therapy interventions.</P>
<P>
<I>Specialist professional input interventions</I>
<BR/>In both the two trials of structured assessment and management, the rate of incontinence was lower in the intervention group than in the control group (Comparison 01.01.01). There was, however, marked heterogeneity between the trials: Wikander (<LINK REF="STD-Wikander-1998b" TYPE="STUDY">Wikander 1998b</LINK>), 1/21 vs. 10/13 (RR 0.06; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.43); Brittain (<LINK REF="STD-Brittain-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Brittain 2000a</LINK>), 40/73 vs. 31/48 (RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.63 to 1.14). Although the overall RR (0.26) was consistent with a large treatment effect, applying a random effects model (because of the heterogeneity) led to a wide confidence interval which was not statistically significant (0.01 to 4.67; p = 0.36).</P>
<P>
<I>Complementary therapy interventions</I>
<BR/>In the three trials of complementary therapy interventions for which data were available (<LINK REF="STD-Liu-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhou-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 1999</LINK>), the rate of incontinence was reported to be lower in the intervention group and this difference was statistically significant for two of the studies. This comparison also showed heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 80.8%). Applying a random effects model, the overall RR was 0.44 (95% CI 0.23 to 0.86; p = 0.02).</P>

<P>There were no data suitable for analysis in RevMan Analyses in relation to changes in the mean number of symptoms (see 'Characteristics of Included Studies Table').

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Summary of main results</HEADING>
<P>The review aimed to consider all interventions designed to treat urinary incontinence after stroke in adults, rather than testing a specific hypothesis. Experimental studies were found testing a wide range of interventions.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Behavioural interventions</HEADING>
<P>The small trial testing pelvic floor muscle training against general rehabilitation (<LINK REF="STD-Tibaek-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tibaek 2005</LINK>) found evidence in favour of the treatment group in terms of mean voiding frequency over 24 hours and mean daytime voiding frequency; however findings were only significant when outcomes were measured over three rather than two days. No significant differences were found in the primary outcome (24 hour pad test) or secondary outcomes including vaginal palpation of the pelvic floor muscle, the SF36 or the IIQ.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Specialised professional input interventions</HEADING>
<P>One of the two trials testing specialised professional input (<LINK REF="STD-Wikander-1998b" TYPE="STUDY">Wikander 1998b</LINK>) suggests that structured assessment and management is promising in helping people to regain continence in the early post-stroke period: this type of intervention merits further research. Some features of this trial have to be considered in interpreting the large effects suggested. Because the intervention was delivered on a separate ward, equivalence of treatment other than the intervention could not be assessed, particularly in relation to staff mix and numbers. The sample size was small, it is not clear why the numbers in the two trial groups differed, and outcome measurement was not blinded. Furthermore, if there is an effect, it is not possible to separate out the influences of structured assessment which could include training of the staff, multi-disciplinary coordination or the focus provided to staff by regular feedback of outcome, from the involvement of the patient in the assessment and management of their care (<LINK REF="STD-Wikander-1998b" TYPE="STUDY">Wikander 1998b</LINK>).</P>
<P>The other trial of specialised professional input (<LINK REF="STD-Brittain-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Brittain 2000a</LINK>) found that outcomes from Continence Nurse Advisor and usual care groups were similar at all data points, with the exception of the number of people cured of all urinary symptoms at six months and satisfaction with the service at three months, where findings favoured the treatment group (although the confidence intervals were wide). The intervention used by the Continence Nurse Advisor was well defined, with a structured assessment and intervention protocol. This was particularly appropriate where reasons for continuing problems with continence had not been investigated. The generalisability of these results has to take into consideration the wide definition of urinary incontinence used, which included people suffering from a range of other urinary symptoms such as frequency or urgency. While the trial overall was relatively large and well designed, the proportion of participants for whom results were available at six months was quite low (63%) and some of the data could not be analysed.</P>
<P>If there are differences between the two professional input intervention trials, these could be related both to the intensity of the interventions, and to the type of trial participant. Participants in the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Wikander-1998b" TYPE="STUDY">Wikander 1998b</LINK> were between 11-19 days post-stroke when the hospital-based intervention began, whereas the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Brittain-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Brittain 2000a</LINK> was conducted in a community setting. This is likely to have included people with a much less recent stroke. Participants in the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Wikander-1998b" TYPE="STUDY">Wikander 1998b</LINK> were also known to have developed continence problems only subsequent to their stroke, while this is not known for the other trial (<LINK REF="STD-Brittain-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Brittain 2000a</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Complementary therapy interventions</HEADING>
<P>Three trials of complementary therapies found significant differences favouring the treatment group: acupuncture was more effective than usual care in terms of people with incontinence after treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2002</LINK>), eye and scalp acupuncture was more effective than no acupuncture in terms of people with incontinence after treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Zhou-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 1999</LINK>) and ginger-salt-partitioned moxibustion plus routine acupuncture was more effective than routine acupuncture in terms of mean daytime voiding frequency and mean nighttime voiding frequency (<LINK REF="STD-Liu-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2006</LINK>). However, these trials reported minimal methodological detail and it is likely they were of poor quality. It is also not clear whether, and how, these interventions are transferable to the health services of other countries.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Pharmacotherapy interventions</HEADING>
<P>In the small cross-over trial testing an intervention (oral oestrogen) against placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Judge-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Judge 1969</LINK>), there were fewer incontinence episodes per week during oestrogen treatment. However, it is only known that the participants had a history of stroke. The high mean age of the participants in the trial, the presence of confusion and lack of mobility, and the setting in which the trial took place (two geriatric hospitals) suggest that continence problems may have been secondary to other conditions as well as stroke. For this reason it is problematic to generalise these results to women after stroke. Furthermore, the dose prescribed is not that currently recommended, hormone replacement therapy is anyway now widely considered to be contraindicated in patients who have had, or are at risk of, stroke, and there is evidence that oestrogens increase incontinence in postmenopausal women (<LINK REF="REF-Hendrix-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hendrix 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is notable that the most promising results for regaining continence were from the <LINK REF="STD-Wikander-1998b" TYPE="STUDY">Wikander 1998b</LINK> trial, where the time since stroke onset of the participants was short. Early intervention could have greatest impact on the numbers regaining continence. However, 25% of people discharged from hospital after stroke still have continence problems. There is a lack of evidence on whether the many other forms of intervention that have been shown to have some value in the general population would also be relevant to people after stroke. In particular, there are no usable results from trials testing the use of bladder relaxants such as anticholinergics, or programmes of timed voiding or bladder training.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Overall completeness and applicability of the evidence</HEADING>
<P>The major point of interest in the included studies is the mix of categories of intervention, including physical, behavioural and complementary therapies, drugs, and professional input interventions such as using trained personnel and specific methods of managing care. However, within categories it was generally not possible to combine studies due to use of different outcome measures.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Quality of the evidence</HEADING>
<P>The trials included were generally small (n=724 participants in total; median =49 participants); only three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Brittain-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Brittain 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Judge-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Judge 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tibaek-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tibaek 2005</LINK>) had adequate allocation concealment and many were limited by poor reporting. For most, it was impossible to judge the extent to which they might have been prone to bias. The small sample sizes meant that confidence intervals were wide and did not rule out clinically important differences when there was no statistically significant difference. Even the largest trial (<LINK REF="STD-Brittain-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Brittain 2000a</LINK>) is not fully reported, and it has not been possible to obtain full data from the investigators. The review is also limited by the lack of full data for four other trials (<LINK REF="STD-Chu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Chu 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gelber-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Gelber 1997a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gelber-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Gelber 1997b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lewis-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Lewis 1990</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Potential biases in the review process</HEADING>
<P>The original protocol for this review specified inclusion criteria for participants as having had a stroke in the previous 12 months, but this definition proved unworkable, because most of the trials did not specify or report time since stroke. There was also a lack of clarity about whether urinary incontinence was subsequent to stroke. Only three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Liu-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tibaek-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tibaek 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wikander-1998b" TYPE="STUDY">Wikander 1998b</LINK>) specified that urinary continence problems were subsequent to stroke, and detailed the time since stroke onset. For this reason, the extent to which the results for the remaining trials can be generalised to people with continence problems solely as the result of a stroke is unclear.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is very little evidence from stroke-specific studies to guide practice. The lack of trials testing the same category of intervention means that recommendations for practice are based on the results of a few, usually small, trials. The <LINK REF="STD-Wikander-1998b" TYPE="STUDY">Wikander 1998b</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Brittain-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Brittain 2000a</LINK> trials provide some evidence to suggest that specialised professional input using systematic methods to assess and manage continence problems may improve some outcomes. The limited evidence suggests that the greatest impact on urinary incontinence may be in the acute phase of rehabilitation after stroke. However, the Brittain (<LINK REF="STD-Brittain-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Brittain 2000a</LINK>) trial suggests that specialist input and individualised care management may improve the number of symptoms of urinary incontinence even in the longer term. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Evidence suggesting that beneficial outcomes may be achieved by structuring the management of care for people with urinary continence problems following a stroke points to the need for larger trials. Given the variety of problems that can hinder the maintenance of continence after stroke, the use of individualised assessment and goal setting to tailor interventions to the neurological and functional problems of the individual would seem to be especially worthy of consideration. </P>
<P>Methods of managing continuing urinary incontinence such as intermittent catheterisation or the use of catheter valves are also needed. </P>
<P>Three trials of complementary therapies, namely acupuncture (<LINK REF="STD-Zhou-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2002</LINK>) and ginger-salt-partitioned moxibustion (<LINK REF="STD-Liu-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2006</LINK>), suggest these interventions may be worth investigating further with more rigorous study design. </P>
<P>There is a need for more well-designed studies. Further research should use standardised definitions and classification systems to record details of the type and severity of stroke, and the type and severity of urinary incontinence. Pre-stroke continence status, time since stroke and stroke recurrence should also be recorded, with clear inclusion criteria for continence status. Exclusion criteria should be given for comorbidities and clinical indicators of underlying urogenital or systemic conditions such as infection. Specific details of structured assessment and intervention protocols need to be given, with standardisation of treatment, measures of between groups contamination or differences, and tailoring of intervention to the early or later phases of rehabilitation. Outcome measures of urinary incontinence and of urinary symptoms should be standardised, with attention to their validity and reliability and the blinding of outcome assessment. The measurement of changes in health related quality of life would be valuable. The time periods for review should be standardised for the acute, early and later phases of rehabilitation. Lastly, sample size calculations and secure randomisation at either the cluster or individual patient level should be used appropriately. </P>

<P>The review was conceived and designed by Lois Thomas. Searching was completed by Beverley French. Trials were considered for inclusion independently by two reviewers (Lois Thomas, Beverley French). Data extraction and review of the methodological quality of the eligible studies was then independently conducted by two reviewers for each study (Chris Sutton, Michael Leathley, Stephen Cross, Beverley French and Lois Thomas). Extracted data and quality assessment were crosschecked and any disagreements discussed and if necessary resolved by Lois Thomas. Lois Thomas and Beverley French wrote the text of the review. James Barrett and Caroline Watkins acted as external reviewers, and contributed to constructing the implications for practice and research.</P>

<P>Due to the comprehensive nature of the searches already performed by the Stroke Collaborative Review Group, no additional searches were performed other than on CINAHL, combining stroke terms with terms for urinary incontinence without a research methods filter. This was done because of the potentially poor indexing of nursing research. The following strategy was used to search CINAHL (January 1982 to January 2007) on Dialog Datastar:</P>

<P>The above search was combined with the CINAHL search from the Cochrane Stroke Group.</P>
<P>Recent unpublished trial data were also searched for on national and international databases i.e. NHS National Research Register, NHS Research Findings Register, US Community of Science NIH Grants, MetaRegister of Controlled Clinical Trials and CRISP, by adapting terms drawn from the existing search strategies of the Incontinence and Stroke Review Groups.</P>
<P>The reference lists of all relevant reviews and trial reports were searched to identify further relevant studies. Major investigators were contacted to ask for any other possible relevant trials, published or unpublished. In addition, contact was made with the authors of other relevant Cochrane reviews to ascertain whether defined subgroups of stroke survivors were identified in trials testing methods of promoting continence in a general population.</P>
<P>The review was publicised on the following websites: Joanna Briggs Institute, Royal College of Nursing Research Society, Royal College of Nursing Continence Interest Group, Association of Continence Advisors, Sigma Theta Tau.</P>
<P>We did not impose any language or other restrictions on any of these searches.</P>
