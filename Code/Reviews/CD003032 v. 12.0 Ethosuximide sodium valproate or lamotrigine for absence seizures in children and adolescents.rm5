<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Epilepsy is a disorder where seizures are caused by abnormal electrical discharges from the brain. Absence epilepsy involves seizures that cause a sudden loss of awareness. It often starts in childhood or adolescence. Three antiepileptic drugs are often used for absence epilepsy: valproate, ethosuximide and lamotrigine.</P>
<P>This review aims to determine which of these three antiepileptic drugs is the best choice for the treatment of absence seizures in children and adolescents.</P>
<P>
<B>Results</B>
</P>
<P>The review found some evidence (based on eight small trials) that individuals taking lamotrigine are more likely to be seizure free than those using placebos. The review found robust evidence that patients taking ethosuximide or valproate are more likely to be seizure free than those using lamotrigine. However, because of the lower risk of adverse effects, the use of ethosuximide is preferred over valproate in patients with absence childhood epilepsy.</P>
<P>With regards to both efficacy and tolerability, ethosuximide represents the optimal initial empirical monotherapy for children and adolescents with absence seizures.</P>
<P>The evidence is current to 1 September 2016.</P>

<P>This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review originally published in 2003, Issue 3, and updated in 2005, Issue 4.</P>
<P>Absence seizures are brief epileptic seizures which present in childhood and adolescence. Depending on clinical features and electroencephalogram (EEG) findings they are divided into typical, atypical absences, and absences with special features. Typical absences are characterised by sudden loss of awareness and an EEG typically shows generalised spike wave discharges at three cycles per second. Ethosuximide, valproate and lamotrigine are currently used to treat absence seizures. This review aims to determine the best choice of antiepileptic drug for children and adolescents with typical absence seizures.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-01-12 10:31:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group's Specialized Register (1 September 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online (CRSO, 1 September 2016), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 1 September 2016), ClinicalTrials.gov (1 September 2016) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ICTRP (1 September 2016). Previously we searched Embase (1988 to March 2005) and SCOPUS (1823 to 31 March 2014). No language restrictions were imposed. In addition, we contacted Sanofi Winthrop, Glaxo Wellcome (now GlaxoSmithKline) and Parke Davis (now Pfizer), manufacturers of sodium valproate, lamotrigine and ethosuximide respectively.</P>

<P>Randomised parallel group monotherapy or add-on trials which include a comparison of any of the following in children or adolescents with absence seizures: ethosuximide; sodium valproate; lamotrigine; or placebo.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-01-12 10:31:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Outcome measures were: (1) proportion of individuals seizure free at one, three, six, 12 and 18 months post randomisation; (2) people with a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency; (3) normalisation of EEG and/or negative hyperventilation test; and (4) adverse effects. Data were independently extracted by two review authors. Results are presented as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-01-12 10:31:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Eight small trials were found (three of them not included in the previous version of the review). Six of them were of poor methodological quality and seven recruited less than 50 participants. There are no placebo-controlled trials for ethosuximide or valproate, and hence, no evidence from randomised controlled trials to support a specific effect on absence seizures for either of these two drugs. Due to the differing methodologies used in the trials comparing ethosuximide, lamotrigine and valproate, we thought it inappropriate to undertake a meta-analysis. One large randomised, parallel double-blind controlled trial comparing ethosuximide, lamotrigine and sodium valproate in children with newly diagnosed childhood absence epilepsy found that at 12 months, the freedom-from-failure rates for ethosuximide and valproic acid (VPA) were similar and were higher than the rate for lamotrigine. The frequency of treatment failures due to lack of seizure control (P &lt; 0.001) and intolerable adverse events (P &lt; 0.037) was significantly different among the treatment groups, with the largest proportion of lack of seizure control in the lamotrigine cohort, and the largest proportion of adverse events in the VPA group. Overall, this large study demonstrates the superior effectiveness of ethosuximide and VPA compared to lamotrigine as initial monotherapy aimed to control seizures without intolerable adverse effects in children with childhood absence epilepsy.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-01-12 10:31:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>With regards to both efficacy and tolerability, ethosuximide represents the optimal initial empirical monotherapy for children and adolescents with absence seizures. However, if absence and generalised tonic-clonic seizures coexist, valproate should be preferred, as ethosuximide is probably inefficacious on tonic-clonic seizures.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-01-31 13:03:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review is an update of a review originally published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003, Issue 3; <LINK REF="REF-Posner-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Posner 2003</LINK>), and updated in 2005, Issue 4; <LINK REF="REF-Posner-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Posner 2005b</LINK>) on 'Ethosuximide, sodium valproate or lamotrigine for absence seizures in children and adolescents'.</P>
<P>Absence seizures (AS) are brief epileptic seizures characterised by sudden loss of awareness. Depending on clinical features and electroencephalogram (EEG) findings, they are divided into typical AS, atypical AS, and AS with special features (<LINK REF="REF-Berg-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berg 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tenney-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tenney 2013</LINK>). About 10% of seizures in children with epilepsy are typical AS. Typical AS are associated with an EEG showing regular generalised and symmetrical spike and slow wave complexes at a frequency of three cycles per second at the same time as the absence. Childhood seizure disorders are classified into syndromes, which take into account seizure types, age and EEG changes. Typical AS may be the only seizure type experienced by a child and this then constitutes either an epileptic syndrome called childhood absence epilepsy or juvenile absence epilepsy. However, AS may also be only one of multiple types of seizures, for example in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy where myoclonic and tonic-clonic seizures occur as well as AS. Atypical AS are characterised by less abrupt onset and offset, longer duration, changes in muscular tone, and variable impairment of consciousness; they are associated with interictal 1.5-2.5 Hz irregular, asymmetrical spike and wave complexes on the EEG, and with diffuse, irregular slow spike and wave as ictal pattern. The 2010 revised International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) Report on Terminology and Classification has recently recognised two additional types of AS, which are associated with special features: myoclonic AS and eyelid myoclonia with absence (EMA) (<LINK REF="REF-Berg-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berg 2010</LINK>). Seizures occurring in EMA are clinically associated with jerkings of the eyelids with upward eye-deviation, which are usually triggered by eye closure; the ictal EEG shows 3-6 Hz generalised polyspike and wave complexes, sometimes associated with occipital paroxysmal discharges.</P>
<P>Non-systematic reviews have suggested that ethosuximide and sodium valproate are equally effective (<LINK REF="REF-Duncan-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duncan 1995</LINK>). Valproate is considered the drug of choice in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (<LINK REF="REF-Chadwick-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chadwick 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Christe-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Christe 1989</LINK>), although there is little in the way of evidence from randomised controlled trials to support this. Lamotrigine used to be considered a second-line drug, reserved for intractable AS (<LINK REF="REF-Duncan-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duncan 1995</LINK>), but its use has increased with time. It is especially valued in situations where sodium valproate leads to weight gain and also for women of childbearing age. The latter is due to fears of a higher rate of fetal abnormalities in pregnancies exposed to valproate (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2000</LINK>). Preliminary studies suggested that lamotrigine may become the first-line drug in AS (<LINK REF="STD-Buoni-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Buoni 1999</LINK>). This review aims to determine the best choice of anticonvulsant for children and adolescents with AS by reviewing the information available from randomised controlled trials.</P>

<P>The updated search strategy described above yielded 86 results (two Epilepsy Specialized Register, 14 CENTRAL, 14 MEDLINE, 51 SCOPUS, three ClinicalTrials.gov, and two ICTRP). After removing 19 duplicates, one publication already in review, and 26 obviously irrelevant items, we assessed 40 articles for possible inclusion.

Ethosuximide was initially given at 250 mg/day and, whenever required, incremented by 250 mg to a maximum of 1500 mg/day. Valproate was started at 400 mg/day and, if deemed necessary, gradually incremented by 200 mg up to 2400 mg/day.

</I> (<LINK REF="STD-Sato-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Sato 1982</LINK>)<BR/>This study used a complex response conditional design and recruited drug naive as well as participants already on treatment, with a total of 45 participants recruited. In the first phase of this trial, participants were randomised to receive either valproate (and placebo) or ethosuximide (and placebo) and followed up for six weeks. Participants responding to randomised treatment continued with the randomised drug for a further six weeks. Responders included previously untreated participants who became seizure free and participants who had been previously treated and had an 80% or greater reduction in AS frequency. Non-responders and those with adverse effects were crossed over to the alternative treatment and followed up for a further six weeks. The age range of participants was three to 18 years. Apart from absence seizures some participants also had other types of seizures. The report does not specify if the absence seizures were typical or atypical. Some of the participants were drug naive and some drug resistant. Participants of the study were selected from those who attended epilepsy clinic at the Clinical Research Center, University of Virginia Hospital, USA. The work was supported by a contract from the Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke (NINCDS).</P>

</I> (<LINK REF="STD-Martinovic-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Martinovic 1983</LINK>)<BR/>This was a parallel, open design study comparing ethosuximide and sodium valproate. Participants were between five and eight years old with a recent (less than six weeks) onset of seizures. All participants (total 20) had 'simple absences' and were followed up for one to two years. Six individuals did not co-operate and were therefore not included in the analysis. No information about sponsorship by a pharmaceutical company is given.</P>

</I> (<LINK REF="STD-Frank-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Frank 1999</LINK>)<BR/>This was a double-blind study using a 'responder enriched' design. Participants (total 29) had newly diagnosed typical absence seizures and were aged between three to 15 years. Prior to randomisation, all participants received treatment with lamotrigine. After four weeks or more of treatment, participants who were seizure free and had a negative 24-hour EEG with hyperventilation, were randomised to either continue lamotrigine or to placebo and were followed up for four weeks.

We contacted the main author of this study via email three times (30 October and 4 November 2015, and 7 January 2016) asking for further information; we did not receive a reply. This was a randomised, open-label, parallel group design comparing sodium valproate with lamotrigine used in monotherapy for treatment of typical absence seizures (diagnosed clinically and by EEG support). Thirty patients were included (males 16; females 14 &#8211; age between five and 14 years). Patients with other comorbidities were excluded. Fifteen patients were randomly allocated to receive valproate and 15 to receive lamotrigine. The follow-up was 12 months. The primary outcome was seizure freedom and no EEG evidence of seizure. Drug dosages were not explicitly reported. The dosages were escalated according to the clinical response, starting from a low dose. Lamotrigine was titrated very slowly at two-weekly intervals to avoid unwanted side effects (maximum 10 mg/kg/day). After one month of treatment nine patients (60%) receiving valproate and none (0%) receiving lamotrigine were seizure free. After three months, 11 patients (73.3%) in the sodium valproate and eight patients (53.3%) in the lamotrigine group receiving lamotrigine were seizure free. After 12 months, 12 patients (80%) receiving sodium valproate and 10 patients (66.6%) treated with lamotrigine were seizure free (P &gt; 0.05). Minimal adverse events (not explicitly reported) were observed in 26.6% of patients treated with sodium valproate and in 20% of patients receiving lamotrigine. No dropouts were observed. No information on sponsorship by pharmaceutical company was available.</P>

<P>This study (<LINK REF="STD-Huang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2009</LINK>), compared valproate with lamotrigine monotherapy in drug naive children (n = 48, six to 10 years) with newly diagnosed childhood AS (typical seizures). Included patients were 17 male and 31 female (no detailed descriptions in each group respectively). The follow-up time was 12 months. The outcome measure was total seizure freedom, measured at one, three, six and 12 months. Complete normalisation of EEG with seizure freedom and occurrence of adverse effects were also considered. In the valproate group, sustained release tablets or oral solution were administered twice daily (totally 15 mg/kg per day); in case of persisting seizures after one week, the dose was increased to 20 mg/kg per day, twice daily (maximum dose daily 30 mg/kg). In case of persisting seizures despite a maximum dose of 30 mg/kg within a month, combination with lamotrigine 0.15 mg/kg daily to 2 mg to 5 mg/kg was administrated. In the lamotrigine group, patients received a starting dose of lamotrigine of 0.5 mg/kg daily, administered twice, increased to 0.15 mg/kg per two weeks. The daily maintenance dose was 2 mg to 5 mg/kg, and the maximum daily dose 10 mg/kg. In case of persisting seizures despite a maximum dose within a month, combination with valproate 10 mg/kg daily to 20 mg/kg was administrated.

<B>Glauser 2013 </B>(<LINK REF="STD-Glauser-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Glauser 2013a</LINK>)<BR/>This was a randomised, parallel double-blind controlled trial comparing ethosuximide, lamotrigine and sodium valproate in children with newly diagnosed childhood absence epilepsy. The study designed included also a partial cross-over to open-label (at treatment failure only) with subsequent follow-up: participants reaching a treatment failure criterion in the double-blind treatment phase were given the opportunity to enter into the open-label phase, during which participants were randomised to one of the two other antiepileptic drugs. Participants (total 453 enrolled) had typical absence seizure, were between seven months and 12 years 11 months, and were previously untreated. Among the 453 patients enrolled, seven were withdrawn, hence 446 participants were included in subsequent effectiveness analyses and 451 participants included in the safety analyses. Follow-up was up to 12 months. Study drugs were titrated as tolerated in predetermined increments every one to two weeks over 16 weeks. Ethosuximide and valproic acid doses were incremented of 5 mg to 10 mg/kg/day at intervals of two weeks, whilst lamotrigine doses were incremented of 0.3 mg to 0.6 mg/kg/day at intervals of two weeks. The maximal target doses were ethosuximide 60 mg/kg/day or 2000 mg/day (whichever was lower), valproic acid 60 mg/kg/day or 3000 mg/day (whichever was lower), and lamotrigine 12 mg/kg/day or 600 mg/day (whichever was lower). The main effectiveness outcome was the freedom from treatment failure assessed 12 months after randomisation. Freedom from treatment failure was also assessed at 16 to 20 weeks. Treatment failure was defined as failure either due to lack of seizure control, or meeting safety exit criteria, or withdrawal from the study for any other reason. This study was not sponsored by any commercial organisation.</P>

<B>Lamotrigine versus placebo<BR/>
</B>
</I>We found one study (<LINK REF="STD-Frank-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Frank 1999</LINK>) comparing lamotrigine with placebo which recruited 29 participants. As outlined in <LINK TAG="STUDY_DESCRIPTION" TYPE="SECTION">Description of studies</LINK> above, this trial used a responder-enriched design where participants responding to lamotrigine during a pre-randomisation baseline phase were randomised to continue lamotrigine or have it withdrawn. This trial therefore compares the effect of continuing versus withdrawing lamotrigine. The results were as follows: in the initial open-label dose-escalation phase, 71% of the participants became seizure free on lamotrigine using a 24-hour EEG/video telemetry recording; in the placebo controlled phase 64% of the participants on lamotrigine remained seizure free versus 21% receiving placebo (P &lt; 0.03).</P>

</I>We found four studies comparing valproate with ethosuximide (<LINK REF="STD-Callaghan-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Callaghan 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sato-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Sato 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martinovic-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Martinovic 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glauser-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Glauser 2013a</LINK>). Due to differences in study design, participants and length of follow-up we did not think it appropriate to pool results in a meta-analysis. For our chosen outcome 'seizure freedom', we were unable to extract data for this outcome at the time points we had specified (one, six and 18 months). Rather than not present any data for this outcome, we have summarised results for individual trials, where the proportion of participants seizures free during follow-up was reported. Results for individual studies are presented below as well as in meta-view tables.</P>
<P>
<I>(1) Seizure freedom<BR/>
</I>The risk ratio (RR) estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for seizure freedom (RR &lt; 1 favours ethosuximide) are:</P>
<P>(a) <LINK REF="STD-Callaghan-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Callaghan 1982</LINK>: RR 0.70 (95% CI 0.32 to 1.51); seizure freedom was observed in six out of 15 patients receiving valproate and in eight out of 14 patients receiving ethosuximide.</P>
<P>(b) <LINK REF="STD-Sato-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Sato 1982</LINK>: RR 1.93 (95% CI 0.87 to 4.25); the proportion of patients achieving seizure freedom in both groups is not explicitly reported.</P>

In one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Martinovic-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Martinovic 1983</LINK>) all participants achieved this outcome (10/10 in the valproate and 10/10 in the ethosuximide group). For the other trial (<LINK REF="STD-Callaghan-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Callaghan 1982</LINK>) the RR was 1.02 (95% CI 0.70 to 1.48); 12 out of 15 patients receiving valproate and 11 out of 14 patients receiving ethosuximide experienced 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency. Again, no difference is found, but the confidence interval is wide and equivalence cannot be inferred.</P>

<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Coppola-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Coppola 2004</LINK>) comparing valproate and lamotrigine head-to-head, recruited drug naive children with typical absence seizures. The primary outcome measure was total seizure freedom and was assessed at one, three and 12 months. At one month follow-up 52.6% of patients taking valproate (10 out of 19) were seizure free compared to only 5.3% of patients taking lamotrigine (1 out of 19) (P = 0.004). With the passage of time increasingly more patients responded to lamotrigine. At three months seizure freedom was observed in 12 out of 19 (63.1%) patients taking sodium valproate and in seven out of 19 (36.8%) patients taking lamotrigine (P = 0.19). At the last observation at 12 months follow-up, 13/19 (68.4%) patients taking sodium valproate and 10(19 (52.6%) taking lamotrigine were seizure free (P = 0.51).</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Basu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Basu 2005</LINK>) compared sodium valproate with lamotrigine in patients with typical absence in a randomised, open-label, parallel group design. After one month of treatment nine patients (60%) receiving valproate and none (0%) receiving lamotrigine were seizure free. After three months, 11 patients out of 15 (73.3%) in the sodium valproate and eight patients out of 15 (53.3%) in the lamotrigine group receiving lamotrigine were seizure free. After 12 months 12 patients out of 15 (80%) receiving sodium valproate and 10 patients out of 15 (66.6%) treated with lamotrigine were seizure free (P &gt; 0.05).</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Huang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2009</LINK>) compared valproate with lamotrigine monotherapy in drug naive children with newly diagnosed childhood absence seizures (typical seizures). At 12 months, 17 patients out of 24 (71%) in the valproate group and 12 out of 24 patients (50%) in the lamotrigine group achieved seizure freedom. Detailed data on seizure freedom at one, three, six and 12 months are reported in meta-view tables.</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Glauser-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Glauser 2013a</LINK>) compared valproate and lamotrigine in drug naive patients with childhood absence seizures. The main effectiveness outcome was the freedom from treatment failure assessed 12 months after randomisation. Freedom from treatment failure was also assessed at 16 to 20 weeks, and in between 16 and 20 weeks and month 12. Treatment failure was defined as failure either due to lack of seizure control, or meeting safety exit criteria, or withdrawal from the study for any other reason. Freedom from treatment failure at 12 months after randomisation was higher in patients taking sodium valproate (64/146, 44%) than in patients taking lamotrigine (31/146, 21%; P &lt; 0.001). At 16 to 20 weeks, freedom from treatment failure was observed in 85/146 (58%) patients taking valproate and 43/146 (29%) patients taking lamotrigine.</P>
<P>
<I>(2) Normalisation of the EEG</I>
</P>
<P>Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Huang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2009</LINK>) explicitly reported data on this outcome. The proportion showing normal EEG at 12 months in the lamotrigine group (6/22, 27.3%) was significantly lower than that in the valproic acid group (15/23, 65.2%) (P &lt; 0.05).</P>

</I>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Glauser-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Glauser 2013a</LINK>), compared ethosuximide and lamotrigine in drug naive patients with childhood absence seizures. The main effectiveness outcome was the freedom from treatment failure assessed 12 months after randomisation. Freedom from treatment failure was also assessed at 16 to 20 weeks, and in between 16 and 20 weeks and month 12. Treatment failure was defined as failure either due to lack of seizure control, or meeting safety exit criteria, or withdrawal from the study for any other reason. Freedom from treatment failure at 12 months after randomisation was higher in patients taking ethosuximide (70/154, 45%) than in patients taking lamotrigine (31/146, 21%; P &lt; 0.001).

<B>Adverse effects<BR/>
</B>
</I>The most common adverse effects of treatment with valproate reported by the studies assessing this drug (<LINK REF="STD-Callaghan-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Callaghan 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martinovic-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Martinovic 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sato-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Sato 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glauser-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Glauser 2013a</LINK>) were fatigue, nausea, vomiting, increased appetite with weight gain, behavioural/psychiatric changes (decreased concentration, personality change, hyperactivity, attention problems, hostility), and thrombocytopenia (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). This is similar to the general adverse effects profile of valproate. Adverse effects often seen with valproate treatment are dyspepsia, weight gain, tremor, transient hair loss and haematological abnormalities (<LINK REF="REF-Panayiotopoulos-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Panayiotopoulos 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Ethosuximide treatment was mostly associated with nausea, vomiting, and behavioural/psychiatric changes (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>The most common adverse effects of treatment with lamotrigine were fatigue, and behavioural/psychiatric changes (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). In one lamotrigine study (<LINK REF="STD-Frank-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Frank 1999</LINK>), the most commonly reported adverse event was rash (reported on 11 occasions in 10 patients). However, only in one of the individuals was this thought to be related to lamotrigine. There were two serious adverse events during the treatment, but they were judged to be unrelated to treatment. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Huang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2009</LINK>), systemic anaphylaxis rash during lamotrigine treatment led to patients withdrawal from the study. In the <LINK REF="STD-Glauser-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Glauser 2013a</LINK> study, no side effects (including rash, reported in two patients taking valproate, six patients taking ethosuximide, and six patients taking lamotrigine) occurred more frequently in the lamotrigine cohort compared to the other treatment groups (valproate and ethosuximide). The occurrence of rash in patients receiving lamotrigine is a well-known adverse events of this drug and its risk may be reduced by slow titration (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2015</LINK>).</P>

Three of the trials were explicitly reported as double-blind (<LINK REF="STD-Sato-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Sato 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Frank-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Frank 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glauser-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Glauser 2013a</LINK>). In three of the trials there was no mention of losses to follow-up or exclusions from analyses. The trials used a variety of methodologies; six were parallel trials (<LINK REF="STD-Callaghan-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Callaghan 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martinovic-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Martinovic 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coppola-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Coppola 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Basu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Basu 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glauser-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Glauser 2013a</LINK>) and two used response conditional designs (<LINK REF="STD-Sato-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Sato 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martinovic-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Martinovic 1983</LINK>). The length of follow-up ranged from four weeks to four years.</P>
<P>The trial comparing lamotrigine with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Frank-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Frank 1999</LINK>), found that individuals becoming seizure free on lamotrigine, were more likely to remain seizure free if they were randomised to stay on lamotrigine rather than placebo. In essence, this trial assessed the effect of lamotrigine withdrawal. Although this trial finds evidence of an effect of lamotrigine on absence seizures, it was of only four weeks duration, and the design is inadequate to inform clinical practice. Also, clinicians and people living with epilepsy are likely more concerned with how drugs compare with each other rather than with placebo.</P>
<P>Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Coppola-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Coppola 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Basu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Basu 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2009</LINK>) directly compared lamotrigine with the long-established treatment for typical absence seizures, sodium valproate. All these three studies found both valproate and lamotrigine to be efficacious in the treatment of typical absence seizures in children. However, in these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Coppola-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Coppola 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Basu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Basu 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2009</LINK>) the study sample size was small (38, 30 and 48 patients, respectively), and estimates are therefore imprecise. Most robust results are provided by the much larger study including three groups: valproic acid, lamotrigine and ethosuximide (<LINK REF="STD-Glauser-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Glauser 2013a</LINK>). This study found that at 12 months, the freedom-from-failure rates for ethosuximide and valproic acid were similar and were higher than the rate for lamotrigine. The frequency of treatment failures due to lack of seizure control (P &lt; 0.001) and intolerable adverse events (P &lt; 0.037) was significantly different among the treatment groups. Almost two thirds of the 125 participants with treatment failure due to lack of seizure control were in the lamotrigine cohort. The largest subgroup (42%) of the 115 participants discontinuing due to adverse events was in the valproic acid group. Overall, this study demonstrates the superior effectiveness of ethosuximide and valproic acid compared to lamotrigine as initial monotherapy aimed to control seizures without intolerable adverse events in children with childhood absence epilepsy. Because of the higher rate of adverse events leading to drug discontinuation and the significant negative effects on attentional measures seen in the valproate cohort, the authors concluded that ethosuximide represents the optimal initial empirical monotherapy for childhood absence epilepsy. Notably, this study was the very first randomised controlled trial to meet the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) criteria for class I evidence for childhood absence epilepsy (or for any type of generalised seizure in adults or children) (<LINK REF="REF-Glauser-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glauser 2006</LINK>). Consequently, ethosuximide and valproate were designed/designated as treatments with level A evidence in children with childhood absence epilepsy in the recent ILAE treatment guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Glauser-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glauser 2013b</LINK>).</P>
<P>The good efficacy profile of ethosuximide for the treatment of absence seizures as shown in <LINK REF="STD-Glauser-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Glauser 2013a</LINK> confirms results of three other smaller studies that compared ethosuximide with valproate (<LINK REF="STD-Callaghan-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Callaghan 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sato-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Sato 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martinovic-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Martinovic 1983</LINK>); all these three smaller studies reported a superior efficacy profile for ethosuximide over valproate with regards to seizure freedom (<LINK REF="STD-Callaghan-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Callaghan 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sato-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Sato 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martinovic-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Martinovic 1983</LINK>), although with wide confidence intervals due to small sample size. However, it is noteworthy to consider that ethosuximide does not suppress tonic-clonic seizures (<LINK REF="REF-Berkovic-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berkovic 1993</LINK>), and it has even been suggested that it can transform absences into grand mal seizures (<LINK REF="REF-Glauser-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glauser 2002</LINK>), although with contrasting data (<LINK REF="REF-Schmitt-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmitt 2007</LINK>). Hence, ethosuximide should probably be avoided in patients with absence seizures and co-existing generalised tonic-clonic seizures</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Significance</HEADING>
<P>There are no placebo-controlled trials for ethosuximide or valproate, and hence no evidence from randomised controlled trials to support a specific effect on absence seizures for either of these two drugs. Due to the differing methodologies used in the trials comparing ethosuximide, lamotrigine and valproate, we thought it inappropriate to undertake a meta-analysis. Hence, recommendations for practice from this review are based on a qualitative comparison. Further trials with larger size than many of the studies currently included in this review are required. Further research could allow results to be pooled, leading to a quantitative rather than a qualitative summary of results. In summary, ethosuximide, lamotrigine and valproate are commonly used to treat children and adolescents with absence seizures. We now have evidence from a recently conducted, high-quality, large trial that ethosuximide and valproate have higher efficacy than lamotrigine as initial monotherapy in children and adolescents with absence seizures. This study showed a higher rate of adverse events leading to drug discontinuation and significant negative effects on attentional measures in the valproate group. Consequently, with regards to both efficacy and tolerability, ethosuximide represents the optimal initial empirical monotherapy for children and adolescents with absence seizures. However, the use of ethosuximide should be avoided in patients with absence seizures and generalised tonic-clonic seizures, as this drug is probably inefficacious on tonic-clonic seizures.</P>

<P>With regards to both efficacy and tolerability, ethosuximide represents the optimal initial empirical monotherapy for children and adolescents with absence seizures. However, if absence and generalized tonic-clonic seizures co-exist, valproate should be preferred over ethosuximide, as this drug is probably inefficacious on tonic-clonic seizures. These implications for practice rely on results of trials that were heterogeneous. Larger trials could further clarify or change implications for practice in the future.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-01-12 10:33:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We now have convincing evidence that ethosuximide and valproate have higher efficacy than lamotrigine as initial monotherapy in children and adolescents with absence seizures, and that ethosuximide is better tolerated. Due to its good profile in terms of both efficacy and tolerability, ethosuximide should be considered as the standard treatment if only absence seizures are present. However, if absence and generalised tonic-clonic seizures co-exist, valproate should be preferred. Placebo-controlled trials in people with newly diagnosed epilepsy will provide evidence for an effect and aid in the interpretation of comparative studies should such studies find equivalence. However, clinical practice is best informed by trials that compare the effect of one drug with another. Such trials should be pragmatic in concept and given that absence seizures are relatively common, they should also be feasible. If possible, future trials should be of a larger size than many of the studies currently included in this review. In addition, such trials will need to be of at least 12 months' duration and measure outcomes which include remission from seizures, EEG with a hyperventilation test, adverse effects, quality of life and psychosocial outcomes.</P>
