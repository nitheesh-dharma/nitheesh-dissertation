<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Structured treatment interruptions (STI) of antiretroviral therapy (ART) have been under investigation as an alternative strategy in the management of chronic HIV infection since 1999. The investigation of treatment interruptions (also called "drug holidays") was initially driven by patients seeking to alleviate treatment fatigue, reduce drug-related toxicities, and improve quality of life. In patients whose ART treatment fails, treatment interruption has been implemented in order to halt progression of HIV drug resistance on the failing regimen, thereby preserving subsequent treatment options. In patients with multi-drug resistance, some early studies suggested that ART interruption could improve subsequent response to ART. More recently, STI has been proposed as a means of reducing the cost of HIV treatment in resource-limited settings. <BR/> <BR/>We conducted a systematic review of evidence regarding STI in persons with chronic, unsuppressed HIV infection and multi-drug resistance. Based on the completed trials we reviewed, the vast majority of evidence suggests greater harm than benefit from interrupting ART in patients with chronic HIV infection, who have treatment failure with multi-drug resistant HIV. The evidence does not support the use of STI with such patients.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Structured treatment interruptions (STI) of antiretroviral therapy (ART) have been investigated as part of novel treatment strategies, with different aims and objectives depending on the populations involved. These populations include: 1) patients who initiate ART during acute HIV infection; 2) patients with chronic HIV infection, on ART, with successfully suppressed viremia; and 3) patients with chronic HIV infection and treatment failure, with persistent viremia due to multi-drug resistant HIV (Hirschel 2001; Deeks 2002; Miller 2003). </P>
<P>In an earlier Cochrane review (Pai 2005), we had summarized the evidence about the effects of STI in chronic suppressed HIV infection. In this review, we summarize the evidence on STI in patients with chronic unsuppressed HIV infection due to drug-resistant HIV. Unsuppressed HIV infection describes those patients who cannot suppress viremia, due to the presence of multi-drug-resistant virus. It is also referred to as treatment failure. <BR/> <BR/>Drug resistance is identified by the presence of resistant mutations at baseline.</P>
<P>STI as a treatment strategy in HIV-infected patients with chronic unsuppressed viremia involves interrupting ART in controlled clinical settings, for a pre-specified duration of time. These interruptions have various aims, including the following: 1) to allow wild virus to re-emerge and replace the resistant mutant virus, with the hope of improving the efficacy of a subsequent ART regimen; 2) to halt development of drug resistance and to preserve subsequent treatment options; 3) to alleviate treatment fatigue and reduce drug-related adverse effects; and 4) to improve quality of life (Miller 2003; Montaner 2001; Vella 2000;).</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of our systematic review was to synthesize the evidence on the effect of structured treatment interruptions in adult patients with chronic unsuppressed HIV infection.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We included all available intervention studies (randomized controlled trials and non-randomized trials) conducted in HIV-infected patients worldwide. We searched nine databases, covering the period from January 1996 to February 2006. We also scanned bibliographies of relevant studies and contacted experts in the field to identify unpublished research, abstracts and ongoing trials. </P>
<P>In the first screen, a total of 3186 potentially eligible citations from nine databases and sources were identified, of which 2047 duplicate citations were excluded. The remaining 1139 citations were examined in detail, and we further excluded 951 citations that were modeling studies, animal studies, case reports, and opinion pieces. As shown in Figure 01,<B> </B>188 citations were identified in the second screen as relevant for full-text screening. Of these, 60 basic science studies, editorials and abstracts were excluded and 128 full-text articles were retrieved. In the third screen, all full-text articles were examined for eligibility in our review. These were subclassified into three categories: 1) chronic suppressed HIV infection; 2) chronic unsuppressed HIV infection; and 3) acute HIV infection. Studies were further excluded if their abstracts did not contain enough information for inclusion in our reviews. A total of 62 studies were finally classified into chronic suppressed, acute, and chronic unsuppressed categories. Of these, 17 trials met the eligibility criteria for this review.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Inclusion criteria <BR/>All available randomized or non-randomized controlled trials investigating planned treatment interruptions among patients with chronic unsuppressed HIV infection. Early pilot non-randomized prospective studies on treatment interruptions of fixed and variable durations were also included. Relevant abstracts on randomized controlled trials were also included if they contained sufficient information. </P>
<P>Exclusion criteria <BR/>Editorials, reviews, modeling studies, and basic science studies were excluded. Studies on STI among patients with chronic suppressed HIV infection were summarized in a separate review. Studies on STI in primary HIV infection were beyond the scope of this review.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers independently extracted data, evaluated study eligibility and quality. Disagreements were resolved in consultation with a third reviewer. </P>
<P>A total of seventeen studies on STI were included in our review. However, due to significant heterogeneity across studies (i.e. in study design, populations, baseline characteristics, and reported outcomes; and in reporting of measures of effect, hazard ratios, and risk ratios), we considered it inappropriate to perform a meta-analysis.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>In early pilot non-randomized trials, a pattern was evident across studies. During treatment interruption, a decline in CD4 cell counts, increase in viral load, and a shift in the level of genotypic drug resistance towards more of a wild-type HIV virus was reported. This suggests that STI may be used to increase drug susceptibility to an optimized salvage regimen upon treatment re-initiation. These studies generated useful data and hypotheses that were later tested in randomized controlled trials. </P>
<P>Randomized controlled trials rated high on quality. Of the eight randomized controlled trials reviewed, seven had been completed while one was ongoing and remains blinded. Of the seven completed randomized controlled trials, six have reported consistent virologic and immunologic patterns, and found no significant benefit in virologic response to subsequent ART in the STI arm, compared to the control arm. In addition, the largest completed randomized trial reported greater numbers of clinical disease progression events and evidence of prolonged negative impact on CD4 cell counts in the STI arm (Beatty 2005; Benson 2004; Deeks 2001; Lawrence 2003; Walmsley 2005; Ruiz 2003).</P>
<P>The single RCT with divergent findings from the others (GigHAART), reporting a significant virologic and immunologic benefit due to STI, was different in prescribing a shorter STI duration and a salvage ART regimen of 8-9 drugs. There were also differences in the patient population characteristics with this study, targeting those with very advanced HIV disease (Katlama 2004).</P>
<P>Although we await the unblinded results of the eighth RCT (OPTIMA), the evidence so far does not support STI in the setting of chronic unsuppressed HIV infection with antiretroviral treatment failure (Brown 2004; Holodniy 2004; Kyriakides 2002; Singer 2006).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The current available evidence primarily supports a lack of benefit of STI before switching therapy in patients with unsuppressed HIV viremia despite ART. There is evidence of harm in attempting STI in patients with relatively advanced HIV disease, due to the associated CD4 cell decline and the increased risk of clinical disease progression. At this time, there is no evidence to recommend the use of STI in this clinical category of patients with treatment failure.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Structured treatment interruptions (STI), a novel antiretroviral therapy (ART) strategy, involve taking a planned break from therapy (sometimes called a "drug holiday"), under pre-specified conditions, in a supervised clinical setting. This strategy of ART management has been under investigation since 1999, when the first case report of STI was reported (<LINK REF="REF-Lisziewicz-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lisziewicz 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>STI have been attempted in three main settings of HIV infection: 1) subsequent to early ART initiation during acute or primary HIV infection, 2) in chronic controlled HIV infection (suppressed viremia on ART), and 3) in chronic uncontrolled HIV infection (unsuppressed viremia due to treatment failure). In these three distinct categories, STI is utilized with different aims and objectives, clinically, immunologicly, and virologicly, depending on patient populations (<LINK REF="REF-Hirschel-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirschel 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lisziewicz-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lisziewicz 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lori-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lori 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miller-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>In an earlier Cochrane review, we summarized the available evidence on STI in chronic suppressed HIV infection (<LINK REF="REF-Pai-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pai 2005</LINK>). In the present review, we evaluate and synthesize evidence on the utility of STI in chronic unsuppressed infection. </P>
<P>Chronic unsuppressed HIV infection is a common outcome in patients in whom first-line and second-line regimens have failed, and there is evidence of resistance to all three initial ART drug classes: nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI); non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI); and protease inhibitor (PI). In these patients, treatment failure may be a consequence of a substantial period of prior treatment with what is now considered suboptimal therapy (e.g., mono- or dual drug regimens) and poor patient adherence (<LINK REF="REF-Benson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bonhoeffer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bonhoeffer 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Foli-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foli 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Montaner-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montaner 2005</LINK>). Remaining on a failing regimen with persistent viremia results in the development of progressive drug mutations and resistance to ART (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moss-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moss 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oxenius-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oxenius 2003</LINK>). There are data to suggest that drug-resistant viruses may be less fit (i.e. have lower replication capacity) than wild-type viruses (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miller-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walmsley-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walmsley 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>STI have been explored in this setting with various aims. These are to do the following: 1) alleviate treatment fatigue; 2) reduce drug related adverse effects; 3) improve quality of life; (<LINK REF="REF-Jager-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jager 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Flepp-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flepp 2001</LINK>) 4) halt progression of resistance and preserve subsequent treatment options (<LINK REF="REF-Dorman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dorman 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vella-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vella 2000</LINK>); and 5) allow wild-type virus to replace the resistant mutant virus, with the hope of improving efficacy of subsequent ART regimens (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miller-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Montaner-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montaner 2005</LINK>). When treatment interruptions are attempted, it is important to monitor clinical disease progression, and immunologic and virologic response (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dybul-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dybul 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Flepp-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flepp 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hirschel-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirschel 2001</LINK>;) </P>
<P>For the past few years, several non-randomized studies and randomized trials have been conducted in the setting of setting of chronic HIV infection with ART failure due to multi-drug resistant viruses (<LINK REF="STD-Deeks-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Deeks 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ghosn--2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ghosn 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jaafar-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jaafar 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Katlama-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Katlama 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lawrence-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lawrence 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ruiz-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ruiz 2003</LINK>). In this context, the effect of STI in these trials needs to be synthesized.</P>

<BR/>
</B>Our search strategy identified a total of 17 studies. These studies were classified by study designs into randomized controlled trials (N=8) and non-randomized trials (N=9). See Table: Characteristics of included studies.</P>
<P>
<B>A) Randomized Controlled Trials: </B>
<BR/>Eight RCTs have been conducted to date. These trials attempted the strategy of using a single STI of pre-determined duration (with a range of 2 to 4 months), prior to switching ART, in persons with treatment failure. Safety parameters were usually set up so that if patients fared poorly with large declines in CD4 counts, clinicians were allowed to intervene earlier with re-initiation of ART. Sample sizes in the completed trials varied from 46 to 274. In the ongoing OPTIMA trial the targeted sample size is 504. The mean number of antiretroviral drugs in the study-prescribed ART regimens varied from 4-8 drugs. Eligibility criteria with respect to CD4 cell count and entry HIV RNA level differed across trials (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Presence of HIV drug resistance was determined either by history of prior treatment failure or by genotypic testing for evidence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) virus. Varying durations of follow up (24 weeks-48 months) were reported. Besides reporting the effect of STI on surrogate markers (including CD4 and viral load) of HIV disease, in some cases the effects on clinical end-points were also determined and recorded. See Table of included studies.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>B) Non-randomized trials:</B> <BR/>Nine non-randomized studies in this category investigated the impact of treatment interruptions of varying durations (8 weeks to 3 months). Treatment interruptions were attempted because of patients developing drug toxicities or because of treatment failure. The studies were small, with sample sizes ranging from 9 to 77 patients. These studies were characterized by the absence of comparison groups, hence of inferior methodological quality. Eligibility criteria varied across studies, and have been summarized elsewhere (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). The impact of treatment interruption on virologic, immunologic and clinical outcomes was documented. In a few studies, patients were also followed after resumption of therapy, after the treatment interruption. See Table of included studies.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>Methodological quality of RCTs was assessed by using two methods. </P>
<P>1. The Jadad scale, a validated quality assessment instrument (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>) <BR/>2. The Cochrane method for adequacy of concealment of allocation (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2001</LINK>)</P>
<P>The Jadad instrument (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>) includes the following components. Each component gets a score of one. <BR/>I. Was the study described as randomized? <BR/>II. If so, was allocation concealed? <BR/>III. Was the study described as double blind? <BR/>IV. Were the outcome assessors blinded? <BR/>V.

<BR/> A. Randomized controlled trials<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>An early RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Deeks-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Deeks 2001</LINK>) was followed by three landmark trials: the Retrogene study, CPCRA 064, and GigHAART (<LINK REF="STD-Katlama-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Katlama 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lawrence-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lawrence 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ruiz-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ruiz 2003</LINK>). The ACTG A 5086 trial and CTN 164 trials recently reported results similar to the CPCRA 064 and Retrogene studies (<LINK REF="STD-Benson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Benson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walmsley-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Walmsley 2005</LINK>). A small trial by Beatty et al used a new class of drug in the prescribed salvage regimen (<LINK REF="STD-Beatty-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Beatty 2005</LINK>). The OPTIMA trial is ongoing and the results remain blinded to randomization assignment. (<LINK REF="STD-Brown-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holodniy-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Holodniy 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kyriakides-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kyriakides 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singer-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 2006</LINK>). The designs of the trials have been tabulated, and the individual trial results elucidated.</P>
<P>See <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> for baseline comparisons.</P>
<P>A.1. <LINK REF="STD-Beatty-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Beatty 2005</LINK> reported data from a randomized study in 30 participants that investigated a 16-week STI followed by Enfuvirtide (ENF) -based optimized salvage regimen. The control group was administered an immediate ENF regimen. In the STI arm, treatment interruption resulted in a drop in CD4 by 27 cells/mm and viral rebound by 0.4 log copies/ml. After resuming salvage therapy, the percent of patients achieving an undetectable viral load (HIV RNA &lt;75 copies/ml was greater) was 53% in the immediate ENF arm (controls) compared to 36% in the STI arm. There was no virologic benefit at 24 weeks associated with use of STI prior to switching to an optimized salvage therapy with ENF. The main predictor of treatment response was reported to be baseline phenotypic susceptibility score.</P>
<P>A.2. <LINK REF="STD-Benson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Benson 2004</LINK> reported data on the AACTG A5086 study, in triple-class experienced patients, with failure of at least two regimens. Forty-one participants were enrolled and randomized to a sixteen week STI arm (n=21) with resumption of salvage therapy or to a continuous treatment arm. This study was stopped early due to poor recruitment.</P>
<P>A.3. <LINK REF="STD-Deeks-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Deeks 2001</LINK>, a small pilot study, randomized sixteen patients either to a single STI of 12 weeks duration, or to continued therapy. This was an early randomized study in the field of STI. They reported that STI resulted in a shift in viral population from drug-resistant to drug-sensitive, an increase in plasma HIV RNA levels, and a decrease in CD4 cell counts. The authors concluded that the return of wild virus during interruption increased the ability of virus to replicate, and also depleted peripheral blood CD4 cells.</P>
<P>A.4. <LINK REF="STD-Katlama-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Katlama 2004</LINK>: This trial reported results in 68 patients who were randomized to either an immediate switch to a GigHAART regimen or a single 8-week STI followed by a GigHAART regimen. Differentiating features of this trial were use of a regimen of 8-9 drugs, a patient population with very advanced HIV disease, and a shorter duration of STI (2 months). This study was also closed early to accrual.</P>
<P>In contrast to the other RCTs, the findings in this trial indicated a virologic and immunologic benefit from STI. A better virologic success rate (defined as a minimum 1 log reduction in HIV RNA at 12 weeks) was reported in the STI arm compared to the control arm (62% vs. 26% success, respectively; p=0.007). A favorable change from baseline CD4 cell count in the STI arm, (+ 51 versus +7, p=0.047) and a decrease in log HIV RNA by 1.91 as compared to log 0.37 in the control arm (p=0.013) was reported at 24 weeks. In multivariate analysis, significant predictors of virologic success were treatment interruption, reversion to wild-type virus, adequate plasma drug concentration, and use of lopinavir. This is the only randomized clinical trial to report a significant and sustained difference between the treatment arms in virologic and immunologic response due to STI (<LINK REF="STD-Katlama-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Katlama 2004</LINK>)<BR/> <BR/>A.5. <LINK REF="STD-Lawrence-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lawrence 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Lawrence-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lawrence 2005</LINK> reported results from the RCT of largest sample size (N=274). In this trial, participants were randomized to a single STI of 16 weeks duration, followed by optimized regimen, (STI arm, N=140). The control arm was immediately switched to an optimized regimen (control arm, N=134). The study was closed to accrual early per recommendations by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board.</P>
<P>The initial results published in 2003 were based on data from N=270 patients, with a median follow-up of 12 months. Post-STI and after ART resumption, both arms reported a sustained reduction in HIV RNA of 0.8 log copies/ml. In the STI arm, a significant decrease in CD4 counts was noticed as compared to the control arm (p&lt;0.001). In the STI arm, a higher rate of clinical disease progression was reported (hazard ratio 2.57) (1.2 to 5.5, p=0.01) as compared to control arm. In a multivariate model, the significant predictors of clinical disease progression were baseline CD4 count (hazard ratio=1.38) (1.11-1.72) and treatment group (hazard ratio 2.74) (1.25-5.98). There were no differences between groups with respect to adherence, prophylaxis for opportunistic infections and quality of life measures (<LINK REF="STD-Lawrence-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lawrence 2003</LINK>)</P>
<P>In the 2005 abstract, the authors presented the follow-up data from all participants (N=274) with a median follow-up of 36 months. During the STI, 55% of the STI arm lost at least half of the mutations present at randomization; 26% lost all mutations. The final results showed no significant difference between the STI and control arms in virologic response during the follow-up periods after treatment was reinitiated in the STI arm. However, there was a sustained negative impact of STI on CD4 cell counts with treatment arm differences for the follow-up periods 0 to 4, 5 to 24, and after 24 months of 84.3 (p &lt; 0.0001), 47.0 (p = 0.0001), and 42.8 (p = 0.07), favoring the control arm. Although the number of clinical events (progression of disease or death) were higher in the STI arm than in the control arm, the overall difference was no longer significant with a median follow-up of 36 months (<LINK REF="STD-Lawrence-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lawrence 2005</LINK>)</P>
<P>The authors concluded that in this patient setting, there was no clinical, virologic, immunologic or quality of life benefit from STI. Furthermore, STI was associated with a significantly unfavorable CD4 response that persisted well after treatment re-initiation. Therefore, they recommend continuing treatment with an optimized ART regimen and avoiding the use of STI (<LINK REF="STD-Lawrence-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lawrence 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lawrence-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lawrence 2005</LINK>)</P>
<P>In the STI arm, the median increase in CD4 was 10 cells/mm3 as compared to 17.5 cells/mm3 in the control arm. In the STI arm, the median change in HIV RNA was -0.65 log copies/mL as compared to -1.15 copies/mL in the control arm. In STI arm, viral reversion was reported in 15/18 (83%) patients. The authors concluded that STI did not lead to improvement in virologic response nor in the sustained disappearance of drug resistance mutations. </P>
<P>A.6. <LINK REF="STD-Ruiz-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ruiz 2003</LINK> reported results of an RCT of small sample size (N=46), in which patients were randomly assigned to receive a 5-drug salvage regimen after a single 12 week STI (STI arm, N=22), or to immediately switch to this 5-drug salvage regimen (control arm, N=24). At week 48, there were no differences in viral load (p=0.619) between interrupted and non-interrupted groups. In the STI arm, a decrease (-11) in CD4 cell count from baseline was reported, compared to an increase (+63) in the control arm; however, the difference was not significant (p=0.734). In 35% of the participants in the STI arm, viral reversion took place, which did not affect virologic response. The investigators concluded that prior to switching salvage regimens, attempting STI failed to provide any immunologic or virologic benefit. </P>
<P>A.7. <LINK REF="STD-Walmsley-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Walmsley 2005</LINK> reported data from the CTN 164 trial, involving 134 participants and aimed to assess the benefit of an STI before switching to an optimized treatment regimen. Participants were randomized to a 12 week STI followed by optimized salvage therapy (STI arm) or to an immediate switch to optimized salvage therapy (IS arm). If the participant's health deteriorated in the STI arm, treatment was initiated early. The trial was stopped early to accrual due to slow recruitment. The original target sample size was 200; however, data on 134 participants were reported. Participants were followed for 60 weeks post-randomization.</P>
<P>The primary outcome of this trial was to detect the proportion of patients who achieve a reduction in viral load &lt;50 copies/ml after at least three months on salvage therapy. This endpoint was achieved by 55% participants in the STI arm and 69% participants in the IS arm (p=0.11). Although the reported reductions in HIV RNA in both STI and control arms, were similar from baseline, (-1.7 log cop/ml) the differences in CD4 counts between the two arms, i.e., IS (+95) and STI (+25) arms were significant (p&lt;0.04). Therefore, there was a statistically lower CD4 cell count rise but similar load reduction at 60 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Walmsley-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Walmsley 2005</LINK>) To conclude, a 12-week STI prior to switching salvage therapy did not improve outcomes. </P>
<P>A.8. The OPTIMA trial is still ongoing and remains blinded to randomization assignment. The study is designed with a targeted sample size of 504 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Kyriakides-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kyriakides 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Singer-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 2006</LINK>, the design of the OPTIMA trial is elucidated. This trial compares three month fixed duration STI arms (called "ART drug-free period" or ARTDFP) to no ART drug-free period arms. It also compares ARTDFP followed by optimized standard ART (&lt;4 drugs) or mega-ART (&gt;5 drugs) salvage regimens. It aims to evaluate differences between mega-ART and standard ART on virologic response, and to assess differences in clinical outcomes (aids or death, and aids related events), and quality of life between the two (ARDFP and non ARDFP) arms. Clinicians are allowed to terminate the ARTDFP earlier than 3 months, if they find that patients are deteriorating.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Brown-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2004</LINK> presented preliminary reports on the OPTIMA trial, showing available data in 255 participants, with a median follow-up of 11 months. These results remain blinded to the randomization arm, so no conclusions as to the utility of STI or mega-HAART can yet be made from this trial.</P>
<P>
<B>B. Non-randomized studies:</B>
<BR/>Non-randomized studies, of sample sizes from 9-77, attempted unplanned and planned interruptions of fixed and variable durations (9-49 days), with documentation of effects of interruption. These were small pilot studies that helped in the development of hypotheses and rationale for attempting STI in treatment failure category. Characteristics of participants and effects of interruptions and ART resumption are summarized in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>. The effects of STI after the resumption of ART are documented in the subsequent section. </P>

<P>
<B>Summary of results across studies: </B>
</P>
<P>The principal findings of individual studies have been reported below.</P>
<P>B.1. <LINK REF="STD-Deeks-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Deeks 2003</LINK> reported results of their study of 24 participants. A single STI of variable duration (median 20 weeks) was attempted. The authors suggest that post ART resumption, viral suppression (&lt;200 HIV RNA copies/ml) could be possible on a regimen with one active drug.</P>
<P>B.2. <LINK REF="STD-Delaugerre-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Delaugerre 2001</LINK>, in their prospective study in 20 participants, reported results of a fixed 8-week treatment interruption. On ART resumption, rapid detection of drug mutations was noted. Duration of interruption emerged as a significant predictor of viral reversion. There was a greater genotypic reversion in protease inhibitor-treated patients, as compared to nucleoside analogue-resistant patients.</P>
<P>B.3. <LINK REF="STD-Ghosn--2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ghosn 2005</LINK>, in their REVERT study of 23 participants, investigated the impact of interruptions of 24 weeks median duration (12-37). In this single-arm study, participants interrupted therapy and resumed salvage GigHAART therapy on reversion of resistance mutations to at least two drug classes. At baseline, CD4 count was 43(1-372), and VL was 5.14(4.51-5.69), with evidence of genotypic resistance. At the end of STI, an increase (70%) in viral susceptibility to three drugs in 70% (16/23) participants was reported. AIDS-defining events in 66% participants were also reported. Significant viral reversions led to no virologic and immunologic benefit. The authors concluded that in patients failing therapy, i.e., with low CD4&lt;200, reversion of resistance mutations was not successful in restoring the efficacy of a salvage regimen, and was clinically deleterious.</P>
<P>B.4. <LINK REF="STD-Halfon-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Halfon 2003</LINK> reported results of a 3-month single treatment interruption in 11 patients. A complete reversion of mutant to wild-type virus and a sharp reduction in the number of mutations was seen in 45% of participants.</P>
<P>B.5. <LINK REF="STD-Izopet-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Izopet 2000</LINK> reported results of a 3-month fixed single treatment interruption followed by salvage therapy in 38 participants. Treatment interruption led to a median increase in HIV RNA of 0.4 log10, a median decrease in CD4 cell count of 43 cells/mm3, and a shift to wild-type virus in 61% patients. This study suggested in patients where HIV disease was not very advanced, a three-month treatment interruption could be considered in optimizing salvage therapy. The genotypic shift was best predicted by clinical stage of HIV infection.</P>
<P>B.6. <LINK REF="STD-Jaafar-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jaafar 2004</LINK> investigated a fixed 3-month interruption in 77 patients. In a multivariate model, the factor associated with a genotypic shift was a high nadir CD4 cell count (OR 9.15). The predictors of virologic response to ART resumption were genotypic shift (OR 11.68), a shorter time on failing ART (OR 3.6), and a lower HIV RNA level before treatment resumption (OR 2.83). Sustained virologic response was best predicted by use of a NNRTI in NNRTI-naïve patients (OR 4.89). The authors reported no significant differences in viral rebound and CD4 cell loss during STI between patients with and without a genotypic shift.</P>
<P>B.7. <LINK REF="STD-Miller--2000" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2000</LINK> conducted the first prospective cohort study, the Frankfurt cohort, and reported on the effects of resuming ART, post-interruption. Forty-eight participants were studied, in whom treatment interruptions of variable durations were undertaken, with documentation of outcomes. During treatment interruption, participants experienced a shift toward genotypic reversion in drug resistance within the virus population, and CD4 decline. Predictors of improvement in response to ART resumption in a multivariate model were: 1) pre-treatment VL (hazard ratio 0.33); 2) genotypic shift (hazard ratio 5.22); and 3) new drugs in the ART regimen (hazard ratio 2.12).</P>
<P>B.8. <LINK REF="STD-Verhofstede-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Verhofstede 1999</LINK> investigated the effects of STI of variable durations in nine patients with high viral loads at baseline. Interruptions led to replacement of the mutant virus by wild-type virus fourteen days after treatment interruption.</P>
<P>B.9 <LINK REF="STD-Youle-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Youle 2000</LINK>, in their study of 35 participants, reported on interruptions of variable duration. Treatment interruption resulted in a significant decline in CD4 cell count (median CD4 cell count 125 cells/mm3 at baseline dropping to 83 cells/mm3, p&lt;0.008).</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>We have summarized the currently available evidence on the effects of structured treatment interruption in patients with drug-resistant virus and chronic unsuppressed HIV disease, despite being on HAART. </P>
<P>
<B>A. Non-randomized trials:</B>
<BR/>Non-randomized trials investigated the impact of fixed and variable durations of interruptions, but were limited by small sample sizes (&lt;100) and the absence of control groups. Durations of follow-up were short. Overall, however, a pattern was evident across studies. </P>
<P>An improvement in drug susceptibility, with genotypic shift towards wild-type virus, and a decline in CD4 and viral rebound were reported as a result of STI. In two studies, significant viral reversions failed to restore efficacy of salvage ART (<LINK REF="STD-Ghosn--2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ghosn 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jaafar-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jaafar 2004</LINK>). Predictors of genotypic shift were: 1) high baseline CD4 (<LINK REF="STD-Miller--2000" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2000</LINK>); 2) high nadir CD4 (<LINK REF="STD-Jaafar-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jaafar 2004</LINK>); 3) clinical stage of HIV infection (<LINK REF="STD-Izopet-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Izopet 2000</LINK>); and 4) duration of interruption (<LINK REF="STD-Delaugerre-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Delaugerre 2001</LINK>). The progression of HIV infection was hypothesized to be a factor of increased viral fitness of re-emergent wild-type virus, and its effect on the immune system. </P>
<P>Responses after ART resumption were reported in a few studies. Viral suppression was better restored in those participants resuming therapy containing at least one active drug (<LINK REF="STD-Deeks-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Deeks 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ghosn--2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ghosn 2005</LINK>). Predictors of favorable response to ART resumption were: 1) a shorter time on the failing regimen (<LINK REF="STD-Jaafar-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jaafar 2004</LINK>); 2) a lower HIV level before treatment resumption (<LINK REF="STD-Jaafar-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jaafar 2004</LINK>); 3) genotypic shift (<LINK REF="STD-Jaafar-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jaafar 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller--2000" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2000</LINK>); and 4) an increased number of drugs in the optimized regimen (<LINK REF="STD-Miller--2000" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2000</LINK>). </P>
<P>The ART salvage regimen used post-STI played a major role in affecting response to resumption after interruption of therapy. This offered a clue to the introduction of newer drug classes with significant antiviral activity in multi-drug resistant patients. <LINK REF="STD-Ghosn--2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ghosn 2005</LINK> also concluded that in patients failing therapy, reversion of resistant mutations within viral populations failed to restore ART efficacy. As discussed by <LINK REF="STD-Ghosn--2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ghosn 2005</LINK>, the number of active drugs in the salvage regimen was important in deciding the ART post-resumption. The issue of use of active drugs was first raised by <LINK REF="STD-Deeks-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Deeks 2003</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Miller--2000" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2000</LINK> had similarly suggested the role of continued treatment in the setting of treatment failure in the light of risks of CD4 decline during treatment interruption.</P>
<P>Frequent monitoring of patients undergoing treatment interruption in controlled settings was recommended by all authors. A need for randomized studies of large sample sizes was also raised by the trials.<BR/> <BR/>
<B>B. Randomized controlled trials </B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Evidence from three landmark trials (CPCRA 064, Retrogene, GigHAART trials)</B>
</P>
<P>Similar results were reported in RCT by <LINK REF="STD-Lawrence-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lawrence 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ruiz-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ruiz 2003</LINK>, with a significant decrease in CD4 cell counts and rise in HIV RNA during STI, and no virologic or immunologic benefit from STI. </P>
<P>However, divergent results were reported in the RCT by <LINK REF="STD-Katlama-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Katlama 2004</LINK>. These divergent results were a greater virologic success, increase in CD4 cell count and greater log reduction in STI arm post STI compared to the no-STI control arm. In a multivariate model, the major predictors of virologic success were treatment interruption, reversion to wild-type virus, adequate plasma drug concentration, and use of lopinavir (<LINK REF="STD-Katlama-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Katlama 2004</LINK>)</P>
<P>Potential factors contributing to the difference in results between these trials include the differences in sample size, baseline characteristics of participants, STI durations, and the prescribed ART salvage regimens as enumerated below. </P>
<P>1) Sample size: Two RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Katlama-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Katlama 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ruiz-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ruiz 2003</LINK>) had small sample sizes, (46, 68), while one RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Lawrence-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lawrence 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lawrence-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lawrence 2005</LINK>) had a moderately-sized sample of 274. </P>
<P>2) Study populations: The GigHAART trial (<LINK REF="STD-Katlama-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Katlama 2004</LINK>) targeted patients with advanced HIV disease and low baseline CD4 cell counts (median CD4 = 27 cells/mm3), while CPCRA 064 trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lawrence-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lawrence 2003</LINK>) had no CD4 entry criteria and enrolled patients with moderate HIV disease and median CD4 of 153 cells/mm3. The Retrogene study (<LINK REF="STD-Ruiz-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ruiz 2003</LINK>) participants had less advanced disease and higher baseline CD4 counts (median CD4 =339 cells/mm3). </P>
<P>3) STI duration: STI durations also varied across these trials. The GigHAART study attempted 2 months STI; the Retrogene study, 3 months; and CPCRA 064, 4 months. (<LINK REF="STD-Katlama-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Katlama 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lawrence-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lawrence 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ruiz-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ruiz 2003</LINK>)</P>
<P>4) ART regimen: While drugs in the optimized ART regimens were similar in the Retrogene and CPCRA 064 trials (i.e., 4-5 drug regimens), they were different in GigHAART trial (i.e., 8-9 drugs including hydroxyurea). This could also explain differences in responses to STI post ART resumption in the GigHAART trial (<LINK REF="STD-Katlama-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Katlama 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lawrence-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lawrence 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ruiz-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ruiz 2003</LINK>)</P>
<P>
<B>Evidence from other randomized trials (ACTG 5086, CTN 164, and others) </B>
</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Benson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Benson 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Deeks-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Deeks 2001</LINK>, the sample size of the studies were small, however, no significant virologic and immunologic benefit were reported. The ACTG 5086 trial was stopped prematurely due to poor recruitment. Due to a small sample size (41), the study was underpowered to detect differences between the two groups (STI and continuous therapy) arm.</P>
<P>Another larger trial, the CTN 164 with a sample size 134 was closed early to accrual due to poor recruitment (<LINK REF="STD-Walmsley-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Walmsley 2005</LINK>). In 67 participants in STI arm, a pattern of no significant immunologic and virologic benefit was reported. Although the study was not powered to examine clinical endpoints, there were a greater number of AIDS defining events noted in the STI arm. In summary, there was no benefit accrued to STI and some suggestion of harm.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Beatty-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Beatty 2005</LINK> reported trial results using Enfuvirtide (ENF) in the salvage regimen subsequent to attempting a 16 week STI. As a result of STI, an expected drop in CD4 in STI arm and viral rebound, was noted. But post resumption of Enfuvirtide based regimen, the reduction in VL to undetectable was less compared to control arm. There was no virologic benefit, and treatment response was best predicted by phenotypic susceptibility at baseline. This study also was limited by a small sample size (47), and a short study follow-up of 24 weeks. This study challenged the speculation of better response with new antiretrovirals (ENF). However, the results reported suggested no virologic benefit due to STI.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Currently ongoing trial </B>
<BR/>OPTIMA trial is currently ongoing and the primary endpoint results remain blinded as to randomization assignment. Therefore, conclusions as to the utility of STI and/or mega-HAART in this patient population cannot yet be made from this trial (<LINK REF="STD-Holodniy-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Holodniy 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kyriakides-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kyriakides 2002</LINK>).</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Based on the results of recently reported trials, there were reports of no significant virologic or immunologic benefit due to STI, before switching to an optimized salvage regimen in patients with chronic unsuppressed HIV infection (treatment failure) and multi-drug resistant HIV. There is strong evidence that STI leads to CD4 decline during treatment interruption and is likely to have a prolonged negative impact on CD4 response even after treatment is resumed. This appears to translate into an increased risk of progression of disease events, although the difference in risk between those who undergo a single STI and those remaining on continuous salvage therapy may wane over time after ARVs have been resumed. </P>
<P>To conclude, based on the studies we reviewed, there is no evidence to support the use of STI in this patient population.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>A standardized method for reporting of all important outcomes (measures of effect such as hazard ratios, risk ratios) needs to be emphasized. This will aid comparability across trials. Use of CONSORT guidelines for reporting of trials will be useful in this regard. Evaluation of success of STI strategies in terms of in terms of consistent definitions of primary and secondary end points will greatly aid comparability across trials. </P>
<P>Trials designed with adequate power to determine differences in clinical endpoints and follow up of longer durations will help assess the true clinical impact of interventions over time. These will also help assess safety, efficacy and applicability of STI. Two large trials, CPCRA and OPTIMA, have been designed with primary clinical endpoints to explore these questions (<LINK REF="STD-Brown-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lawrence-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lawrence 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singer-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 2006</LINK>). The unblinded results from the OPTIMA study are eagerly awaited (<LINK REF="STD-Brown-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holodniy-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Holodniy 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kyriakides-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kyriakides 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singer-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 2006</LINK>). <BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Overall evidence</B> </P>
<P>To conclude, based on the studies we reviewed, the evidence in this category primarily supports a lack of benefit of STI before switching therapy, in patients with unsuppressed HIV viremia despite ART. There is no evidence that viral reversion of resistance during STI results in an improvement in response to subsequent antiretroviral therapy. There is no net virologic or immunologic benefit accrued to STI before switching to an optimized salvage regimen. Importantly, there is evidence of harm from STI in patients with relatively advanced HIV disease, including an immediate decline in CD4 cell count during the STI period, followed by a prolonged negative impact on CD4 recovery, even after ART re-initiation. This suggests an increased risk of clinical disease progression although the difference in risk of a single STI compared with continuous salvage therapy may wane over time once ART is resumed.</P>
<P>Based on the studies we reviewed, the vast majority of evidence suggests greater harm than good from interrupting ART, in chronically HIV-infected individuals who have treatment failure with multi-drug resistant HIV. The evidence does not support the use of STI in this setting.</P>
