We will ask Liz to run an up-to-date search and amend the search dates &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have entered the clinical data using GIV to match the ANCOVA results reported in Wright, and amended the text to be in keeping with the discussion and conclusions in &lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Wright 2009&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Wright 2009&lt;/a&gt;. The SoF table has also been revised to reflect the confidence intervals from this single study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma's notes 15/06/2012&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The points raised by the feedback contributor unfortunately continues to be an issue in this review update. Meenu, please could you read through the feedback and my comments and revise the review in light of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What ar&lt;span&gt;e fitteses? I think this needs some sort of plain language description. I don't think you should be using new words in the abstract that have not been used in the review so you must revise one or the other. &lt;/span&gt;Is this to do with dustmites or is it to do with humidity control? The background needs to be clearer - we have a Cochrane review on controlling house dustmites for asthma which you should be aware of, and reference.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;ANS:&lt;/span&gt; This was a typing mistake. Has been corrected. There is no such term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Background&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What kind of studies were the ones supporting use of humidifiers? case control? Observational?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm not clear whether dehumidifiers or humidifiers are under investigation - the background needs to be set out clearly. As it needs a re-write anyway, I have activated the required headings which have been introduced since the original review was written, so please use them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;please be consistent between &amp;quot;dust mite&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;dustmite&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANS It is RCTs &amp;amp; dehumidifiers are under investigation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is mechanical ventilation with heat recovery? please explain and comment on how it alters humidity - does it increase or decrease it?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Need to discuss the risk of bias and not Jadad and link to the risk of bias figure which I have added for you&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;need to structure according to the order of outcomes selected&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Warner - what were the interventions of interest? you talk about 4 arms, but do not make it clear what is of interest and why&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;we don't use meta view - we use RevMan!! Please correct&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm not sure what this means or how it relates to asthma control and what is AH and RH? &amp;quot;All humidity analysis were performed by using AH values rather than RH values because this permitted a direct comparison between indoor and outdoor conditions . Analysis of covariance showed a highly significant difference ( p &amp;lt; 0.001) between the MVHR &amp;amp; non-MVHR groups. The houses with MVHR had a lower bedroom humidity than the non-MVHR houses over the whole test period, both winter and summer. The difference was greater in winter , being 0.73 g/kg at an outdoor humidity of 5g/kg &amp;amp; 0.38 at an outdoor humidity of 10g/kg.&amp;quot; It is not clear to me what comparison group you used. I would assume MVHR vs no intervention - but it would be interesting perhaps to know if the HEVC added anything - although this should arguably wait until the discussion if you wish to make a point around (potential) effects being due to reduction of allergens rather than increase in humidity. What do you think? Please elaborate in the review.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wright 2009&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;again, meta view doesn't exist&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;you must insert a link to the forest plots to which you refer (use the insert link button to the left of the &amp;#937; button)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;data should be entered in the format: (SMD 0.08; 95% CI -0.31 to 0.47) please amend&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;you start talking about humidity levels in different rooms without having stated in which the humidifier was installed, can you please be clearer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;please delete the figures - I don't think they add much considering how light the review is on data and that you haven't felt it important to link to them&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANS: It is Revman&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANS: links inserted in the text part&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disucssion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;this sentence doesn't make sense to me &amp;quot;The focus of this review was oriented towards patient outcomes. Therefore, whilst the data reported in those studies may have a relevance to the issue of reducing allergen exposure, they could not be used in our review.&amp;quot; The effects of interventions includes discussion of house dustmite reduction and humidity levels so the review is not internally consistent&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;what does measuring Dr p 1 mean? You talk about it being used in a skin prick test, and then talk about it in terms of levels, so I assume that the meta-analyses are about how much Dr p 1 was present in the house - which does not appear to be an asthma outcome - or is it?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;what do you mean by patient outcomes?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;you cannot use the term humidifiers and dehumidifiers interchangeably &amp;quot;One possible solution would be to incorporate timing devices into the &lt;span&gt;dehumidifying&lt;/span&gt; devices themselves. &lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Warner 2000&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Warner 2000&lt;/a&gt; did in fact incorporate such a device in the vacuum cleaner, but not the &lt;span&gt;humidifiers&lt;/span&gt;. &amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;YOu go back and forth between saying that asthma symptoms are not changed and that the studies support the use of humidity devices. Can you please rationalise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANS:Skin prick test has been done to check for the allergic response to Dr p 1 &amp;amp; measurment of Dr p 1 has been done in the surroundings like Bed, bedroom so as to co-relate the probability of an allergic response and also it tells about the effect of decrease in humidity on environmental factors for asthma&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANS : patient outcomes include&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Airway function (FEV1 and PEFR)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Asthma symptoms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use of rescue bronchodilator medication&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Daily steroid use&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exacerbations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Emergency room attendance/unscheduled clinic visits&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hospital admissions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Health status (Quality of life)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bronchial hyperresponsiveness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Skin reactivity to moulds or house dust mite&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANS: Study support the use of dehumidifying devices&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data and analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The comparison tree is set up wrong. The comparison of &amp;quot;humidifier versus no intervention&amp;quot; and then each outcome should be listed underneath - let me know if you don't know how to do this&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;totals need to be turned off as you only have one study contributing data therefore you cannot 'pool' it. open up the forest plot and hit the 'cogs' button to change this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANS: labels have been changed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANS: Totals have been turned off&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miscellaneous&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Characteristics of included studies. you should not link to figures here - links must go in the main text&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Characteristic of excluded studies - as outcome measures were not an inclusion criteria, it is not necessary to include that information here&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;contributions of authors - reads as per a protocol. please update&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is no longer acceptable to use the term asthmatics - please find and replace&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What happened to the ongoing study Thompson? Please reinstate it under the correct heading - presumably it's been published and excluded?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANS: Outcome measures are inclusion criteria they are mentioned as&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Airway function (FEV1 and PEFR)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Asthma symptoms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use of rescue bronchodilator medication&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Daily steroid use&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exacerbations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Emergency room attendance/unscheduled clinic visits&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hospital admissions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Health status (Quality of life)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bronchial hyperresponsiveness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Skin reactivity to moulds or house dust mite&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANS: Asthmatics has been replaced&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANS: Thomsons study is the same study as &lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Wright 2009&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Wright 2009&lt;/a&gt;.

<P>A second trial has been added for the 2013 update of this review. The original open-label trial compared an intervention consisting of mechanical ventilation heat recovery system with or without high efficiency vacuum cleaner fitted in 40 homes of patients with asthma who had positive tests for sensitivity to house dust mite. The new double-blind trial also compared a mechanical ventilation heat recovery system with a placebo machine in the homes of 120 adults with allergy to house dust mite. The new trial, which was at low risk of bias, showed no significant difference in morning peak flow (mean difference (MD) 13.59; 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.66 to 29.84), which was the primary outcome of the trial. However, there was a statistically significant improvement in evening peak flow only (MD 24.56; 95% CI 8.97 to 40.15). There was no significant difference in quality of life, rescue medication, requirement for oral corticosteroids, visits to the GP, emergency department (ED) or hospitalisations for asthma. There was no significant difference in the house dust mite count and the antigen levels in the new trial, in contrast to the previous trial.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2013-03-15 13:55:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-03-04 09:54:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Moisture content or humidity of inspired air has been variously studied in relation to asthma symptoms, control of the disease and airway response to exercise. There are studies that demonstrate attenuation of broncho-provocative response to exercise when administered along with humidity increase in the inspired air (<LINK REF="REF-Boulet-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boulet 1991</LINK>), whereas an increase in humidity of the ambient air in the natural habitat of individuals with asthma has been shown to increase asthma symptoms due to an increase in the mould and house dust mite content in the environment (<LINK REF="STD-Korsgaard-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Korsgaard 1983</LINK>). Humidity control measures in the form of provision of mechanical ventilation to the houses have been used to decrease the house dust mite content (<LINK REF="STD-Crane-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Crane 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is however, no consensus on whether such measures help in the control of asthma. The consensus statements on management of asthma recommend the reduction of indoor humidity to less than 50% as a desirable action to control dust mite population, which is an important allergen source causing and leading to increase in symptoms of asthma, in sensitised individuals.</P>
<P>Humidity plays an important role in determining the house dust mite count in the indoor environment. House dust mite has been shown to be a very important allergen. Indoor humidity also leads to breeding of fungi in the home, which can also cause asthma. Recent times have seen measures being introduced to control indoor humidity in order to decrease the prevalence of these respiratory allergens. These measures include provision of healthy and well-ventilated homes, use of portable and fixed dehumidifiers, mechanical ventilation and behavioural intervention. However, it is not known how useful these measures are in the management of patients with chronic asthma.The present review studies the effect of using dehumidification of ambient air in the home environment of patients with asthma using various devices.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-03-04 09:53:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Asthma is a chronic disease characterised by recurrent attacks of breathlessness and wheezing, which vary in severity and frequency from person to person. Symptoms may occur several times in a day or a week in affected individuals, and for some people become worse during physical activity or at night. Recurrent asthma symptoms frequently cause sleeplessness, daytime fatigue, reduced activity levels and school and work absenteeism. Asthma has a relatively low fatality rate compared to other chronic diseases. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 235 million people currently suffer from asthma. Asthma is the most common chronic disease among children. Asthma is a public health problem not just for high-income countries; it occurs in all countries regardless of the level of development. Most asthma-related deaths occur in low- and lower-middle income countries. Asthma is under-diagnosed and under-treated. It creates a substantial burden to individuals and families and often restricts individuals&#8217; activities for a lifetime.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-11-20 15:08:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Higher humidity levels may worsen asthma as a warm humid environment favours the growth of house dust mite, fungus and moulds which can act as allergens and trigger asthma.</P>
<P>Here we have studied dehumidification i.e. decreasing the humidity levels of ambient air as an additional intervention to control the symptoms of asthma. Dehumidification is achieved by using mechanical ventilation and heat recovery systems.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-11-20 17:42:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The intervention might work by decreasing the humidity levels and all its attendant risks such as breeding of dust mite and proliferation of fungal spores.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-03-04 09:54:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Many studies have been conducted using dehumidifiers in the homes of patients with asthma. However, there is no consensus whether this intervention is clinically useful. These studies are difficult to do and are reasonably expensive. Hence there is a need to appraise the evidence on this topic.</P>

<P>The systematic search for studies yielded 178 potentially relevant studies. Ten studies were considered for inclusion into the review. There were five studies in which randomisation had been used (<LINK REF="STD-Hyndman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hyndman 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Warner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Warner 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morgan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Morgan 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Burr-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Burr 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wright-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wright 2009</LINK>). However, studies which emphasised the environmental control of humidity and its effect mainly on the house dust mite were excluded.The <LINK REF="STD-Hyndman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hyndman 2000</LINK> study was examined closely by review authors, but was eventually excluded as the overall focus of the study was on the impact of portable humidifiers on the domestic environment, rather than on the effect of air humidification on asthma symptoms.</P>
<P>An updated search in November 2011 identified a study which was excluded on the grounds that the environmental intervention provided was a number of measures aimed at reducing domestic moulds (<LINK REF="STD-Kercsmar-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kercsmar 2006</LINK>). Another trial <LINK REF="STD-Morgan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Morgan 2004</LINK> was excluded as they had used a specific educational intervention for environmental control.

<P>One study was included in the original review (<LINK REF="STD-Warner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Warner 2000</LINK>) and a second study has been added for this update (<LINK REF="STD-Wright-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wright 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Warner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Warner 2000</LINK> studied 40 patients in a parallel randomised control trial over 12 months. They had used mechanical ventilation with heat recovery (MVHR) and high efficiency vacuum cleaning (HEVC) in one group, MVHR alone in the other and HEVC alone in the third and no intervention in the fourth group. The MVHR units consisted of a heat exchanger and two fans with a manually operated boost switch for the bathroom and an EU4 filter on the supply (the MVHR units were purchased by EA Technology and installed by ADM Indux). The system was a pleated filter, which had a greater than 90% efficiency of trapping particles of greater than 5 µm and was aimed at trapping pollen grains and larger inhalable particulates. Patients with moderate to severe asthma who were using prophylactic medication were recruited from asthma clinics at Southampton University Trust Hospitals. A housing questionnaire was filled in to determine the suitability of the participants home for installation of the MVHR unit. Daily symptom diary cards and twice daily peak expiratory flow (PEF) rate with a Wright's peak flow meter were recorded before the study started and for one month prior to domiciliary visits. Patients with FEV1 less than 80% of predicted values were not subjected to histamine challenge. Twenty-seven patients had an assessment of histamine challenge. The study consisted of four treatment arms. Group 1 was allocated to receive a MVHR in bedrooms and bathrooms plus HEVC. Group 2 was allocated to receive MVHR alone, group three received HEVC alone. Group 4 received no intervention and served as the control group. Initially 40 homes were to be included in the trial, of which 10 were subsequently deemed unfit to accommodate the MVHR unit. Thirty homes were then randomised between all four groups, and the 10 deemed unsuitable for the MVHR were randomly allocated to the last two non-MVHR groups. Detailed information on clinical symptoms and lung functions was not provided.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Wright-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wright 2009</LINK> studied 119 asthmatic patients who were allergic to house dust mite, in a parallel, double-blind, randomised trial over 12 months. They used MHRV in one group and no intervention in the other group. MHRV units were fitted in the roof space or hallway cupboard in 120 suitable homes by 'Vent-Axia (Crawley,UK). These energy efficient units extract air continuously from the kitchen and bathroom and deliver pre-warmed air via insulated ducts into the bedroom and living room. The system provided an additional 0.5 air exchanges per hour to the living room and bedroom. Patients between 16 to 60 years of age were recruited from general practice and hospital clinics in Lanarkshire, Scotland, U.K. One hundred and nineteen homes were randomised between two groups out of which 18 were protocol violators and one withdrew from the study; therefore, 53 houses were installed with an active MHRV and 47 were in the control group, in which the MHRV was installed but not activated. Patients were included on the basis of variable airflow obstruction of &#8805;12 % on spirometry or &#8805;15% on PEF readings or a symptom score of &#8805;0.86 on Asthma Control Questionnaire, Minimum FEV1 of the patients was more than 50% predicted at baseline and they did not have an exacerbation in the previous month. Allergy to <I>Der P </I>was determined according to a positive skin prick test. After surveying, houses were installed with MHRV system, participants were followed up at three, six, nine and 12 months after randomisation. A daily symptom diary was recorded and participants measured morning and evening PEF for two weeks before each visits. Spirometry was performed at each visit. </P>

<P>The methodological quality of the eligible controlled trials was assessed as per the 'Risk of bias' tables which evaluate the reported quality of randomisation, blinding, and description of withdrawals and dropouts. This quality assessment was carried out independently by two review authors (Meenu Singh and Nishant Jaiswal).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Warner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Warner 2000</LINK> was deemed as being of low quality by both review authors. The reporting in the study was not explicit enough to have obtained a higher score, and the absence of blinding by not introducing a dummy humidifier as a control measure also prevented the authors from conferring it a higher score. Moreover, the trial was not fully randomised.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Warner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Warner 2000</LINK>:  Due to the absence of data for the 30 households that were randomised over the four groups, we were unable to impute any numerical data from the study. The trial authors report that no significant differences were found between any of the four randomised groups for any of the patient outcomes, including symptom scores, pulmonary function tests and histamine challenge test. The patients in intervention group (MVHR) showed higher PC20 values in a histamine challenge test, than those without intervention (control) but it did not reach significance (P = 0.085). Allergen and house dust mite levels in mattresses and sofas did not decrease significantly. However, allergen and house dust mite levels were significantly reduced in the bedroom carpets of trial participants allocated to the MVHR and the MVHR plus HEVC groups (P = 0.05).<BR/>
<BR/>All humidity analysis were performed by using Absolute Humidity (AH) values rather than Relative Humidity (RH) values because this permitted a direct comparison between indoor and outdoor conditions. Analysis of covariance showed a highly significant difference in humidity ( P &lt; 0.001) between the MVHR and non-MVHR groups. The houses with MVHR had a lower bedroom humidity than the non-MVHR houses over the whole test period, both winter and summer. The difference was greater in winter, being 0.73 g/kg at an outdoor humidity of 5g/kg and 0.38 g/kg at an outdoor humidity of 10g/kg.<BR/>
<BR/>Efforts to obtain extraneous data for the 30 households randomised across the four groups have not been successful.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Wright-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wright 2009</LINK>: A total of 100 patients in 100 houses were analysed in this trial (53 on MHRV and 47 on placebo). The trial authors reported that change in mean morning percent predicted PEF, from baseline to 12 months, did not differ between the MHRV group and the control group (mean difference (MD) 13.59; 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.66 to 29.84, <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>) when compared using an adjusted difference (ANCOVA). However; there was a significant improvement in the MHRV group compared with control group in the mean evening PEF (MD 24.56; 95% CI 8.97 to 40.15, <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). There was no significant difference in change from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 (MD 1.32; 95% CI -2.55 to 5.19, <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>) or daily symptoms including use of rescue medicines (MD -0.04; 95% CI -1.00 to 0.92, <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>), Asthma Contol Score (MD -0.25; 95% CI -0.58 to 0.08, <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>), or St George&#8217;s Respiratory Questionare score (MD -2.83; 95% CI -7.82 to 2.16, <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>), There was also no significant difference in the number of participants who suffered an exacerbation requiring oral corticosteroids (odds ratio (OR) 0.52; 95% CI 0.22 to 1.24, <LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>), GP visits (OR 0.29; 95% CI 0.01 to 7.28, <LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>) or emergency department (ED) visits (OR 1.84; 95% CI 0.32 to 10.52, <LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>) or hospitalisations (OR 0.09; 95% CI 0.00 to 1.72, <LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>). The &#8216;per protocol&#8217; analysis provided similar results to the intention-to-treat analysis. No adverse event was reported relating to the installation of the MHRV unit. The median (interquartile range) per cent of time homes achieved a reduction in the indoor relative humidity below 50% was greater in the MHRV group than in the control group in the bedroom [45.1% (30.0 to 55.1) versus 21.0(8.5 to 49.0), P = 0.001]  but not in the living room [51.5% (35.4 to 58.7) versus 40.6% (12.8 to 63.5), P = 0.26]. At 12 months the changes in the mean Der P 1 and Der P 2 concentration as compared with the baseline concentrations, did not differ between the MHRV group and control group, nor were  there differences in total or house dust mite specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-03-11 11:51:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Dehumidifiers have been used in the environmental control of homes of patients with asthma (<LINK REF="STD-Warner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Warner 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wright-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wright 2009</LINK>). Other studies have looked at the levels of dust mite concentrations, mould eradication and other non-patient centred outcomes as primary outcome measures (<LINK REF="STD-Harving-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Harving 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hyndman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hyndman 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morgan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Morgan 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Burr-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Burr 2007</LINK>). The focus of this review was oriented towards patient outcomes. Therefore, whilst data reported in those studies may have a relevance to the issue of reducing allergen exposure, they could not be used in our review.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Warner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Warner 2000</LINK> study that has studied clinical outcomes in patients with asthma has not reported the results in detail. Their reported results do not reveal any benefit from using dehumidification on patient outcomes. The randomisation procedure was inadequate for the purpose of this review, as 10 homes were randomised only between the non-MVHR groups (groups three and four). The authors did not specify how many children from the subsequent 30 homes were allocated between all groups. Hence, the evidence from randomised controlled trials is scarce and is of low quality, preventing us from commenting on the usefulness of dehumidifiers in control of chronic asthma.</P>
<P>Adherence to the treatment regimens in these studies has also proved difficult to determine. Unlike in drug trials where levels of a drug can be determined by laboratory tests, domiciliary visits by the trial investigators represent possibly the only way to ensure that the treatment regimens are maintained (<LINK REF="REF-Wood-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 1998</LINK>). One possible solution would be to incorporate timing devices into the dehumidifying devices themselves. <LINK REF="STD-Warner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Warner 2000</LINK> did in fact incorporate such a device in the vacuum cleaner, but not the dehumidifiers. If participants in the study were not running their dehumidifiers for long stretches of time, this was not reflected in the data reported in the published study, and may have affected the MVHR's efficacy. <LINK REF="STD-Warner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Warner 2000</LINK> also reported that not all participants completed diary cards, and this may be indicative of poor adherence to the study protocol.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Wright-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wright 2009</LINK> study studied clinical outcomes in patients with asthma and was considered to be at low risk of bias <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>. Daily symptoms including use of rescue medicines, Asthma Control Score, St George&#8217;s Respiratory Questionare score, requirement for oral corticosteroids, GP or ED visits or hospitalisations with asthma did not differ significantly in two groups. The results showed an improvement in the evening PEF readings of the MHRV group as compared with the control group, and there was no significant difference in FEV1. The morning PEF changes were internally consistent with these evening changes of PEF but did not achieve statistical significance, possibly because the study was insufficiently powered to demonstrate a clinical response as only 100 out of 119 could complete follow-up. There was significant number of dropouts i.e. out of 120 houses only 100 could be evaluated at the end of the trial as one participant defaulted , six were protocol violators from MHRV group and 12 from the control group. One from the MHRV group withdrew consent. It was clear that reduced relative humidity was insufficient to impact on <I>Der P 1</I> burden &amp; there was no difference between the groups in change in serum house dust mite specific IgE antibody. <LINK REF="STD-Wright-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wright 2009</LINK> also reported that with MHRV intervention, there was a more prolonged and more significant reduction in relative humidity in bedrooms, and that <I>Der P 1</I> levels were lower in bedding, which is arguably the most important exposure.</P>

<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with portable or fixed domestic dehumidification measures are difficult to perform. The results from a high quality RCT leave considerable uncertainty about dehumidifiers in the UK. The results cannot be generalised to hot climatic conditions where similar trials may be needed. The adherence to treatment regimens should, where possible, be followed up and reported. Double-blinding should be used, using dummy dehumidifiers. Asthma outcomes being measured should include clinical parameters, pulmonary functions, quality of life measures and adverse events, including financial burden.</P>
