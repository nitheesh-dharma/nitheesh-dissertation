<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-08-08 08:53:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>People with diabetes can develop foot ulcers. These are often due to reduced blood supply, reduced sensation, a change in the amount of movement in the lower leg, a foot deformity or the presence of some trauma. Therapies for foot ulcers include pressure reducing or relieving footwear and wound care through frequent dressing changes. Healing the wound can be delayed by poor control of blood sugar levels, compliance with therapies and the amount of bacteria on the wound surface. Foot ulcers in people with diabetes frequently become infected. Silver is an antimicrobial and dressings which contain silver have been developed. The authors of this Cochrane review wanted to find evidence on whether silver based dressings reduced infection and encouraged wound healing. They searched the medical literature for randomised and controlled clinical trials but found no studies which were eligible for inclusion in the review. We therefore do not know if silver containing dressings and topical agents containing silver are beneficial to diabetic foot ulcer healing.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-08-03 10:26:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Foot ulceration affects 15 to 20% of people with diabetes. It is a major precursor to amputation in this patient group, and early and appropriate treatment provides the greatest opportunity for healing. The use of silver for its antimicrobial properties has re-emerged, and modern wound dressings that release a sustained amount of free silver ions, are now widely used in wound management.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate the effects of silver-containing dressings and topical agents on infection rates and healing of diabetes related foot ulcers. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2010-07-26 16:41:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (Searched 8/2/10); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library,</I> 2010 Issue 1); Ovid MEDLINE - 2007 to January Week 3 2010; Ovid MEDLINE - In-Process &amp; Other Non-Indexed Citations (Searched 4/2/10); Ovid EMBASE - 2007 to 2010 Week 04; EBSCO CINAHL - 2007 to 8 February 2010. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials and non-randomised controlled clinical trials were considered for inclusion. Studies were included if they involved participants with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes and related foot ulcers, met the requirements for randomisation, allocation and concealment where appropriate, and compared the intervention with a placebo or a sham dressing, an alternative non silver based dressing or no dressing, and reported outcomes that represent healing rate or infection. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors independently evaluated the papers identified by the search strategy against the inclusion criteria but identified no trials eligible for inclusion in the review. It was not possible to perform planned subgroup and sensitivity analysis in the absence of data. In future, if eligible trials become available, a random effects model will be applied for meta-analysis in the presence of statistical heterogeneity (estimated using the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic). Dichotomous outcomes will be reported as risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CI), and continuous outcomes as weighted mean differences (WMD) with 95% CI. Statistical significance will be set at P value &lt; 0.05 for all outcomes and the magnitude of the effect will be estimated by calculating the number needed to treat (NNT) with 95% CI. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>No studies were identified that met with the inclusion criteria</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Despite the widespread use of dressings and topical agents containing silver for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers, no randomised trials or controlled clinical trials exist that evaluate their clinical effectiveness. Trials are needed to determine clinical and cost-effectiveness and long term outcomes including adverse events. </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-08-08 08:54:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Foot ulceration affects 15 to 20% of all individuals with diabetes and precedes up to 85% of amputations in this patient group (<LINK REF="REF-Armstrong-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armstrong 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Boulton-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boulton 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oyibo-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oyibo 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Valk-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Valk 2001</LINK>;<LINK REF="REF-Van-Acker-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Acker 2002</LINK>). The five-year re-ulceration rate is approximately 70%, and, for those undergoing lower-limb amputations, there is a 50% chance of losing the remaining limb within three years (<LINK REF="REF-Valk-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Valk 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Gils-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Gils 1999</LINK>). The five-year mortality rate for bilateral amputees is high (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Gils-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Gils 1999</LINK>), usually as a result of more widespread organ damage of which amputation is a strong marker.<BR/>
<BR/>A study in the United States reported that costs for medical care for peripheral neuropathy and associated complications, such as ulceration, to be in the vicinity of US$10 billion per annum for the year 2001 (<LINK REF="REF-Gordois-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gordois 2003</LINK>). In the United Kingdom, direct health care costs associated with diabetes related amputation are approximately £8000 per patient per year, based on acute care costs for 1996/97 (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 2003</LINK>). More difficult to quantify, but equally important, is the impact of diabetic foot ulceration on indirect costs, including the cost of carers, loss of employment, and increased reliance on social welfare (<LINK REF="REF-DiabCost-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">DiabCost 2002</LINK>). Quality of life is reduced by both the presence of an ulcer, and often as a consequence of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Kinmond-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kinmond 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meijer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meijer 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tennvall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tennvall 2000</LINK>). Treatment methods for diabetic foot ulceration often entail burdensome regimes including pressure relief - often in the form of a below knee cast or custom footwear - daily dressing changes and frequent trips to various health professionals. Although these treatment regimes are essential for healing and prevention of further complications, they can last for many months and have a profound effect on activities of daily living and quality of life.</P>
<P>Ulceration usually occurs when one or more of the following are present: peripheral neuropathy (particularly loss of feeling/protective sensation), foot deformity, and minor trauma (<LINK REF="REF-Currie-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Currie 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reiber-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reiber 1999</LINK>). Less frequently diabetic foot ulceration may present as a symptom of deeper infection such as cellulitis, an abscess, or osteomyelitis. Another less frequent precursor to ulceration is peripheral vascular disease, as impaired circulation contributes significantly to non-healing of ulcers and subsequent risk for amputation (<LINK REF="REF-Boulton-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boulton 2000</LINK>). This multifactorial nature of diabetic foot ulceration has prompted the development of a range of grading systems that allow classification of characteristics such as aetiology, depth, presence/absence of infection and the involvement of deeper structures such as bone. Grading systems such as Wagner or the Texas Foot Classification System are used widely for descriptive purposes, deciding treatment plans, and to assign a level of risk for amputation (<LINK REF="REF-Armstrong-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armstrong 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Boulton-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boulton 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Timely resolution of diabetic foot ulceration is essential if further tissue loss and infection are to be avoided. Current guidelines recommend the use of pressure relieving devices, appropriate dressings to promote healing and prevent infection, and where appropriate, debridement, drainage and revascularization (<LINK REF="REF-ACFAS-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACFAS 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Apelqvist-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Apelqvist 2000</LINK>). In addition, optimisation of glycaemic control and patient education are important factors in achieving successful ulcer healing (<LINK REF="REF-Boulton-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boulton 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eaglestein-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eaglestein 2001</LINK>). Amputation should not be overlooked as a means of successful management, and in fact, early and appropriate amputation can prevent the need for more extensive surgery and greater complications at a later date.</P>
<P>Despite the need for speedy resolution in order to avoid greater complications, it is not uncommon for diabetic foot ulcers to reach a point where progress slows or even stops altogether. Commonly referred to as 'delayed' or 'non-healing' this phenomenon contributes significantly to the chronicity associated with diabetic foot ulcers, and can occur despite appropriate treatment and management of all contributing factors. There are several factors that have the potential to contribute to a delay in wound healing, including poor patient compliance with treatment regimes, poorly controlled glycaemic (blood sugar) levels and poor tissue oxygenation (<LINK REF="REF-ADA-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">ADA 1999</LINK>). Also implicated in the delayed or non-healing of diabetic foot ulcers, is the impaired immune response to injury commonly seen in people with diabetes that frequently results in poor, or no progress, after initiation of the inflammatory phase of healing (the initial healing phase involving the arrival of blood cell types and removal of bacteria from the site). This ultimately affects formation of granulation tissue (new tissue containing all the cellular components for skin formation), which is a pre-requisite to epithelialisation or complete skin healing (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2003</LINK>). Modern dressings such as Dermagraft (Smith and Nephew) and Apligraf (Novartis) have been developed in an attempt to overcome these cellular deficiencies and promote wound closure (<LINK REF="REF-Curren-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curren 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marsten-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marsten 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Also implicated in the delayed or non-healing of diabetic foot ulcers, is the amount of bacteria on both the wound surface, and less often, in deeper wound tissue (<LINK REF="REF-Edwards-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schultz-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schultz 2003</LINK>). Terms used to describe the 'bacterial bio burden', or different levels of bacteria on the surface of an ulcer, include 'contaminated', 'colonised' or 'infected', and obtaining a degree of bacterial balance have been cited as a key objective in successful wound care (<LINK REF="STD-Ballard-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ballard 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sibbald-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sibbald 2003</LINK>). 'Contaminated' refers to a level of bacteria that is not harmful to the host (in this case the diabetic patient) and where micro-organisms are not replicating (re-producing) and pose no threat to healing (<LINK REF="REF-Sibbald-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sibbald 2003</LINK>). 'Colonised' ulcers will display a greater concentration of micro-organisms that impede wound healing but do not result in overt signs of clinical infection such as erythema, pus and pain (<LINK REF="REF-Sibbald-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sibbald 2003</LINK>). The exact bacterial concentration at which colonisation or 'critical colonisation' occurs, has yet to be determined (<LINK REF="REF-Sibbald-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sibbald 2003</LINK>). 'Infected' refers to a wound state characterised by the defeat of the hosts immune system by replicating micro-organisms or bacteria. Again, the exact level at which 'colonisation' becomes 'infection' is not known, however a long established rule is a level of bacteria equal to or greater than 10<SUP>5</SUP> colony forming units per gram of tissue (cfu/g), or 100,000 or more bacterial cells per gram of wound tissue, is sufficient to confirm infection (<LINK REF="STD-Bowler-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bowler 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Edwards-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sibbald-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sibbald 2003</LINK>). It has been argued however, that the 10<SUP>5</SUP> rule may not apply to ulcers such as those affecting the diabetic foot, due to the complex nature of the bacteria that typically affects them (<LINK REF="STD-Bowler-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bowler 2003</LINK>). Studies have demonstrated common isolates affecting diabetic foot ulcers include both aerobic (needing oxygen to survive) and anaerobic (thrive in low to no oxygen) organisms including, <I>Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus </I>and <I>Enterococcus </I>species, <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Peptostreptococcus</I> and coliform bacteria (<LINK REF="REF-Armstrong-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armstrong 1995</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Sibbald-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sibbald 2003</LINK> suggest this unusual mix of bacterial species may impact on such things as virulence and bacterial characteristics, causing these micro-organisms to behave outside the normal spectrum.</P>
<P>Although the debate continues over the definition of 'colonised' versus 'infected' and the implications of this for wound healing remain unclear, a variety of modern wound dressings have been developed that claim to restore the bacterial burden to an acceptable level and that this will promote healing. Silver containing dressings are one such new group of dressings and are available in a variety of forms including foams, hydrofibres and hydrocolloids, all containing free silver ions as the active ingredient. Silver has long been recognised as a powerful antimicrobial and was used as early as 1895 for dressing surgical wounds and minimising post-operative infection (<LINK REF="REF-Lansdown-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lansdown 2004</LINK>). In the same era, Crede began using silver nitrate to prevent neonatal eye infections (<LINK REF="REF-Burrell-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burrell 2003</LINK>). Silver is an effective antimicrobial due to its ability to bind to the DNA of bacteria and bacterial spores, reducing their ability to replicate (<LINK REF="STD-Ballard-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ballard 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cooper-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 2004</LINK>) and is reported to be effective against almost all known bacteria including fungi and some viruses (<LINK REF="REF-Ovington-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ovington 2001</LINK>). The silver binds to the cell membranes causing significant damage and preventing replication (<LINK REF="STD-Ballard-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ballard 2002</LINK>). Antibiotic research in the 1940s saw investigations into the further use of silver in medicine decline and not re-emerge until the 1960s, after which time silver was incorporated into a variety of preparations for use in wound healing (<LINK REF="REF-Burrell-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burrell 2003</LINK>). Silver salts such as silver nitrate and silver sulphadiazine were commonly applied to burns (<LINK REF="REF-Burrell-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burrell 2003</LINK>). Silver can be delivered to a wound in a number of chemical formulations including metallic, nanocrystalline or ionic silver. A preparation may have a high concentration of silver but the availability of the silver to the wound may vary. For this reason studies may use the term 'free' silver to describe the amount of bioavailable silver from the product. The amount and rate of free silver released onto the wound surface will impact on its antimicrobial activity and Lansdown has reported that levels in excess of 20 mg/l demonstrate the best results (<LINK REF="REF-Lansdown-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lansdown 2002</LINK>). Manufacturers of silver dressings (<LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>) claim to combine the antimicrobial properties of sustained silver release with the ability to manage exudate and maintain a moist wound surface.</P>
<P>Greater clarification is required about the possibility of toxicity through prolonged exposure to, or use of, wound dressings that contain silver. Whilst many claim the use of dressings containing silver is safe and does not expose patients to the possibility of toxicity, Lansdown expressed the need for more investigation before a consensus can be reached (<LINK REF="REF-Lansdown-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lansdown 2004</LINK>). As Lansdown rightly points out absorption of silver depends on such things as depth and extent of the wound, mode and frequency of application, silver content and specifically the amount of exudate secreted from the wound, which usually governs the amount of silver released.</P>
<P>There is little available data on the cost effectiveness of dressings containing silver, particularly when used to treat diabetes related foot ulcers. Work presented by <LINK REF="REF-Scanlon-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scanlon 2004</LINK> indicated a 48% increase in cost effectiveness of silver-containing hydro-activated foam when compared with 3 alternative dressings when used to treat venous leg ulcers. However community prescription cost data for England (<LINK REF="REF-Dept-Health-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dept Health 2005</LINK>) shows that over million pounds (UK £) was spent on just one type of silver dressing (Actisorb silver, 10.5cm by 10.5cm) in 2004.</P>
<P>An earlier systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Meara-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Meara 2001</LINK>) failed to identify any randomised controlled trials evaluating the affect of silver containing dressings and topical applications on diabetes related foot ulcers, and as such, this review was undertaken in order to determine whether more recent studies could be reported.<BR/>

<P>Prospective randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomised controlled clinical trials (CCTs) both published and unpublished were eligible if they compared the effectiveness of dressings and topical agents containing silver (used alone or in combination with other dressings/agents), in resolving infection and/or promoting healing of infected and uninfected diabetes related foot ulcers. </P>
<P>For the purposes of the review clinical infection of soft tissue was defined as the presence of purulent secretion (pus) or two or more of: erythema, warmth, tenderness/pain or induration (hardening of tissue). Indicators of more invasive infection included systemic signs such as fever, chills, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, abscess, cellulitis or osteomyelitis. </P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Trials recruiting people with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes and related foot ulcers including neuropathic, ischaemic and neuroischaemic ulcers were considered for inclusion. Presence of infection at baseline did not exclude studies from the review. Studies that recruited people both with and without diabetes were considered if the results for the study group with diabetes could be reported separately or were provided by the researchers for the purposes of the review. Similarly, studies that recruited people with ulcers related to venous disease, vasculitis or any chronic condition other than diabetes were considered, if the results relating to people with a diabetic foot ulcer were reported separately or were made available for the purposes of this review. Information about these and other variables, including concurrent therapy such as antibiotics, was to have been recorded. </P>

Among these five studies is an evaluation of the clinical results of earlier studies using silver dressings, and comparisons of the effect of silver dressings on diabetes related foot ulcers when compared with the effect of either standard wound care or an alternative non-silver dressing. All these studies are abstracts which have been presented at conferences and as such have limited information available, researchers for these studies were contacted where possible and invited to provide additional information however, to date no information has been received. For this first update further searches were undertaken and the results assessed, seven studies were added to the 'Studies Awaiting Assessment' (<LINK REF="STD-Braumann-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Braumann 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Colonna-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Colonna 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jude-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Jude 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jude-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Jude 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karap-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Karap 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Munter-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Munter 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Teot-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Teot 2008</LINK>). A list of excluded studies can be reviewed in the 'Tables' section of this review under 'Characteristics of excluded studies'. Sixteen of these studies were excluded as their study design did not meet the eligibility criteria, 18 were excluded as they did not include participants with diabetes related foot ulcers and 11 were excluded as they were in-vitro studies or studies not involving humans.</P>

<DISCUSSION>
<P>No eligible studies were identified. Whilst we believe the search strategy was exhaustive, it may be that studies that could potentially meet the criteria for inclusion were missed because their findings have not yet been published. Although we made every effort to contact researchers and manufacturers, and searched recent conference proceedings for relevant abstracts, we acknowledge the difficulties in identifying unpublished data and accept that some unpublished work may have been missed. Several abstracts identified from conference proceedings from 2003 and 2004 revealed information pertaining to studies recently completed or still underway, and it is possible that such work will be identified in future updates of this review. </P>
<P>The results of this review demonstrate a lack of appropriately randomised and controlled trials evaluating the effect of silver based products on infection and healing of diabetic foot ulcers. It is important that such studies are conducted using a sufficiently large sample size. Results from studies involving different patient groups cannot necessarily be generalised to this patient population. People with diabetes experience disease specific co-morbidities, for example the development of an altered immune response, that may or may not resemble immune changes resulting from other pathologies and specific aetiologies that contribute to the development of an ulcer. Concomitant therapies will also differ between groups experiencing venous leg ulcers, burns and diabetic foot ulcers, and these other therapies will no doubt impact on study outcomes. Appropriate study design and analysis is especially important in this patient group as it is rare for diabetic foot ulcers to be treated or managed with a wound dressing alone. Pressure off-loading, debridement and the use of systemic antibiotic therapy are used routinely in the management of diabetic foot ulcers and all will impact on healing and infection rates. It is essential that the degree to which each impact on outcomes is investigated. Diabetes duration and age will also likely impact on outcomes and should not be disregarded. </P>
<P>Some difficulties do exist with studying this population and date back to such age old arguments as 'What features define a chronic wound?' Whilst many organisations and institutions have a definition they routinely use, no such definition is universally accepted and contributes to difficulties in determining inclusion and exclusion criteria and defining the study population. Earlier in this review we discussed the lack of definite cut off points for determining when an ulcer is 'colonised' as opposed to 'infected', and at what point is wound healing compromised. It is perhaps just as important that studies are conducted that define these terms more conclusively and investigate the relationship, if any, between bacterial load and healing.<BR/> <BR/>Currently, study outcomes vary greatly and range from qualitative findings such as 'pain' and ease of use', to more quantitative data including the number of bacteria identified via wound swab before and after treatment. We would recommend that where possible, studies consider reporting 'time to complete healing' as this should be the main aim of all wound management. Change in total ulcer area should always be reported as both absolute and percentage change. </P>
<P>Whilst no studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria for this review future updates will identify any studies evaluating the effect of silver dressings and topical agents on diabetic foot ulcers. <BR/> </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>No RCTs or CCTs were identified therefore we cannot conclude whether silver based dressings and topical agents result in benefits or harms for people with diabetes related foot ulcers. RCTs are required in order to determine the clinical and cost effectiveness of silver based treatments for diabetes related foot ulcers. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>RCTs that evaluate the effect of silver containing dressings and topical agents and their effect on healing of diabetes related foot ulcers are required. </P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.  Was the allocation sequence randomly generated?</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Yes, low risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>The investigators describe a random component in the sequence generation process such as: referring to a random number table; using a computer random number generator; coin tossing; shuffling cards or envelopes; throwing dice; drawing of lots.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">No, high risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>The investigators describe a non-random component in the sequence generation process. Usually, the description would involve some systematic, non-random approach, for example: sequence generated by odd or even date of birth; sequence generated by some rule based on date (or day) of admission; sequence generated by some rule based on hospital or clinic record number.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Unclear</HEADING>
<P>Insufficient information about the sequence generation process to permit judgement of &#8216;Yes&#8217; or &#8216;No&#8217;.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.  Was the treatment allocation adequately concealed?</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Yes, low risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Participants and investigators enrolling participants could not foresee assignment because one of the following, or an equivalent method, was used to conceal allocation: central allocation (including telephone, web-based and pharmacy-controlled randomisation); sequentially-numbered drug containers of identical appearance; sequentially-numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">No, high risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Participants or investigators enrolling participants could possibly foresee assignments and thus introduce selection bias, such as allocation based on: using an open random allocation schedule (e.g. a list of random numbers); assignment envelopes were used without appropriate safeguards (e.g. if envelopes were unsealed or non­opaque or not sequentially numbered); alternation or rotation; date of birth; case record number; any other explicitly unconcealed procedure.</P>
