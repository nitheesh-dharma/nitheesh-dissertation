<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-07-29 11:56:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Eye injuries are a preventable cause of blindness, yet remain a significant disabling health problem that affects all age groups. Despite health and safety requirements and widespread legislation, injuries can still occur at home, in the workplace, during recreational activities or as a result of road crashes.</P>
<P>The authors of this review searched for randomised controlled trials and controlled before-and-after studies looking at the effectiveness of educational interventions, such as written materials, video or audio tapes, for the prevention of eye injuries. The authors found five studies involving different types of people, using various educational interventions and based in different countries, that met the inclusion criteria. Due to the low quality of the studies identified, the authors concluded that there is no reliable evidence that educational interventions are effective in preventing eye injuries.</P>
<P>The review authors recommend that further high quality randomised controlled trials, with longer follow-up periods are conducted. More trials should be based in low and middle-income countries in order to carry out a comparison with those in high-income countries.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2009-08-12 16:56:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Injuries and the Cochrane Eyes &amp; Vision Group Specialised Registers, CENTRAL (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2008, Issue 3), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Current Controlled Trials <I>meta</I>Register (now includes National Research Register), AgeInfo, HMIC Health Management Information Consortium, WHOLIS (World Health Organization Library Information System), LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences), MEDCARIB (Caribbean Health Sciences Literature), ISI Web of Science: (<I>Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED), Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science (CPCI-S)</I>), ERIC, ZETOC and SPORTdiscus. We also checked reference lists of relevant papers and contacted study authors in an effort to identify published, unpublished and ongoing trials. Searches were last updated in August 2008.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2009-04-14 19:17:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>We included any randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled before-and-after studies which evaluated any educational intervention aimed at preventing eye injuries.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-07-29 11:57:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Four authors independently screened the electronic search results and data extracted. Three authors entered data into RevMan 5. As we judged there to be substantial heterogeneity between participants and interventions, we did not pool the studies' results, but have reviewed the results narratively.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-08-08 20:40:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>We included two RCTs and three controlled before-and-after studies in this review. One study reported eye injuries as an outcome and four studies reported change in behaviour or knowledge.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-07-29 11:57:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The included studies do not provide reliable evidence that educational interventions are effective in preventing eye injuries. There is a need for well-conducted RCTs with adequate allocation concealment and masking (blinding).

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-08-10 14:01:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Ocular injury is a preventable cause of blindness, and yet it remains a significant disabling health problem that affects all age groups. Injuries may occur in the home, in the workplace, during recreational activities or as a result of road crashes. Types of injuries vary from closed globe (contusion or lamellar laceration) to an open globe injury, which includes rupture, penetration, and perforation of the globe. To date, the main strategy to prevent these injuries has been to educate people to identify high-risk situations and to take correct action to avoid danger.</P>
<P>Information from the World Health Organization (WHO) suggests that over 55 million eye injuries occur each year (<LINK REF="REF-Negrel-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Negrel 1998</LINK>). They report that about 1.6 million people go blind from these injuries, 2.3 million suffer from bilateral low vision and 19 million remain with unilateral blindness or low vision. Data from the United States Eye Injury Register (<LINK REF="REF-USEIR" TYPE="REFERENCE">USEIR</LINK>) have identified that over 57% of the injuries occur in people under 30 years of age. In children under three years old, injury remains the main cause of eyeball loss (enucleation).</P>
<P>A population-based survey (<LINK REF="REF-Krisnainah-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krisnainah 2006</LINK>) and the <LINK REF="REF-USEIR" TYPE="REFERENCE">USEIR</LINK> have established that males are more likely to sustain eye injury. Data from the <LINK REF="REF-USEIR" TYPE="REFERENCE">USEIR</LINK> indicate that over 40% of injuries occur within the home environment. In contrast, data from studies conducted in some developing countries, specifically India and Nepal, identify the mainly-agricultural work environment (<LINK REF="REF-Khatry-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khatry 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Krisnainah-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krisnainah 2006</LINK>) as a higher risk situation. The Birmingham Eye Trauma Terminology (BETT) (<LINK REF="REF-Kuhn-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuhn 2004</LINK>) has been endorsed as a comprehensive and standardised classification that attempts to address ambiguity in the description of eye injuries. The BETT classification defines all eye injuries as open or closed globe injuries. In the US it has been found that 31% of injuries occur from blunt objects and result in varying degrees of contusion (from 'black eye' to severe intraocular tearing) and, occasionally, rupture of the globe, or blow out fracture of the floor of the orbit. Sharp objects contribute to about 18% of injuries (<LINK REF="REF-USEIR" TYPE="REFERENCE">USEIR</LINK>). Penetrating injuries and perforating injuries often carry a poor prognosis. The management of each case varies, and is dependent on how far and where the sharp object entered the eye. Intraocular foreign bodies can cause structural damage as well as be toxic to the tissues. These materials vary from plastics and glass to metal, and even plant matter, which can induce an infection. Burns to the eye remain an ophthalmic emergency where the outcome depends upon the concentration and pH of the burning agent. Alkalis are a particular challenge as they penetrate the ocular tissues and cause irreversible damage.</P>
<P>In the UK almost half of all eye emergencies are due to trauma (<LINK REF="REF-MacEwen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacEwen 1999</LINK>), though injuries within the UK workplace have decreased significantly due to better awareness and the use of eye protection in industrial settings (<LINK REF="REF-Canavan-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Canavan 1980</LINK>). Similarly, eye injuries due to road traffic crashes have decreased in countries where there is widespread use of seat belts and laminated windscreens (<LINK REF="REF-Vernon-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vernon 1984</LINK>).</P>
<P>Evidence suggests that some population groups are at a greater risk because of increased exposure to hazards that lead to ocular injuries (<LINK REF="REF-Negrel-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Negrel 1998</LINK>). Inability to detect or avoid the risk contributes to higher incidence, particularly in low and middle-income countries. Worker safety measures in industrialised nations has led to a significant reduction in injuries but these are costly and not universally applied. The key preventive strategy therefore remains with behaviour change of individuals through educational interventions to recognise risks and avoid exposure where possible.</P>
</CONDITION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-08-10 14:34:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Behavioural change may prevent many ocular injuries. Educational interventions have been proposed as a potentially effective approach to assist in bringing about such a change; these may be implemented in conjunction with new or existing legislation/regulations. <LINK REF="REF-Lipscomb-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipscomb 2000</LINK> has identified that interventions to prevent ocular injuries have been effective when used in conjunction with policy changes in both industrial and agricultural settings. Educational interventions can range from simple printed information such as leaflets, announcements on the radio or television, to intensive safety workshops. These interventions can also range from costing very little to being quite expensive to implement.</P>
<P>Cost and type of intervention will also have a bearing on low and middle-income countries. A written intervention such as a leaflet or advertisement in a newspaper, whilst effectively cheaper and easier to circulate than holding an intensive workshop, may be limited to those who are literate. Broadcasting on the radio or television might be more effective, but will only reach those who are able to afford electronic equipment. Additionally, educational messages need to be tailored to meet the requirements of the exposed population.</P>
<P>In low and middle-income countries, the environmental factors, farming techniques, and lack of safety regulation in industrial settings leads to a high burden of injury. The behaviour of an individual is influenced by their own awareness as well as the social and legislative norms held in the community. Therefore to bring about a change in behaviour changes are necessary at multiple levels, and an educational intervention is the most applicable pathway. </P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-03-30 14:34:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Karen Blackhall">
<P>We were unable to identify any evidence that shows the effectiveness of educational interventions for the prevention of eye injuries. Previous reviews <LINK REF="REF-Lipscomb-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipscomb 2000</LINK> highlight the uncertainty surrounding the effectiveness of educational interventions to prevent eye injuries by bringing about the required behavioural change - with or without legislation. Evidence of the effects of interventions will provide vital information in identifying the most suitable educational method(s) to help bring about a 'cultural' change in behaviour to prevent ocular injuries.</P>

<P>For dichotomous outcomes we calculated rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals. The rate ratio is the ratio of event rates post and pre intervention in the intervention area divided by the corresponding post to pre intervention event ratio in the control area. Provided that any changes in the population at risk are the same in both control and intervention areas, the rate ratio gives the reduction in the event rate in the intervention area compared to that in the control area. For example, a rate ratio of 0.8 corresponds to a 20% reduction in events compared to that predicted from the rates in the control area. For injury outcome data the standard errors for logarithms of rate ratios and hence 95% confidence intervals for rate ratios were calculated assuming that the number of events in each area in each period followed a Poisson Distribution.</P>
<P>For continuous outcomes we calculated the weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence intervals.</P>
<P>For studies which presented an appropriate summary effect estimate in the report, we have reported this estimate in the Results section.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Adler_x002d_Grinberg-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Adler-Grinberg 1985</LINK>: To address &#8216;preventable blindness&#8217; caused by eye injuries. School-aged children were taught about eye health and safety by the use of an NSPC-designed teaching unit, aimed at preventing blindness. The study assessed the effectiveness of the program afterwards by examining the students' knowledge, attitudes and self-reported behaviour regarding eye health and safety to see if the aims of the programme were met.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Eime-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Eime 2005</LINK>: To prevent eye injuries in squash players by the use of appropriate eyewear (i.e. that have standards-approved protective polycarbonate lenses). The study evaluated the implementation of a health education and eyewear promotion strategy, the Protective Eyewear Promotion (PEP) strategy. The use of appropriate eyewear in squash players was assessed before and after the intervention by comparing the player&#8217;s eyewear behaviour to see whether the objectives of the study were met.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Forst-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Forst 2004</LINK>: To reduce work-related eye injury and illness among Latino migrant and seasonal workers by the use of a &#8216;Promotor de salud&#8217; (or Community Health Worker) to provide training and protective eyewear. Pre and post-intervention questionnaires were used to examine whether the aims of the study were met.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Hathaway-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hathaway 1992</LINK>: To examine factors influencing user-compliance with warning signs in a racquetball court. It tested (i) cost of compliance (by making it either easy or more difficult to comply by either providing eye protection or not); and (ii) inclusion of specific consequence information, such as number of eye injuries in racquet sport players per year, on warning signs (or not). Players were observed to find out if the aims of the study were met.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Smith-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1978</LINK>: To use behaviour modification techniques to improve worker safety behaviour. The shipyard environment under examination had a high incidence of eye injury, therefore the wearing of safety glasses by ship-fitters to prevent eye injury was selected as the behaviour to be modified. The study tested the effectiveness of training supervisors in the fundamentals of behaviour modification in order to increase the use of safety glasses by employees. Eye accident rates before and after the intervention were examined to see if the aims of the study were met.</P>

For the control group, injury rates in the before and after periods were 5.82 and 4.66 per 100 employees (1.16% decrease), respectively. The review authors calculated a rate ratio of 0.45 (95% CI 0.09 to 2.36), indicating a 55% decrease in injuries in the experimental group relative to the control, although this finding is not statistically significant (-55%, 95% CI -91% to +136%).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Eime-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Eime 2005</LINK> assessed behaviour through a pre and post-survey of the use of protective eyewear by squash players.

The review authors calculated the rate ratio comparing use of glasses in the education group (group 1) with the two no education groups (group 2 and 3); RR was 2.02 (95% CI 0.07 to 62.30), indicating that glasses use amongst workers in the experimental group was two times greater than in the control group.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-08-10 15:29:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>The results from the five included studies do not provide reliable evidence that educational interventions are effective in preventing eye injuries. Two of the studies reported data on the primary outcome, eye injuries, which found a reduction associated with the intervention given in that study. However, methodological weaknesses in these studies, such as allocation concealment and their susceptibility to bias, means that their findings should be viewed with caution.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2009-08-10 15:36:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Although we included five studies in this review, there are a number of issues that need to be addressed when considering it as a useful source of evidence.</P>
<P>Overall, the low quality study designs, variation in educational campaigns, lack of uniformity of the occupations and activities studied (farming to sports activities) and range of age groups (primary school children to adults) makes it difficult to evaluate the evidence presented.</P>
<P>The educational interventions used were different for each study even where the settings were similar such as the sports activities (squash and racquetball) or the labour intensive industries (farm workers and ship-fitters). For <LINK REF="STD-Adler_x002d_Grinberg-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Adler-Grinberg 1985</LINK>, audio or visual aids were used in combination with other tests and worksheets. The length of the training was for five sessions of 20 minutes each or five sessions of 40 minutes to an hour each. There was also emphasis on classroom activities to reinforce the concepts that were shown/heard in the presentations. For <LINK REF="STD-Eime-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Eime 2005</LINK> which was set in squash venues, the emphasis was on visual materials such as posters, pamphlets and stickers as well as offering incentives. <LINK REF="STD-Hathaway-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hathaway 1992</LINK>, the other sports study based on racquetball players, used written materials in the form of warning signs and offered the use of protective gear. <LINK REF="STD-Forst-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Forst 2004</LINK> used personnel in the form of community health workers to train the farm workers. The farm workers were expected to have at least two training sessions which included enlarged photographs, presentations, and other written materials that demonstrated eye injuries and hazards. Each farm worker was also fitted with safety glasses. <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1978</LINK> looked at ship-fitters and trained the supervisors by giving them five to 10 hours of classroom training over a period of one week. Incentives such as praising workers who wore safety glasses were used to help the ship-fitters modify their behaviour.</P>
<P>All five studies were conducted in high-income countries (four in the USA and one in Australia); we found no eligible studies from low or middle-income countries. Studies conducted in low and middle-income countries may be affected by a lack of health and safety awareness or legislation and the level of technology and safety features of machines etc., which may have implications for eye injury rates.</P>
<P>The studies cover a broad time frame from 1978 to 2005. Additional data that may have been collected when the trial was conducted was generally not available. Findings from the older studies may not be applicable or appropriate today due to advancement of technology and changing methods in industry. Despite extensive searches we did not identify any planned or ongoing studies. This suggests that although eye injuries may be a health burden in many countries, this is not reflected in the level of research in this area.</P>
<P>The included reviews also had short follow-up times. Behaviour changes were in most cases measured immediately after the intervention, which raised concerns about the sustainability of the change over time. Follow-up times should be sufficient to gauge whether a change in outcome is caused by random fluctuation or if there really is an effect from the intervention over time.<BR/>
</P>
<P>The studies tend to focus on self-reported injury rates or subjective changes in behaviour which are difficult to evaluate. The value of questionnaires and interviews, in this instance, is also unclear.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2009-07-29 12:02:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The methodological quality of the studies was poor overall. Due to a lack of reporting or unclear information provided, we were not able to assess the overall risk of bias for each study. Only two randomised controlled trials were found. Only one study reported on eye injuries as an outcome so no conclusions could be drawn. None of the studies in this review measured the effect of the intervention through data collected in emergency departments. Self-reporting of eye injuries or observation of behaviour is much more difficult to equate and therefore not as objective. The range of settings and interventions were not conducive to a successful comparison of the studies. Pre and post-test measurements of knowledge or attitude do not necessarily give a suitable indicator of behaviour change.<BR/>
</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2009-08-10 15:41:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>This systematic review addresses a focused research question using predefined inclusion criteria and methodology to select and appraise eligible studies.<BR/>
<BR/>As with all systematic reviews, the possibility of publication bias should be considered as a potential threat to validity. Identification of research for systematic reviews of public health interventions tends to require more complex searching than for reviews of medical interventions. The multi-disciplinary nature of the research means that it is more widely scattered, with much published in the grey literature (<A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD005244/bibliography.html#CD005244-bbs2-0055">Jackson 2005</A>). In recognition of this, the search strategy for this systematic review involved searching multiple electronic databases from a range of disciplines (including two specific databases of grey literature). Reference lists of relevant studies and contact with experts in the field were employed as methods to identify all potentially eligible published and unpublished studies. The searching was not limited to studies in English. With such a comprehensive search strategy, the chance of having missed an important study should be low and issues of publication bias should be minimal.</P>
<P>The findings of this systematic review are limited by the overall poor methodological quality of the included studies; poorly designed and executed studies are susceptible to bias and can lead to either an over or under estimate of effect.</P>
<P>Several studies were conducted over a decade ago, so their relevance and generalisability to the present situation is questionable. An additional limitation is the lack research from low and middle-income countries.</P>
<P>Possible bias is introduced when the study is conducted and reported by those who are involved. For example in <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1978</LINK>, crews reported compliance to safety methods and eye injury rates to supervisors.</P>
<P>Lack of follow up is a potential form of bias and none of the included studies were followed up for a reasonable period of time after the intervention had been given. </P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2009-07-29 12:02:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The results of this review support and echo the recommendations made by <LINK REF="REF-Lipscomb-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipscomb 2000</LINK> in a review evaluating the effectiveness of interventions to prevent work-related eye injuries. Lipscomb reviewed all studies (irrespective of study design) which were set in the construction, manufacturing and agricultural industries. The primary outcome was eye injury rates.</P>
<P>Lipscomb also noted in the review that not much recent scientific research had been done. In her review, four out of the seven studies she included were published before 1980 and the most recent was published in 1993. Few studies have been carried out since; this review identified only two eligible studies (<LINK REF="STD-Eime-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Eime 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Forst-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Forst 2004</LINK>) since Lipscomb's review was published.</P>
<P>Along with the dearth of recent literature published on this topic, Lipscomb also concluded that "much of the information we do have comes from descriptions of safety programs that have not been rigorously evaluated. Carefully designed controlled trials would allow us to more clearly understand the effects of different interventions in different work environments". Her statement clearly reflects the findings of this review.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-08-12 15:11:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-08-04 15:42:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>This review found no evidence to support the idea that educational interventions help to prevent eye injuries. Although there is no evidence of harm, it fails to confirm whether educational interventions bring about a sustained decline in ocular injury rates and outcomes. One of the studies included in the review does show that educational interventions can bring about change in knowledge which leads to change in behaviour but it is unclear how this could translate to a change in injury rate or have a sustained effect on behaviour.</P>
<P>The review does highlight the variety of educational tools available, but their effectiveness and replicability for different population groups and environments is inconclusive. It is also not possible to conclude on the impact of educational effectiveness by age, gender, occupation or environment.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-08-12 15:11:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Future research in this area should concentrate on well-conducted randomised trials with adequate allocation concealment and masking (blinding). Studies should have a longer follow-up time to better understand the sustainability of behaviour change through an educational intervention. Exposure to risks varies by age, gender, profession and environmental safety factors and which must be evaluated before and after an intervention.</P>
<P>Appropriate studies need to be carried out in low and middle-income countries where poor conditions/work environments and lack of appropriate legislation dictate a greater risk of injury. These studies must also evaluate the cost to individuals and the practical implications of employing interventions that aim to influence behaviour and prevent ocular injuries.</P>
<P>Studies should look at eye injury rates as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes, such as behaviour changes and effectiveness of the educational tool, should be collected independently of those taking part. Statistically feasible methods (judgement analysis) and interrupted time series over several years could be applied.<BR/>
