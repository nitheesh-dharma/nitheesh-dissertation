<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-08-26 12:19:01 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Deirdre Beecher">
<P>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune disease of the nervous system. Drugs that interfere with the immune system, such as methotrexate could benefit people with the disease. To date research suggest that there may be small improvements from treatment with methotrexate. However, until these improvements need to be balanced against methotrexate's potentially serious side-effects. Until larger research studies are performed, it will be too early to say whether the benefits of this drug outweigh its side-effects.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2008-08-26 12:10:42 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Deirdre Beecher">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Methotrexate is a potent immunosuppressant which in theory could reduce relapse rates and delay disease progression in multiple sclerosis (MS). Subsequently, clinical trials of methotrexate have been conducted in people with MS.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To identify and summarise the evidence that methotrexate is beneficial and safe for people with MS.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-08-26 12:10:42 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Deirdre Beecher">
<P>We searched the Cochrane MS Group Specialised Register (September 2007), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2007, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1966 to September 2007), EMBASE (1974 to Septermber 2007), Science Citation Index (SCISEARCH), British Medical Journal Register of unpublished clinical trials and reference lists from identified trials. We also contacted manufacturers and researchers in the field.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials of methotrexate for the prevention of relapses and disease progression in MS.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>We obtained 1118 citations from our literature search, but found only 2 eligible randomised controlled clinical trials. One study was excluded on the basis of inadequate allocation concealment, leaving one eligible study. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>The included trial involved 60 participants with chronic progressive multiple sclerosis. There were no participants with relapsing-remitting disease. The trial showed a non-significant reduction in sustained EDSS progression and number of relapses in favour of methotrexate therapy. There was no difference in time to first relapse and no data on relapse rate. Minor side-effects were reported frequently in both methotrexate (87.1%) and placebo groups (89.7%), but there were no major side-effects.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>In progressive MS, the single included trial reveals a non-significant trend in reduction of sustained EDSS progression and number of relapses in favour of methotrexate. There are no studies of methotrexate in relapsing remitting MS. Before drawing further conclusions regarding the efficacy of methotrexate in MS, further trials of people with relapsing-remitting MS or progressive MS are required.<BR/> </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-09-15 10:06:29 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Liliana Coco">
<P>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease of the brain and spinal cord. The initial disease course can be characterised by a series of relapses and remissions (relapsing remitting MS), but given time, multiple sclerosis will become a disabling disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Hawkins-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawkins 1999</LINK>). In some patients the disease is progressive from its onset (primary progressive MS) and in others a period of progression follows a period of relapses and remissions (secondary progressive MS). Treatments which reduce relapse rates or delay disease progression are a priority. The most promising avenues for treatment are immunomodulatory therapies (<LINK REF="REF-Hunter-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hunter 1997</LINK>). Methotrexate is a potent immunosuppressant, whose mode of action is predominantly through its inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase (<LINK REF="REF-Calabresi-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Calabresi 1990</LINK>), although there are other anti-inflammatory effects which do not rely upon this specific mechanism (<LINK REF="REF-Cronstein-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cronstein 1993</LINK>). However, longterm methotrexate administration is associated with serious side-effects including hepatic fibrosis (<LINK REF="REF-Colsky-1955" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colsky 1955</LINK>). It is important to establish the efficacy of methotrexate, to ensure that people with MS are not subject to longterm exposure with a potentially toxic drug without good evidence of efficacy.<BR/>We report a systematic review of the literature to determine the efficacy and safety of oral methotrexate for multiple sclerosis.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>This review will assess the benefits and risks of oral methotrexate for the secondary prevention of relapses and delay of progression of MS.</P>

<P>Methodological quality<BR/>The Cochrane Reviewer's Handbook discusses methodological quality under the following headings: (1) Selection bias, (2) Performance bias, (3) Attrition bias and (4) Detection bias.<BR/>(1) Selection bias was determined by assessing allocation concealment and matching of groups. Allocation concealment was classified as (A) adequate, (B) unclear, (C) inadequate and (D) not used.<BR/>(2) We determined whether each trial had a separate treating and evaluating neurologist, and took measures to minimise inadvertent patient unblinding as a means of assessing performance bias.<BR/>(3) We included trials with intention to treat analysis to reduce the effect of attrition bias.<BR/>(4) If a separate evaluating physician and treating physician were employed, detection bias will be acceptably low.</P>
<P>To be included in the meta-analysis, a trial had to have class "A" methodological quality i.e. (1) allocation concealment was adequate (Unclear allocation concealment will be accepted if every other methodological factor was of the best possible standard), (2) Treated and non-treated groups had adequate baseline comparability, (3) patients and treating physician were blind to treatment allocation, (4) analysis was intention to treat, (5) a separate evaluating and treating physician were employed.<BR/>Trials in which allocation concealment was unclear, or separate evaluating and treating neurologist were not used were excluded from primary analysis (class "B" methodology). If a randomised trial did not have adequate allocation concealment and did not have a separate evaluating and treating neurologist, it would have been excluded (class "C" methodology).</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2008-08-26 12:20:15 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Deirdre Beecher">
<P>Our search strategy identified 1118 potential articles. OG and GM reviewed titles and excluded 950 articles, as they clearly were not randomised controlled trials of methotrexate for MS. Of the remaining 168 articles review of titles, abstracts and if necessary the whole article excluded a further 166, leaving 2 articles for consideration. The authors of 1 trial (<LINK REF="STD-Currier-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Currier 1993</LINK>) responded to a request for further information, and subsequently their trial was excluded on the grounds of its allocation concealment and definition of a relapse. This trial (<LINK REF="STD-Currier-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Currier 1993</LINK>) included 44 participants of whom 20 had relapsing remitting MS and 24 had progressive MS. The published report separates outcomes for each sub-group, and found a trend towards fewer relapses in the relapsing remitting group treated with methotrexate (7/9 relapse free on methotrexate compared to 4/11 placebo), but observed no difference in the proportions who had progressive MS who had a change in EDSS score.</P>
<P>The remaining paper (<LINK REF="STD-Goodkin-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Goodkin 1995</LINK>) is the subject of this review. This trial (<LINK REF="STD-Goodkin-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Goodkin 1995</LINK>) there were 31 participants randomised to oral methotrexate and 29 randomised to placebo (Table of included studies) and followed up for 36 months. None of the participants had relapsing remitting MS. Of the 31 patients who received methotrexate, 7 had primary progressive and 24 had secondary progressive disease, compared to 11 out of 29 patients who received placebo who had primary progressive MS (Table of comparisons).</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>The single study included in this review met methodological standards set by our protocol, having adequate allocation concealment, adequate attempts to preclude inadvertent patient unblinding, using intention to treat analysis, and utilising separate treating and evaluating neurologists. </P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2008-08-26 12:20:23 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Deirdre Beecher">
<P>Primary outcome measures, pre-specified in our review protocol:<BR/>1. Sustained EDSS progression<BR/>A non-significant trend in favour of methotrexate was observed (11/31 methotrexate versus 15/29 placebo had sustained EDSS progression, p = 0.157).</P>
<P>2. Proportion remaining relapse free at the end of blinded assessment<BR/>There was no difference in the proportions remaining relapse free (27/31 methotrexate versus 24/29 placebo), but the population studied were at particularly low risk of relapse from the outset.</P>
<P>Secondary outcome measures from our protocol:<BR/>1. Time to first relapse<BR/>Although the precise times to relapse were not published, the authors reported a non-significant difference in time to relapse between treatment groups (Log Rank Test: p = 0.395).<BR/>2. Safety - the methotrexate was reported as being well tolerated with no major side-effects reported during 36 months of follow-up. Minor side-effects were commonly reported and included upper respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection, nausea, headache and myalgia. Side-effects were reported by 87.1% of the methotrexate group and 89.7% of the placebo group. No participant discontinued medication as a result of side-effects attributable to methotrexate.</P>
<P>The following outcome measures from our protocol were not reported in this study:<BR/>1. Relapse rate<BR/>2. Time to sustained disease progression (as defined above in 1).<BR/>3. Number of new or enlarging lesions on brain T2 weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).<BR/>4. Number of gadolinium enhancing lesions on T1 weighted MRI scans<BR/>5. Total MRI lesion burden on T2 weighted scans expressed as a volume in cubic millimetres<BR/>6. Number or rate of treated relapses (defined as a relapse needing corticosteroid treatment or admission to hospital)</P>
<P>The included trial used a "composite outcome measure" as its primary outcome measure, and found a difference in the proportions with "treatment failures" - in favour of methotrexate. As this composite outcome measure was not pre-specified in our protocol, we will review its meaning in the discussion section (below).</P>
<P>Safety<BR/>Methotrexate was well tolerated, although the authors did observe an ovarian cancer in one methotrexate participant. This cancer was reported as incidental, so presumably it was felt to have existed prior to the introduction of methotrexate. No hepatic fibrosis was detected, although this complication may take many years to emerge.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-09-15 10:06:29 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Liliana Coco">
<P>As a potent immunosuppressant drug methotrexate should be beneficial in the treatment of patients with MS. However there is limited evidence of its efficacy in people with MS. In particular there are no studies of this treatment for relapsing remitting MS, and only one eligible trial of this treatment in progressive MS. The included trial was exceptional as it did not use a single widely used outcome measure, but incorporated a "composite " measure.<BR/>The composite measure defined a treatment failure as sustained failure on one of 4 parameters : progression of EDSS score, deterioration of Ambulation Index, increased error rate in Box and Block Test and increased error rate in 9 hole peg test. The authors report a significant difference between treated and placebo-treated groups, when this composite outcome measure was used. In a Cox regression model, they estimated that participants who received methotrexate were as much as 4 times less likely to fail than placebo treated controls. While this is an important observation, no significant differences were found for the individual outcomes of sustained EDSS progression and Ambulation Index. Tests of upper limb function were statistically significant (9 Hole Peg Test) or very close to conventional levels of significance (Box and Block test). This makes it difficult to use the present data to eliminate methotrexate as a potential therapeutic candidate for progressive MS. Moreover, its effect on relapsing remitting MS remains untested.<BR/>There is limited data on the effect of methotrexate on relapses. The included study showed a non-significant trend on number of relapses during the trial, with no difference in time to first relapse. However, the trial population were selected on the basis of their low relapse rate, and given their status of progressive MS were unlikely to experience any relapse during follow-up. It is therefore premature to judge the effect of methotrexate on relapse prevention. The excluded trial of methotrexate in MS (<LINK REF="STD-Currier-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Currier 1993</LINK>), admitted by the authors as a preliminary one, reported a trend towards fewer relapses in relapsing remitting MS.This at least raises the possibility that methotrexate could have a role in relapsing remitting MS, but requires a methodologically rigorous clinical trial.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is one methodologically rigorous clinical trial of methotrexate for progressive MS (<LINK REF="STD-Goodkin-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Goodkin 1995</LINK>). This trial did not detect significant differences between methotrexate and placebo treated groups for individual outcome measures. The methotrexate to be well tolerated with no major side-effects. This trial used, as its primary outcome, a composite measure, which they found to be significantly different between methotrexate and placebo treated groups. However, it is premature to be certain of sustained benefit until therapeutic effect is measured with a more generalisable outcome. At present, we do not recommend the use of methotrexate for progressive or relapsing remitting MS at this time.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Future trials need to be performed on the use of methotrexate in relapsing-remitting and progressive multiple sclerosis. Such trials should include standard outcome measures, and include, if possible, objective measures of outcome, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging and widely used outcome measures such as relapse rates, sustained EDSS progression, and reproducible tests of upper limb function. </P>
