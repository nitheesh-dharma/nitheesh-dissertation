<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Hypnotherapy (treatment by hypnosis) for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Studies of hypnotherapy for treatment of IBS.<BR/>Only a small number of studies of hypnotherapy have been performed and the way these studies were carried out was not up to a high standard. Hypnotherapy was either compared with standard treatment of IBS, with supportive psychotherapy (discussion of symptoms and possible contributing emotional problems and stressful life events) or with no treatment in patients on a waiting list to be seen by a specialist.</P>
<P>What is IBS and could hypnotherapy work as treatment?<BR/>IBS is a common gastrointestinal disorder characterized by chronic abdominal pain and an abnormal pattern of bowel movements (i.e. diarrhea, constipation or mixed diarrhea and constipation). Hypnotherapy could provide benefit for IBS, by affecting parts of the brain that experience abdominal pain or influence the movement of the bowel.</P>
<P>What did the studies show?<BR/>The studies provide some evidence that suggests that hypnotherapy might be effective in treating IBS symptoms including abdominal pain. However the results of these studies should be interpreted with caution due to poor study quality and small size. </P>
<P>How safe is hypnotherapy?<BR/>Hypnotherapy was well tolerated and no serious side effects were reported in the studies. </P>
<P>What is the bottom line? <BR/>Although current data are promising, there is insufficient evidence to allow any conclusion about the effectiveness of hypnotherapy for the treatment of IBS. More research with well designed studies is needed. </P>

<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder of unknown aetiology. Current pharmacological treatments have limited value. Hypnotherapy has been reported to have beneficial effects for IBS symptoms.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate the efficacy of hypnotherapy for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Published and unpublished randomised clinical trials and quasi-randomised clinical trials were identified through structured searches of MEDLINE (1966 to March 2006), EMBASE (1980 to March 2006), PsycINFO (1806 to March 2006), CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, 1982 to March 2006), AMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, 1985 to March 2006) and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials. Conference proceedings from Digestive Disease Week (1980 to 2005) were also searched. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Eligible studies included all randomised and quasi-randomised clinical studies comparing hypnotherapy for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with no treatment or another therapeutic intervention.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>All studies were evaluated for eligibility for inclusion. Included studies were assessed for quality and data were extracted independently by four authors. The primary outcome measure of interest was the overall bowel symptom severity score which combines abdominal pain, diarrhoea or constipation and bloating. Secondary outcomes included abdominal pain, diarrhoea, constipation, bloating, quality of life, patient's overall assessment of well-being, psychological measures as per validated questionnaires, and adverse events. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Four studies including a total of 147 patients met the inclusion criteria. Only one study compared hypnotherapy to an alternative therapy (psychotherapy and placebo pill), two studies compared hypnotherapy with waiting-list controls and the final study compared hypnotherapy to usual medical management. Data were not pooled for meta-analysis due to differences in outcome measures and study design. The therapeutic effect of hypnotherapy was found to be superior to that of a waiting list control or usual medical management, for abdominal pain and composite primary IBS symptoms, in the short term in patients who fail standard medical therapy. Harmful side-effects were not reported in any of the trials. However, the results of these studies should be interpreted with caution due to poor methodological quality and small size. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The quality of the included trials was inadequate to allow any conclusion about the efficacy of hypnotherapy for irritable bowel syndrome. More research with high quality trials is needed.</P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder of unknown aetiology characterized by a chronic and relapsing course of abdominal pain or discomfort associated with disturbed defecation (<LINK REF="REF-Drossman-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drossman 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Drossman-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drossman 2006b</LINK>). It can also be classified on the predominant symptom i.e. diarrhoea, constipation or mixed diarrhoea and constipation. Its prevalence is similar in most industrialized countries (USA, Britain) affecting 14-24% of women and 5-19% of men (<LINK REF="REF-Drossman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drossman 1997</LINK>). It is the most common gastrointestinal disorder diagnosed by gastroenterologists in the United States where IBS patients comprise 28% of all patients seen (<LINK REF="REF-Mitchell-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitchell 1987</LINK>). In the United States alone, the economic impact is estimated at $25 billion annually through direct costs of health care use and indirect costs such as work absenteeism (<LINK REF="REF-Camilleri-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Camilleri 2000</LINK>). IBS is a serious disorder that can cause a significant impairment of quality of life, comparable to that of patients with chronic renal failure or complicated diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Gralnek-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gralnek 2000</LINK>). There is a need to develop more effective treatment for this large affected population.</P>
<P>Recent research suggests that irritable bowel syndrome may have an organic component and therefore should not be dismissed as a "functional" or "non-organic" entity (<LINK REF="REF-Talley-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Talley 2002</LINK>). IBS is considered to be a biopsychosocial disorder where the mind and the body are part of a system where their dysregulation can produce illness (the persons experience of ill health) and disease. One model of functional gastrointestinal disorders conceptualises it as follows: affected individuals, who early in life, together with their genetic makeup, may be primed for developing IBS because of the occurrence of adverse environmental influences on psychosocial development. These environmental factors could include family influence on illness expression, abuse, major losses or exposure to infections, which may affect ones psychosocial development in terms of an individuals susceptibility to life stress or psychological state and coping skills, as well as susceptibility to gastrointestinal dysfunction, abnormal motility, altered mucosal immunity or visceral hypersensitivity. In other words, an individual with adaptive coping skills and illness behaviours may not develop the clinical syndrome of IBS (or be aware of it) or if it does develop may not seek medical attention. However another individual who has co-existent psychosocial co-morbidities, high life stress, abuse history, or maladaptive coping, may develop a syndrome (e.g. post infectious IBS), go to the physician frequently and generally have a poorer outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Drossman-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drossman 2006a</LINK>). It is, as if the maladapted individual, seeks reassurance from an external source (i.e. healthcare provider) as this ability to adaptively interpret physiological symptoms has not been modelled or has not developed or cannot occur due to current psychosocial comorbidity. Other processes which may be important in the pathophysiology of IBS include serotonin dysregulation (<LINK REF="REF-Coates-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coates 2004</LINK>),central nervous system pain dysregulation (<LINK REF="REF-Mayer-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mayer 2005</LINK>) and bacterial overgrowth (<LINK REF="REF-Lin-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Current pharmacological treatments are targeted at symptom control and have limited value (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2000</LINK>). No single drug is effective in relieving all of the symptoms of IBS over a sustained period of time. It is also well known that the immediate placebo response is high (averaging 47%) and is not sustained (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2000</LINK>). This leads to repeated medical consultations.<BR/>A meta-analysis of trials for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome found the following (<LINK REF="REF-Lesbros-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lesbros 2004</LINK>): <BR/>1) Most trials with antispasmodics were methodologically flawed and the clinical evidence supporting their use is weak. <BR/>2) Alosetron, a selective 5HT3 receptor antagonist, is recommended for women with severe diarrhoea predominant IBS who have failed conventional therapy. Tegaserod, a partial 5- HT4-receptor agonist was recommended for women with constipation predominant IBS (however subsequent to the publication of this systematic review tegaserod was removed from the market in March 2007 because of cardiovascular adverse events).<BR/>2) Antidepressants are recommended for diarrhoea predominant IBS with severe refractory symptoms.<BR/>3) There is not enough evidence to recommend the use of bulking agents in IBS except as adjuvants in painless constipation.<BR/>4) Loperamide, an anti-diarrhoeal agent, is effective for painless diarrhoea.<BR/>5) The use of prokinetic agents, stimulating laxatives, peppermint oil or benzodiazepines is not recommended in IBS.<BR/>6) Current studies do not support the routine use of probiotics in IBS patients.<BR/>7) Elimination diet cannot be recommended except in patients with proven food intolerance.<BR/>8) The role of psychotherapy in IBS has not been established. </P>
<P>Hypnotherapy: <BR/>Hypnotherapy may provide benefit for IBS, possibly due to its effects on central nervous system pain processing regions (<LINK REF="REF-Rainville-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rainville 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Hypnotherapy was first used in medicine during the nineteenth century as an anaesthetic for orthopaedic surgery. Hypnotic capacity is defined as, "the ability to focus narrowly and intensify one's concentration and perception while reciprocally diminishing awareness of all other stimuli" (<LINK REF="REF-Sugarman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sugarman 1996</LINK>). It appears that during this state the conscious critical mind is placed "on hold" and therapeutic suggestions can more readily be accepted and incorporated into the subconscious mind. The individual may then modulate some physiological processes previously thought to be only under involuntary control.</P>
<P>Hypnosis has been used successfully for a number of conditions in childhood including reducing nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy, reducing pain and anxiety during painful procedures and reducing the frequency of childhood migraine (<LINK REF="REF-Zeltzer-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zeltzer 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dinges-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dinges 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Olness-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olness 1987</LINK>). Hypnosis has also been shown to enable children to modulate physiological processes such as increasing the production of salivary immunoglobulin A (<LINK REF="REF-Sugarman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sugarman 1996</LINK>). </P>
<P>In adults hypnotherapy has been shown to alter a number of physiological mechanisms. Suggestion of relaxation by hypnosis has resulted in a significant reduction of unstimulated as well as betazole stimulated acid secretion and a decrease in gastric motility (<LINK REF="REF-Stacher-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stacher 1975</LINK>).</P>
<P>Hypnotherapy has been studied for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome in a number of randomised controlled trials in adults (<LINK REF="STD-Whorwell-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Whorwell 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Galovski-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Galovski 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Forbes-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Forbes 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Palsson-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Palsson 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Palsson-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Palsson 2002b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simren-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Simren 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whorwell-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Whorwell 1984</LINK>). </P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate the efficacy of hypnotherapy for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome.</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Eligible studies include all randomised and quasi-randomised clinical studies comparing hypnotherapy for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with no treatment or another therapeutic intervention. Studies comparing two types of hypnotherapy for IBS were not included. Quasi randomised studies are those studies which are intended to be randomised by using methods of allocation such as alternation, date of birth, or case record number.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Male or female patients, of any age or ethnic origin, who had been diagnosed with IBS and who did not have an organic cause for their gastrointestinal symptoms. IBS can be diagnosed on the basis of one of the following three criteria: </P>
<P>Manning criteria (abdominal pain relieved with defecation, looser and/or more frequent stools with the onset of pain and abdominal distension (<LINK REF="REF-Manning-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manning 1978</LINK>)); </P>
<P>Rome I criteria (at least three months of continuous or recurrent symptoms of abdominal pain or discomfort that is relieved with defecation; and/or associated with a change in frequency of stool; and two or more of the following, at least on one-fourth of occasions or days: altered stool frequency, stool form, and stool passage, passage of mucus; and/or bloating or feeling of abdominal distension (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 1989</LINK>)); or </P>
<P>Rome II criteria (at least 12 weeks, not necessarily consecutive, in the preceding 12 months, of abdominal discomfort or pain that has two of three features: relieved with defecation, and/or onset associated with a change in frequency of stool; and/or onset associated with a change in form/appearance of stool (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 1999</LINK>)). </P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Interventions which involve hypnotherapy versus a control therapy such as standard medical therapy, psychological therapies (e.g. cognitive behavioral, psychotherapy or counseling), no treatment or wait-list controls were considered for inclusion. </P>
<P>It was required that the trials should describe the methods of the intervention to ascertain that hypnotherapy was performed rather than guided imagery or a relaxation technique. In addition, if studies were not explicit as to the specific elements used in the hypnotic technique but stated that hypnotherapy was performed, these too will be included. A tape may be provided for reinforcement of the session.<BR/> <BR/>Hypnotherapy should be performed by an appropriately qualified therapist and incorporate most of the following principals:<BR/>i. education and testing of hypnotic susceptibility in the subject, explanation of hypnosis and discussion of common misconceptions; <BR/>ii. performance of an induction procedure, such as using eye fixation;<BR/>iii. deepening techniques, such as progressive muscular relaxation and/or breathing relaxation; <BR/>iv. therapeutic suggestions, such as guided imagery, anchoring techniques and ego-strengthening (post-hypnotic suggestions can also be used especially to facilitate self hypnosis), and gut focussed scripts may be specifically used to target bowel symptoms; and<BR/>v. an alerting phase, involving orientation to the surroundings. </P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>The primary outcome measure of interest was the mean change in the overall bowel symptom severity score which combines abdominal pain, diarrhoea or constipation and bloating. Although the overall assessment of patients' well being is often used as the primary outcome in drug trials of IBS, the overall bowel symptom severity score is more commonly used in trials assessing psychological treatments for IBS. Secondary outcomes include mean changes in individual symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhoea, constipation, bloating, quality of life, patient's overall assessment of well-being, psychological measures as per validated questionnaires, and adverse events. </P>

<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>A. Electronic searching<BR/>Relevant randomised clinical trials and quasi-randomised clinical trials were found through structured searches of MEDLINE (1966 to March 2006), EMBASE (1980 to March 2006), PsycINFO (1806 to March 2006), CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, 1982 to March 2006), AMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, 1985 to March 2006) and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials.</P>
<P>The Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field was also contacted for additional citations. This entity within the Cochrane Collaboration focuses on unconventional interventions for preventing ill health, or promoting health. </P>

<P>C. Personal contact <BR/>The first author of each included study was contacted for information regarding unpublished trials. </P>
<P>D. Conference proceedings /hand searching </P>
<P>Hand searching of conference proceedings from Digestive Disease Week (1980 to 2005) was also conducted. </P>
<P>Studies in languages other than English were included and duplicate publications of the same trial were identified through reading the articles in question and contacting the authors if required. </P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Study selection:<BR/>Four authors independently screened the titles of abstracts resulting from the literature searches. Study eligibility for inclusion in the review were assessed against defined criteria. Any disagreement amongst authors was resolved by consensus agreement and/or discussion with the Cochrane IBD/FBD review group. </P>
<P>Quality assessment:<BR/>The quality of included trials was assessed by examining the individual attributes of the trials rather than giving trials an overall quality score. </P>
<P>Study quality was assessed using the following criteria:<BR/>i. generation of the random sequence: adequate (computer generated random numbers, table of random numbers or similar) or inadequate (other methods or not described);<BR/>ii. allocation concealment: adequate (central independent unit, sealed envelopes, or similar) or inadequate (not described or open table of random numbers or similar), or not used;<BR/>iii. blinding: adequate (identical or similar therapies) or inadequate (placebo not performed or no comparator described). Blinding of participants, study investigations and assessors to be recorded; and <BR/>iv. follow-up: adequate (number and reasons for drop-out and withdrawal) described or inadequate (number or reasons for drop-outs or withdrawals not described).</P>
<P>Data extraction:<BR/>Each author independently extracted data from the included studies. Any disagreement among reviewers was resolved by consensus agreement. Authors of primary studies were contacted to clarify necessary data and to provide missing information. </P>
<P>Statistical analysis:<BR/>RevMan was used to analyse data. Analyses were performed by intention to treat where possible.</P>
<P>All of the outcome measures studied were continuous variables. Therefore, the standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals were used to compare different measurement scales of the same outcome. </P>
<P>If studies compared outcome measures by using exactly the same measures or scales the weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals were used to assess the effect of treatment between groups.</P>

Four studies compared two types of hypnotherapy for IBS (<LINK REF="STD-Barabasz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Barabasz 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Flammer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Flammer 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Palsson-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Palsson 2002b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harvey-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Harvey 1989</LINK>). These studies were excluded as the purpose of this review was to compare hypnotherapy with another type of therapy or placebo/wait-list control. Three studies were follow-up studies assessing the efficacy of hypnotherapy in a cohort of patients after a period of time, rather than randomised controlled studies (<LINK REF="STD-Gonsalkorale-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gonsalkorale 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Houghton-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Houghton 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whorwell-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Whorwell 1987</LINK>). One study did not include hypnotherapy as an intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Boyce-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Boyce 2003</LINK>). Four randomised trials (<LINK REF="STD-Whorwell-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Whorwell 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Galovski-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Galovski 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Palsson-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Palsson 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 2006</LINK>) including 147 adult patients were identified and included in the review (Table of characteristics of included studies). No quasi-randomised studies were identified.</P>
<P>The included studies evaluated the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with hypnotherapy. <LINK REF="STD-Whorwell-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Whorwell 1984</LINK> compared hypnotherapy to supportive psychotherapy. Two studies compared hypnotherapy to wait-list controls (<LINK REF="STD-Palsson-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Palsson 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Galovski-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Galovski 1998</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 2006</LINK> compared the combination of hypnotherapy and usual medical therapy with usual medical therapy alone. All studies used gut focussed hypnotherapy; two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Palsson-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Palsson 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Galovski-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Galovski 1998</LINK>) used scripts based on the hypnosis techniques developed by <LINK REF="STD-Whorwell-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Whorwell 1984</LINK>. In the <LINK REF="STD-Whorwell-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Whorwell 1984</LINK> study, hypnotherapy consisted of seven half hour sessions over a three month period. In the <LINK REF="STD-Palsson-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Palsson 2002a</LINK> study, hypnotherapy was performed for seven 45 minute sessions over 12 weeks. In the <LINK REF="STD-Galovski-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Galovski 1998</LINK> study 12 half hour to one hour sessions were performed over 12 weeks. In the <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 2006</LINK> study hypnotherapy was performed for five weekly 30 minute sessions. </P>
<P>All patients were independently diagnosed with IBS by their gastroenterologist or treating physician. Patients had symptoms for at least 6 months in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Palsson-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Palsson 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Galovski-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Galovski 1998</LINK>). Eligible patients in the <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 2006</LINK> study had been consulting their general practitioner for IBS for more than 6 weeks, and had failed to manage their symptoms using one or more conventional treatments. In the <LINK REF="STD-Whorwell-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Whorwell 1984</LINK> study, patients had been under the care of their physician for 12 months and had not responded to any previous therapy. Rome 1 criteria were applied to patients for the diagnosis of IBS in the <LINK REF="STD-Palsson-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Palsson 2002a</LINK> study. Correspondence with the primary author of the <LINK REF="STD-Galovski-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Galovski 1998</LINK> study clarified that Rome criteria had been used to diagnose patients with IBS. In the <LINK REF="STD-Whorwell-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Whorwell 1984</LINK> study, IBS was defined by the presence of abdominal pain, a disordered bowel habit (diarrhoea, constipation, or alternating diarrhoea and constipation) and abdominal distension. The <LINK REF="STD-Whorwell-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Whorwell 1984</LINK> study predated the Rome criteria. For the <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 2006</LINK> study, IBS was independently diagnosed by a gastroenterologist but the criteria used to make the diagnosis were not stated. Correspondence with the primary author, clarified that the Rome criteria were not applied to the study population. The author stated that the study was to be primary care based and therefore a general practitioner diagnosis of IBS was used. This was deemed important by the author to enable generalisability to the primary care population. GP diagnosis had to have been given more than 6 weeks prior to enrolment and patients had to have tried at least one conventional therapy and failed to manage symptoms adequately. However the clinical signs, symptoms or investigations used to diagnose IBS by GPs were not provided and therefore the exact nature of the IBS diagnosis is unclear.</P>
<P>Outcome measures differed between the studies (see Table of characteristics of included studies). In the <LINK REF="STD-Whorwell-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Whorwell 1984</LINK> study all patients were asked to keep a diary card, on which they recorded the daily frequency and severity of abdominal pain and abdominal distension. The severity items were scored as follows: 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate and 3 = severe. Bowel habit and general wellbeing were also recorded and abnormality expressed on a similar 0 to 3 scale. The data for 7 days were totaled and the scores analysed separately using repeated analysis of variance. Post therapy comparisons were made by means of a Tukey multiple comparison test and were adjusted for pre-treatment levels. <LINK REF="STD-Galovski-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Galovski 1998</LINK> assessed change in the Composite Primary Reduction Score (CPRS). The CPRS equals the diarrhoea reduction score + constipation reduction score, divided by 2 (or 3) depending on the number of primary symptoms present. The diarrhoea reduction score equals the average pretreatment diarrhoea ratings minus the average post treatment diarrhoea ratings divided by the average pretreatment diarrhoea ratings. <LINK REF="STD-Palsson-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Palsson 2002a</LINK> evaluated 14 day diary symptom scores at each assessment time period (baseline, 2 weeks after completing treatment and 4 months later) for abdominal pain, bloating, proportion of hard/loose stools per day and bowel movement frequency. <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 2006</LINK> assessed a composite symptom score containing three dimensions (pain, constipation and diarrhoea) and an IBS-specific quality of life measure with eight dimensions (dysphoria, interference with activity, body image, health worry, food avoidance, social reaction, sexual function, and relationships) at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months post -randomisation.</P>

<P>
<B>SELECTION BIAS<BR/>
</B>The four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were assessed for allocation concealment. Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Whorwell-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Whorwell 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Galovski-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Galovski 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Palsson-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Palsson 2002a</LINK>) were not clear with respect to randomisation methods and so the primary authors were contacted to clarify this. Correspondence with the primary author of the first study (<LINK REF="STD-Whorwell-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Whorwell 1984</LINK>) clarified that randomisation was performed by using a sealed envelope with the treatment allocation inside. This method was deemed adequate (A) for allocation concealment. Correspondence with <LINK REF="STD-Palsson-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Palsson 2002a</LINK> revealed that randomisation was conducted using a randomisation computer program, and used immediately after individuals had completed a consent form and had formally enrolled in the study. Allocation concealment was unclear in the <LINK REF="STD-Palsson-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Palsson 2002a</LINK> study. Correspondence with the primary author of the Galovski 1998 study revealed that both names of each matched pair in the study were put into a "hat" and the first name drawn was randomised to the control condition .These names were drawn by an independent person not associated with the study. The process was repeated until all members of each pair were assigned. This method was not optimal (C) for ensuring adequate allocation concealment. In the final study (<LINK REF="STD-Roberts-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 2006</LINK>) blocked randomisation was by sealed envelope and was overseen in all clinics by both a consultant gastroenterologist and one of the research team. This method was deemed adequate (A) for ensuring allocation concealment.<BR/> <BR/>
<B>DETECTION BIAS<BR/>
</B>The blinding of patients and investigators was not used in the <LINK REF="STD-Palsson-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Palsson 2002a</LINK> study. However as symptom ratings were completed at home daily by patients over a two-week period, these outcome measures were not influenced by the investigators judgement or bias. The primary author was the assessor and the therapist in the <LINK REF="STD-Galovski-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Galovski 1998</LINK> study and therefore was not blinded to outcome measures. This introduces the potential for detection bias in this study. In the <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 2006</LINK> study author correspondence confirmed that outcomes were patient completed (returned by post) and therefore no assessor was involved. In the <LINK REF="STD-Whorwell-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Whorwell 1984</LINK> study author correspondence clarified that the person performing the outcome assessments undertook them completely blind to what treatment the patient was receiving. <BR/>
<B>
<BR/>ATTRITION BIAS<BR/>
</B>Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Galovski-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Galovski 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Palsson-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Palsson 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 2006</LINK>) documented reasons for exclusion and numbers of dropouts that were lost to follow-up. <LINK REF="STD-Whorwell-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Whorwell 1984</LINK> specified inclusion criteria but no exclusion criteria. Correspondence with the author clarified that there no dropouts.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>PERFORMANCE BIAS<BR/>
</B>The blinding of the clinician to treatment allocation in studies of hypnotherapy would not be feasible due to the nature of the intervention and the fact that the operator cannot be blinded to the specific clinical technique that they are performing on the patient. It is possible that an independent clinician not involved in the study or responsible for measuring or analysing outcome variables may limit bias. This did not occur in any of the included studies and the therapist performing hypnotherapy was also the person assessing outcome variables and analysing data. Therefore there is the potential for performance bias. The blinding of patients was not feasible due to the nature of the intervention. In the <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 2006</LINK> study the patient's general practitioner was also informed of the randomisation arm and requested to continue usual management for all participants, as the effectiveness of hypnotherapy was being assessed as a complementary, rather than an alternative therapy. However, this could introduce the potential for bias on the part of the general practitioner depending upon whether they have an affinity or aversion to hypnotherapy. Correspondence with the author of this study (<LINK REF="STD-Roberts-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 2006</LINK>) indicated that outcomes were patient completed and returned by post and therefore no assessor was involved. In the <LINK REF="STD-Whorwell-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Whorwell 1984</LINK> study author correspondence clarified that the same therapist performed the hypnotherapy as well as the supportive psychotherapy. The potential for bias with this method was acknowledged by the author as it is conceivable that if the same practitioner performs both hypnotherapy and psychotherapy, bias may be introduced into one arm of the study depending on which therapy the practitioner favoured.</P>
<P>
<B>ADDITIONAL QUALITY ASSESSMENT<BR/>Sample size calculation: </B>Three trials did not report a sample size calculation (<LINK REF="STD-Whorwell-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Whorwell 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Galovski-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Galovski 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Palsson-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Palsson 2002a</LINK>). In the <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 2006</LINK> study a sample size calculation was performed. Using previous estimates of variance for quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Drossman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drossman 2000</LINK>) it was calculated that 50 patients in each arm would enable a medium change in scores (standard difference = 0.60) to be detected with 90% power at the 5% significance level, that is, a change in mean quality of life score from 63 to 77.<BR/>
<B>Definition of inclusion/exclusion criteria:</B> Inclusion and exclusion criteria were stated clearly in the <LINK REF="STD-Palsson-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Palsson 2002a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 2006</LINK> studies. Exclusion criteria were not clearly stated in the <LINK REF="STD-Whorwell-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Whorwell 1984</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Galovski-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Galovski 1998</LINK> studies. Correspondence with <LINK REF="STD-Galovski-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Galovski 1998</LINK> clarified that patients were diagnosed with IBS by their physicians using Rome criteria. In the <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 2006</LINK> study IBS was independently diagnosed by a gastroenterologist but the criteria used to make the diagnosis were unclear. <BR/>
<B>Completeness of follow-up:</B> There were no dropouts and all patients completed the trial in the <LINK REF="STD-Whorwell-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Whorwell 1984</LINK>. A 20% drop-out rate was reported in the <LINK REF="STD-Palsson-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Palsson 2002a</LINK> study. In the <LINK REF="STD-Galovski-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Galovski 1998</LINK> study reasons for drop-outs were provided. Numbers and reasons for exclusions and dropouts were stated in the <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 2006</LINK> study.<BR/>
<B>Control and treatment groups comparable at entry: </B>Although<B> </B>the study by <LINK REF="STD-Galovski-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Galovski 1998</LINK> had a small sample size (n = 12) the study design ensured that all patients were matched for concurrent psychiatric diagnoses, susceptibility to hypnosis and various demographic factors. In the <LINK REF="STD-Palsson-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Palsson 2002a</LINK> study all patients were similar and had IBS for at least one year and fulfilled Rome criteria. In the <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 2006</LINK> study all patients had been consulting their general practitioner for IBS for more than six weeks. It is uncertain that control and treatment patients were matched in terms of clinical criteria for IBS.<BR/>
<B>Experience of the therapist:</B> The level of experience of the therapist performing hypnotherapy was clearly stated in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Galovski-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Galovski 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Palsson-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Palsson 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 2006</LINK>). This was not clearly stated in the <LINK REF="STD-Whorwell-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Whorwell 1984</LINK> study. However the therapeutic hypnosis technique was described in detail and the scripts and style of hypnotherapy have subsequently has been used by several other studies.<BR/>
<B>Type of hypnotherapy used:</B> "Gut directed" hypnotherapy was performed in all four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Whorwell-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Whorwell 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Galovski-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Galovski 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Palsson-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Palsson 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 2006</LINK>). Gut directed hypnotherapy refers to specific suggestions being included in the scripts that were directed to symptoms within the gastrointestinal tract in addition to general ego-strengthening type suggestions. Hypnotic induction in the <LINK REF="STD-Palsson-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Palsson 2002a</LINK> study was conducted verbatim following written scripts developed by one of the authors. A script partly modelled on the hypnosis techniques developed by <LINK REF="STD-Whorwell-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Whorwell 1984</LINK> was then used to provide hypnotic gut specific suggestions, overall physical relaxation, reduced perception of life threat and lessened attention to gut discomfort. The <LINK REF="STD-Galovski-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Galovski 1998</LINK> study utilized a hypnotherapy script provided by <LINK REF="STD-Whorwell-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Whorwell 1984</LINK> and therefore attempted to replicate Whorwell's original study. Hypnosis was induced in the <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 2006</LINK> study using a standard preliminary hypnotic induction technique (usually eye fixation) followed by standard deepening procedures. Therapeutic hypnotic suggestions were patient directed, with visualisations used according to the patient's predominant symptoms. Patients were encouraged to use images that they felt comfortable with and represented the symptoms they experienced. All four studies gave patients tapes of the sessions to practice daily auto-hypnosis at home. </P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>Four studies including a total of 147 patients met the inclusion criteria for the review, although their methodological quality was low. Data were not pooled for meta-analysis due to differences in outcomes and study design. The primary outcome measure of interest for this review was the mean change in the overall bowel symptom severity score which combined the primary symptoms of IBS: abdominal pain, diarrhoea or constipation and bloating. Although the overall assessment of patients' well being is often used as the primary outcome in drug trials of IBS, the overall bowel symptom severity score is more commonly used in trials assessing psychological treatments for IBS (<LINK REF="REF-Francis-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Francis 1997</LINK>). Two studies utilized overall symptom severity scores (<LINK REF="STD-Roberts-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Galovski-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Galovski 1998</LINK>). Data were not pooled for this outcome because different parameters were used to calculate the scores. Secondary outcomes included changes in individual symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhoea, constipation, bloating, quality of life, patient's overall assessment of well-being, psychological measures as per validated questionnaires, and adverse events. </P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Whorwell-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Whorwell 1984</LINK> study compared hypnotherapy with supportive psychotherapy. The supportive psychotherapy group received a placebo tablet and 7 half hour sessions of supportive psychotherapy. The hypnotherapy group was treated with seven half hour sessions of hypnotherapy of decreasing frequency over a three month period. Patients were given a tape of their hypnotherapy session after the third visit to continue practicing at home between sessions. <LINK REF="STD-Whorwell-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Whorwell 1984</LINK> reported a benefit in the hypnotherapy group at 3 months for abdominal pain, bowel habit, abdominal distension and general well being. Correspondence with the author revealed that the data were not available for analysis. The study was performed over 20 years ago and the data were stored on discs which are not compatible with todays technology. Also hard copies of the data were destroyed when the hospital changed sites.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Galovski-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Galovski 1998</LINK> study one patient in each of six matched pairs was randomly assigned to a hypnotherapy treatment arm or a wait-list control arm where symptoms were monitored for six weeks. This control group was then crossed over to the treatment arm after six weeks. The primary outcome was a composite measure of IBS symptoms (CPRS) and showed that treatment was superior to symptom monitoring. Using the daily symptom monitoring diaries, a single index, called the Composite Primary Symptom Reduction (CPSR) score, was calculated following the method of Blanchard and Schwartz (<LINK REF="REF-Blanchard-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blanchard 1988</LINK>). This score is an index of overall change in symptom level and also provides a means for describing clinically significant improvements in symptomatology. One patient in the treatment group dropped out due to a change in diagnosis and was not included in the statistical analysis. Results from the treatment condition (n = 5) revealed that three subjects (60%) were improved, one subject (20%) was somewhat improved, and one subject (20%) was unimproved. The symptom monitoring condition's (n = 6) results revealed that all six subjects were unimproved. The hypnotherapy subjects (n = 5) were found to be significantly (P = 0.0005) more improved (CPSR score of -0.55 and SD = 0.33) than the symptom monitoring wait-list controls (CPSR score of 0.32 and SD = 0.49) with a WMD of -0.87 and a 95% CI of -1.36 to -0.38.</P>
<P>Patients in the <LINK REF="STD-Palsson-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Palsson 2002a</LINK> study were randomly assigned to immediate hypnotherapy (IM, n = 15) or delayed hypnotherapy (DL, n = 15) a waiting list control. Six patients in the DL group 20%) dropped out after enrollment due to scheduling difficulties, relocation away from the study area, or unrelated medical problems. The IM group received hypnosis treatment immediately following a two-week symptom recording baseline data. They were then retested two weeks after completing treatment, and a third time approximately four months after completing treatment. Group DL (delayed), the waiting-list control group, received no hypnosis treatment for the first four months and were retested at a time corresponding to the end of treatment for group IM. The hypnotherapy group received seven 45-minute sessions of individual hypnosis treatment over approximately 12 weeks (one session every other week). Results favoured the hypnotherapy treatment group only for proportion of bowel movements rated as hard or watery (WMD = -0.25, 95% CI -0.38 to -0.12). It did not show a statistically significant difference for frequency of bowel movements (WMD = 0.20, 95% CI -1.06 to 1.46 ), bloating (WMD = -0.16, 95% CI -6.44 to 6.12) or abdominal pain (WMD = -3.90; 95% CI -10.60 to 2.80).</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 2006</LINK> study compared an intervention group (hypnotherapy and usual medical management) with a control group who received usual medical management and only the research clinic assessment and follow-up questionnaires. The usual medical management was provided by the patients' general practitioner. The hypnotherapy group received five half hour sessions approximately one week apart. At three months the hypnotherapy group (n = 34) had greater improvements in overall symptom scores (mean change from baseline 13.0 for hypnotherapy group (SD = 10.5) versus control group -4.5 (SD = 13.90), WMD -8.5, 95% CI -14.53 to -2.47). There was also a weaker but significant improvement in the abdominal pain score in the hypnotherapy group (n = 30, mean change from baseline -21.20, SD = 18.6) as compared to the control group (n = 26, mean change from baseline -6.80, SD = 20.4) with WMD -14.4 and 95% CI -24.69 to -4.11)). This study failed to show a benefit of hypnotherapy at 12 months for all outcome measures.</P>
<P>The presence of harmful adverse events was not mentioned in any study.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Four randomised clinical trials with a total of 147 patients, comparing hypnotherapy with another therapy or waiting-list control for treatment of IBS met the inclusion criteria for this review. Only two studies reported on the primary outcome measure specified for this review but different individual parameters were used to obtain the final symptom severity score and therefore precluded meta-analysis. Only one study compared hypnotherapy to an alternative therapy or placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Whorwell-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Whorwell 1984</LINK>). None of the included studies looked at hypnotherapy as first line therapy for IBS. The four included studies all studied IBS patients who had failed medical therapy. One was a primary care based study (<LINK REF="STD-Roberts-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 2006</LINK>) whilst three (<LINK REF="STD-Whorwell-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Whorwell 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Galovski-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Galovski 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Palsson-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Palsson 2002a</LINK>) were from specialist gastroenterology settings.</P>
<P>The included studies have several methodological limitations. Adequacy of blinding and intention to treat analysis were clearly stated in only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Roberts-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 2006</LINK>) however the diagnosis of IBS in this study population is uncertain as the clinical signs, symptoms or investigations used to diagnose IBS by GPs were not provided. The research methods (method of randomisation, blinding, allocation concealment) were not clearly outlined or were inadequate in the remaining three studies. Three of the trials did not calculate sample size a priori and were comprised of small patient numbers. The potential for bias (detection, performance, attrition) was evident in all of the trials as the hypnotherapist was also the person assessing outcome variables in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Whorwell-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Whorwell 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Galovski-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Galovski 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Palsson-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Palsson 2002a</LINK>) and in the <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 2006</LINK> study the patients' GP was aware of treatment assignment and therefore the potential to introduce bias was also evident in this study. </P>
<P>A formal meta-analysis was not possible due to differences in outcome measures and study design in the four included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Whorwell-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Whorwell 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Galovski-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Galovski 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Palsson-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Palsson 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 2006</LINK>) and loss of data in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Whorwell-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Whorwell 1984</LINK>). In the <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 2006</LINK> study abdominal pain was improved in the hypnotherapy group when compared with wait list controls at 3 months. In two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Galovski-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Galovski 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 2006</LINK>) an overall IBS symptom score improved with hypnotherapy when compared to wait-list control at 3 months. In only one study was long term outcome measured at 12 months and this did not show a sustained benefit for hypnotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Roberts-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 2006</LINK>). Hypnotherapy appears to be a safe intervention as adverse events were not reported in any of the included studies. However, the results of the included studies need to be interpreted with caution due to small size and methodological limitations. </P>
<P>In patients who fail medical treatment, hypnotherapy could be considered as a therapeutic intervention for abdominal pain and composite primary IBS symptoms. However even though the studies in this review suggest a beneficial effect in the short term, this has not been convincingly proven. The long term benefits of hypnotherapy are also uncertain as only one primary care based study, measured long term (12 months) outcomes in a systematic method and no benefit was found (<LINK REF="STD-Roberts-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 2006</LINK>). </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Although the four small studies in this review suggested a beneficial effect in the short term, this has not been convincingly proven. The results of the included studies need to be interpreted with caution due to the small size and methodological flaws of the included studies. Long term efficacy is uncertain as it has only been evaluated in the one study (<LINK REF="STD-Roberts-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 2006</LINK>) and this did not show a sustained benefit for hypnotherapy. However, hypnotherapy appears to be a safe intervention and could be tried in patients who fail standard medical therapy.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Given the paucity of high quality randomised controlled studies (RCTs) in this population, further RCTs are warranted, especially those with longer term follow-up. These RCTs should use a study design which assures high internal validity. They should also:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>consider evaluating the use of hypnotherapy in newly diagnosed IBS patients as opposed to patients who fail medical therapy;</LI>
<LI>undertake randomised controlled trials comparing hypnotherapy to an alternative therapy, as opposed to wait list controls;</LI>
<LI>evaluate the benefit of "booster" hypnotherapy to sustain efficacy of therapy and the validity of autohypnosis at home;</LI>
<LI>enroll children and adolescents;</LI>
<LI>calculate sample size a priori;</LI>
<LI>use standardized criteria (e.g. Rome III) to diagnose patients with IBS; </LI>
<LI>state clear inclusion and exclusion criteria;</LI>
<LI>use appropriate randomisation methods and allocation concealment to minimise selection bias;</LI>
<LI>describe patient withdrawal and dropouts and modify statistical analysis if appropriate;</LI>
<LI>attempt to blind assessors of treatment groups or use independent outcome assessors; and</LI>
<LI>follow up study participants in both control and hypnotherapy groups at prolonged intervals to ascertain whether initial effects are sustained. </LI>
</UL>
