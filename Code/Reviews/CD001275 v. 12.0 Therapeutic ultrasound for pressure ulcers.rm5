<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Pressure ulcers (also called pressure sores, bed sores or decubitus ulcers) are sores on the body caused by pressure or rubbing. They usually happen to immobile people, on bony parts of their bodies, such as hips, heels and elbows. </P>
<P>Low levels of ultrasound (not enough to generate heat) are sometimes used to treat pressure ulcers. It is not clear how ultrasound might affect healing, and ultrasound waves may have a positive or negative impact on the blood flow around the sore. The review with three trials involving 146 people found that there is very little evidence from trials on the effects of ultrasound on pressure ulcers. </P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-04-24 16:18:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For this update we searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (April 2008) , The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) - The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2008, Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to April Week 3 2008), Ovid EMBASE (1980 to 2008 Week 16) and Ovid CINAHL (1982 to April Week 3 2008).</P>

<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing therapeutic ultrasound with sham ultrasound or standard treatment. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors independently checked the result of the search to identify relevant RCTs. Details of eligible studies were extracted and summarised using a data extraction sheet.

Meta-analysis was used to combine the results of trials where the interventions and outcome measures were sufficiently similar. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Three trials involving 146 people were included. Two RCTs compared ultrasound therapy with sham ultrasound and the third compared a combination of ultrasound and ultraviolet light with laser and with standard treatment. </P>
<P>Neither of the two RCTs comparing ultrasound with sham found a significant difference in healing rates. The trials were pooled, in the absence of significant heterogeneity. There was no evidence of benefit associated with the use of ultrasound in the treatment of pressure ulcers. </P>
<P>In the three-arm comparison there was no statistically significant difference in ulcers healed. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is no evidence of benefit of ultrasound therapy in the treatment of pressure ulcers. However, the possibility of beneficial or harmful effect cannot be ruled out due to the small number of trials, some with methodological limitations and small numbers of participants. Further research is needed. </P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-05-08 12:03:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-04-22 17:26:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Pressure ulcers (also known as bed sores, pressure sores and decubitus ulcers) are areas of localised damage to the skin and underlying tissue caused by pressure, shear or friction. They usually occur over bony prominences such as the sacrum, heels, hips and elbows, most often in immobile elderly people (for example elderly orthopaedic patients), patients with severe acute illnesses (such as in people in Intensive Care Units) and in people with neurological problems (for example in people with spinal cord injuries).</P>
<P>Pressure ulcers have been recorded as occurring in 5 to 32% of patients admitted to a UK District General Hospital (the precise rate depends on case-mix) and 4 to 7% in the community (<LINK REF="REF-Kaltenthaler-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaltenthaler 2001</LINK>). They represent a major burden of sickness and reduced quality of life for patients and their carers, and are costly to health service providers.</P>
<P>Pressure ulcers present on a continuum of tissue damage from persistently reddened, unbroken skin (non-blanching erythema) through to destruction of the muscle and bone.</P>
<P>The treatment of pressure ulcers consists of four main strategies:</P>
<OL>
<LI>local treatment of the wound using wound dressings and other topical applications;</LI>
<LI>pressure relief using beds, mattresses or cushions, or by repositioning the patient;</LI>
<LI>treating concurrent conditions which may delay healing, e.g. poor nutrition, infection;</LI>
<LI>use of physical therapies such as electrical stimulation, electromagnetic, ultrasound, laser therapy.</LI>
</OL>
<P>The mechanisms by which ultrasound may affect wound healing have been reviewed by Dyson 1982. Briefly, the cellular effects of ultrasound can be divided in thermal and non-thermal (<LINK REF="REF-Dyson-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dyson 1982</LINK>); the lower intensities used therapeutically mean that any beneficial effects are likely to be due to non-thermal mechanisms (<LINK REF="REF-Dyson-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dyson 1987</LINK>). Non-thermal effects include the production of standing waves, acoustic streaming, microstreaming and cavitation. Some of these effects may be beneficial whilst others may be harmful. Standing waves may cause the arrest of blood flow, whilst cavitation may cause bubble formation within the blood stream (<LINK REF="REF-Dyson-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dyson 1987</LINK>). Careful choice of exposure time, intensity and continuous movement of the ultrasound applicator should minimize these effects.</P>
<P>In a Dutch Consensus Report on pressure ulcers, ultrasound was described as "potentially useful in individual cases of Grade IIIa pressure sore" (defined as a pressure ulcer with full thickness skin loss involving damage or necrosis to subcutaneous tissue)(<LINK REF="REF-CBO-Consensus-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">CBO Consensus 1986</LINK>), although a survey in the Netherlands found that only approximately 25% of nursing home doctors and nurses regarded ultrasound as "effective or very effective" for treating pressure ulcers (<LINK REF="REF-ter-Riet-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">ter Riet 1992</LINK>). A systematic review was therefore warranted in the face of this professional uncertainty.</P>
<P>A preliminary scan of the literature identified that therapeutic ultrasound has been evaluated in a number of different regimens: varying pulse duration, power output, and frequency.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2008-04-22 17:26:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The aim of this review was to systematically assess the evidence for the effectiveness of therapeutic ultrasound on pressure ulcer healing.</P>
<P>The review sought to answer the following questions:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Does therapeutic ultrasound stimulate pressure ulcer healing?</LI>
<LI>If therapeutic ultrasound does stimulate pressure ulcer healing, what is the optimum treatment regimen, in terms of pulse duration, power output from the probe, ultrasound frequency, length and frequency of treatment?</LI>

In the laser treatment group 4/6 (66%) ulcers healed, and in the standard wound care group 5/6 (83%) ulcers healed. There were no statistically significant difference between the groups, however this study was extremely underpowered.<BR/>Ultrasound/UV therapy compared with laser therapy (RR 1.44; 95% CI 0.85 to 2.64)(<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>);<BR/>ultrasound/UV therapy compared with standard treatment, (RR 1.18; 95% CI 0.84 to 1.72)(<LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>);<BR/>laser therapy compared with standard therapy, (RR 0.80; 95% CI 0.41 to 1.56)(<LINK REF="CMP-005.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the three-arm comparison there was an increase in the weekly healing rates associated with the ultrasound/ultraviolet combination compared with laser but the difference between the groups was not statistically significant. Similarly there was no statistically significant difference between ultrasound/ultraviolet and standard treatment.</P>
<P>The secondary outcome measures highlighted for this review: costs, quality of life, pain and acceptability were not reported in any of the RCTs.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>There is currently no evidence of a benefit associated with therapeutic ultrasound in the healing of pressure ulcers. All the trials included in this review have involved small numbers of patients, differing regimens of therapeutic ultrasound, and differing follow up periods, therefore more research is needed.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is no evidence of a benefit of using ultrasound therapy in the treatment of pressure ulcers. The possibility of a beneficial or a harmful effect cannot be ruled out due to the very small number of trials.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The studies summarised in this review are small, two have methodological problems, and clinicians may feel that ultrasound requires further evaluation in larger, well designed studies. Future research should pay attention to the following: Clearly defined inclusion and exclusion criteria for participants, sample size with sufficient power to detect important treatment effects, use of randomisation with allocation concealment (e.g. sealed envelopes, computer generated codes), blinded outcome assessment, use of objective outcome measurement (e.g. ulcer area, complete healing rates), intention-to-treat analysis and analysis which adjusts for imbalances in baseline variables such as ulcer size. In addition the frequency and duration of treatment, location of wounds and the treatments applied with ultrasound should be clearly described. </P>
<P>Randomised controlled trials require adequate reporting. The CONSORT statement (<LINK REF="REF-Begg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begg 1996</LINK>) lists 21 items should be reported to show readers whether or not a trial is likely to produce valid and reliable results. Further research into the relationship of therapeutic ultrasound and pressure ulcer healing needs to be reported in accordance with these guidelines. Future research should also include detailed reporting of concomitant interventions, as these can have important effects on healing. These include pressure relieving aids and wound dressings used.</P>

<P>For the first published version of this review the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register was searched for RCTs of ultrasound therapy until December 1999. The trials register is composed of searches from 19 electronic databases (including MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL), handsearching of journals and conference proceedings, and contact with experts and companies in the field. Citations within obtained reviews and papers were scrutinised to identify additional studies.</P>

<P>For the first and second updates we searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (May 2006), and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 2 2006) using the following search strategy:<BR/>1. LEG ULCER explode all trees (MeSH)<BR/>2. DECUBITUS ULCER explode all trees (MeSH)<BR/>3. (bed near sore*)<BR/>4. (pressure near ulcer*)<BR/>5. (pressure near sore*)<BR/>6. (decubitus near ulcer*)<BR/>7. (chronic near ulcer*)<BR/>8. (chronic near wound*)<BR/>9. (#1 or #2 or #3 or #4 or #5 or #6 or #7 or #8)<BR/>10. ULTRASONIC THERAPY explode all trees (MeSH)<BR/>11. (electric* near therapy)<BR/>12. (pulse* near therapy)<BR/>13. (pulsed or diapulse*)<BR/>14. ultrasound*<BR/>15. (ultra next sound*)<BR/>16. ultrason*<BR/>17. electrotherapy<BR/>18. (#10 or #11 or #12 or #13 or #14 or #15 or #16 or #17)<BR/>19. (#9 and #18)</P>
<P>In addition we hand searched The Proceedings of the "2nd World Union of Wound Healing Societies' Conference" (Paris, July 2004). The electronic files of the following German Medical Journals from the Thieme Verlag Germany and the Springer Verlag Germany were also checked from 1994 to May 2004:<BR/>Physikalische Medizin, Rehabilitationsmedizin, Kurortmedizin;<BR/>Aktuelle Dermatologie;<BR/>Aktuelle Rheumatologie;<BR/>Der Hautarzt.</P>
<P>The archives of the following journals from Blackwell and MPH Vrlag were also searched in from 1994 to May 2004:<BR/>Zeithrift fur Hautkrankheiten /SC;<BR/>Zeithrift fur Wundheilung /SC.</P>
<P>Finally citations within obtained reviews and papers were scrutinised to identify additional studies. There was no restriction on the basis of language, date of trial or publication status.</P>
