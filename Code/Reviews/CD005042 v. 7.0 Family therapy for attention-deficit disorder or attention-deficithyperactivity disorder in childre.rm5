<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>This review looks at whether family therapy can help children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) without medication. There are several medications and types of therapy used to treat ADHD. However, many families would rather that their children not take medication. Two studies met the criteria for quality of research method. One found no difference in children's symptoms of ADHD after either family therapy or normal treatment in the community. The second study found that family therapy was more effective than a medication placebo. Further research is needed.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is diagnosed in between 3% and 7% of school-age children and consists of the core symptoms of inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity. Children are often treated with medication, usually stimulant medication such as methylphenidate. Stimulant medication has been found to be effective for alleviating ADHD symptoms, at least in the short term. ADHD is also treated with a variety of psychosocial and psychoeducational interventions for parents, children, and with multicomponent interventions combined with medication management. However, many patients (10 to 13% of patients) cannot or prefer not to take medication. Family therapy without medication may help to develop structure in the family, help to manage children's behaviour, and may help families cope with distress from the presence of the disorder.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>This review seeks to address the question of whether family therapy without medication can reduce the core symptoms of ADHD as compared to no treatment or standard treatment.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The following electronic databases were searched using a specific search strategy: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2004), MEDLINE (1966 to April 2004), PsycINFO (1872 to April 2004), CINAHL (1982 to April 2004), Biosis (Biological Abstracts) (1985 to March 2004), Dissertation Abstracts (1980 to April 2004), and Sociological Abstracts (Sociofile) (1963 to April 2004). Hand searches of relevant journals and bibliographies were also conducted and experts in the field were contacted for further information.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Included studies were randomised controlled trials investigating the efficacy of behavioural family therapy, cognitive behavioural family therapy, or functional family therapy for children with ADHD or ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder).</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Studies were evaluated for methodological quality and to determine whether they met the inclusion criteria.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>This assessment yielded two studies. Data were extracted for both studies. The findings from Jensen 1999 (N=579) indicate that no difference can be detected between the efficacy of behavioural family therapy and treatment as usual in the community. The finding from the available data from Horn 1991 slightly favours treatment over medication placebo.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Further research examining the effectiveness of family therapy versus a no-treatment control condition is needed to determine whether family therapy is an effective intervention for children with ADHD. There were no results available from studies investigating forms of family therapy other than behavioural family therapy.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-07-25 16:01:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gretchen J Bjornstad">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-07-08 11:56:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most frequently diagnosed psychological disorders in children. The major symptoms of this disorder are developmentally inconsistent and chronic levels of inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Barkley-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barkley 1998</LINK>). In some cases, particular symptoms are predominant. In those cases, subtypes of the diagnosis can be indicated: attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, predominantly inattentive type or predominantly hyperactive-impulsive type. Where neither subtype predominates, individuals can be diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, combined type, which is the most common subtype of this disorder in children and adolescents (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2000</LINK>). ADHD is diagnosed in approximately 3% to 7% of school-age children (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2000</LINK>). Indeed, the number of patients visiting physicians for ADHD seems to be increasing from year to year (<LINK REF="REF-Goldman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldman 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Swanson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swanson 1995</LINK>). In England and Wales, the prevalence has been estimated to be approximately 5% of children aged 6 to 16 (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2000</LINK>). Adolescents with this disorder have been found to be more likely to have a comorbid oppositional defiant disorder or a comorbid conduct disorder than adolescents without a diagnosis of ADHD, and are more likely to self report more antisocial behaviour and poorer social competence than a control group (<LINK REF="REF-Barkley-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barkley 1991</LINK>). In addition, the majority of children who are diagnosed with ADHD through a rigorous set of criteria will continue to present with the core symptoms of ADHD into adolescence, and 43% will meet diagnostic criteria for conduct disorder at follow up (<LINK REF="REF-Barkley-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barkley 1990</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-07-08 11:56:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The medications most frequently prescribed for patients diagnosed with ADHD are stimulant medications such as methylphenidate or dexamphetamine (<LINK REF="REF-Wolraich-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolraich 1990</LINK>). Other medications such as antidepressants, antihypertensive medication, beta-blockers, and anticonvulsants are also used, generally when stimulants are not found to be effective for patients, or when comorbid diagnoses indicate that alternative treatment methods may be more applicable to certain cases (<LINK REF="REF-Barkley-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barkley 1998</LINK>). In the United States, for example, stimulant medications are the most frequently prescribed forms of psychotropic medication for children (<LINK REF="REF-Wolraich-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolraich 2003</LINK>). While a large number of studies have indicated that stimulant medication is effective for reducing symptoms of inattentiveness, impulsivity and hyperactivity in children and adolescents with ADHD in the short term, the long-term effectiveness of pharmacotherapy for ADHD is not known (<LINK REF="REF-Goldman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldman 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schachter-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schachter 2001</LINK>). One rigorous systematic review found that many studies lack a sufficiently long-term follow up and tend to score low on measures of quality (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1999</LINK>). There is also concern that stimulant medications are overprescribed or are prescribed without sufficiently using appropriate diagnostic criteria. For example, one longitudinal community study showed that the majority of children who had been prescribed stimulants had never met diagnostic criteria for any form of ADHD, and those who were diagnosed with ADHD-Not Otherwise Specified (NOS) were more likely to be prescribed stimulants if they met diagnostic criteria for oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) than if they did not (<LINK REF="REF-Angold-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Angold 2000</LINK>). This finding gives weight to the argument that prescription of stimulants may, in some cases, be augmented by comorbid behaviour disorders, which in turn might be addressed by nonpharmacological behavioural interventions rather than stimulants. ADHD is currently treated with a variety of either training interventions or psychotherapeutic interventions for parents, children, and teachers (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2000</LINK>). ADHD is most often treated with pharmacological interventions, sometimes in combination with other types of therapy. However, the effectiveness of such forms of therapy for children with ADHD and comorbid behaviour problems must be evaluated empirically to determine whether it is effective, and for which symptoms it is effective.</P>
<P>In the current literature, there is some evidence for the efficacy of various forms of family therapy for the treatment of attentional disorders in children (<LINK REF="REF-Carr-2000b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carr 2000b</LINK>). Many of these forms of family therapy can be categorised as those focused on changing problem-maintaining behaviour patterns and belief systems, and related mediating and moderating factors (<LINK REF="REF-Carr-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carr 2000a</LINK>). Examples of these types of family therapy are: Mental Research Institute (MRI) brief therapy, strategic family therapy, structural family therapy, cognitive-behavioural family therapy, and functional family therapy, all of which are described and categorised in a review of family therapy for behaviour problems (<LINK REF="REF-Carr-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carr 2000a</LINK>). These types of family therapy can be used to help families learn how best to support a child with this type of disability and how to avoid parenting practices, cycles of interactions, and other environmental factors that might exacerbate the problem.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2008-07-08 11:56:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Much of the evidence suggesting that family therapy is efficacious for children and adolescents with ADHD refers to multimodal forms of family therapy which include pharmacological components combined with family therapy or parent training, and sometimes individual therapy for children and school-based interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Carr-2000b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carr 2000b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MTA-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">MTA 1999</LINK>). Such evidence does not conclusively show that these types of interventions are significantly more effective than pharmacological treatment alone (<LINK REF="REF-MTA-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">MTA 1999</LINK>). Unfortunately, such conclusions do not benefit patients who do not respond to medication (10% to 13% of patients (<LINK REF="REF-Goldman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldman 1998</LINK>)), who suffer from unpleasant side effects from medication (e.g. decreased appetite, insomnia, anxiety, irritability, or tics (<LINK REF="REF-DuPaul-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">DuPaul 1998</LINK>)), or who are taking medications that cannot be taken along with ADHD medication (e.g. monoamine oxidase inhibitors (<LINK REF="REF-DuPaul-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">DuPaul 1998</LINK>). In addition, the Technology Appraisal Guidance from the National Institute for Clinical Excellence limits the usage of stimulants by recommending that methylphenidate be used only with children aged six and older who do not have "marked anxiety, agitation or tension; symptoms or family history of tics or Tourette's syndrome; hyperthyroidism; severe angina or cardiac arrhythmia; glaucoma; or thyrotoxicosis" and recommends caution in treatment for children with "epilepsy, psychotic disorders, or a history of drug or alcohol dependence" (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2000</LINK>, p.1). Furthermore, patient preference for non-pharmacological treatment is common. For example, it is reported that parents of children with ADHD tend to view parent training or support groups significantly more favourably than medication (<LINK REF="REF-Corkum-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corkum 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is evidence of the potential effectiveness of family therapy without pharmacological components for various internalising and externalising problems in children and adolescents with ADHD. For example, one clinical trial yielded results suggesting that family therapy and two types of parent training (behaviour management training, problem-solving and communication training), and structural family therapy, all produced reductions in parent-adolescent conflicts, improvement in communication between parents and adolescents, and reduced intensity of anger during conflicts over time, according to reports by mothers and their adolescents who had been diagnosed with ADHD (<LINK REF="STD-Barkley-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Barkley 1992</LINK>). These three forms of treatment were also found to produce improvements in school adjustment as reported by mothers and in various externalising and internalising problems (<LINK REF="STD-Barkley-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Barkley 1992</LINK>). However, a lack of a no-treatment control group in this study prevents the researchers from drawing conclusions about the effectiveness of these interventions relative to no treatment. In addition, information was not collected from schools to determine applicability of results across settings. Moreover, standard assessment questionnaires to measure changes in the core symptoms of ADHD were not used, as the researchers were not looking directly at treating ADHD symptoms, but rather other behavioural problems.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-07-25 16:01:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gretchen J Bjornstad">
<P>Non-systematic reviews of the literature examining the effectiveness of family therapy for symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity indicate that family therapy is effective when it helps parents understand and cope with their children's disorder, decreases family distress, and improves the structural aspects of the family such as the intergenerational hierarchy, rules and routines, and communication (<LINK REF="REF-Carr-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carr 2000a</LINK>). However, because these reviews have not been conducted systematically they are subject to a risk of bias. A systematic review that evaluates trials by taking into account their methodological quality is therefore needed. This systematic review will evaluate the efficacy of selected family therapy interventions for symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity in children with ADHD, independent of pharmacological treatments.</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Randomised controlled trials investigating the efficacy of methods of family therapy excluding medication for children with ADHD or ADD.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Trials were considered only if the participants were children or adolescents as defined by triallists, with diagnoses of ADHD or ADD as determined by DSM-III (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-APA-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1987</LINK>) or DSM-IV criteria (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-APA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2000</LINK>), diagnoses of Hyperkinetic Disorder as determined by ICD-9 or ICD-10 criteria (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1993</LINK>), or a cut-off score on a well-validated assessment measure (e.g. Conners' Parent Rating Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Conners-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conners 1998</LINK>)). Diagnoses must have been based on symptoms from at least two settings (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2000</LINK>). Definition of 'child' or 'adolescent' was left up to the triallists to account for cultural differences in these definitions. Participants may have had comorbid diagnoses, given the substantial prevalence of comorbid diagnoses with ADHD such as Oppositional-Defiant Disorder or Conduct Disorder (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-APA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2000</LINK>). Children must not be taking medication for their symptoms during the trials.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Family therapy interventions which include functional family therapy, cognitive-behavioural family therapy, or behavioural family therapy, all of which must include components with at least one parent and the child participating in some therapy sessions with therapist were included. These forms of family therapy were selected because they can be logically grouped together as they all contain a component of behavioural therapy in treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Carr-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carr 2000a</LINK>). Treatment methods which involved interventions with parents exclusively were excluded to avoid overlap with another ongoing review (<LINK REF="REF-Zwi-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zwi 2001</LINK>). Treatment methods were considered if they also included components with teachers. Trials in which medication was administered to the intervention group were excluded. Trials in which a separate group received medication were included, but analyses focused on family therapy group versus control group only.</P>

<P>The search strategy yielded 905 references, most of which contained abstracts. The titles and abstracts obtained were independently screened by the author (GB) and co-author (PM) for trials for possible inclusion. When such trials were identified, or when the abstract was missing from the reference, the entire articles were obtained. Full articles were obtained for 26 studies, which were then independently screened by the authors to decide whether the studies met the criteria for inclusion. In addition, one study author was contacted on 26 July 2004 to obtain information about an unpublished study presented at a conference; however, information about that study (<LINK REF="STD-Baumgartner-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Baumgartner 2001</LINK>) was not available from the author at that time (<LINK REF="REF-Crismon-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crismon 2004</LINK>).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Assessment of methodological quality </HEADING>
<P>Methodological quality was assessed independently by the author and co-author and any disagreements were resolved by discussion. Assessment was made of all included studies, to consider the following questions:<BR/>Was the assignment to treatment groups truly random?<BR/>Was allocation adequately concealed?<BR/>How complete was follow up?<BR/>How were the outcomes considered for people who withdrew?<BR/>Were they included in the analysis?<BR/>Were those assessing outcomes blind to the treatment allocation?</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Randomisation</HEADING>
<P>Randomisation was judged as 'adequate' when computer-generated random numbers, a random numbers table, or coin-tossing were used to allocate participants to treatment conditions.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Allocation concealment </HEADING>
<P>The trials were divided into quality categories as defined in the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2004</LINK>), where:<BR/>A: adequate allocation concealment; participants and researchers were unaware of participants' future allocation to condition until after decisions about eligibility were made and informed consent was obtained;<BR/>B: unclear concealment; allocation concealment measures were not described in detail;<BR/>C: inadequate allocation concealment; allocation was not concealed from either participants before informed consent or from researchers before decisions about inclusion were made;<BR/>D: allocation concealment not used.<BR/>For the purposes of this review, only trials meeting categories "A" or "B" were included.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Blinding of assessors </HEADING>
<P>It is not possible to blind either those who deliver family therapy or those who receive it to the nature of the intervention. It was a criterion for this review that assessors be blinded. Quality of blinding was determined primarily by whether those who assessed and coded outcome measures were blind to condition, and the quality of blinding was categorised where:<BR/>Adequate = assessor blind to condition;<BR/>Unclear = blinding of assessor not reported and information not available from researchers; and<BR/>Inadequate = assessor not blind to condition.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Loss to follow up </HEADING>
<P>Loss to follow up was assessed by categorising the studies by method of response to loss to follow up where:<BR/>Adequate = losses to follow up were equally distributed between treatment and comparison groups;<BR/>Unclear = information about losses to follow up unavailable; and<BR/>Inadequate = losses to follow up in excess of 30% or unevenly distributed between treatment and comparison groups.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Intention-to-treat </HEADING>
<P>Assessment also took into account whether researchers used intention-to-treat analyses by including measures from all participants, even those that did not participate fully in the treatment protocol, and by replacing missing data for each participant with the last available data from that participant (e.g. using pre-test scores at pre-test and post-test if participant did not provide post-test data) or with group means. The researchers categorised studies such that:<BR/>Adequate = intention-to-treat analyses performed or could be performed using available data;<BR/>Unclear = information about whether intention-to-treat analyses were performed was not available and could not be acquired by contacting the researchers of the study; and<BR/>Inadequate = intention-to-treat analyses were not performed and could not be done using available data.</P>

</B> (<LINK REF="STD-Jensen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 1999</LINK>):<BR/>This study was a multi-site investigation of the effectiveness of behavioural treatment, medication management, and their combination relative to each other and to treatment as usual in the community. The treatment program lasted 14 months and the study included 579 children of both genders aged 7 to 9.9 years. The behavioural treatment program combined parent training, child-focused treatment, and school-based intervention (N = 144). This intervention was a behavioural family intervention in that it taught parents behavioural skills to use in the home, which were combined with therapist-administered behavioural interventions with the children including a reward system, time outs, social reinforcement, and modelling. This combination was designed to change those patterns of child and parent behaviour which maintain the child's problem behaviour. The goal was that the children would begin to learn more appropriate behaviour and would begin to respond to behavioural interventions and that the parents would be able to manage the child in the home using their new skills (<LINK REF="REF-Carr-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carr 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jensen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 1999</LINK>).

This study allocated 96 families to one of six treatment conditions: placebo medication alone, low-dose stimulant therapy alone, high-dose stimulant therapy alone, placebo medication plus family therapy, low-dose stimulant therapy plus family therapy, and high-dose stimulant therapy plus family therapy. Only two conditions are of interest to this review: medication placebo alone (N = 16) and medication placebo plus family therapy (N = 16). The family therapy intervention was also designed to follow a behavioural family therapy model by combining behavioural interventions for children and parents to teach the children skills to regulate their behaviour while also teaching parents how to reinforce their children's appropriate behaviour and diminish coercive behaviour patterns in the family (<LINK REF="REF-Carr-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carr 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Horn-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Horn 1991</LINK>). It combined behavioural parent training and child self-control training plus consultation with teachers and use of a daily school-to-home report card of disruptive behaviour in the classroom.</P>
</INCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>The NIMH MTA study took care to include children of various backgrounds and with various comorbid diagnoses to promote generalisability (<LINK REF="STD-Jensen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 1999</LINK>). However, children with diagnoses which required immediate alternative treatment or which are known to respond to stimulant medication in negative ways were excluded. Children were diagnosed with ADHD Combined Type using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (<LINK REF="REF-Shaffer-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaffer 1996</LINK>), parent report, and reports from teachers on a standardised measure regarding ADHD symptoms. After screening, children were randomly assigned to conditions at the National Institute of Mental Health, although the specific method of randomisation is not clear. The allocation of participants took place after they had agreed to be randomised. Several outcome measures were used in this study to capture the many outcomes of interest; however, this weakened effect estimates in the results because multiple hypotheses were addressed simultaneously. However, Bonferroni corrections were used to raise the standard of proof and avoid making a Type I error. ADHD symptoms were measured using the inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity subscales of the SNAP measure for parents and teachers (<LINK REF="REF-Swanson-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swanson 1992</LINK>). In addition, blind observers rated ADHD symptoms exhibited by the children whilst they were in school. </P>
<P>The MTA researchers took a number of steps to ensure implementation fidelity, across the six sites (<LINK REF="STD-Jensen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 1999</LINK>). They utilized manualised treatments, regular supervision sessions with therapists, weekly treatment meetings, and they audiotaped all treatment sessions. In addition, the participants' compliance with medication treatment protocols was monitored. Compliance with behavioural treatment was not monitored, but attendance at treatment sessions was encouraged. Participants who did not comply fully with the treatment protocol were included in analyses in the same group to which they were allocated using an intent-to-treat method of analysis. However, the researchers did not carry pre-test data into post-test cells for participants who did not complete post-test measures. The researchers did conduct separate analyses including all participants and including only those that completed all measures and they stated that there were no differences between the findings of those two analyses. Despite this claim, presenting data for all participants, using the most recent available scores for missing outcome data would have been the more rigorous option. </P>
<P>The most significant methodological flaw in this otherwise rigorous study is that the community treatment group was not a proper no-treatment or waiting list control group. It was rather a group that was free to seek and receive treatment in the community, which included pharmacological treatment for approximately two thirds of participants in this group. Considering this issue on ethical grounds, this allowed the researchers to conduct this large-scale study over a long period of time without withholding treatments that have been found to be effective in previous research. However, this lowers the strength of conclusions that may be drawn about the effectiveness of each of the treatment methods of interest. It particularly inhibits conclusions being drawn about the non-pharmacological behavioural treatment as stimulant medication is known to be an effective treatment for ADHD, at least in the short term (<LINK REF="REF-Goldman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldman 1998</LINK>). Therefore, while it is useful to know how a well-designed behavioural treatment program compares to treatment as usual, if conclusions are to be drawn about the effectiveness of methods for patients who cannot or prefer not to take medication, a study with a no-treatment control group comparison is also needed. </P>
<P>The other study (<LINK REF="STD-Horn-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Horn 1991</LINK>) recruited families who had already been referred to one clinic for symptoms of ADHD, most of whom had intact marriages, were white, from the middle class, and living in the suburbs of a city in the Midwest of the United States, which limits the generalisability of the results of this study to a broad range of patients in various locations. Although the referred families were there due to symptoms of ADHD, the researchers did evaluate all potential participants for diagnoses of ADHD in a rigorous manner before inclusion in the study to ensure that they did not include any participants without a proper diagnosis. They used a clinical interview with parents, the Conners' Rating Scales (<LINK REF="REF-Conners-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conners 1998</LINK>) for parents and teachers, and psychometric testing of the child. A psychologist and a paediatrician then reviewed these data independently and children were invited to participate in the study only if there was agreement on a diagnosis. Children were included if they had comorbid diagnoses of conduct disorder or oppositional defiant disorder, but were excluded if they had comorbid diagnoses of anxiety, psychotic or depressive disorders, intellectual deficits, or physical disabilities. Any stimulant medications the children were taking prior to the study were discontinued two weeks before initiation of the study. </P>
<P>Informed consent was collected from parents before families were allocated to treatment conditions. Allocation was randomised; however, this was done in groups of 12 families at a time, by randomly allocating two of the 12 to each treatment condition. This method would have been more rigorous had all families been randomised at once, however, given the large number of conditions relative to the sample size, it was a way to ensure that the largest possible samples were present in each condition. Analyses showed that the only major demographic difference between groups was that the medication placebo only group contained significantly more non-white children than the other treatment groups. </P>
<P>The researchers (<LINK REF="STD-Horn-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Horn 1991</LINK>) ensured implementation fidelity in their behavioural treatment sessions by providing training for all therapists, using manualised methods and providing manuals to therapists for their reference, providing weekly supervision sessions, and audiotaping all therapy sessions for referral in supervision. Treatment compliance for behavioural therapy was not measured. Eighteen families dropped out of the study sometime between randomisation and post-testing. Dropouts were relatively balanced across treatment groups and no significant demographic differences were found between participants who completed treatment and dropouts. Data were analysed for all participants, including those that dropped out of the study after randomisation. However, the authors state that the results of those analyses were essentially the same as the results of analyses computed with only completers to justify the fact that they present only the completers' data in their publication. The data from the entire sample remain unavailable. However, the dropouts for the teacher measures were less than a third of the sample, so the data from the Conners' Teacher Hyperkinesis Index can be included in this review.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2008-07-25 16:25:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gretchen J Bjornstad">
<P>Many of the results reported by <LINK REF="STD-Jensen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 1999</LINK> were not directly relevant to the interests of those interested in the effectiveness of family therapy alone, and will thus be discussed only briefly. The researchers found that their medication management program was superior to both the behavioural treatment condition (p &#8804; 0.001) and the community treatment condition (p &#8804; 0.001), and was no different from the combined behavioural treatment and medication management condition (p = n.s.) for reducing symptoms of ADHD in children. Relevant to this review, they could not detect a difference in effectiveness between the behavioural treatment condition and the community treatment condition (p = n.s.).<BR/>The major results reported by <LINK REF="STD-Horn-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Horn 1991</LINK> were also not directly relevant to this review, but do contribute to the knowledge base in this area and will be discussed briefly here. Similar to the other included study (<LINK REF="STD-Jensen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 1999</LINK>), these researchers did not detect a difference between the combined family intervention plus medication management conditions and the medication management conditions in alleviating symptoms of ADHD (p-values not reported for nonsignificant results). They did find some evidence to support the hypothesis that a low dose of stimulant plus behavioural therapy can yield the same effects as a high dose of stimulant alone. The authors did not directly address the relative effectiveness of the medication placebo plus family therapy condition and the medication placebo alone condition in their discussion.<BR/>A meta-analysis cannot be conducted for the current version of the review because the comparison conditions used in the two included studies cannot be combined; one study used a medication placebo condition as a comparison whereas the other study used a treatment-as-usual in the community condition. As Figures 1.1 to 1.5 show (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>,<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK> , <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>) the analyses computed for <LINK REF="STD-Jensen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 1999</LINK> indicated that the results do not favour the family therapy condition or the community care condition when based on parent ratings of symptoms, teacher ratings of symptoms, or classroom observations. Analyses of the data of the second study (<LINK REF="STD-Horn-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Horn 1991</LINK>) were possible only for the data from the Conners' Teacher Hyperkinesis Index. This is due to the fact that the number of dropouts was larger for the parent measures than for the teacher measures in this study. Given that the dropouts for the teacher measure were less than a third of the originally randomised sample, the data for this measure can be included in this review. These results indicate that participants in the treatment condition scored lower (but not significantly) on the Conners' Teacher Hyperkinesis Index than participants in the medication placebo condition as is shown in <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>. </P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Given data from <LINK REF="STD-Jensen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 1999</LINK>, it is possible that for some children and families a manualised family therapy intervention, implemented in a rigorous manner may be just as effective, but not more effective than treatment as usual in a community. The fact that two-thirds of participants in the community treatment condition received stimulant medication and that there was no detectable difference between outcomes in the two groups suggests that a well-designed non-pharmacological family therapy program might be just as effective as the usual treatment patients receive, even if that includes medication. However, the effectiveness of family therapy could be better assessed if it is compared with a no-treatment condition. The results from <LINK REF="STD-Horn-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Horn 1991</LINK> indicate that family therapy with a medication placebo is significantly more effective in reducing ADHD symptoms in the classroom context than a medication placebo alone. While the information about the parents' perception of their children's ADHD symptoms was not available, the teacher reports are still quite valuable given that they may provide a more objective measure of the effectiveness of the intervention and indicate that the effects of the intervention extend to contexts outside the home. </P>
<P>If it is the case that a family therapy program is as effective as the treatment commonly provided in the community, and is more effective than medication placebo alone, it is important to consider under what conditions this type of intervention might be effective. The parent-training component of the therapy utilised in the MTA study (<LINK REF="STD-Jensen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 1999</LINK>) teaches parents effective and positive methods to increase appropriate behaviour in their children and diminish coercive interactions. It thus establishes a more authoritative role for the parents, securing the parent-child hierarchy, and teaching how the family environment can lead to the exhibition of behaviour problems in the child, diverting attributions of blame away from the child personally (<LINK REF="REF-Edwards-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 2002</LINK>). The child component of the therapy implements behavioural interventions to familiarise the child with the system and initiate the child's responses to behavioural treatment as they are simultaneously introduced in the home. In addition, the school component of the treatment program consists of consultation between the family therapist and the school, and reinforcement of appropriate school behaviours at home. The family therapy implemented in <LINK REF="STD-Horn-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Horn 1991</LINK> was similar to that of the MTA study (<LINK REF="STD-Jensen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 1999</LINK>) in that it combined a parent training intervention, a child-training component, and school consultation. The parent-training component involved teaching parents to manage their children's behaviour using methods based in social learning theory. The child-training component consisted of group self-control training in which children learned problem solving skills and anger management. The school consultation component consisted of updating teachers on the behaviour techniques being used in the home and having teachers utilize a daily report card to communicate to parents about their children's behaviour at school. The combination of these components from each intervention could enable the child to be more successful in the home and at school, by providing a clear structure and clear expectations. Indeed, while this clarity would be beneficial to any child, a child with ADHD may have considerably more need for such a structure to learn to manage his or her own behaviour (<LINK REF="REF-Edwards-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 2002</LINK>) given that a major manifestation of ADHD is behavioural disinhibition (<LINK REF="REF-Barkley-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barkley 1998</LINK>). Implementation of the interventions in these studies required that therapists had backgrounds in clinical psychology at the doctoral level, familiarity with social learning principles, treatment manuals, and regular supervision with clinical psychologists (<LINK REF="STD-Horn-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Horn 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Wells-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wells 2000</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>This review suggests that if practitioners are attempting to provide treatment for children with ADHD who cannot or prefer not to receive medication, a behaviourally-oriented, multicomponent family therapy program may be as effective as a normal treatment strategy for some children and their families, and possibly more effective than a medication placebo. However, it is important to note that these conclusions are based on data from only two studies. In addition, information about the effectiveness of other forms of family therapy such as structural, functional, or strategic family therapy is not available at this point. These methods may work as well as behavioural methods in that they will affect the interactions between family members in a way that may provide a more supportive and organised family environment in which to help the child manage his or her behaviours (<LINK REF="REF-Carr-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carr 2000a</LINK>).</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of family therapy for children and adolescents with ADHD. Studies must be conducted investigating various forms of family therapy compared to no- treatment or waiting list control conditions over long periods of time. The studies included here both investigated the effectiveness of behaviourally-oriented treatment programs, limiting the conclusions that can be drawn about various forms of family therapy at this point. There is much need for further evidence in this area to develop an understanding of how to treat children using family therapy without medication. Specifically, future research should explore this question by comparing various forms of family therapy with no-treatment control conditions to determine which specific methods and theories are most applicable to the symptoms of ADHD. These studies should be more rigorous than those available at present by including larger sample sizes to detect effects, well-concealed randomisation, control groups that do not access treatment as usual for at least a portion of the duration of the study, and measures of compliance with treatment by patients.</P>

Results indicated that both groups who received Ritalin showed more positive outcomes on various child measures than those receiving only family therapy or family therapy plus a medication placebo, however, parent and screeners' ratings tended to yield more positive outcomes for children in both family therapy conditions.

<P>The intervention in this study consisted of parent training only, with no direct participation of the child in therapy sessions. In addition, children were not properly diagnosed with ADHD as symptoms were reported by parents only.<BR/>This study compared parent training, parent counseling and support, and a waiting list control condition for children with parent-reported symptoms of ADHD. Results indicated more favourable outcomes for participants in the parent training group than for those in the comparison groups. N=78.</P>

<P>The participants in this study were not diagnosed with ADHD, rather they were included if they had, among other characteristics, complaints from parents about attention deficit symptoms, with no supporting assessments.<BR/>This study compared parent-child interaction training with a 'minimal treatment' control condition for children in low-income families with complaints of behavioural or emotional problems one year after treatment. Results indicated that parental reports of ADHD and internalising symptoms showed greater improvements in the treatment group as compared to the control group, and these results were supported by videotaped observations of children's behaviour. There was no difference between groups on ratings of children's oppositional behaviours. N=96.</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<P>There seems to be an error in the text on p 9 about the study of Horn 1991. The authors state (last sentence before discussion) that "participants in the treatment condition scored significantly lower on the Conners' Teacher Hyperkinesis Index than participants in the medication placebo condition as is shown in Figure 2.02". The results of this study are not in Figure 2.02 but in figure 6.02. Moreover the WMD shows a non-significant difference (95% CI includes zero) which contradicts the statement in the text.</P>
