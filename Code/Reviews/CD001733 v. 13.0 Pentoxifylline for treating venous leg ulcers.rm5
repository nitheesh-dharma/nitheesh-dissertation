<P>Substantive amendment. For this second update, published in the Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2007, new searches were carried out in (February 2007). 5 new studies identified, 3 were included in this review (Pizarro, Belcaro and Nikolovska). We are awaiting further information on 2 studies (De Sanctis and Marchitelli). We have received information about a possible negative trial that remains unpublished (possibly called the PRIDE study). However, further inquiries to the sources of this information have retrieved no additional details to assist in locating the study and a search of the manufacturer's database (including conference presentations) has not identified any such trial. Five additional studies were added to the Table of Excluded studies (n= 14).</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-05-07 11:29:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Venous leg ulcers are a common, recurring and disabling condition. The mainstay of treatment is the use of firm compression bandages or stockings to support the veins of the leg. Some leg ulcers take many months or years to heal and treatment is aimed at preventing infection and speeding up healing. Pentoxifylline is a tablet taken to improve blood circulation. The review of trials suggests that pentoxifylline, 400 mg tablet taken three times a day, increases the chance of healing.</P>

<P>No new trials were identified for this update. We included twelve trials involving 864 participants. The quality of trials was variable. Eleven trials compared pentoxifylline with placebo or no treatment. Pentoxifylline is more effective than placebo in terms of complete ulcer healing or significant improvement (RR 1.70, 95% CI 1.30 to 2.24). Pentoxifylline plus compression is more effective than placebo plus compression (RR 1.56, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.13). Pentoxifylline in the absence of compression appears to be more effective than placebo or no treatment (RR 2.25, 95% CI 1.49 to 3.39).</P>
<P>More adverse effects were reported in people receiving pentoxifylline (RR 1.56, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.22). Nearly three-quarters (72%) of the reported adverse effects were gastrointestinal.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Pentoxifylline is an effective adjunct to compression bandaging for treating venous ulcers and may be effective in the absence of compression. The majority of adverse effects were gastrointestinal disturbances. </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-10-25 12:03:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Leg ulcers are wounds on the lower limb that have remained unhealed for four to six weeks. The condition is thought to affect about one per cent of the population at some time in their life, with more women than men being affected (<LINK REF="REF-Callam-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Callam 1985</LINK>). Point or period prevalence of leg ulcers ranges from 0.4/1000 to 1.9/1000 population and prevalence increases with age (<LINK REF="REF-Callam-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Callam 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Baker-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baker 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walker-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 2002a</LINK>). Approximately 50 to 70% of leg ulcers are venous in origin. Prevalence of venous ulcers ranges from 0.62/1000 to 1.6/1000 (<LINK REF="REF-Baker-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baker 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nelz_x00e9_n-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelzén 1994</LINK>). It is likely that both these estimates are underestimating actual prevalence, as capture-recapture analysis to estimate missing cases in another prevalence study suggested a substantially greater prevalence than these studies identified (<LINK REF="REF-Walker-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 2002b</LINK>).</P>
<P>The association between calf-pump insufficiency and ulceration has long been known (<LINK REF="REF-Browse-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Browse 1983</LINK>). Two hypotheses have been advanced to explain the microcirculatory changes observed with venous ulceration. <LINK REF="REF-Browse-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Browse 1982</LINK> proposed that venous hypertension increases capillary permeability leading to the formation of an impermeable pericapillary fibrin cuff causing local tissue ischaemia. However, <LINK REF="REF-Coleridge-Smith-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coleridge Smith 1988</LINK> argued that the fibrin cuff is secondary to occlusion of capillaries by plugs of white cells, which creates distal ischaemia. The trapped white cells release agents which damage the endothelium, increasing capillary permeability and allowing the formation of the fibrin cuff. More recently, <LINK REF="REF-Coleridge-Smith-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coleridge Smith 1993</LINK> has suggested that it is the infiltration of the skin by white cell products alone that mediates tissue destruction. </P>
<P>Pentoxifylline, a haemorheological agent, is known to influence microcirculatory blood flow and oxygenation of ischaemic tissues, although the actual mechanism of action is uncertain (<LINK REF="REF-Brenner-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brenner 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stellin-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stellin 1989</LINK>). It is thought to increase red and white cell filterability, and decrease whole blood viscosity, platelet aggregation and fibrinogen levels (<LINK REF="REF-Brenner-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brenner 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Colgan-1990a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colgan 1990a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Another Cochrane review has shown that compression therapy increases the proportion of healed venous ulcers (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Meara-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Meara 2012</LINK>). However, despite the use of compression, a proportion of venous ulcers remain unhealed and therapies additional to compression may be beneficial. Pentoxifylline as an adjunct to compression therapy in venous ulcers has been the subject of trials that have reported conflicting results (<LINK REF="STD-Colgan-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Colgan 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dale-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dale 1999</LINK>). Pentoxifylline has also been compared with placebo without compression as standard therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Weitgasser-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Weitgasser 1983</LINK>).</P>

<P>We included studies involving people of any age in any care setting described as having venous leg ulcers. As there is no agreed standard for the diagnosis of venous ulceration, it was not possible to apply a standard definition. As a minimum, diagnosis of venous disease had to be derived from clinical signs and symptoms consistent with venous hypertension (i.e. ulcer located in the medial gaiter area; presence of varicose veins, eczema, pigmentation, induration and oedema, in any combination).</P>

<P>We assessed the risk of bias of each included study using the Cochrane Collaboration tool for assessing risk of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>).

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2010-12-07 12:32:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We expressed results as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). In the absence of significant heterogeneity, we used a fixed effects model when combining studies. Where heterogeneity was significant, we used a random effects model. Where trials excluded withdrawals after randomisation from the analysis, the withdrawals were incorporated back into the study results, either in the group from which they withdrew (if identified) or as failures in the treatment group. We calculated the number needed to treat from the pooled risk ratio using the formula 1/((RR-1) X PEER), where the patient expected event rate (PEER) was the lowest and highest control group event rate from among the pooled trials, as suggested in the Cochrane Reviewers Handbook 4.2.0 (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2003</LINK>). Values for the NNT were rounded up to nearest whole number.

<P>We specified subgroup analyses prior to synthesis of the studies; these comparisons included pentoxifylline compared with placebo or no treatment, with compression as a background therapy, pentoxifylline compared with placebo or no treatment, and pentoxifylline compared with other drug treatments. We assessed statistical heterogeneity using Chi-square and I<SUP>2</SUP> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). The I<SUP>2</SUP> indicates the percentage of between-study variation explained by true heterogeneity rather than chance effect. Where statistical heterogeneity was present (p&lt;0.1), the likely cause was investigated using pre-specified sensitivity analyses, to compare the impact of variations in methodology (allocation concealment, blinding, outcome), treatment (duration of treatment, absence of compression) and sample population. Probable cause was indicated when I<SUP>2</SUP> returned to near zero levels.</P>

<P>The majority of studies reported either complete healing of the reference ulcer or all ulcers on the reference leg as the primary outcome, or provided individual data from which proportions healed could be calculated. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Falanga-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Falanga 1999</LINK>) proportions healed were extrapolated from the life table analysis. <LINK REF="STD-Herdy-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Herdy 1997</LINK> reported the area for each participant's ulcer at baseline and trial completion. No ulcers completely healed. Rather than report a single trial as continuous data, the operational definitions for healing or significant improvement from <LINK REF="STD-Arenas-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Arenas 1988</LINK> were applied to create categorical data from <LINK REF="STD-Herdy-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Herdy 1997</LINK>. No ulcers met this criterion in either arm. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Falanga-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Falanga 1999</LINK>) compared two different doses of pentoxifylline (1200 mg and 2400 mg daily) with the placebo. For the purposes of this analysis, the two treatment arms were added together and we conducted sensitivity analyses to test the impact of this. In addition, this study also excluded 2 participants after randomisation. These participants have been added to the denominator in the treatment arm as treatment failures, in order to prevent over-estimation of the treatment effect. Another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Pizarro-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Pizarro 1996</LINK>) was a four arm trial, in which two arms received the same dose of pentoxifylline and two arms received a placebo. Following advice from the Cochrane Wound Groups editorial base, we decided to combine the two pentoxifylline arms and the two placebo arms.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-05-12 18:08:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>On the basis of current evidence pentoxifylline appears to be an effective treatment for venous leg ulcers, either as an adjuvant to compression, or alone where compression cannot be used. Most side effects were gastrointestinal effects, and were tolerated by participants.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Pentoxifylline with compression</HEADING>
<P>Pentoxifylline is an effective adjunct to compression therapy. Overall there was an absolute increase in healing of 21% (95%CI 8 to 34%) in favour of pentoxifylline as an adjuvant to compression. As control event rates ranged from a high of 62.2% to a low of 16.67%, the NNT may range from 3 (95%CI 2 to 12) to 11 (95%CI 6 to 43). The cost-effectiveness of pentoxifylline and compression was reported alongside one of the included trials (<LINK REF="REF-Bosanquet-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bosanquet 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dale-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dale 1999</LINK>), but this information has yet to be fully reported. However, economic modelling involving four of the trials that used pentoxifylline as an adjuvant to compression (<LINK REF="STD-Sch_x00fc_rmann-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Schürmann 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Colgan-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Colgan 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dale-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dale 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Falanga-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Falanga 1999</LINK>) suggested a mean cost saving of GBP 98.09 (95%CI -49.21 to 245.00) per QALY gained if pentoxifylline was used (<LINK REF="REF-Iglesias-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iglesias 2006</LINK>). The dominance of pentoxifylline if the other three trials were included in an economic analysis is currently unknown. However, it seems most likely that pentoxifylline would remain the dominant economic strategy given the additional trials favoured pentoxifylline.</P>
<P>Where participants were sampled from a hard-to-heal population, the absolute increase in healing was 37% (95% CI 26 to 48%). As control event rates ranged from a high of 28.6% to a low of 16.67%, the NNT may range from 7 (95%CI 4 to 25) to 11 (95%CI 6 to 43). Other trials may also have inadvertently recruited hard-to-heal participants as part of their sample. An individual patient data meta-analysis using a prognostic index could test the hypothesis that pentoxifylline is more effective as an adjuvant in hard-to-heal populations and "normal healing" participants.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Pentoxifylline without compression</HEADING>
<P>Pentoxifylline appears to be more effective than placebo or no treatment in the absence of compression. The absolute increase in healing was 23% (95%CI 4 to 43). As control event rates ranged from a high of 27.5%% to a low of 23.3%, the NNT may range from 3 (95%CI 2 to 8) to 4 (95%CI 2 to 9). This finding suggests it should be considered for use in people unable to tolerate compression bandaging, or those who do not want to use compression.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Limitations</HEADING>
<P>Subgroup analyses are observational and thus prone to bias. In addition subgroup using a threshold of 5% for statistical significance means there is a 1:20 chance that a subgroup analysis will be significant by chance alone. Although hard-to-heal participant populations appear to explain the statistical heterogeneity amongst the included trials, such a conclusion may be misleading. Therefore these analyses should be considered exploratory rather than conclusive.</P>
<P>Although analysis suggests publication bias is unlikely to be present, the threat cannot be ruled out. We have received advice that a negative study of pentoxifylline in venous ulceration remains unpublished (possibly called the PRIDE study). However, we have not been able to locate any information about such a study, despite [1] the manufacturer searching their internal database, [2] requests for more information from the two sources of the information, and [3] letters to relevant journals. If any readers have information about such a negative trial, we would welcome their contacting us. In the absence of such information, we calculated a fail-safe N (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenthal-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenthal 1984</LINK>) to determine how many unpublished null studies would be necessary to reduce our findings from significant to non-significant: 120 null studies would be needed. It should be noted that the fail-safe N can only be an overestimate of the number of negative studies needed to refute our findings (<LINK REF="REF-Soeken-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soeken 2003</LINK>). However, until credible information becomes available about a negative study, we believe current evidence supports the use of pentoxifylline.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-05-12 10:42:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Pentoxifylline is an effective adjunct to compression bandaging for treating venous ulcers. In the absence of compression, pentoxifylline also appears to be effective for treating venous ulcers. The majority of adverse effects were gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, indigestion and diarrhoea).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-05-12 10:42:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The quality of the research and reporting was variable, with early studies being of poorer quality. Important messages for future studies are:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Future trials should be registered with a WHO approved registry.</LI>
<LI>The CONSORT statement (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>) should be used as a guideline for reporting.</LI>
<LI>Recruitment numbers should be based on an a priori sample size calculation given that the likely treatment benefit can now be inferred.</LI>
<LI>Compression therapy should be clearly described, to assist with appropriate combination of trials.</LI>
<LI>Objective outcome measures should be used. Examples include complete healing or absolute change in ulcerated area (including standard deviations). Time to healing, whether average or median, is an important outcome for clinical practice, but is infrequently reported.</LI>
<LI>Where multiple ulcers exist, complete healing of all ulcers, even if bilateral, should be the endpoint in a drug trial.</LI>
<LI>Short duration trials should be avoided.</LI>
<LI>Analysis should be by intention-to-treat of all people following randomisation.</LI>
<LI>An economic analysis incorporating recently located trials should be undertaken.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Areas for further investigation include:</P>
<OL>
<LI>An individual participant meta-analysis to test the relative effects of pentoxifylline on participants meeting criteria for slow-to-heal ulcers in comparison with those that might be considered "normal" healers.</LI>
<LI>Cost effectiveness in people unable to tolerate compression.</LI>
<LI>Trials of lower doses to test efficacy and tolerability.</LI>
<LI>Trials to test effect on prevention of recurrence.</LI>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.  Was the allocation sequence randomly generated?</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">low risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>The investigators describe a random component in the sequence generation process such as: referring to a random number table; using a computer random number generator; coin tossing; shuffling cards or envelopes; throwing dice; drawing of lots.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">high risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>The investigators describe a non-random component in the sequence generation process. Usually, the description would involve some systematic, non-random approach, for example: sequence generated by odd or even date of birth; sequence generated by some rule based on date (or day) of admission; sequence generated by some rule based on hospital or clinic record number.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Unclear</HEADING>
<P>Insufficient information about the sequence generation process to permit judgement of &#8216;Yes&#8217; or &#8216;No&#8217;.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.  Was the treatment allocation adequately concealed?</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">low risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Participants and investigators enrolling participants could not foresee assignment because one of the following, or an equivalent method, was used to conceal allocation: central allocation (including telephone, web-based and pharmacy-controlled randomisation); sequentially-numbered drug containers of identical appearance; sequentially-numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">high risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Participants or investigators enrolling participants could possibly foresee assignments and thus introduce selection bias, such as allocation based on: using an open random allocation schedule (e.g. a list of random numbers); assignment envelopes were used without appropriate safeguards (e.g. if envelopes were unsealed or non­ opaque or not sequentially numbered); alternation or rotation; date of birth; case record number; any other explicitly unconcealed procedure.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Unclear</HEADING>
<P>Insufficient information to permit judgement of &#8216;Yes&#8217; or &#8216;No&#8217;. This is usually the case if the method of concealment is not described or not described in sufficient detail to allow a definite judgement, for example if the use of assignment envelopes is described, but it remains unclear whether envelopes were sequentially numbered, opaque and sealed.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">3.  Blinding was knowledge of the allocated interventions adequately prevented during the study?</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">low risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Any one of the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>No blinding, but the review authors judge that the outcome and the outcome measurement are not likely to be influenced by lack of blinding.</LI>
<LI>Blinding of participants and key study personnel ensured, and unlikely that the blinding could have been broken.</LI>
<LI>Either participants or some key study personnel were not blinded, but outcome assessment was blinded and the non-blinding of others unlikely to introduce bias</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">high risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Any one of the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>No blinding or incomplete blinding, and the outcome or outcome measurement is likely to be influenced by lack of blinding.</LI>
<LI>Blinding of key study participants and personnel attempted, but likely that the blinding could have been broken.</LI>
<LI>Either participants or some key study personnel were not blinded, and the non-blinding of others likely to introduce bias.</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">4.  Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed?</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">low risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Any one of the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>No missing outcome data.</LI>
<LI>Reasons for missing outcome data unlikely to be related to true outcome (for survival data, censoring unlikely to be introducing bias).</LI>
<LI>Missing outcome data balanced in numbers across intervention groups, with similar reasons for missing data across groups.</LI>
<LI>For dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes compared with observed event risk not enough to have a clinically relevant impact on the intervention effect estimate.</LI>
<LI>For continuous outcome data, plausible effect size (difference in means or standardised difference in means) among missing outcomes not enough to have a clinically relevant impact on observed effect size.</LI>
<LI>Missing data have been imputed using appropriate methods.</LI>
</UL>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">high risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Any one of the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Reason for missing outcome data likely to be related to true outcome, with either imbalance in numbers or reasons for missing data across intervention groups.</LI>
<LI>For dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes compared with observed event risk enough to induce clinically relevant bias in intervention effect estimate.</LI>
<LI>For continuous outcome data, plausible effect size (difference in means or standardized difference in means) among missing outcomes enough to induce clinically relevant bias in observed effect size.</LI>
<LI>&#8216;As-treated&#8217; analysis done with substantial departure of the intervention received from that assigned at randomisation.</LI>
