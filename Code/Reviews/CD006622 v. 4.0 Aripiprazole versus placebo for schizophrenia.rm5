<P>Schizophrenia is one of the major psychiatric disorders; it affects individuals' thinking, perception, affect and behaviour. It can occur in around 1% of the population. Aripiprazole is one of the newer antipsychotic medications introduced for the treatment of schizophrenia. When compared with placebo, people taking aripiprazole had fewer relapses, smaller numbers of participants left study early, and needed less additional antipsychotic medications. Insomnia and headache were the most commonly reported side effects, but were not much difference to placebo. Side effects such as akathisia, nausea and weight gain occurred more in the aripripazole group as compared to placebo. There has been a worry with newer antipsychotic medications and their effect on conductance problems in the heart, impaired glucose levels and excessive production of prolactin (which can cause unpleasant breast pain and secretion). On the limited evidence available (due to participants leaving early and fewer studies) aripiprazole appears to have a similar effect to that of placebo. The overall finding on its efficacy in treating schizophrenia is unchanged from those found in the original review.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-06-17 17:42:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>First generation 'typical' antipsychotics such as chlorpromazine and haloperidol have been the mainstay of treatment up until the introduction of the second generation 'atypical' antipsychotics such as risperidone and olanzapine. Typical and atypical antipsychotics do provide a treatment response for most people with schizophrenia, whether a reduction in psychotic episodes or a lessening in the severity of their illness. However, a proportion of people still do not respond adequately to antipsychotic medication. Additionally, atypical and especially typical antipsychotics are associated with serious adverse effects, which can often compromise compliance with medication and therefore increase the incidences of relapse. In this review we examine the effects of aripiprazole compared with placebo.</P>

<P>Despite the fact that 2585 people participated in nine randomised aripiprazole studies, we were unable to extract any usable data on death, service outcomes, general functioning, behaviour, engagement with services, satisfaction with treatment; economic outcomes or cognitive functioning. In general, study attrition was very large for all studies over four weeks' duration. There was high attrition in most of the included studies. Fewer people left the aripiprazole group compared with those in the placebo group (n = 2585, 9 RCTs, RR 0.73 CI 0.60 to 0.87). Compared with placebo, aripiprazole significantly decreased relapse in both the short (n = 310, 1 RCT, RR 0.59 CI 0.45 to 0.77) and medium term (n = 310, 1 RCT, RR 0.66 CI 0.53 to 0.81). It also produced better compliance with study protocol (n = 2275, 8 RCTs, RR 0.74 CI 0.59 to 0.93). Aripiprazole may decrease prolactin levels below those expected from placebo (n = 305, 2 RCT, RR 0.21 CI 0.11 to 0.37). Insomnia (~23%) and headaches (~15%) were commonly reported in both groups, with no significant difference.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-06-17 17:45:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Aripiprazole may be effective for the treatment of schizophrenia. Aripiprazole has a lower risk of raised prolactin and prolongation of the QTc interval. Clearly reported pragmatic short-, medium- and long-term randomised controlled trials should be undertaken to determine its position in everyday clinical practice.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-06-17 17:49:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Schizophrenia is one of the major psychiatric disorders; it affects individuals' thinking, perception, affect and behaviour. The lifetime prevalence of schizophrenia is reported to be between 0.4% and 1.4% across populations (<LINK REF="REF-Cannon-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cannon 1996</LINK>). Typically, schizophrenia is preceded by prodromal symptoms such as deterioration in functioning, unusual behaviour, disturbed communications etc.; these changes can be gradual. But a number of individuals may not have any prodromal symptoms and present with an acute first episode. The course of schizophrenia can be either continuous, or episodic, with progressive or stable deficit, or there can be one or more episodes with complete or incomplete remission (<LINK REF="REF-ICD-10" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICD 10</LINK>). Between 14% and 20% of patients will recover fully; others will show improvement, but will have recurrences. The early stages of schizophrenia are characterised by repeated exaggeration of symptoms, with a high proportion responding to the initial treatment of antipsychotic medications. Around 80% will relapse within five years (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2009</LINK>). The mortality amongst people with schizophrenia is approximately 50% above the general population, partly related to high suicide rates, violent deaths and increased risk of physical health problems (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2009</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-06-17 17:51:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>'Atypical' or 'second generation' antipsychotics include drugs such as clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, amisulpiride and ziprasidone. Initially, these were said to differ from typical antipsychotics in that they were found not to cause movement disorders (catalepsy) in rats at clinically effective doses (<LINK REF="REF-Arnt-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arnt 1998</LINK>). These atypical drugs, however, are far from ideal, and problematic adverse effects do occur. With the exception of ziprasidone, most atypicals are associated with weight gain (<LINK REF="REF-Anath-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anath 2003</LINK>). Clozapine, which is used for people whose illness is 'treatment-resistant', may induce life-threatening decreases in white blood cells (agranulocytosis) as well as heart problems (acute myocarditis, cardiomyopathy) and diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Rivas_x002d_Vasquez-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rivas-Vasquez 2003</LINK>). Atypical antipsychotics are costly but may be better tolerated than older anitpyschotics, with less frequent extrapyramidal symptoms are reported. Aripiprazole is reported to cause little or no elevation of prolactin concentration. Aripiprazole is claimed to be at least as effective for positive symptoms of schizophrenia and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. It has also been suggested that aripiprazole may be associated with fewer movement disorders (parkinsonism, dystonias, tardive dyskinesia), less weight gain and reduced negative effects on the heart (QTc interval abnormalities) and on glucose metabolism compared with standard antipsychotics (<LINK REF="REF-Rivas_x002d_Vasquez-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rivas-Vasquez 2003</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Technical background</HEADING>
<P>Aripiprazole is said to be the prototype of a new third generation of antipsychotics, the so-called dopamine-serotonin system stabilisers (<LINK REF="STD-McQuade-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McQuade 2002</LINK>). It is reported to exert its antipsychotic effects by acting as a partial agonist at D2 dopamine- and 5-HT1a serotonin receptors, and as an antagonist at 5-HT2 serotonin receptors (<LINK REF="REF-Grunder-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grunder 2006</LINK>). It has been postulated that, through the above receptor site actions, and hence dopamine and serotonin system stabilisation, a partial D2 agonist would be able to act as an antagonist in pathways where an abundance of dopamine was producing psychosis. However, it would stimulate receptors as an agonist at sites in which low dopaminergic tone would produce side effects (e.g. areas mediating motor movement and prolactin release) (<LINK REF="REF-Rivas_x002d_Vasquez-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rivas-Vasquez 2003</LINK>). Aripiprazole, however, also has an affinity to other receptors including D3, D4, 5-HT2c, 5-HT7, alpha-1 adrenergic and H1 histamine receptors (<LINK REF="REF-Burris-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burris 2002</LINK>). When taken orally, aripiprazole has bioavailability of 87% and peak plasma concentration occurring at three to five hours; the recommended target dose for aripiprazole is 10 mg to 15 mg per day (dose range 10 mg to 30 mg) (<LINK REF="REF-Abilify-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abilify 2006</LINK>). Phase III trials were initially conducted in Japan in 1995, and the drug was granted approved status for the treatment of schizophrenia by the Food and Drug Adminstration (USA) on 15 November 2002 (<LINK REF="REF-FDA-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 2002a</LINK>). Aripiprazole has since been licensed in most countries worldwide, and is available as tablets, orally disintegrating tablets, oral solution and intramuscular injection.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-06-30 10:07:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Aripiprazole is one of the newer antipsychotic medications; it is marketed as having a different mechanism of action and a better side effect profile compared to others, particularly with regard to weight gain and prolactin levels. This review looks at, and updates data from a single comparison of a previous systematic review, Aripiprazole for schizophrenia (<LINK REF="REF-El_x002d_Sayeh-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">El-Sayeh 2006</LINK>). A single comparison has been split out of the old review and used to create a new review, one that assesses aripiprazole's efficacy and side effects compared to placebo. This placebo review will then become part of a family of aripiprazole reviews: Aripiprazole versus typical antipyschotics (<LINK REF="REF-Bhattacharjee-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhattacharjee 2008</LINK>) and Aripiprazole versus other atypical antipsychotics (<LINK REF="REF-Komossa-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Komossa 2007</LINK>).</P>

<P>We included all relevant randomised controlled trials. Where a trial was described as 'double-blind', but it was implied that the study was randomised, we included the trial in a sensitivity analysis. If there was no substantive difference within primary outcomes (see 'types of outcome measures') when these 'implied randomisation' studies were added, then we included these in the final analysis. If there was a substantive difference, we only analysed clearly randomised trials and described the results of the sensitivity analysis in the text. We excluded quasi-randomised studies, such as those allocating by using alternate days of the week. Randomised cross-over studies were eligible, but only data up to the point of first cross-over because of the instability of the problem behaviours and the likely carryover effects of all treatments.</P>

We decided to primarily use endpoint data, and only use change data if the former were not available. We combined endpoint and change data in the analysis as we used mean differences (MD) rather than standardised mean differences throughout (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.4 Skewed data</HEADING>
<P>Continuous data on clinical and social outcomes are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data, we aimed to apply the following standards to all data before inclusion: a) standard deviations and means are reported in the paper or obtainable from the authors; b) when a scale starts from the finite number zero, the standard deviation, when multiplied by two, is less than the mean (as otherwise the mean is unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution, (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>); c) if a scale started from a positive value (such as PANSS which can have values from 30 to 210) the calculation described above was modified to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skew is present if 2SD&gt;(S-S min), where S is the mean score and S min is the minimum score. Endpoint scores on scales often have a finite start and end point and these rules can be applied. When continuous data are presented on a scale that includes a possibility of negative values (such as change data), it is difficult to tell whether data are skewed or not. We entered skewed data from studies of less than 200 participants in additional tables rather than into an analysis. Skewed data pose less of a problem when looking at mean if the sample size is large, we entered such data into syntheses.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.5 Common measure</HEADING>
<P>To facilitate comparison between trials, we intended to convert variables that can be reported in different metrics, such as days in hospital (mean days per year, per week or per month) to a common metric (e.g. mean days per month).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.6 Conversion of continuous to binary</HEADING>
<P>Where possible, we made efforts to convert outcome measures to dichotomous data. This can be done by identifying cut-off points on rating scales and dividing participants accordingly into 'clinically improved' or 'not clinically improved'. It is generally assumed that if there is a 50% reduction in a scale-derived score such as the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS, <LINK REF="REF-Overall-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1962</LINK>) or the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS, <LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>), this could be considered as a clinically significant response (<LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005a</LINK>). If data based on these thresholds were not available, we used the primary cut-off presented by the original authors.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.7 Direction of graphs</HEADING>
<P>Where possible, we entered data in such a way that the area to the left of the line of no effect indicated a favourable outcome for aripiprazole. Where keeping to this made it impossible to avoid outcome titles with clumsy double-negatives (e.g. 'Not improved') we reported data where the left of the line indicates an unfavourable outcome. This was noted in the relevant graphs.</P>

<P>We used the GRADE approach to interpret findings (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2008</LINK>) and used GRADE profiler (<A HREF="http://www.ims.cochrane.org/revman/gradepro">GRADEPRO</A>) to import data from Review Manager 5 (<A HREF="http://www.ims.cochrane.org/revman">RevMan</A>) to create 'Summary of findings' tables. These tables provide outcome-specific information concerning the overall quality of evidence from each included study in the comparison, the magnitude of effect of the interventions examined, and the sum of available data on all outcomes we rated as important to patient-care and decision making. We selected the following main outcomes for inclusion in the summary of findings table:</P>

<P>RBB worked independently to assess risk of bias by using criteria described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) to assess trial quality.

It has been shown that RR is more intuitive (<LINK REF="REF-Boissel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boissel 1999</LINK>) than odds ratios and that odds ratios tend to be interpreted as RR by clinicians (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2000</LINK>). For statistically significant results we had planned to calculate the number needed to treat to provide benefit /to induce harm statistic (NNTB/H), and its 95% confidence interval (CI) using Visual Rx (http://www.nntonline.net/) taking account of the event rate in the control group.

As a consequence, on entry to the second phase the participants can differ systematically from their initial state despite a wash-out phase. For the same reason, cross-over trials are not appropriate if the condition of interest is unstable (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>).

<P>We have provided details of only the scales that provided usable data. We have outlined reasons for exclusions of data under 'Outcomes' in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>
</P>
<P>3.6.1.1 Global state - Clinical Global Impression Scale - CGI Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Guy-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guy 1976</LINK>)<BR/>This is used to assess both severity of illness and clinical improvement, by comparing the conditions of the person standardised against other people with the same diagnosis. A seven-point scoring system is usually used, with low scores showing decreased severity and/or overall improvement. A CGI-I (CGI-Improvement) score was also validated for used in this review. <LINK REF="STD-Carson-2002-b" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2002 b</LINK> reported usable data for this outcome.</P>
<P>3.6.1.2 Mental state - Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale - PANSS (0)<BR/>This schizophrenia scale has 30 items, each of which can be defined on a seven-point scoring system varying from 1 - absent to 7 - extreme. This scale can be divided into three sub-scales for measuring the severity of general psychopathology, positive symptoms (PANSS-P) and negative symptoms (PANSS-N). A low score indicates lesser severity. <LINK REF="STD-Kane-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2003</LINK> reported data from this scale.</P>
<P>3.6.1.3 Quality of life - Quality of Life Scale - QLS, (<LINK REF="REF-Carpenter-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carpenter 1994</LINK>)<BR/>This is a semi-structured interview administered and rated by trained clinicians. It contains 21 items rated on a seven-point scale based on the interviewer's judgement of patient functioning. A total QLS and four sub-scale scores are calculated, with higher scores indicating less impairment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">3.6.2 Redundant data</HEADING>
<P>Enormous efforts are invested in studies rating and recording data that are then reported in such a way as to render them useless for reviews such as this. For example, in <LINK REF="REF-Carson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carson 2000</LINK> the trialists compare aripiprazole with both haloperidol and placebo. Outcomes such as death, clearly of interest, were reported in an obscure manner so we could not be sure of either the number of deaths or the groups in which they took place. We are only sure that they did take place. At a meeting held with workers from the Outcomes Research department of Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals (UK) on the 27th October 2004 in Leeds, we requested further clarification on numerous data that appeared on the FDA web site. In particular, we were concerned by the high death rates observed in the two studies we identified by FDA study number. It was jointly agreed that this information (as well as other important data) would be provided to us when located by company staff. We did not hear from the company again until we published a short version of this review at a conference (<LINK REF="REF-El_x002d_Sayeh-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">El-Sayeh 2006</LINK>). Thereafter, in May 2006, one author (H E-S) and editor (CEA) met with representatives of Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals. These representatives were most helpful in clarifying data on the FDA web site, specifically on death which, on further evaluation, do not suggest an increased risk of mortality as indicated in the conference review (<LINK REF="REF-El_x002d_Sayeh-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">El-Sayeh 2006</LINK>). They also encouraged the review authors to ask for more data. We have amended this version and hope to do so again in light of more data provided by industry, especially on those studies that await assessment.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Carson-2000-a" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2000 a</LINK> reported continuous measures of global state (CGI) but no variances are reported. The same applies to their repeated measures of mental state (BPRS, BPRS-PANNS), general functioning (CGI) and adverse effects (Simpson-Angus scale, Barnes Akathisia scale, Abnormal Involuntary Movement scale) and other outcome measures including changes in body weight, serum prolactin, and QTc interval changes. This poor reporting is by no means unique to <LINK REF="STD-Carson-2000-a" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2000 a</LINK> (see 'Outcomes', <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). Participants in trials may be appalled to know how much of their data has been rendered useless. It is possible that there is a systematic bias in which data, such as the simple binary outcome of death, are not reported well.</P>

<P>Several of the included studies reported data in terms of a last observation carried forwards (LOCF) analysis and an OC analysis (observed cases, defined as those completing the trial). Although LOCF analyses are commonly used to account for missing observations, this technique could introduce bias as considerable assumptions are made about people who did not stay in the study. We saw no reporting of attempts to validate assumptions by following up people who did leave the study early. In some included studies, rates of participants leaving early were more than 40%. Using LOCF, 40% of the data on certain outcomes are assumed and would lead to bias in the overall results.</P>

<P>From the original review Aripripazole for schizophrenia, we identified 9 studies where aripripazole was compared with placebo; we included all 9 studies. We carried out update searches in May 2007 and August 2008 to see if there are any new studies on Aripiprazole compared to placebo or any additional data on the existing included studies. The two update searches did not find further studies but provided additional study data, particularly on side effects.</P>
<P>We also identified two new studies (<LINK REF="STD-Carson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nyilas-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Nyilas 2007</LINK>) focusing on adolescent populations from conference posters. Since the findings from these studies have been presented as graphs, in percentiles or just reported as P values, we have not been able to include them in the analysis at this stage. We contacted authors for additional information but unable to get the data. This is particularly unfortunate given that this age group is an important subset of the general population, and research data and studies are often lacking.</P>

Only one aripiprazole versus placebo comparison contained relevant data. <LINK REF="STD-Carson-2002-b" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2002 b</LINK> provided usable data for short-term (up to 12 weeks) relapse.

The same study provided usable data for medium-term (13 to 26 weeks) relapse. Again the aripiprazole group had significantly less relapse compared with people given placebo (n = 310, 1 RCT, RR 0.66 CI 0.53 to 0.81, NNT 5 CI 3.0 to 8.5).</P>

All other studies (one-week to 12-week duration) gave several reasons for the poor compliance with study protocol, and several seemed to fall into a natural grouping reporting a poor global outcome. We have grouped these throughout the review. Overall people allocated to aripiprazole encountered this outcome significantly less than those given placebo (n = 2275, 8 RCTs, RR 0.74 CI 0.59 to 0.93, NNT 21 CI 12.7 to 60.5).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-06-28 13:51:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>When compared with placebo, aripiprazole treated patients had fewer relapses, fewer people left study early and needed less additional antipsychotic medications. Where reported, both the group needed benzodiazepine/antianxiety medication (lorazepam) as an adjunct treatment in most of the patients.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Applicability of findings</HEADING>
<P>All the included studies occurred as multicentre trials in North American and European settings. Clinicians should take this into consideration when thinking of using aripiprazole in very different settings of care.</P>
<P>The majority of trials involved inpatient participants with little in the way of physical and psychiatric co-morbidity and with well-defined schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Such people are a minority in everyday care, where people who are not in hospital and suffer from less well defined illness, combined with problems such as depression and substance abuse, are the norm. The reader is subsequently left with the difficult decision as to whether the findings of studies with such participants, interventions and outcomes, gathered in standardised highly developed inpatient settings, can still inform their daily practice.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Limited data, confusing data</HEADING>
<P>The collection and quality of the data reported were very variable. With the exception of one trial, no studies reported outcomes over 12 weeks. Aripiprazole is a relatively new antipsychotic medication, so it is not surprising that long-term studies are rare at this point, but it is to be hoped that they are planned. Even if an intervention works in the short term (by 12 weeks) there is no guarantee that this means that the compound has long-term benefits.</P>
<P>Data were often not used because of high drop-out rates. The enormous degree of loss to follow-up is common in similar studies of other compounds, but rare in everyday practice. This also casts doubt on the applicability of findings to routine care. The design of the studies is clearly encouraging loss to follow-up. People leave for many reasons, often not specified, and their last observation is carried forward to the end. These data, sometimes with an assumption on over 50% of people are, nevertheless, acceptable to the regulatory authorities. Until this ends, pharmaceutical companies will see little reason to change their practices, as compounds such as aripiprazole or any other new drug will gain licenses for clinical use even if 40% to 60% of their data is unavailable. Often the trialists do not have an obligation to follow people up for longer than the period during which they took the medication. One possible consequence of this might be that an extreme adverse reaction to discontinuation of an intervention, such as death, would go unreported if it occurred a week after the treatment stopped. Data beyond the discontinuation of the medications used within the trial are collected but not reported. This data should be reported since it is not the individual compounds in a trial which are randomised, but the intention to give those individual compounds.</P>
<P>Some trialists tended to report mean figures without giving standard deviations. This renders averages meaningless and of no use to review authors.</P>
<P>We found it disappointing that, despite considerable investment in clinical trials, no outcome data were available on death, service outcomes, general functioning, behaviour, engagement with services, economic outcomes and cognitive functioning. The primary outcome of this review was relapse and data were available on this in the aripiprazole-placebo comparison. Other outcomes were of secondary importance to the review authors, but we have reported what we can in order to present the most complete data set possible for the reader.</P>
<P>Several trials only reported adverse effects which occurred in at least 5% to 10% of participants, which could exclude potentially serious less frequent outcomes. Randomised trials are limited in their ability to highlight important rare outcomes, so further restricting what is reported seems odd. We note that the design of the trials did not limit reporting of positive outcomes to only those that occurred at least 5% to 10% of the time.</P>
<P>Some data were obtained from conference proceedings and posters. This made extraction difficult as results were often summarised. Several studies were reported multiple times. Without unique study identifiers, this gives the impressions that there are more data than actually exist and facilitates erroneous double counting.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">3.1.1 Relapse</HEADING>
<P>Relapse, the primary outcome for this review, was only reported by <LINK REF="STD-Carson-2002-b" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2002 b</LINK> and was defined in one of three ways: i. a CGI rating of minimally worse; ii. a PANSS rating of moderately severe on hostility or uncooperativeness on two successive days; or iii. &gt;/= 20% increase in total PANSS score from randomisation. This implies first, that these measures of severity of illness are indeed markers of a relapse and second, that the measures agree on the severity of illness needed to constitute a relapse. We are not sure that these scores on these measures really would constitute what clinicians or recipients of care would call relapse. We think that the ratings listed above would be moderate deterioration rather than an event that would be universally recognised as relapse. Nevertheless, it is genuinely heartening that aripiprazole helps avoid these degrees of deterioration and that the number needed to treat of five is not very large in either the short or medium term.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">3.1.2 Poor compliance with study protocol due to lack of efficacy, deterioration or psychosis</HEADING>
<P>This category constituted patients leaving the study due to poor efficacy, those with deterioration in their mental state and those who developed frank psychosis. There was a significant difference in favour of aripiprazole with regard to this outcome, although the number needed to treat is high (NNT 21 CI 12 to 60).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">3.1.3 Needing additional antipsychotic medication</HEADING>
<P>Few people needed 'rescue' antipsychotics in the aripiprazole group as compared to placebo. It has to be seen as encouraging that aripiprazole does seem to have some antipsychotic activity within the four studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">3.1.4 Needing additional benzodiazepines</HEADING>
<P>There appeared to be significantly less need for benzodiazepine medication in the aripiprazole treated patients (NNT 16). Two studies used intramuscular medication, however, and the outcomes were only reported over the short term (up to 24 hours) (<LINK REF="STD-Daniel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Daniel 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oren-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>This needs to be taken in context as in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Adson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Adson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marcus-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 2005</LINK>), the majority (85%) of the patients in both arms received lorazepam as an anti-anxiety drug.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">3.2 Adverse effects</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">3.2.1 Clinically important specific adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>Overall results from the included studies suggest that the akathisia, nausea and weight gain were more common in those treated with aripiprazole; there were no significant differences in reported adverse effects in people taking placebo compared to those taking aripiprazole. No objective rating scales appeared to be used in measuring these symptoms, even though for certain symptoms such as anxiety and extrapyramidal side effects, these are commonly used in research. <LINK REF="STD-Potkin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Potkin 2003</LINK> did repeatedly find more adverse effects than <LINK REF="STD-Carson-2002-b" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2002 b</LINK> and, although there is nothing in the methods of the papers to suggest this, it may be that the former study used more sensitive measures of adverse effects. <LINK REF="STD-Potkin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Potkin 2003</LINK> did seem to suggest that aripiprazole may be associated with extrapyramidal symptoms, vomiting and weight gain. Although no different from placebo, about 17% of people given aripiprazole were also medicated with antiparkinson medication. It was unclear from all studies, both those in this comparison and those including an active control group, how the level of significant weight gain (seven percent) was decided upon. There was no mention of this figure in the methodology section of the included study reports and if it was decided on after the data were inspected, any results would be prone to bias.</P>

<P>All data, mostly from <LINK REF="STD-Carson-2002-b" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2002 b</LINK>, suggest little effect on measures of glucose and lipids. Patients with schizophrenia do have higher risk of cardiovascular and metabolic disorders, and some newer antipsychotic medications increase this risk. Aripripazole, however, seems to have a neutral effect.</P>
<P>There did appear to be a significant difference in favour of aripiprazole in terms of the numbers of people with a rise in serum prolactin to at least 23 ng/ml (NNT 9 CI 6.2 to 15.7). This may have clinical implications in terms of the problems caused by high prolactin, such as galactorrhoea. <LINK REF="STD-Potkin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Potkin 2003</LINK> suggested that numerical decline in the prolactin levels in the aripiprazole group is consistent with partial agonism at the D2 receptors and mirror results from their pre-clinical trials. However data were missing for baseline mean serum prolactin levels in 8/103 people allocated to placebo and 21/202 people given aripiprazole. We have assumed that these people did not have raised prolactin, but if they did and we were incorrect in our assumption, there would be no clear finding in favour of aripiprazole.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3.3 Leaving the study early</HEADING>
<P>Significantly fewer people left the aripiprazole group compared with placebo (NNT 8 CI 5.6 to 10.3) for any reason. These data are heterogeneous and if the two studies with the most extreme results are removed (<LINK REF="STD-Csernansky-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Csernansky 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Potkin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Potkin 2003</LINK>), data become more homogeneous and much less favourable for aripiprazole. We do not see obvious reasons for heterogeneity. However, nearly half of all trial participants chose to leave early. This reflects negatively on study design and means that much of the remaining data are uninformative. Adverse effects did not seem to be a reason for study attrition, although again data were heterogeneous. There is no evidence from these studies that aripiprazole is a major cause of unacceptable short-term adverse effects. Results from the (<LINK REF="STD-Carson-2002-b" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2002 b</LINK>) study provided more accurate data, but this did not significantly affect the overall results.</P>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-06-26 23:31:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a lack of evidence on the efficacy of aripiprazole in schizophrenia (i.e. showing improvement of the schizophrenia symptoms rating scales). The studies rely on other factors, such as compliance and smaller numbers of relapses as a measure of efficacy.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Limited data, confusing data</HEADING>
<P>The collection and quality of the data reported were very variable.</P>
<P>With the exception of one trial, no studies reported outcomes over 12 weeks. Aripiprazole is a relatively new antipsychotic medication, so it is not surprising that long-term studies are rare at this point. However, it is to be hoped that they are planned. Even if an intervention works in the short term (by 12 weeks) there is no guarantee that this means that the compound has long-term benefits.</P>
<P>Data were often not usable because of high drop-out rates. The enormous degree of loss to follow-up is common in similar studies of other compounds, but rare in everyday practice. This also casts doubt on the applicability of findings to routine care. The design of the studies is clearly encouraging loss to follow-up. People leave for many reasons, often not specified, and their last observation is carried forward to the end. These data, sometimes with an assumption on over 50% of people are, nevertheless, acceptable to the regulatory authorities. Until this ends, pharmaceutical companies will see little reason to change their practices, as compounds such as aripiprazole or any other new drug will gain licenses for clinical use even if 40% to 60% of their data are unavailable. Often the trialists do not have an obligation to follow people up for longer than the period during which they took the medication. One possible consequence of this might be that an extreme adverse reaction to discontinuation of an intervention, such as death, would go unreported if it occurred a week after the treatment stopped. Data beyond the discontinuation of the medications used within the trial are collected but not reported. This data should be reported since it is not the individual compounds in a trial which are randomised, but the intention to give those individual compounds.</P>
<P>Some trialists tended to report mean figures without giving standard deviations. This renders averages meaningless and of no use to review authors.</P>
<P>We found it disappointing that, despite considerable investment in clinical trials, no outcome data were available on death, service outcomes, general functioning, behaviour, engagement with services, economic outcomes and cognitive functioning. The primary outcome of this review was relapse and data were available on this in the aripiprazole-placebo comparison. Other outcomes were of secondary importance to the review authors, but we have reported what we can in order to present the most complete data set possible for the reader.</P>
<P>Several trials only reported adverse effects which occurred in at least 5% to 10% of participants, which could exclude potentially serious less frequent outcomes. Randomised trials are limited in their ability to highlight important rare outcomes, so further restricting what is reported seems odd. We note that the design of the trials did not limit reporting of positive outcomes to only those that occurred at least 5% to 10% of the time.</P>
<P>We obtained some of the data from conference proceedings and posters. This made extraction difficult, as results were often summarised. Several studies were multiply reported. Without unique study identifiers this gives the impression that there are more data than actually exist and facilitates erroneous double counting.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Applicability of findings</HEADING>
<P>All the included studies occurred as multicentre trials in North American and European settings. Clinicians should take this into consideration when thinking of using aripiprazole in very different settings of care.</P>
<P>The majority of trials involved inpatient participants with little in the way of physical and psychiatric co-morbidity and with well-defined schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Such people are a minority in everyday care, where people who are not in hospital and suffer from less well-defined illness, combined with problems such as depression and substance abuse, are the norm. The reader is subsequently left with the difficult decision as to whether the findings of studies with such participants, interventions and outcomes and standardised highly developed inpatient settings can still inform their daily practice.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. For people with schizophrenia</HEADING>
<P>For this update, we found no new studies comparing aripiprazole with placebo to add to those included in the original review and update. However, we noted several new studies comparing aripiprazole with active control.</P>
<P>When compared with placebo, aripiprazole treated patients had fewer relapses and fewer left study early, and needed less additional antipsychotic medications. Overall it appears that aripiprazole has a better side effect profile; those that were significantly more prevalent than in the placebo group included akathisia, nausea and weight gain.</P>
<P>There have been concerns in the medical community about the effects of atypical antipsychotics on conductance problems in the heart (QTc interval), increased prolactin levels (excessive production of prolactin, which can cause unpleasant breast pain and secretion) and glucose levels; on the limited evidence available (due to subjects leaving study early and fewer studies), aripiprazole appears to have a similar effect to that of placebo. The overall finding on its efficacy in treating schizophrenia is unchanged from what we found in the original review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. For clinicians</HEADING>
<P>Aripripazole efficacy on global state was superior to placebo in one study. Aripripazole may offer significant advantages over other atypicals in terms of outcomes, as it caused hyperprolactinaemia and raised QTc interval; thus, aripiprazole's effect appears to be similar to that of placebo. More studies are needed to replicate and validate these findings. In two studies, lorazepam was given to 85% of the patients in both arms, suggesting a need for additional medication. Long-term studies are required to see how long this is necessary.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">3. For managers/policy makers</HEADING>
<P>Aripiprazole is another new atypical antipsychotic drug and it does seem to have an effect on some people with serious mental illnesses such as schizophrenia. It appears to be tolerated well. Despite the fact that thousands of people have been randomised in trials of aripiprazole, there are no data on service outcomes and few medium- or long-term data. In the context of finite resources, the lack of good quality data leaves managers and policy makers with difficult decisions to make.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-06-30 10:08:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. General</HEADING>
<P>As with all similar studies, public registration of a study before anyone is randomised would ensure that participants could be confident that people would know that the study had at least taken place. Unique study numbers would help researchers to identify single studies from multiple publications and reduce the risk of duplicating the reporting of data. Compliance with CONSORT (Moher 2001), both on the part of authors and editors, would help to clarify methodology and many outcomes. Failure to comply results in both loss of data and confusion in the results, neither of which help clinicians, patients or managers.</P>
<P>Intention-to-treat analysis should be performed on all outcomes and all trial data should be made easily accessible. A minimal requirement should be that all data should, at least, be presented as numbers. In addition, continuous data should be presented with means, standard deviations (or standard errors) and the number of participants. Data from graphs, P values of differences and statements of significant or non-significant differences are of limited value. Unfortunately, in spite of the large numbers of participants randomised, we were unable to use most of the data in the trials included in this review due to the high drop-out rates observed as well as poor data reporting.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Specific</HEADING>
<P>As an antipsychotic agent with a novel mechanism of action, aripiprazole is an interesting compound, but pragmatic, real world, randomised controlled trials should be carried out to determine its value in standard clinical practice. Studies of medium- and long-term risks, including mortality, behaviour, satisfaction with treatment and cost-effectiveness, in comparison to typical and atypical antipsychotics, are a priority. Pragmatic entry criteria and non-blinding with hard endpoints may be helpful in decreasing the study attrition (<LINK REF="REF-Rowland-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowland 1998</LINK>).</P>
