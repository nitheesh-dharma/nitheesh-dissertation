<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-10-08 09:46:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Sometimes young adults and adults who are born with heart problems grow up and have depression. Treatments to help them other than anti-depressant drugs include psychotherapy, cognitive behavioural therapies and talking therapies. Benefits of having treatment may include improved quality of life, and disadvantages of having treatment may include more severe depression and lower quality of life. Our objective was to update the previous review on the effects (both harms and benefits) of psychological interventions for treating depression in young adults and adults with congenital heart disease. Psychological interventions include cognitive behavioural therapy, psychotherapy, or 'talking/counselling' therapy for depression. We updated the previous searches up to February 2013 and found no evidence from randomised controlled trials about the effects of psychotherapy, cognitive behavioural therapies and talking therapies for treating depression in adults or young adults born with heart disease. A well-designed randomised controlled trial is needed to assess the effects of psychological interventions for depression in congenital heart disease.</P>

<P>Adult and adolescent congenital heart disease is increasing in prevalence as better medical care means more children are surviving to adulthood. People with chronic disease often also experience depression. There are several non-pharmacological treatments that might be effective in treating depression and improving quality of life for adults and young adults with congenital heart disease. The aim of this review was to assess the effects of treatments such as psychotherapy, cognitive behavioural therapies and talking therapies for treating depression in this population.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Description of the condition</HEADING>
<P>Congenital heart disease is defined as a structural anomaly of the heart or great vessels that is or could be of functional significance (<LINK REF="REF-Morris-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 2001</LINK>). The spectrum of congenital heart disease varies considerably in its complexity, from simple congenital heart disease such as a small atrial septal defect or isolated congenital aortic valve disease to conditions of great complexity such as Eisenmenger syndrome and transposition of the great arteries (<LINK REF="REF-ACC_x002f_AHA-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACC/AHA 2008</LINK>). The generally accepted best estimate of the birth prevalence of congenital heart disease is 8 per 1000 live births (<LINK REF="REF-Bernier-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernier 2010</LINK>); however, this does not take into account geographical differences. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Van-der-Linde-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van der Linde 2011</LINK>) of the birth prevalence of congenital heart disease worldwide revealed the highest rate in Asia at 9.3 per 1000 live births (95% confidence interval (CI) 8.9 to 9.7) and lowest in Africa (1.9 per 1000 live births; 95% CI 1.1 to 3.5). The birth prevalence of congenital heart disease is also much higher in Europe compared to North America (8.2 (95% CI 8.1 to 8.3) and 6.9 (95% CI 6.7 to 7.1) per 1000 live births, respectively) (<LINK REF="REF-Van-der-Linde-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van der Linde 2011</LINK>). The prevalence of specific heart defects also varies, with ventricular septal defects being the most common overall (<LINK REF="REF-Van-der-Linde-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van der Linde 2011</LINK>), although the prevalence of the type of heart defect also varies by continent.</P>
<P>With better medical care, more children today born with heart defects are surviving to adulthood. A recent systematic review estimates that there are approximately 3000 per million adults (aged 18 years and older) living with congenital heart disease (<LINK REF="REF-Van-der-Bom-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van der Bom 2012</LINK>). The adult congenital heart disease population include those who:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>have never undergone cardiac surgery;</LI>
<LI>have undergone cardiac surgery and require no further operation;</LI>
<LI>have had palliative surgery with or without anticipation of reparative surgery; and</LI>
<LI>are inoperable apart from organ transplantation (<LINK REF="REF-Perloff-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perloff 1991</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>Many of these adults require lifelong follow-up and treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Warnes-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warnes 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murphy-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murphy 2005</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">How the intervention might work</HEADING>
<P>The latest clinical guidelines on congenital heart disease (<LINK REF="REF-ACC_x002f_AHA-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACC/AHA 2008</LINK>) identified that the healthcare system does not provide guided transition from paediatric to adult care, with one important barrier to healthcare among people with congenital heart disease being the provision of adequate management of patients with cognitive or psychosocial impairment. The American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) recommend that individual and family psychosocial screening should be undertaken in all people with congenital heart disease, including screening for cognitive, mood, and psychiatric disorders (<LINK REF="REF-ACC_x002f_AHA-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACC/AHA 2008</LINK>), although this is based on expert opinion as there is very limited evidence to support the treatment effect. Chronic medical illness is often associated with emotional problems; however, there is relatively little research on the psychological sequelae of congenital heart disease and its impact remains ill-defined (<LINK REF="REF-Kokkonen-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kokkonen 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-State-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">State 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ACC_x002f_AHA-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACC/AHA 2008</LINK>). It is also apparent from clinical practice that the cardiac lesion is not always the major problem for these patients (<LINK REF="REF-DeMaso-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeMaso 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-State-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">State 1998</LINK>). Significant improvements in survival and reductions in morbidity have meant that issues pertaining to quality of life (QoL), such as employment, exercise participation, and pregnancy, now predominate and may lead to emotional distress (<LINK REF="REF-Lane-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lane 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simko-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simko 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moons-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moons 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moons-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moons 2009</LINK>). One pilot study (<LINK REF="REF-Bromberg-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bromberg 2003</LINK>) reports that approximately one-third of adults with congenital heart disease have a psychiatric disorder, compared to only about one in five of adults in the general population, with depression and anxiety being the most common problems. The psychosocial outcome (i.e. presence of psychosocial abnormality without any treatment) of people with congenital heart disease is at odds with some studies reporting negative outcomes, e.g. psychological or psychiatric disturbance (<LINK REF="REF-Garson-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garson 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lane-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lane 2002</LINK>), whereas another showed positive outcomes, e.g. absence of psychological or psychiatric disturbance (<LINK REF="REF-Cox--2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cox 2002</LINK>). Despite conflicting evidence, adults (not all are in treatment, 40% having cured or simple heart disease requiring no intervention) (<LINK REF="REF-BCS-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">BCS 2002</LINK>) who have significant psychological and psychiatric disturbances may benefit from treatment. In a study of 76 adults with congenital heart disease, 34% were depressed, and the older ones were more likely to be affected (<LINK REF="REF-Popelova-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Popelova 2001</LINK>). </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Why it is important to do the review</HEADING>
<P>A previous meta-analysis indicates that psychological interventions directed at disease-related, emotional or behavioural problems are effective for children and adolescents with chronic medical illness (<LINK REF="REF-Kibby-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kibby 1998</LINK>), while a later meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Karsdorp-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karsdorp 2007</LINK>) suggests that older children and adolescents with congenital heart disease may benefit from psychological interventions aimed at reducing anxiety and depression. There is also some evidence that provision of social support is effective in alleviating stress from physical illness, although depression per se has not been studied (<LINK REF="REF-Varni-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Varni 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ranmal-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ranmal 2008</LINK>). Hence it is important to consider the corresponding young adult population with congenital heart disease who may have significant depression and identify effective interventions.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2013-10-08 09:57:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our intention was to assess risk of bias independently by two review authors, with disagreements to be resolved by consensus or by recourse to a third review author. If necessary we would contact the study authors for further information.</P>
<P>We would assess the methodological quality of a particular trial in accordance with guidelines in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We would use data extraction forms to record and assess the following areas of risk of bias: selection, performance, detection, attrition, and reporting biases, using The Cochrane Collaboration's 'Risk of bias' tool and categorising domains as being at 'low', 'high', or 'unclear' risk of bias based on the Cochrane risk of bias criteria (see <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK> Table 8.5.d).</P>
<P>(1) Selection bias</P>
<P>The randomisation procedure including sequence generation and allocation concealment would be assessed. <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK> recommends that the allocation of participants to intervention and control groups must be done in a random manner. The risk of bias in the sequence generation is considered low if the allocation procedure was generated using a computerised randomisation procedure, random number table or similar; unclear if insufficient information was provided about the sequence generation procedure to allow judgement; and high if resulting from date/day of admission, hospital number, or similar. To minimise selection bias, the allocation of participants to different treatments must be undertaken in a manner that prevents foreknowledge by either the investigator or the participant about which group will receive the next participant.<BR/>Allocation concealment bias is considered low if randomisation was undertaken centrally (computerised, web-based, telephone-based, sealed envelopes or equivalent method). Risk of allocation concealment is considered high if there is a possibility that investigators or participants could have known or influenced treatment allocation, and unclear if there is insufficient description of the selection process to determine risk of bias as either low or high.</P>
<P>(2) Blinding (performance and detection bias)<BR/>
<BR/>It is difficult to prevent performance bias in trials of psychological interventions because participants and those running the interventions will be aware of the treatment allocation. However, those assessing the outcomes may be unaware of the group to which participants were assigned. This is particularly important in research with subjective outcome measures such as depression (<LINK REF="REF-Karlowski-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karlowski 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Colditz-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colditz 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>We would record blinding of participants and investigators and blinding of the outcome assessors, to determine performance bias and detection bias respectively, and designate them as being at 'low', high' or 'unclear' risk, based on the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' criteria.</P>
<P>(3) Incomplete data assessment (attrition bias)</P>
<P>We would note the number of withdrawals or dropouts from each study by intervention group and the reasons for withdrawal/dropout or incomplete data assessment, and would classify them as being at 'low', high' or 'unclear' risk of attrition bias, based on the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' criteria. 
</P>
<P>(4) Selective outcome reporting</P>
<P>The primary and secondary outcomes reported in the Methods section or in the protocol paper (if available) should be reported. Selective outcome reporting would be categorised as being at 'low', high' or 'unclear' risk, based on the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' criteria.</P>
<P>(5) Other forms of bias such as imbalance of baseline characteristics of groups.</P>
<P>We would also assess each study for other potential risks of bias not encompassed by the previously listed sources of bias, with each determined to be at 'low', high' or 'unclear' risk, based on the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' criteria.</P>

<P>There were not enough studies in this review to test for reporting bias. However, future versions will enter data from all identified and selected trials into a funnel plot (size of study versus effect size based on the primary outcome of change in depression pre-/post-intervention) to attempt to detect the possibility of publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>). Asymmetry of the funnel plot may indicate publication bias. We will also assess other possible causes of asymmetry of the funnel plot, such as clinical and/or methodological heterogeneity.</P>
</BIAS_ASSESSMENT>
<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2013-10-06 11:25:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Outcomes would be assessed using continuous (e.g., changes on the depression scales), categorical (e.g., one of three categories on a quality-of-life scale, such as 'better', 'worse' or 'no change'), or dichotomous (e.g., either depressed or not-depressed) measures. Where possible and appropriate, we will use meta-analysis to combine results statistically.</P>
<P>Many rating scales are available to measure outcomes in psychological trials. These scales vary in the quality of their validation and reliability. Therefore, if a rating scale's validation has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal, it will not be included. In addition, the rating scale should have been either self-reported or been completed by an independent observer. Where possible, we will use trials that use the same instrument to measure specific outcomes in direct comparisons. Where continuous data are presented from different scales, rating the same effect, we will present both sets of data and will inspect the general direction of the effect. We will report the mean and standard deviation or median and interquartile range. Where these data are not reported in the paper, we will contact the lead author in an attempt to obtain this missing information. If possible, we will calculate these data using other measures of variation that have been reported, such as the confidence intervals.</P>
<P>We will convert continuous outcome measures to dichotomous data where possible. We will use the authors' designated cut-off point for determining clinical effectiveness where appropriate. Otherwise, we will identify validated cut-offs on rating scales from the literature, and will divide participants on the basis of whether they had 'clinically improved' or 'not clinically improved'. For dichotomous outcomes, we will estimate a Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio with its associated 95% confidence interval (CI). As a summary measure of effectiveness where possible, we will calculate the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB).</P>
<P>We would inspect graphical representations of the data; if the confidence intervals for the results of the studies do not overlap, this suggests that the differences are likely to be statistically significant (<LINK REF="REF-Walker-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 1988</LINK>). In addition, we will check for differences between the results of each included trial, using a test for heterogeneity. As these tests usually have low statistical power, a type I error level of 0.10 rather than the customary 0.05 will be used for rejecting the null hypothesis of homogeneity. If there is statistically significant heterogeneity the data will be presented separately rather than pooled. We would analyse results using both the fixed-effect and random-effects models. However, where there is significant heterogeneity, we will prefer a random-effects model, and will attempt to explore the reasons for this heterogeneity in post-hoc analyses.</P>
<P>We will investigate factors which may lead to differences between the results of individual studies, using sensitivity analyses. The review will investigate:<BR/>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Overall completeness of applicability of evidence</HEADING>
<P>Congenital heart disease in adults is a new and rapidly expanding sub-specialty of cardiology. Advances in medical treatment mean more people born with congenital heart defects are living longer and therefore there are more adolescents and adults with congenital heart defects (<LINK REF="REF-Perloff-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perloff 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Warnes-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warnes 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ACC_x002f_AHA-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACC/AHA 2008</LINK>). In addition, people with more complicated congenital defects are also able to live longer lives (<LINK REF="REF-Warnes-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warnes 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lindberg-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindberg 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ACC_x002f_AHA-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACC/AHA 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-der-Bom-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van der Bom 2012</LINK>), resulting in a need for lifelong follow-up and hospitalisation for some. There will be a group in which cure is not possible, but effective palliative measure are available to improve both quality and length of life (<LINK REF="REF-Hagler-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hagler 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ACC_x002f_AHA-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACC/AHA 2008</LINK>). Indeed, it is estimated that 3000 per million adults live with congenital heart disease (<LINK REF="REF-Van-der-Bom-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van der Bom 2012</LINK>). Reduction in morbidity and improvements in survival mean that issues pertaining to quality of life (QoL), such as employment, exercise participation, and pregnancy, now predominate and may lead to emotional distress (<LINK REF="REF-Lane-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lane 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simko-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simko 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moons-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moons 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moons-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moons 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>In any chronic condition it is vital to consider factors other than pathology. Psychological distress is common; for example, in multiple sclerosis, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and coronary heart disease the prevalence of depression has been quoted as 41.8%, 25%, and between 20 and 27% respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Burg-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burg 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chwastiak-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chwastiak 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Manen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Manen 2002</LINK>). With increasing numbers of people with congenital heart disease surviving to adulthood, the prevalence of depression may well increase. Data on the prevalence of depression among people with congenital heart disease are scant, and the results are conflicting (<LINK REF="REF-Kovacs-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kovacs 2005</LINK>). Studies in North America report poorer emotional functioning among adults with congenital heart disease compared to an age-matched general population (<LINK REF="REF-Brandhagen-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brandhagen 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Horner-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horner 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bromberg-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bromberg 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kovacs-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kovacs 2009</LINK>), whereas European studies have tended not to demonstrate such differences (<LINK REF="REF-Utens-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Utens 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Popelova-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Popelova 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cox--2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cox 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Rijen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Rijen 2003</LINK>). In a larger, more recent study, Iranians with congenital heart disease reported similar levels of depression to health-, age- and sex-matched controls, but higher levels of anxiety and more somatic symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Elsami-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elsami 2013</LINK>). Clearly, chronic medical illness is often associated with emotional problems; however, there is relatively little research on the psychological sequelae of congenital heart disease, and its impact remains ill-defined (<LINK REF="REF-Kokkonen-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kokkonen 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-State-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">State 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ACC_x002f_AHA-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACC/AHA 2008</LINK>). It is also apparent from the literature that the complexity of the congenital heart disease is not always the major problem for these people (<LINK REF="REF-DeMaso-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeMaso 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-State-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">State 1998</LINK>), and that family perceptions and adjustment to the ill child may be more pertinent (<LINK REF="REF-ACC_x002f_AHA-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACC/AHA 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-State-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">State 1998</LINK>). The American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) therefore recommend that individual and family psychosocial screening should be undertaken in all people with congenital heart disease, including screening for cognitive, mood, and psychiatric disorders (<LINK REF="REF-ACC_x002f_AHA-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACC/AHA 2008</LINK>) to elucidate the true extent of the psychological impact and to identify those who may require intervention.</P>
<P>How should we treat patients with congenital heart disease who have depression? Apart from treating the physical illness which may have a direct effect on depression, for example pharmacological or surgical treatment for Cushing's disease, and specific disease-related counselling, the treatment regimens for depression and secondary depression are not dissimilar. Indeed there is evidence for the use of tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin receptor inhibitors in the treatment of secondary depression (<LINK REF="REF-Small-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Small 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gill-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gill 1999</LINK>). Nevertheless, specialist services dedicated to individual conditions may be better since they would be able to provide comprehensive and multidisciplinary care. It is therefore disappointing that there is very little in the current literature on effective psychological interventions for people with congenital heart disease (<LINK REF="REF-Karsdorp-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karsdorp 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ACC_x002f_AHA-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACC/AHA 2008</LINK>). Results of a cross-sectional study have indicated that even people who were surgically 'cured' had significantly poorer levels of physical functioning and health (<LINK REF="REF-Lane-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lane 2002</LINK>), and quality of life is often significantly impaired among people with congenital heart disease (<LINK REF="REF-Lane-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lane 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simko-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simko 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moons-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moons 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moons-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moons 2009</LINK>). Evidence from randomised controlled trials is regarded as more reliable than that from cross-sectional studies, but as we found no such trials we have little choice but to base our observations on cross-sectional studies. Cross-sectional studies point to a possible association between congenital heart disease and depression. One might therefore speculate that treating depression and other psychopathology in people with congenital heart disease may require specialised multidisciplinary management, and may help to alleviate depressive symptomatology and to improve quality of life. However, further research is needed to clarify the issues raised.</P>
