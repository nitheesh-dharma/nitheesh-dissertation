I have added details on I&lt;sup&gt;2 &lt;/sup&gt;levels, 95% CI for NNTs, and reordered and shortened the discussion section. I will aim to speak with Francine on the phone next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC Feb 15th, All final changes accepted and I have made a few final changes of wording (around effect modifiers). Ready for copy editing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC Nov 22nd. I have added a sentence to the abstract clarifying that there is no significant difference between subgroups and moved the paragraph about why we did not carry out additional subgroups to the discussion section. Both in green. I have also improved the legend for the Cates' plot. I have also added Rubin as additional reference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC September 21st Statistical Edit. There is no significant difference between the severity or protocol subgroups. Whether each subgroup has a significant P value depends on power and should not be used to compare efficacy between subgroups. The more important message is that the absolute benefit is much higher for those likely to be admitted. Edited accordingly and corrected NNT values reflected in the text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma Notes 09/12/2011&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Ben, the review looks good Well done! I made quite a few changes using tracked changes, but quite a lot of it was cutting and pasting into other parts of the review or under recommended headings so don't panic. The discussion was quite long and rambly and in places came back to the same idea, so I tried to shorten it a bit. What I would suggest is we go through the review and decide if we're happy to keep the tracked changes and then you can go through the individual things that need attention. There are several additional points (mainly highlighted or in brackets) i made within the review text that need specific things stating or adding. I would esitmate this to be a long mornings worth of work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;background&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beta&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;- agonists are clearly the most effective bronchodilators due to their rapid onset of action and the magnitude of achieved bronchodilation (&lt;a link_type=&quot;REFERENCE&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;Sears 1992&quot;&gt;Sears 1992&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a link_type=&quot;REFERENCE&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;Svedmyr 1985&quot;&gt;Svedmyr 1985&lt;/a&gt;) this is quite strong and based on old evidence - reference latest review?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;look at one of FDs review for the intro?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I removed the term unprovoked - OK?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Outcomes&lt;/b&gt; - what is disposition?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Search&lt;/b&gt;: I make it 19 included studies??&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the section is confused because you are referring to different arms rather than different trials. I have tried to clarify this&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why have you reference Monge 2000 in the section about ranking? It is not an included trial - delete?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysis 1.2: Where are the multiple dose flexible protocols? If they did not report this outcome, say so here to help the reader&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysis 1.4: why did you only subgroup the multiple fixed doses here? Either explain, or include the other studies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysis 1.9 - need to decide whether to split it by background corticosteroids or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Forest plots:&lt;/b&gt; I made some changes to the graphs i.e. deleted the minus signs and re-labelled the axes - can you check that you are happy with them : 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.13, 1.14, 1.15, - wasn't sure if I needed to do same for respiratory resistance - let me know! I wasn't sure where the data for change in clinical score came from so wasn't sure if the axes needed to be changed round? I relabeled all the axes, so it would be worth checking them all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Discussions&lt;/b&gt;: comments on clinical/economic significance of values e.g. what is the MID for lung function?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Characteristics&lt;/b&gt; of included studies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;ROB tables - need comments for all domains&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;would be better to have one complete table for each if the studies with more than one arm and then to put the additional data in where necessary e.g. how many people randomised with each severity. Fill the rest of the boxes with 'see above'&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Differences between protocol and review&lt;/b&gt;.

<P>Three new trials were included in this update; two pertaining to the multiple dose - fixed protocol (Qhreshi, 1998; Zorc, 1999) and one pertaining to the multiple dose - flexible protocol (Calvo, 1998); one previously unpublished trial (Ducharme, 1995) was published and is hereafter referred to as Ducharme, 1998.<BR/>
<BR/>The addition of these new trials confirmed previous findings about the efficacy of intensive anticholinergics and beta2-agonist inhalations in acute severe pediatric asthma. It raised the possibility that intensive therapy may have some benefits for children with moderate exacerbations by reducing the number of inhalations required after the fixed protocol.<BR/>
<BR/>Despite a new trial testing the multiple-dose flexible protocol, the evidence is still insufficient to conclude about the benefits of the systematic addition of anticholinergics to every beta2-agonist inhalation, irrespective of disease severity.<BR/>
<BR/>No new trial was added to the single dose protocol, which remains unchanged.</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-08-19 13:49:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Francine M. Ducharme">
<P>
<B>Background</B>
<BR/>In an asthma attack, the airways (small tubes in the lungs) narrow because of inflammation (swelling), muscle spasms and mucus secretions. Other symptoms include wheezing, coughing and chest tightness. This makes breathing difficult. Reliever inhalers typically contain short-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists (SABAs) that relax the muscles in the airways, opening the airways so that breathing is easier. Anticholinergic drugs work by opening the airways and decreasing mucus secretions.<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>Review question</B>
<BR/>We looked at randomised controlled trials to find out whether giving inhaled anticholinergics plus SABAs (instead of SABAs on their own) in the emergency department provides benefits or harms in children having an asthma attack.<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>Key results</B>
<BR/>We found that children with a moderate or severe asthma attack who were given both drugs in the emergency department were less likely to be admitted to the hospital than those who only had SABAs. In the group receiving only SABAs, on average 23 out of 100 children with acute asthma were admitted to hospital compared with an average of 17 (95% CI 15 to 20) out of 100 children treated with SABAs plus anticholinergics. Taking both drugs was also better at improving lung function. Taking both drugs did not seem to reduce the possibility of another asthma attack. Fewer children treated with anticholinergics reported nausea and tremor, but no significant group difference was observed for vomiting.<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>Quality of the evidence and further research</B>
<BR/>Most of the studies were in preschool- and school-aged children; three studies also included a small proportion of infants under 18 months of age, although there was no evidence that inclusion of these infants with wheezy episodes affected the results. Nine trials (45%) were at a low risk of bias and we regarded the evidence for hospitalisation as high quality. Physicians can administer the dose of anticholinergic and SABA in several different ways; as a single dose, or as a certain number of doses or more flexibly. Most of the trials gave the children two or three doses and we think that more research is needed to improve characterization of children that benefit from, and the most effective number and frequency of doses of, anticholinergic treatment.<BR/>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2013-08-19 13:49:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Francine M. Ducharme">
<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-08-14 19:55:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are several treatment options for managing acute asthma exacerbations (sustained worsening of symptoms that do not subside with regular treatment and require a change in management). Guidelines advocate the use of inhaled short acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists (SABAs) in children experiencing an asthma exacerbation. Anticholinergic agents, such as ipratropium bromide and atropine sulfate, have a slower onset of action and weaker bronchodilating effect, but may specifically relieve cholinergic bronchomotor tone and decrease mucosal edema and secretions. Therefore, the combination of inhaled anticholinergics with SABAs may yield enhanced and prolonged bronchodilation.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2013-08-14 19:56:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To determine whether the addition of inhaled anticholinergics to SABAs provides clinical improvement and affects the incidence of adverse effects in children with acute asthma exacerbations.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-08-12 11:29:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched MEDLINE (1966 to April 2000), EMBASE (1980 to April 2000), CINAHL (1982 to April 2000) and reference lists of studies of previous versions of this review. We also contacted drug manufacturers and trialists. For the 2012 review update, we undertook an 'all years' search of the Cochrane Airways Group's register on the 18 April 2012.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-08-14 19:56:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Francine M. Ducharme">
<P>Randomized parallel trials comparing the combination of inhaled anticholinergics and SABAs with SABAs alone in children (aged 18 months to 18 years) with an acute asthma exacerbation.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-08-12 11:20:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We used the GRADE rating system to assess the quality of evidence for our primary outcome (hospital admission).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-08-19 13:49:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Francine M. Ducharme">
<P>Twenty trials met the review eligibility criteria, generated 24 study comparisons and comprised 2697 randomised children aged one to 18 years, presenting predominantly with moderate or severe exacerbations. Most studies involved both preschool-aged children and school-aged children; three studies also included a small proportion of infants less than 18 months of age. Nine trials (45%) were at a low risk of bias. Most trials used a fixed-dose protocol of three doses of 250 mcg or two doses of 500 mcg of nebulized ipratropium bromide in combination with a SABA over 30 to 90 minutes while three trials used a single dose and two used a flexible-dose protocol according to the need for SABA.</P>
<P>The addition of an anticholinergic to a SABA significantly reduced the risk of hospital admission (risk ratio (RR) 0.73; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63 to 0.85; 15 studies, 2497 children, high-quality evidence). In the group receiving only SABAs, 23 out of 100 children with acute asthma were admitted to hospital compared with 17 (95% CI 15 to 20) out of 100 children treated with SABAs plus anticholinergics. This represents an overall number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 16 (95% CI 12 to 29).</P>
<P>Trends towards a greater effect with increased treatment intensity and with increased asthma severity were observed, but did not reach statistical significance. There was no effect modification due to concomitant use of oral corticosteroids and the effect of age could not be explored. However, exclusion of the one trial that included infants (&lt; 18 months) and contributed data to the main outcome, did not affect the results. Statistically significant group differences favoring anticholinergic use were observed for lung function, clinical score at 120 minutes, oxygen saturation at 60 minutes, and the need for repeat use of bronchodilators prior to discharge from the emergency department. No significant group difference was seen in relapse rates.</P>
<P>Fewer children treated with anticholinergics plus SABA reported nausea and tremor compared with SABA alone; no significant group difference was observed for vomiting.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-08-19 13:49:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Francine M. Ducharme">
<P>Children with an asthma exacerbation experience a lower risk of admission to hospital if they are treated with the combination of inhaled SABAs plus anticholinergic versus SABA alone. They also experience a greater improvement in lung function and less risk of nausea and tremor. Within this group, the findings suggested, but did not prove, the possibility of an effect modification, where intensity of anticholinergic treatment and asthma severity, could be associated with greater benefit.</P>
<P>Further research is required to identify the characteristics of children that may benefit from anticholinergic use (e.g. age and asthma severity including mild exacerbation and impending respiratory failure) and the treatment modalities (dose, intensity, and duration) associated with most benefit from anticholinergic use better.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-08-14 19:51:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Francine M. Ducharme">
<P>Asthma is caused by inflammation in the airways and bronchoconstriction, which makes it difficult to breathe and leads to wheezing and breathlessness. The underlying inflammation causes the lining of the airways to secrete mucus, which also obstructs the free flow of air through the lungs. The bronchoconstriction is alleviated by using bronchodilators such as short acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists (SABAs), while the underlying inflammation can be treated with regular inhaled corticosteroids. However, symptoms may flare up in response to an asthma trigger (e.g. virus, dust, pollen) leading to an asthma exacerbation. It is not known why the inflammation, secretions and bronchoconstriction occur. Asthma exacerbations can be life threatening and may require more medications than are used on a day-to-day basis.</P>

<P>The initial management of acute paediatric asthma exacerbations in children focuses on the rapid relief of bronchospasm using inhaled or nebulized bronchodilators (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-GINA-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 2011</LINK>). Children who do have moderate or severe asthma and those who do not respond sufficiently to bronchodilators to relieve symptoms require the addition of oral or intravenous glucocorticoids (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-GINA-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lougheed-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lougheed 2012</LINK>). SABAs are clearly the most effective bronchodilators due to their rapid onset of action and the magnitude of achieved bronchodilation (<LINK REF="REF-Sears-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sears 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Svedmyr-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Svedmyr 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Teoh-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Teoh 2012</LINK>). Anticholinergic agents, such as ipratropium bromide and atropine sulfate, have a slower onset of action and weaker bronchodilating effect, but may specifically relieve cholinergic bronchomotor tone and decrease mucosal edema and secretions (<LINK REF="REF-Chapman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chapman 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gross-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gross 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Silverman-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silverman 1990</LINK>). Thus, the combination of inhaled anticholinergics with SABAs may yield enhanced and prolonged bronchodilation.</P>
<P>National and international guidelines recommend the addition of anticholinergics to inhaled SABAs in people with an acute severe asthma exacerbation and suggest consideration of this therapy in people with moderate exacerbations (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-GINA-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 2011</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-08-12 11:22:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Francine M. Ducharme">
<P>The first version of this Cochrane review published in 1997 found a significant reduction in hospital admissions in school-aged children with severe exacerbations receiving intensive anticholinergic treatment. The review was updated in 2000 with the addition of three new trials further strengthening the initial conclusions (<LINK REF="REF-Plotnick-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Plotnick 2000</LINK>). With the identification of seven new studies, the 2012 update aims to examine the conclusions of the earlier version of this review and explore if characteristics of participants or treatment are associated with increased benefit.</P>

<P>We postulated a priori<I> </I>that three factors may potentially influence the magnitude or direction, or both, of the therapeutic response, namely:</P>
<OL>
<LI>the intensity of anticholinergic treatment;</LI>
<LI>co-intervention with glucocorticoids; and</LI>
<LI>the severity of exacerbation (based on documented/reported severity by authors and by tertile of admission rate).</LI>
</OL>
<P>Therefore, RCTs were grouped according to the intensity of anticholinergic protocol (single-dose regimen, multiple fixed-dose regimen, multiple flexible-dose regimen) and stratified on the presence/absence of systemic glucocorticoids. Whenever reported, the baseline % predicted FEV<SUB>1</SUB> and hospital admission rate in the control groups were recorded as indicators of severity and examined for their potential interaction with therapeutic effect.</P>
<P>In order to evaluate the effect of baseline severity on the magnitude of response to the intervention, we stratified trials according to severity documented or reported by authors as per the original review. In addition, we ranked each study in increasing order of the control group admission rate as a proxy for severity. We then split these arbitrarily into tertiles, which we referred to as low, medium or high risk. If the admission rate for a particular study was not available, we did not rank that study.</P>
<P>For the 2012 update, we considered adding a subgroup analysis by age of child; however, the overlap in age ranges included in each study precluded this analysis. We considered also doing a subgroup analysis based on cumulative dose of ipratropium delivered. However, this analysis was potentially confounded by the severity of the asthma exacerbation of the children included in the trials as well as differences between the drug delivery methods (nebulizers versus metered-dose inhalers (MDI) and spacers) and was thus omitted.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Trial protocol/dose regimen</HEADING>
<P>Overall, there were 20 included trials and three trials generated additional comparisons. Two studies provided stratified data subgrouped by severity (<LINK REF="STD-Qureshi-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Qureshi 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zorc-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Zorc 1999</LINK>), and one study evaluated two different dosing strategies against control (<LINK REF="STD-Schuh-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Schuh 1995</LINK>). Overall, there were 24 comparisons. We subgrouped trials according to the intensity of the anticholinergic protocol (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Six trials on 570 children tested a single dose of ipratropium bromide added to multiple (two to six) doses of SABAs given every 20 to 30 minutes. We termed these the 'single-dose protocol'.</P>
<P>In 16 intervention arms with 2191 children, doses of ipratropium bromide were administered at multiple fixed time points after the trial began. We termed these trials 'multiple fixed-dose protocol'. The doses of ipratropium bromide varied from 120 mcg to 500 mcg and the number of doses ranged between two and six over 30 to 90 minutes.</P>
<P>Two studies including 84 children added a dose of anticholinergic to every SABA, leaving the number of inhalations determined by the child's need. These were termed 'multiple flexible-dose protocol'. <LINK REF="STD-Calvo-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Calvo 1998</LINK> used a fixed dose of ipratropium bromide (20 mcg) given up to seven times in two hours. Treatment was stopped after the child's clinical score dropped below a predetermined threshold. <LINK REF="STD-Guill-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Guill 1987</LINK> used a fixed dose of atropine sulfate (0.05 to 0.1 mg/kg) up to three times at 20-minute intervals. Treatment was continued until symptoms were controlled or the subject was admitted to hospital.</P>
<P>With one exception that used atropine (<LINK REF="STD-Guill-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Guill 1987</LINK>), ipratropium bromide was used as the anticholinergic agent.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>Three studies with children younger than 18 months were included (<LINK REF="STD-Benito-Fernandez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Benito Fernandez 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guill-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Guill 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Phanichyakam-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Phanichyakam 1990</LINK>). Only <LINK REF="STD-Benito-Fernandez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Benito Fernandez 2000</LINK> reported data for the primary outcome and we tested whether inclusion of this study would unduly affect the analysis (although unlikely, as the mean age of children in the study was 5.7 years).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The most frequently reported outcomes were hospital admission rate and spirometric measurements. Nineteen intervention arms (from 16 studies) reported our primary outcome of hospital admission rate. Of note, 84% of the weight in this outcome was contributed by trials focusing on children with documented or reported moderate or severe airway obstruction and 87% of the weight was contributed by trials in the higher and middle tertile of admission rate. Not all trials considered each outcome. The reporting of adverse and side effects was variable. Adverse effects such as hypertension or tachycardia were reported so infrequently that they could not be considered in this review. Whenever reported, we extracted side effects such as nausea, vomiting and tremor, which may interfere with children's compliance. All reported outcomes are listed in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Defining severity using admission rate</HEADING>
<P>No single baseline spirometric characteristic was consistently reported across all studies. Hence insufficient lung function data were provided to enable us to determine the asthma severity of children at the start of trials. We ascertained asthma severity in two ways.</P>
<P>First, as per the original protocol, we stratified severity using lung function or clinical score at baseline and used both the eligibility/exclusion criteria and the severity reported by authors to confirm our assessment (see <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>).</P>

<P>Next, we used the control group event rate as a proxy for severity. Studies were ranked by the order of the admission rate of the control group, and divided into three groups and labelled as high, medium and low admission rates (see <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>).</P>
<P>Ranking of severity based on admission rate in the control group corresponded somewhat but not perfectly to ranking based on mean baseline % predicted FEV<SUB>1</SUB> in the studies that reported it or authors' reports. Ranking on admission rate permitted the inclusion of studies that did not use spirometry or did not report mean baseline % predicted FEV<SUB>1</SUB>.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Primary outcome: admission to hospital</HEADING>
<P>When anticholinergics were delivered in addition to SABAs, there was a significant decrease in the risk of hospital admission versus SABAs and placebo (RR 0.73; 95% CI 0.63 to 0.85; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). The primary analysis was inclusive of all study protocols (single dose, multiple-fixed and multiple-flexible); however, only studies using single and multiple-fixed dose protocols reported data for this outcome. Fifteen studies (nineteen comparisons) reported data for this outcome, but the absence of admission in three studies mean that the pooled RR was based on data from 16 comparisons (2326 children). The result was statistically significant (P value &lt; 0.0001) and there was no evidence of statistical heterogeneity between the study results (I<SUP>2 </SUP>=<SUP> </SUP>0%). In the children receiving SABAs only, 23 people out of 100 were admitted to hospital compared with 17 (95% CI 15 to 20) out of 100 for children receiving SABAs plus anticholinergics (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). This represents an overall number needed to treat for an additional beneficial effect (NNTB) of 16 (95% CI 12 to 29).</P>
<P>A funnel plot of the results for this outcome did not appear to indicate obvious signs of publication bias (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Primary outcome: admission to hospital: subgroup analysis by study protocol</HEADING>
<P>Subgrouping the studies by study protocol for the same outcome showed no statistically significant difference between subgroups (test for subgroup differences: Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 0.55, degrees of freedom (df) = 1, P value = 0.46, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%), although the power was low due to marked group imbalances in weight (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). Fifteen intervention arms including 1998 children were subgrouped into the multiple fixed-dose protocol group. Of interest, anticholinergics delivered as a multiple fixed-dose regimen in 11 studies on 1998 children led to a decrease in the risk of hospital admission by 28% compared with SABA alone (RR 0.72; 95% CI 0.61 to 0.84). This result was statistically significant (P value &lt; 0.0001) with no evidence of heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%). However, pooling data from only three studies (including 419 children) that used a single-dose regimen showed no significant reduction in risk (RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.56 to 1.26). Studies grouped into the multiple flexible-dose protocol did not provide data for this outcome. Due to subgroup imbalance in number and severity, we cannot firmly conclude on whether the intensity of therapy makes a difference in the magnitude of effect of treatment.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Primary outcome: admission to hospital: subgroup analysis by author's judgment of asthma severity and control group admission rate (multiple dose - fixed protocol)</HEADING>
<P>Efforts had been made in previous versions of this review to stratify studies by asthma severity based on baseline lung function or clinical score and validated by both the eligibility and exclusion criteria and the authors' assessment of severity (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). The studies were classified as severe, moderate and severe, moderate, mild and moderate, and mild. There was no significant difference between the RRs in these severity subgroups (test for subgroup differences: Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 2.58, df = 4, P value = 0.63, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%; <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). Admittedly, the number of subgroups may have decreased the power to detect statistically significant subgroup differences.</P>
<P>In the eight studies including 1188 children, judged as experiencing a severe asthma exacerbation, a 27% decrease in the risk of admission (RR 0.73; 95% CI 0.61 to 0.87) was observed with anticholinergic treatment.</P>
<P>In the four studies including 371 children, rated as having a moderate or severe asthma exacerbation, a 40% reduction in risk of hospitalisation (RR 0.60; 95% CI 0.41 to 0.89) was documented in favor of anticholinergic treatment. In the three studies with 463 children experiencing a moderate asthma exacerbation, no significant reduction in risk of hospitalisation (RR 0.77; 95% 0.49 to 1.22) was observed although the effect size was of similar magnitude to that in the preceding groups.</P>
<P>Two studies including 358 children experiencing mild and moderate asthma exacerbations showed a non-significant reduction in hospital admission (RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.52 to 1.47).</P>
<P>In 117 children judged as experiencing a mild asthma exacerbation, there was no apparent beneficial effect on hospital admission with a wide confidence interval (RR 1.43; 95% CI 0.42 to 4.79).</P>
<P>In this review update, we subgrouped hospital admissions using our proxy measure for severity derived from the control group event rate for hospitalisation (see <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). The studies were grouped into tertiles corresponding to high, medium and low risk of admission (high risk, admission rate &#8805; 43%; medium risk, admission rate 10% to 42%; and low risk &lt; 10%). There was no significant difference between the RRs in the severity subgroups (test for subgroup differences: Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 1.68, df = 2, P value = 0.43, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%).</P>
<P>Six studies on 669 children were grouped in the upper tertile with the highest control group admission rates: there was a 32% decrease in the risk of admission with the use of anticholinergics (RR 0.68; 95% CI 0.56 to 0.82; <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). In the six studies on 780 children in the medium-risk group, the use of anticholinergics reduced the risk of admission by 25% (RR 0.75; 95% CI 0.57 to 0.99). In the subgroup with the lowest control group event rates that included six studies on 968 children, the use of anticholinergics did not significantly reduce the risk of hospital admission (RR 0.91; 95% CI 0.59 to 1.42). Comparing the control group weighted risk against the treatment group's risk, the NNTB in the high-risk group was 7 (95% CI 5 to 12) versus 17 (95% CI 10 to 415) in the medium-risk group and 139 (not statistically significant) in the low-risk group (see <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>).</P>
<P>Irrespective of the methods to classify severity, the findings would suggest that, within this group of trials of children with predominantly moderate and severe asthma, those with the most severe airway obstruction and a baseline risk of admission of more than 40% showed the largest numerical benefit from the addition of anticholinergics, with an intermediate effect in those with moderate airway obstruction or a baseline risk of admission between 10% and 40% and no significant effect in the few trials pertaining only to children with mild asthma.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Primary outcome: admission to hospital: subgroup analysis by co-intervention with corticosteroids</HEADING>
<P>Studies were grouped by co-intervention with corticosteroids (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>). There was no significant difference between the subgroups (test for subgroup differences: Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 0.66, df = 3, P value = 0.88, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%). In the eight studies that administered corticosteroids to all children, the addition of an anticholinergic showed a reduction in the risk of hospital admission (RR 0.71; 95% CI 0.59 to 0.86). In the six studies that did not give corticosteroids to all children, the addition of an anticholinergic showed a significant reduction in risk (RR 0.67; 95% CI 0.47 to 0.94). In the three studies that administered corticosteroids at the physician's discretion, the point estimate was similar, but the confidence interval crossed unity (RR 0.77; 95% CI 0.54 to 1.10). This subgroup analysis would suggest that the effect of an anticholinergic was present, independently from the administration of systemic corticosteroids.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Primary outcome: hospital admissions</HEADING>
<P>In children with predominantly moderate and severe asthma exacerbation, the combination of an anticholinergic and SABA significantly reduced the risk of hospital admission, the primary outcome of this review. This result was derived from 15 studies (19 comparisons) and 2497 children. Does this result alone justify the use of an anticholinergic in the treatment of all children with acute asthma? To investigate this further we performed several subgroup analyses and considered the validity of these results and their significance for practice.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Different treatment protocols used in the trials</HEADING>
<P>An anticholinergic was administered as a single dose, multiple doses according to a fixed protocol, or a flexible dosing regimen where the an anticholinergic was systematically added to every SABA treatment until sufficient clinical improvement for discharge. This fundamental difference in treatment protocols prompted the first subgroup analysis by study protocol. The majority of data came from trials using multiple doses of ipratropium added to inhaled SABA with a fixed protocol: these trials used doses between 250 mcg and 500 mcg usually via a nebulizer device, with all but one using two or three doses over 30 to 90 minutes. There was a 28% statistically significant reduction in the risk of hospital admission in favor of anticholinergics. The three trials using a single-dose protocol showed a smaller effect size that was not statistically significant and there were no admission data in the two trials using a flexible protocol. In absence of significant group difference in this analysis and the absence of head-to-head comparison between treatment protocols, there is insufficient information to judge how these different treatment protocols compare with each other. Until further data are available, it seems reasonable to recommend repeated doses of ipratropium bromide in a fixed protocol for one to two hours.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Asthma exacerbation severity</HEADING>
<P>Examining participant characteristics and study author's classification of severity, it was evident that the overwhelming majority of trials were conducted in children with moderate or severe asthma, or both (not unexpected for studies performed in emergency departments). When the trials were broken down into severity subgroups based on the rate of admission to hospital in the control group (given inhaled SABAs alone) or based on lung function and clinical score, there was no significant difference between the severity subgroups.</P>
<P>The strongest evidence for a 32% and 25% statistically significant reduction in the risk of admission to hospital with an additional inhaled anticholinergic was seen from the trials classified with a high and medium admission rate, respectively, and while no evidence of effect was noted in the subgroup with the lowest admission rates, the small sample in this latter subgroup reduced the precision of this observation. Seven children (95% CI 5 to 12) needed to be treated in the high admission rate subgroup to prevent one hospital admission versus 17 (95% CI 10 to 415) in the medium admission rate subgroup and 139 (not statistically significant) in the low admission rate subgroup (see <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>). Similarly, although there was no overall statistically significant subgroup difference when severity was based on lung function and clinical score, there was evidence of effect in all severity subgroups but those classified in the mild and mild-moderate severity subgroups. We underline that, irrespective of the severity classification used, as the CIs for these subgroups were overlapping, there was no significant difference in RR or risk difference between the severity subgroups in this group of predominantly moderate and severe children. Until further data are available, it seems prudent to recommend the addition of anticholinergics in children with moderate or severe exacerbations.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Use of systemic corticosteroids</HEADING>
<P>As the use of corticosteroids for the treatment of acute asthma is widely established in practice, we explored the possibility of effect modification by co-intervention with oral corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-GINA-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lougheed-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lougheed 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rowe-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowe 2001</LINK>)<I>. </I>There was some variation in the use of corticosteroids between studies; corticosteroids were either not used, were systematically used or their use was left to the discretion of the attending physician. We found no statistically significant group difference between the subgroups that did or did not administer systemic corticosteroids and no apparent difference in the size of the effect of an anticholinergic. This suggests that the effect of anticholinergics is not influenced by co-intervention with systemic corticosteroids, at least not within two to three hours of corticosteroid administration (mean time to decision to admit in studies contributing data to the primary outcome two to three hours). This may be due to the delayed onset of action of systemic corticosteroids three to four hours after administration (<LINK REF="REF-Rowe-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowe 2001</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Other subgroups</HEADING>
<P>Further subgroup analyses were considered for the 2012 update, but not performed. Analysis by age of child was not possible because of the significant overlap in children's ages between studies (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>) and reported data were not stratified by age group in individual studies. Total dose of treatment could not be reliably established as the majority of studies used nebulizer devices to deliver the drug. With such a wide age range of subjects it is unclear what proportion of the delivered dose reaches the child's airways (<LINK REF="REF-Rubin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubin 2003</LINK>), which would make any comparison difficult to interpret reliably.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Secondary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Wide ranges of physiological and spirometric parameters were reported among the studies. However, such was the range of parameters used by different studies that the amount of data that could be pooled were limited.</P>
<P>Statistically significant group differences favoring anticholinergic use were observed for lung function whether reported as 'change in % predicted FEV<SUB>1</SUB>' or as '% change in FEV<SUB>1</SUB>', clinical score at 120 minutes, oxygen saturation at 60 minutes and the need for repeat use of bronchodilators prior to discharge from the emergency department. No significant group difference was seen for the relapse rate.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Adverse events</HEADING>
<P>The combination of anticholinergics and SABAs was associated with a statistically significant 30% and 39% reduced risk of nausea and tremor, respectively. No significant group difference in vomiting was observed. Clinically important adverse effects, such as tachycardia or hypertension, were reported too infrequently to permit aggregation. Thus, the addition of anticholinergics to SABAs decreased the incidence of commonly observed beta<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic effects in children treated with SABAs only.</P>

<P>The age range of subjects in the included studies ranged from four months to 18 years (with eight studies including preschool-aged children). The diagnosis of asthma in young children represents a considerable challenge to clinicians and wheezy symptoms in children younger than 12 months may represent a different disease process (such as bronchiolitis) to asthma. The inclusion of studies with infants less than 12 months of age was carefully considered for its potential to confound the results. In the studies that included subjects less than 18 months of age (<LINK REF="STD-Benito-Fernandez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Benito Fernandez 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guill-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Guill 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Phanichyakam-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Phanichyakam 1990</LINK>), the population age range was examined and in each case less than 5% of the population were under 18 months. With such a degree of homogeneity within the studies, the impact, if any, on the overall review was therefore likely to have been very small. Sensitivity analysis removing the only study (<LINK REF="STD-Benito-Fernandez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Benito Fernandez 2000</LINK>) that reported admission data of the three studies that included children less than one year of age, did not alter the direction or magnitude of effect for the primary outcome (RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.63 to 0.86).</P>
<P>With over half of the studies in this review being carried out in North America, the validity of study results to other countries should be considered. Large geographical variations in hospital admission rates have been predominantly attributed to differences in asthma diagnosis, use of daily prophylaxis, intensity of emergency therapy, admission criteria and bed availabilities (<LINK REF="REF-Homer-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Homer 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Payne-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Payne 1995</LINK>). It is acknowledged in the UK and elsewhere, that admission rates in chronic disease may also be influenced by factors such as population deprivation and availability of primary care services (<LINK REF="REF-Saxena-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saxena 2006</LINK>). These factors may limit the external validity (generalizability) of study results, but as they would be applied similarly to both the treatment and control group within each study, this would not affect the internal validity of the observed effect. Interestingly, the absence of statistical heterogeneity of study results across trials provides reassurance to the robustness of study results across countries from which these studies originated.</P>

<P>Like all systematic reviews, this meta-analysis is limited by the quality of existing data (<LINK REF="REF-Khan-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 1996</LINK>). This review examined studies for bias against fixed pre-established criteria in keeping with current Cochrane review methodology. Potential biases were identified in five out of the 19 studies contributing data to our primary outcome. However, there were a far greater number of studies where the potential for bias was unclear. This could be a reflection of poor methodological reporting or poor methodology. Sensitivity analysis removing studies with potential bias did not change the direction and significance of the results for the primary outcome in any of the treatment protocols (<LINK REF="STD-Beck-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Beck 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Calvo-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Calvo 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chakraborti-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Chakraborti 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Phanichyakam-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Phanichyakam 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sharma-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sharma 2004</LINK>). Data from two unpublished studies (<LINK REF="STD-BI-_x005b_pers-comm_x005d_" TYPE="STUDY">BI [pers comm]</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peterson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Peterson 1996</LINK>) were included in this review and sensitivity analysis showed that removing them from the analysis did not impact significantly on the overall result for the primary outcome.</P>
<P>Although only one study clearly described the physician making the decision to admit as blinded to the study medication, the double-blinded nature of nearly all trials (18 out of 20 were double blinded) would imply that study physicians making such clinical decisions were also blinded to the study medication. This should be clearly reported in future trials.</P>
<P>Despite these possible limitations, we did not consider them to have affected the strength or direction of the results for our primary outcome and so we rated the quality of evidence for the effect on hospital admission as high. However, unanswered questions remain regarding the optimal dose, intensity of therapy and severity of asthma exacerbations in relation to the reduced risk of hospital admission.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2013-08-14 19:54:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>The present review summarizes the best evidence available to April 2012. The first update identified three new trials not included in the first version of this review published in 1997. This update has added seven new trials. The conclusion regarding the single-dose protocol and the multiple dose-fixed protocol with regard the primary outcome remains unchanged due to the absence of new trials. With four additional trials in the multiple dose-fixed protocol, the findings of the previous review were confirmed and strengthened. Thus supporting the addition of multiple doses of anticholinergics to SABAs for reducing hospital admission and improving lung function in children not only with severe but also with moderate asthma exacerbations.</P>
<P>The findings of this review are similar to other reviews examining a paediatric population (<LINK REF="REF-Rodrigo-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodrigo 2005</LINK>
<I>).</I> In their review, Rodrigo et al included 16 studies examining the use of anticholinergics plus SABAs versus SABAs alone in childhood asthma. Of those studies, 15 were examined in this review. <LINK REF="STD-Timsit-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Timsit 2002</LINK> was excluded from this review as the protocol examined a different dose of SABA in each treatment arm. The review concluded that "the addition of multiple doses of inhaled ipratropium bromide to SABAs is indicated in the standard treatment in children, adolescents and adults with moderate to severe exacerbations of asthma in the emergency setting" (<LINK REF="REF-Rodrigo-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodrigo 2005</LINK>). In line with our definition, <LINK REF="REF-Rodrigo-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodrigo 2005</LINK> defined severity by baseline spirometric testing (FEV<SUB>1</SUB> or peak expiratory flow (PEF) 50% to 70% of predicted as moderate exacerbation and FEV<SUB>1</SUB> or PEF less than 50% of predicted as a severe exacerbation or different clinical scores).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-08-14 20:04:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Francine M. Ducharme">
<P>The findings of this Cochrane review support the use of anticholinergics in addition to SABAs over SABAs alone in the management of acute asthma in children, with an anticipated 27% reduction in the risk of hospital admission. The absence of statistically significant subgroup difference in treatment response between severity subgroups or those receiving different treatment intensity (multiple fixed-dose versus single-dose) prevents firm conclusions regarding a possible effect modification associated with treatment intensity and asthma severity. Yet, given the large weight of the trials pertaining to children with moderate or severe asthma (with an under-representation of those with mild asthma) and the absence of effect in the mildest subgroup, it seems prudent to recommend the systematic use of anticholinergics in children with moderate or severe asthma only. Similarly, as most of the evidence is derived from trials testing a multiple fixed-dose protocol using three doses of 250 mcg or two doses of 500 mcg of ipratropium bromide administered by nebulizer over 60 to 90 minutes, in combination with a SABA, we would recommend this treatment strategy and duration. There are also insufficient data to comment on the efficacy of adding anticholinergic to every SABA treatment, that is, titrating the number of both therapies to the child's response, on the optimal duration of combination therapy, and no evidence to explore whether the anticholinergic dose should be adjusted to the child's age. The addition of anticholinergics to SABAs was associated with significantly less tremor and nausea than SABAs alone.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-08-13 12:43:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Francine M. Ducharme">
<P>Future trials should be designed to address five issues, the impact on the magnitude of effect of: (1) the severity of airway obstruction (mild asthma and impending respiratory failure); (2) child's age (preschooler-aged versus school-aged children); (3) intensity/flexibility of therapy (fixed versus flexible); (4) dose of anticholinergics (250 mcg versus 500 mcg) and (5) delivery devices (nebulization versus inhalation). This could be done by conducting head-to head comparisons with different doses, treatment intensity (multiple fixed-dose versus multiple flexible-dose protocols) and different inhalation modalities (metered dose inhaler versus nebulization) or by stratifying on child's age and baseline severity or both. Indeed, future research must attempt to define the severity of asthma exacerbation reliably and reproducibly in the study population by standardized methods (e.g. spirometry, respiratory resistance or interrupter technique) or validated clinical scores, or both. Any such attempts should consider the difficulties of using spirometric parameters in a young population (<LINK REF="REF-Arets-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arets 2001</LINK>), although it offers the most objective means to ascertain the severity of airway obstruction reliably (<LINK REF="REF-Silverman-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silverman 2007</LINK>). Alternate measures include use of clinical scores with validated cut-offs for severity such as the Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure (<LINK REF="REF-Chalut-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalut 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ducharme-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ducharme 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Because systemic glucocorticoids are now the standard treatment of children with moderate and severe exacerbations, they should be systematically given with SABAs in future trials. Trials are needed to examine the effect of adding anticholinergics in a multiple flexible-dose manner, that is, each time a SABA is deemed necessary.</P>
<P>Future trials should include more sensitive and reliable endpoints such as number of bronchodilator inhalations and oxygenation (during the emergency department treatment), duration of hospitalisation and duration of need for intensive (at less than four-hour interval) bronchodilator inhalation (for hospitalised children) and attempt to measure time to full recovery in discharged participants, that is, the duration of symptoms, rescue SABA use, functional status and quality of life.</P>
<P>In addition, it seems urgent to assess the efficacy and duration of anticholinergics in children with impending respiratory failure at risk of admission or admitted to the intensive care unit.</P>
