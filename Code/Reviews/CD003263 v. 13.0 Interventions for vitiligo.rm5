<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Vitiligo is a chronic skin disorder characterised by patchy loss of skin colour. Some people experience itching before the appearance of a new patch. It affects people of any age or ethnicity, more than half of whom develop it before the age of 20 years. There are two main types: generalised vitiligo, the common symmetrical form, and segmental, affecting only one side of the body. Recent genetic research suggests that generalised vitiligo is, at least in part, an autoimmune condition which destroys melanocytes (pigment cells). Although our understanding of vitiligo has increased, its causes are still poorly understood. Several treatments are available. Some can restore pigment but none can cure it or prevent its spread or recurrence. Vitiligo patches can have a major psychosocial impact, especially for people with dark or tanned skin or when the face or hands are affected. People with vitiligo can be stigmatised, often experiencing low self-esteem and a lack of self-confidence. Children with vitiligo may be teased and bullied at school. Despite this, we found only one study assessing psychological therapy for vitiligo.</P>
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>What treatments work best to help manage vitiligo?</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>In this update search we found 39 new randomised controlled trials which, added to the 57 studies included previously, makes a total of 96 studies with 4512 participants.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Twenty-one (21/39, 54%) of the new studies assessed new treatments, most of which involved the use of light. Narrowband UVB (NB-UVB) light was used in 35/96 (36% of all included studies), either alone or in combination with other therapies and achieved the best results. There were 18 surgical studies and 31 studies compared active treatment versus placebo.</P>
<P>Half of the studies lasted longer than six months. Most of them 69/96 (72%) had fewer than 50 participants. Only seven studies assessed children and one study only recruited men.</P>
<P>The majority of studies (53/96, 55%), most of which were of combination treatments with light, assessed more than 75% repigmentation. Eight studies reported a statistically significant result for this outcome, including the following four results: topical corticosteroids were better than PUVAsol (psoralen with sunlight), hydrocortisone plus laser light was better than laser light alone, <I>ginkgo biloba</I> was better than placebo and oral minipulse of prednisolone (OMP) plus NB-UVB was better than OMP alone. None of the studies reported the long-term benefit of the treatment i.e. two years' sustained repigmentation. The maximum follow-up time, reported in only one study, was one year post-treatment.</P>
<P>Only 9/96 (9%) reported the quality of life of participants, but the majority of all studies (65/96, 68%) reported adverse effects, mainly for topical treatments, some of which caused itching, redness, skin thinning, telangiectasia and atrophy. Neither mometasone furoate nor hydrocortisone produced adverse effects. Some NB-UVB studies reported phototoxic reaction and Koebnerisation whereas some PUVA (psoralen with artificial light UVA as a light source) studies caused dizziness and nausea.</P>
<P>Six studies reported cessation of spread of vitiligo, one of which showed that <I>ginkgo biloba</I> was more than twice as likely to stop vitiligo spreading than placebo. </P>
<P>This review has highlighted the recent surge in vitiligo research providing insights into its causes. The majority of the studies reporting successful repigmentation were combinations of various interventions with light, indicating this is an effective, though not necessarily permanent, treatment for generalised vitiligo.</P>
<P>In view of the fact that vitiligo has no cure, providing ways of coping with it could be of benefit to patients and should be part of standard care. Better designed studies, consensus on how to measure treatment success, more studies involving children and studies assessing psychological interventions, are needed.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Since the last update (2010), the design and reporting of vitiligo trials have not greatly improved. Only five studies met the criteria for a well-designed trial. Poor design, the number and complexity of the treatments and the fact that many of the studies assessed individual vitiligo patches in the same participant, made comparison of the studies difficult. Consequently, we could only perform one meta-analysis of three studies comparing NB-UVB with PUVA which showed that NB-UVB has fewer side effects and is marginally better than PUVA.</P>

<P>Vitiligo is a chronic skin disorder characterised by patchy loss of skin colour. Some people experience itching before the appearance of a new patch.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-02-18 14:27:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>This update of the 2010 review includes 96 studies, 57 from the previous update and 39 new studies, totalling 4512 participants. Most of the studies, covering a wide range of interventions, had fewer than 50 participants. All of the studies assessed repigmentation, however only five reported on all of our three primary outcomes which were quality of life, &gt; 75% repigmentation and adverse effects. Of our secondary outcomes, six studies measured cessation of spread but none assessed long-term permanence of repigmentation resulting from treatment at two years follow-up.</P>
<P>Most of the studies assessed combination therapies which generally reported better results. New interventions include seven new surgical interventions.</P>
<P>We analysed the data from 25 studies which assessed our primary outcomes. We used the effect measures risk ratio (RR), and odds ratio (OR) with their 95% confidence intervals (CI) and where N is the number of participants in the study.</P>
<P>We were only able to analyse one of nine studies assessing quality of life and this showed no statistically significant improvement between the comparators.</P>
<P>Nine analyses from eight studies reported &gt;75% repigmentation. In the following studies the repigmentation was better in the combination therapy group: calcipotriol plus PUVA (psoralen with UVA light) versus PUVA (paired OR 4.25, 95% CI 1.43 to 12.64, one study, N = 27); hydrocortisone-17-butyrate plus excimer laser versus excimer laser alone (RR 2.57, 95% CI 1.20 to 5.50, one study, N = 84); oral minipulse of prednisolone (OMP) plus NB-UVB (narrowband UVB) versus OMP alone (RR 7.41, 95% CI 1.03 to 53.26, one study, N = 47); azathioprine with PUVA versus PUVA alone (RR 17.77, 95% CI 1.08 to 291.82, one study, N = 58) and 8-Methoxypsoralen (8-MOP ) plus sunlight versus psoralen (RR 2.50, 95% CI 1.06 to 5.91, one study, N = 168). In these three studies <I>ginkgo biloba</I> was better than placebo (RR 4.40, 95% CI 1.08 to 17.95, one study, N = 47); clobetasol propionate was better than PUVAsol (PUVA with sunlight) (RR 4.70, 95% CI 1.14 to 19.39, one study, N = 45); split skin grafts with PUVAsol was better than minipunch grafts with PUVAsol (RR 1.89, 95% CI 1.25 to 2.85, one study, N = 64).</P>
<P>We performed one meta-analysis of three studies, in which we found a non-significant 60% increase in the proportion of participants achieving &gt;75% repigmentation in favour of NB-UVB compared to PUVA (RR 1.60, 95% CI 0.74 to 3.45; I² = 0%).</P>

<I>Definition</I>
</HEADING>
<P>Vitiligo results in a loss of functional melanocytes (pigment producing cells) and has been shown in genetic studies to be associated with other autoimmune diseases. It is characterised by the appearance of white patches on the skin sometimes accompanied by whitening of the hair. It can also have a major psychosocial impact due to the unsightly appearance, especially on dark or tanned skin and on exposed areas of the body, such as the face and hands. Although vitiligo may develop at any age, it is rarely present at birth when it may be confused with piebaldism or nevus depigmentosus (inherited localised skin pigment loss). Most people develop the disease before the age of 20 years (<LINK REF="REF-Lerner-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lerner 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Picardo-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Picardo 2010</LINK>)</P>
<P>Vitiligo is normally asymptomatic, although around 20% of patients report itching at the onset of a new lesion (<LINK REF="REF-Ezzedine-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ezzedine 2011a</LINK>). Recent findings suggest that various local triggers alert the skin's innate immune system creating a silent micro-inflammatory process, still poorly understood (<LINK REF="REF-Ta_x00ef_eb-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taïeb 2012</LINK>). Vitiligo can appear anywhere on the skin but is commonly seen on areas around the orifices, the genitals, face and hands. Friction may also trigger vitiligo on areas such as the neck, elbows and ankles. This is known as the Koebner phenomenon (<LINK REF="REF-Gauthier-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gauthier 2003</LINK>). A recent study proposes the hypothesis that the Koebner phenomenon could be used to assess and predict the clinical profile and course of vitiligo in some cases (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Geel-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Geel 2012</LINK>). The most common form of vitiligo, non-segmental vitiligo or vitiligo vulgaris, is symmetrical and may be localised to certain areas. It may also spread to involve the entire body surface. In contrast, segmental vitiligo only affects one side of the body and usually has limited progression. The two types of vitiligo may co-exist, in which case response to treatment in the segmented areas is usually poor (<LINK REF="REF-Ezzedine-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ezzedine 2011b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Picardo-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Picardo 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Flare-ups of vitiligo may be separated by stable periods sometimes followed by rapid spreading. The disease can also stop spreading spontaneously without any treatment and may even improve, at least partially, for a short time. However, loss of pigmentation normally recurs, even after successful treatment in some areas. From the clinical perspective, if the disease is stable, it is likely to respond better to surgical treatment. Paradoxically, there are many anecdotal accounts of people with vitiligo whose lesions improve while new patches are appearing at the same time. Most of the reported cases of spontaneous repigmentation are seen on sun-exposed sites.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Prevalence</HEADING>
<P>It is difficult to get a true picture of the prevalence of vitiligo. The largest epidemiological study of the prevalence of vitiligo is based on 47,033 inhabitants of the island of Bornholm in Denmark (<LINK REF="REF-Howitz-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howitz 1977</LINK>) where vitiligo affected 0.38% of the population. Although many papers quote an estimate of 0.5% to 1% prevalence worldwide this estimate may vary according to cultural and social differences.This is confirmed in a recent review on vitiligo prevalence which found a worldwide prevalence of 0.5% to 2% (<LINK REF="REF-Kr_x00fc_ger-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krüger 2012</LINK>). When vitiligo is more visible, such as on dark skin or when there is more stigma attached to the disease, people with vitiligo are more likely to consult a doctor, thus reported estimates of prevalence may be higher. Figures as high as 8.8% have been reported in India where considerable stigma is attached to the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Behl-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Behl 1972</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Impact</HEADING>
<P>Vitiligo occurs worldwide, affecting all skin types. Vitiligo, classified as a disease by the WHO (L80), results in a loss of functional melanocytes and is often associated with other autoimmune diseases. It can be a cosmetically and psychologically devastating disease (<LINK REF="REF-Lerner-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lerner 1978</LINK>) resulting in low self-esteem (<LINK REF="REF-Papadopoulos-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papadopoulos 1999</LINK>), poor body image (<LINK REF="REF-Porter-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Porter 1979</LINK>), and difficulties in sexual relationships (<LINK REF="REF-Porter-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Porter 1990</LINK>). Some people with vitiligo may experience high levels of anxiety because of the unpredictability of the disease. Its visibility often makes it difficult for those affected to cope with it from day to day (<LINK REF="REF-Schmid_x002d_Ott-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmid-Ott 2007</LINK>). The use of cosmetic camouflage can be helpful (<LINK REF="REF-Levy-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levy 2012</LINK>), especially for people with dark complexions where vitiligo is much more noticeable, but this is not always available (<LINK REF="REF-Talsania-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Talsania 2010</LINK>). A recent study (<LINK REF="REF-Pahwa-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pahwa 2013</LINK>) describes the psychosocial impact on people with vitiligo in India and a review of their quality of life confirmed their experience of social isolation and stigmatisation (<LINK REF="REF-Parsad-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parsad 2003a</LINK>). People with vitiligo sometimes encounter discrimination in employment, particularly in jobs where they have to deal with the public (<LINK REF="REF-Ongenae-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ongenae 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Porter-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Porter 1987</LINK>). The impact of vitiligo on children and adolescents should not be underestimated. It can be the cause of bullying and teasing, often restricting sports activities or attendance at school (<LINK REF="REF-Silverberg-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silverberg 2014</LINK>). Adults who had negative experiences linked with their vitiligo in childhood report significantly more problems in social development (<LINK REF="REF-Lindhorst-Homan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindhorst Homan 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite the fact that vitiligo can significantly affect quality of life, there are still very few studies addressing this important aspect of the disease or the efficacy of psychological interventions. There has been an increase in published studies in recent years, but more research in this area is needed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Causes</HEADING>
<P>The exact origin of vitiligo is still under investigation. Several mechanisms including autoimmunity, genetic, and environmental factors probably interact in combination in its pathogenesis (<LINK REF="REF-Ezzedine-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ezzedine 2014</LINK> (in press); <LINK REF="REF-Richmond-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richmond 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schallreuter-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schallreuter 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spritz-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spritz 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Westerhof-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Westerhof 2007</LINK>). Almost one third of people with vitiligo have a positive family history of the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Ezzedine-2012a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ezzedine 2012a</LINK>). Moreover, there is increasing genetic evidence underlining the link between vitiligo and other autoimmune diseases (<LINK REF="REF-Jin-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jin 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spritz-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spritz 2013</LINK>). Indeed, NALP-1 polymorphism has been associated with generation of inflammation and other genes for the induction of autoimmunity. The gene NLRP1 is genetically associated with the risk of several autoimmune diseases including generalised vitiligo, Addison's disease, type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and others (<LINK REF="REF-Levandowski-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levandowski 2013</LINK>). It also seems that triggers such as trauma to the skin, hormonal changes in some women after pregnancy and psychological stress may affect the course of the disease. Some studies support the theory that psychological stress is implicated in the onset and exacerbation of some skin diseases, including vitiligo, in some individuals (<LINK REF="REF-Ezzedine-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ezzedine 2012b</LINK>). In one particular study, people with vitiligo experienced a significantly higher number of stressful life events than controls, suggesting that stress may be an important factor in the cause of the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Papadopoulos-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papadopoulos 1998</LINK>). However, more evidence is needed to support this theory.<BR/>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Association with other diseases</HEADING>
<P>Vitiligo is sometimes associated with autoimmune or auto-inflammatory diseases such as thyroid disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Geel-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Geel 2012</LINK>), psoriasis, atopic dermatitis (<LINK REF="REF-Ezzedine-2012a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ezzedine 2012a</LINK>), diabetes mellitus, pernicious anaemia and Addison's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Rezaei-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rezaei 2007</LINK>). People with vitiligo have been found to have antibodies directed against melanocytes and some develop antibodies to other tissues and either suffer from the above mentioned autoimmune diseases themselves or have close relatives that do (<LINK REF="REF-Bystryn-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bystryn 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cui-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cui 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klaus-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klaus 1984</LINK>). These observations have been strengthened by recent genome research (<LINK REF="REF-Jin-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jin 2012</LINK>) strongly pointing to the conclusion that vitiligo is an autoimmune disease as it shares genes with other autoimmune diseases. Furthermore, it has also been shown that vitiligo has an inverse relationship with melanoma which means that people with vitiligo are less likely to develop melanoma (<LINK REF="REF-Spritz-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spritz 2010</LINK>). A survey carried out in the Netherlands suggests that vitiligo patients are also at lower risk of non-melanoma skin cancer as well as melanoma (<LINK REF="REF-Teulings-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Teulings 2013</LINK>). A recent genome-wide association study has also found a susceptibility variant for non-segmental vitiligo in the tyrosinase gene (TYR) in the European white population, rarely found in melanoma patients (<LINK REF="REF-Jin-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jin 2010</LINK>) suggesting a genetic disregulation of immunosurveillance against the melanocytic system. However, the precise links between these diseases have not yet been fully elucidated.</P>

<P>It is important to stress that as yet there is no cure or any effective method of stopping the spread of this disease. Several interventions, based mainly on new findings on the possible causes of this disease, have been used to treat vitiligo (<LINK REF="REF-Border_x00e9_-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borderé 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Forschner-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forschner 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Njoo-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Njoo 1998</LINK>). These include pharmacological interventions (e.g. topical corticosteroids and immunomodulators); various forms of phototherapy (i.e. ultraviolet A (UVA), narrow- and broadband ultraviolet B (NB-UVB, BB-UVB), psoralen and UVA (PUVA), excimer laser, and monochromatic excimer light (MEL)); surgical procedures (grafting, melanocyte transplantation, dermabrasion, micropigmentation); cosmetic measures (depigmentation, cosmetic camouflage, fake tan); complementary therapies, and psychotherapy. Although we found no randomised trials of cosmetic camouflage or fake tanning products they are often recommended or prescribed for the face and other exposed areas. When vitiligo is extensive, depigmentation of the skin using topical products such as MBEH (monobenzyl ether of hydroquinone) is sometimes used. Many published studies describe combination therapies, usually combining a light source with another form of treatment in order to enhance repigmentation.</P>
<P>In the previous review, published in 2010, we described the interventions in more detail. However, in view of the large number of included studies and the length of this review update, we have put some of this information in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> with references to direct the reader to more information on the various interventions.</P>

<P>For studies with a similar type of active intervention, we performed a meta-analysis, to calculate a weighted treatment effect across trials, using a random-effects (DerSimonian and Laird) model. Where it was not possible to perform a meta-analysis, we summarised the data for each trial and have only presented forest plots for primary outcome measures. We have presented the corresponding results as P values. If raw data could not be extracted, we extracted the results from appropriate statistical analyses presented in the paper and reported these in the review. We considered a P value &lt; 0.05 as statistically significant. Excluded studies and reasons for exclusion are described in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>' tables but not discussed further.</P>

<P>In this updated version of the review we retrieved 430 references from our electronic searches, detailed above. The Cochrane search strategy is wide and designed to minimise the possibility of missing published trials which are randomised but which may have been wrongly indexed. Of the 430 studies retrieved, 378 were rejected because randomisation was not mentioned in the titles or abstracts. Of the remaining 52, we excluded 13 studies which, though stating they were RCTs, were deemed to be not randomised either by correspondence with study authors,or where review authors concluded that the method of randomisation was not adequate. These studies are presented in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>' tables. There were therefore 39 eligible new RCTs from the updated electronic searches which, when added to the 57 RCTs included in the 2010 review makes a total of 96 studies assessed for this review. There were 4512 participants overall.</P>
<P>Searches of the trials registers retrieved details of 41 ongoing RCTs. They are listed in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_ONGOING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of ongoing studies</LINK>' section.</P>

The majority of studies included participants with non-segmental vitiligo, authors frequently referred to this as &#8216;symmetrical&#8217; or &#8216;generalised&#8217; vitiligo. One study included participants with segmental vitiligo only. Two studies specified the type of vitiligo included as localised or generalised. One study included only participants with localised vitiligo. Sixteen studies assessed any type of vitiligo, including segmental vitiligo. The remaining studies did not specify the type of vitiligo. Only half of the studies reported the skin phototype of the participants. All these studies included participants with high skin phototypes, where III and IV were predominant.

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Percentage repigmentation &gt;75%</HEADING>
<P>Most studies assessed the presence of repigmentation with the exception of four (<LINK REF="STD-Agarwal-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Agarwal 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barman 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dawid-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Dawid 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Papadopoulos-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Papadopoulos 2004</LINK>). No two studies used exactly the same method of scoring in relation to repigmentation; however, the majority scored the percentage repigmentation and placed participants into categories (e.g. 1% to 25%, 26% to 50%, 51% to 75%, &gt; 75%). Fifty-three of the 96 included studies (55%) addressed our primary outcome of 'percentage of repigmentation of vitiliginous skin: success rate reported as more than 75% repigmentation of individual patches or of total body surface area'. This outcome was expressed in various ways: 75%, &gt;75%, more than 75%, &#8805;75%, 76 -100% (76% to 100%) in the text of the study. A larger proportion of the new studies 26/39 (67%) compared to 28/57 (49%) of the studies from the previous update, assessed this outcome. Many authors made an attempt to clarify the amount of repigmentation that was deemed successful as 'marked', 'complete' or 'excellent', but opinions varied considerably. For example, authors from nine studies perceived more than 50% repigmentation to be 'excellent', whereas others believed it should be higher (e.g. more than 60% (two studies); more than 70% (two studies), more than 80% (three studies) or more than 90% (two studies). Other studies used the terms poor, fair, good, very good and excellent to report levels of repigmentation (<LINK REF="STD-Budania-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Budania 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khandpur-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Khandpur 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sahni-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Sahni 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singh-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vasistha-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Vasistha 1979</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Ruiz_x002d_Maldonado-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Ruiz-Maldonado 1975</LINK> expressed repigmentation rates as 'slight', 'marked', and 'clinically cured', and <LINK REF="STD-Souto-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Souto 1997</LINK> used 'improvement', 'deterioration', and 'no change' to describe differences in repigmentation. Finally, three studies presented repigmentation in millimetres (<LINK REF="STD-Navarro-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Navarro 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rojas_x002d_Urdaneta-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rojas-Urdaneta 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wind-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Wind 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Assessment was commonly made visually by a clinician using photographs of lesions. However, some studies used planimetry (i.e. drawing lesions on transparent papers) to determine repigmentation and a small number took photographs of lesions and subjected them to morphometry analysis using Corel Draw, version 9.0.

<P>The duration of the studies varied widely (three weeks to three years) and was partly related to the outcomes being observed, such as initiation of repigmentation or extent of repigmentation. Forty-eight studies (50%) lasted less than six months, and the other 48 (50%) lasted more than six months, of which 17% (8/48) lasted between one and three years. Within these periods, some studies continued treatment until an optimal response was achieved. It is also worth noting that some surgical methods are likely to show an improvement quicker than other interventions. The longest study was <LINK REF="STD-Pathak-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Pathak 1984</LINK>, which lasted up to three years, although the placebo group was not followed up beyond 12 months.</P>

<P>Although some studies were described as &#8216;double-blind&#8217; or implied double-blinding, not all of them provided details as to how blinding was maintained. Many studies were within-participant comparisons of different interventions so it was not possible for the participants (and sometimes the clinicians) to be blinded in these studies. Blinding of participants was also not possible in some other studies because two different modalities of intervention were being assessed (e.g. oral versus topical interventions). Furthermore, it was not possible for participants (and sometimes clinicians or outcome assessors) to be blinded in some studies, due to the use of certain interventions (e.g. surgical interventions).</P>
<P>Five of the 14 studies which were described as &#8216;double-blind&#8217; (or implied double-blinding) did not have separate blinded outcome assessors. In 22 studies it was stated that the outcome assessor was blinded but neither the participants nor the clinicians were blinded. Fourteen of these studies were within-participant and eight were parallel groups. In 32 studies blinding of participants, clinicians or outcome assessors was not performed or not stated. However in only nine studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bakis_x002d_Petsoglou-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Bakis-Petsoglou 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ho-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lepe-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lepe 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lim_x002d_Ong-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lim-Ong 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mehrabi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Mehrabi 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Navarro-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Navarro 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez_x002d_Martin-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez-Martin 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanclemente-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sanclemente 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Geel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Van Geel 2004</LINK>) were participants, clinicians and assessors all blinded and authors provided information on how blinding was maintained.Thus these were all graded as having a low risk of bias for these three domains.</P>

<P>The overall number of participants lost to follow-up was 685/4512 i.e.15.2% of the total number of study participants included in the review. In 41 of the included studies (44%), data were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis and these were judged at low risk of bias. This was either because there were no losses to follow-up (31 studies) or because data from dropouts were included in an explicit intention-to-treat analysis (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Hamzavi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hamzavi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Souto-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Souto 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is one study (<LINK REF="STD-El-Mofty-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">El Mofty 2013a</LINK>) that mentioned in the text the clinical response was graded according to intention-to-treat analysis; however, losses to follow-up were considered as poor responders but as the text was not entirely clear we judged this as unclear risk of bias. Another study from the same author (<LINK REF="STD-El-Mofty-2013b" TYPE="STUDY">El Mofty 2013b</LINK>) mentioned in the text that intention-to-treat analysis had been used but as losses to follow-up were excluded from the analysis we judged this to be at high risk of bias</P>
<P>Only 19 of the 41 studies that we assessed at low risk of bias for this domain addressed our primary outcome of more than 75% repigmentation.</P>
<P>Further details are provided in the 'Risk of bias' tables (see the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' tables) where we have summarised the adequacy of blinding with particular attention to those studies, (54 in total), that addressed &gt; 75% repigmentation, a primary outcome of this review.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2015-02-18 14:46:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>In this section, mainly because of the large number of studies, we present the results for the effects of interventions only for studies that examined the primary and secondary outcomes of interest in this review. Of the 39 new studies, 17 (44%) assessed monotherapies and the other 22 (56%) assessed combinations of interventions. Nearly all of the studies examined insufficiently similar interventions to allow data pooling, with the exception of one meta-analysis. A large number of studies (40) used an intra-participant design. This design can have implications for the applicability of findings, especially for topical interventions, as it is not always possible to exclude systemic effects of different interventions used within the same participant.</P>
<P>Therefore, as not all 96 studies reported the outcomes of interest and almost half of them used a within-participant design, forest plots are only presented for 25 of the 55 parallel studies. Many of the trials had control arms in which none of the participants improved. This resulted in large risk ratios (RRs) with very large associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs), exacerbated by the relatively small participant numbers in many of the trials. Thus the magnitude of the RRs quoted should be considered with caution, but some conclusions may be drawn on statistical significance (or lack of it) over control from using the Fisher's Exact test. </P>
<P>We have addressed the effects of interventions under the following headings</P>
<OL>
<LI>Topical therapies: 1.1 Topical corticosteroids; 1.2 Intralesional corticosteroids; 1.3 Topical vitamin D analogues - (calcipotriol and tacalcitol); 1.4 Topical calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus and pimecrolimus); 1.5 Khellin; 1.6 Pseudocatalase and catalase / dismutase superoxide; 1.7 Melagenina (human placental extract); 1.8 Tetrahydrocurcuminoid cream; 1.9 Topical anti-oxidant gel.</LI>
<LI>Oral therapies</LI>
<LI>Light therapies: 3.1 Oral PUVA; 3.2 Oral PUVAsol; 3.3 Topical PUVA; 3.4 Topical PUVAsol; 3.5 UVA; 3.6 UVB (including BB-UVB, NB-UVB and P-NB-UVB); 3.7 Laser light devices; 3.8 Other forms of light therapy.</LI>
<LI>Surgical interventions: 4.1 Suction blister grafts; 4.2 Punch grafts, minigrafts, and split thickness skin grafts; 4.3 Micropigmentation; 4.4 Melanocyte transplantation; 4.5 Dermabrasion; 4.6 Needling; 4.7 Fractional CO2 laser.</LI>
<LI>Psychological therapy</LI>
<LI>Complementary therapies</LI>
</OL>
<P>We have grouped the studies according to intervention types. Where combinations of interventions were used (e.g. topical and light therapy together), we have included the studies under the heading of what we consider to be the &#8216;main&#8217; intervention.</P>
<P>Due to the number and complexity of the interventions in this review, we have not repeated our results for those studies with combination interventions under each of the relevant headings. Instead where studies examined two or more different types of intervention, we have mentioned the study under each intervention heading, for example in 'Section 3.1, Oral PUVA' we did not include details of the primary outcome, more than 75% of repigmentation, for <LINK REF="STD-Ermis-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ermis 2001</LINK> because the main intervention was calcipotriol, not PUVA so this was reported in 'Section 1.3 Topical vitamin D analogues'.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.1 Topical corticosteroids</HEADING>
<P>A total of 17 studies examined the effect of topical steroids, either as monotherapy or in combination with other interventions. Fifteen of these studies examined one or more outcomes of interest, and two did not examine any outcomes of interest other than adverse effects.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Primary outcomes</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">a) Quality of life</HEADING>
<P>Two studies assessing topical corticosteroids assessed patient-rated quality of life measures (<LINK REF="STD-Akdeniz-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Akdeniz 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sassi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sassi 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Sassi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sassi 2008</LINK> compared the effects of topical hydrocortisone-17-butyrate plus laser versus laser alone. One outcome measure in this study was patient-rated quality of life, as measured by Skindex-29 (higher score indicates higher quality of life); however no statistically significant difference was seen between the intervention groups (mean difference (MD) 4.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.56 to 11.06, <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Akdeniz-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Akdeniz 2013</LINK>, which compared the effects of NB-UVB, NB-UVB and calcipotriol and NB-UVB and betamethasone plus calcipotriol, assessed quality of life using the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). A reduction in DLQI scores, indicating an improvement in quality of life, was demonstrated in all groups (suggesting improvement in quality of life). However, the data provided were only end of trial scores, rather than change scores from baseline, and the baseline scores were not comparable between groups, therefore, we did not perform any analyses.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">b) Percentage of repigmentation &gt; 75%</HEADING>
<P>Twelve studies examining the effect of topical corticosteroids addressed this outcome, although repigmentation was measured in various different ways. Eight of these studies examined the effect of topical steroids as monotherapy against other monotherapies or combinations of therapies, and the other four examined the effect of topical corticosteroids in combination with other therapies.</P>
<P>Of the studies which only examined the effect of topical corticosteroids in combination with other therapies, <LINK REF="STD-Akdeniz-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Akdeniz 2013</LINK> compared the effects of NB-UVB, NB-UVB and calcipotriol and NB-UVB and betamethasone plus calcipotriol. Although the authors stated a statistically significant difference in favour of NB-UVB plus betamethasone plus calcipotriol compared to NB-UVB alone, results were presented as mean percentages of repigmentation within the treatment groups, therefore, we were unable to assess how many individuals had achieved &gt; 75% repigmentation. <LINK REF="STD-Sassi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sassi 2008</LINK> compared topical hydrocortisone 17-butyrate plus laser versus laser. There was a statistically significant difference in favour of the combination treatment; these participants were more than twice as likely to achieve 75% repigmentation than those receiving laser treatment alone (risk ratio (RR) 2.57, 95% CI 1.20 to 5.50, <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>).</P>
<P>In one RCT of children with vitiligo, <LINK REF="STD-Khalid-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Khalid 1995</LINK> compared topical clobetasol propionate with topical PUVAsol in children with vitiligo. Participants receiving clobetasol propionate were significantly more likely than those receiving PUVAsol to achieve greater than 75% repigmentation (RR 4.70, 95% CI 1.14 to 19.39, <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Kathuria-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Kathuria 2012</LINK> compared 0.05% fluticasone propionate cream 0.1% once daily with 0.1% tacrolimus ointment twice daily for six months. Participants had segmental vitiligo, with or without focal vitiligo. Only one participant in the fluticasone group achieved greater than 75% repigmentation, compared to none in the tacrolimus group. No analysis was performed as the effect size was not estimable.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-K_x00f6_se-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Köse 2010</LINK> compared 0.1% mometasone furoate cream once daily with 1% pimecrolimus cream twice daily, for three months. Although there was a trend towards superior repigmentation in the mometasone group, this was not statistically significant (RR 7.00, 95% CI 0.38 to 127.32, <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>; Fisher's Exact test, P = 0.231).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Kumaran-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kumaran 2006</LINK> compared topical betamethasone dipropionate with either calcipotriol or betamethasone dipropionate plus calcipotriol. None of the participants achieved greater than 75% repigmentation. <LINK REF="STD-Yaghoobi-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Yaghoobi 2011</LINK> compared topical 0.05% clobetasol propionate (or 0.1% triamcinolone acetonide for flexures), as monotherapy and in combination with oral zinc sulphate. Again, none of the participants achieved &gt;75% repigmentation.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Wazir-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wazir 2010</LINK> compared topical 0.01% mometasone furoate, both as monotherapy and in combination with topical 0.03% tacrolimus. Although a greater proportion of participants treated with combination therapy were reported to achieve &gt;75% repigmentation, the data could not be compared to the data from other studies because the repigmentation categories were classified as 51% to 75% and 76% to 95%.</P>
<P>The following studies assessing topical corticosteroids used an intra-participant design; however, data were not sufficient to allow for appropriate analyses to be conducted: <LINK REF="STD-Lim_x002d_Ong-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lim-Ong 2005</LINK> (which compared topical clobetasol propionate plus NB-UVB versus placebo plus NB-UVB); <LINK REF="STD-Lepe-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lepe 2003</LINK> (which compared topical clobetasol propionate and 0.1% tacrolimus); <LINK REF="STD-Westerhof-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Westerhof 1999</LINK> (which compared topical fluticasone propionate (FP) versus FP plus UVA or versus UVA alone); and <LINK REF="STD-Bayoumi-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bayoumi 2012</LINK> (which compared hydrocortisone butyrate and NB-UVB with the same combination after laser dermabrasion).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">c) Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>Sixteen of the 17 studies examining the effect of topical corticosteroids reported adverse effects in some of the participants receiving them. For combination therapies it was not always possible to ascertain which of these adverse effects were attributable to the topical steroids.</P>
<P>Of the studies that examined the effects of topical corticosteroids as monotherapy, <LINK REF="STD-Ho-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 2011</LINK> reported folliculitis in one participant treated with clobetasol propionate. No specific details were given regarding other adverse effects. <LINK REF="STD-Khalid-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Khalid 1995</LINK> reported mild atrophy (four cases), telangiectasia (two), hypertrichosis (one), or acneiform papules (two) in participants treated with clobetasol propionate. <LINK REF="STD-Kathuria-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Kathuria 2012</LINK> reported burning (one case), mild pruritus (two cases), dryness (one case), mild erythema (two cases), atrophy (two cases), telangiectasia (two cases) and acneiform lesions (three cases) in participants treated with 0.05% fluticasone propionate. <LINK REF="STD-K_x00f6_se-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Köse 2010</LINK> reported atrophy (two cases), telangiectasia (two cases) and erythema (one case) in participants treated with 0.1% mometasone furoate. <LINK REF="STD-Lepe-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lepe 2003</LINK> also reported atrophy (three cases) and telangiectasia (two) in participants after treatment with clobetasol. <LINK REF="STD-Kumaran-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kumaran 2006</LINK> reported side effects in seven participants treated with betamethasone, including lesional atrophy, soreness, and hypertrichosis. One participant treated with a combination of betamethasone plus calcipotriol had hypertrichosis and another had dry skin in the lesions. <LINK REF="STD-Wazir-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wazir 2010</LINK> reported that there were no adverse events in participants treated with topical 0.01% mometasone furoate, either as monotherapy or in combination with topical 0.03% tacrolimus.  <LINK REF="STD-Westerhof-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Westerhof 1999</LINK> detected no evidence of dermal or epidermal atrophy on skin biopsy in participants treated with fluticasone propionate. <LINK REF="STD-Yaghoobi-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Yaghoobi 2011</LINK> reported only data for adverse events related to oral zinc but not to the topical steroid used by participants.</P>
<P>Of the studies examining effects of combination therapies, <LINK REF="STD-Barman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barman 2004</LINK> compared the effect of applying a topical corticosteroid (0.1% fluocinolone acetonide) after punch grafting with the use of PUVA therapy after punch grafting. Cobblestoning, depigmentation of the grafts, infection, and graft displacement were seen in some participants in both of the groups. <LINK REF="STD-Bayoumi-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bayoumi 2012</LINK> compared hydrocortisone butyrate and NB-UVB with the same combination after laser dermabrasion. The only adverse events seen were attributable to dermabrasion (oedema and hypertrophic scarring). <LINK REF="STD-Lim_x002d_Ong-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lim-Ong 2005</LINK> reported adverse effects of vesicles, acneiform eruptions, hypertrichosis, and striae in some participants treated with betamethasone plus NB-UVB. <LINK REF="STD-Agarwal-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Agarwal 2005</LINK> (see Section 2: Oral therapies) reported local atrophy and telangiectasia in participants from both intervention groups and acneiform lesions in one participant in the mometasone plus levamisole group. (These adverse effects were attributable to topical mometasone, not levamisole, so we have listed them here, rather than in Section 2: Oral therapies.) <LINK REF="STD-Sassi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sassi 2008</LINK> reported hyperpigmentation in some participants receiving combination treatment with hydrocortisone-17-butyrate plus laser, although this was also seen in participants receiving only laser treatment.</P>
<P>Two studies assessing the effect of topical corticosteroids mentioned adverse events but did not address any other outcomes of interest in this review. <LINK REF="STD-Kandil-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Kandil 1974</LINK> compared betamethasone valerate in 50% isopropyl alcohol versus the alcohol base alone. Adverse effects attributed to betamethasone valerate included hypertrichosis in two participants and a localised acneiform eruption in three participants. <LINK REF="STD-Sanclemente-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sanclemente 2008</LINK> compared twice daily application of betamethasone with a topical catalase/dismutase superoxide.

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Lim_x002d_Ong-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lim-Ong 2005</LINK> was the only study to assess the ability of interventions to halt the spread of vitiligo. It assessed the effect of topical clobetasol propionate plus NB-UVB versus placebo plus NB-UVB on vitiligo disease activity by comparing pre- and post-treatment vitiligo disease activity (VIDA) scores and permanence of repigmentation and development of new lesions within one year post-treatment, as documented by photographs. We did not perform analyses as the study used a within-participant design. Repigmentation in the majority of participants (15/20, 75%) was maintained in both treatment arms within one year post-treatment but eight of the participants developed new lesions on both sides within that time.</P>

<P>Adverse effects were reported in eight studies.<BR/>In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Barman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barman 2004</LINK>, cobblestoning, depigmentation of the grafts, infection, and graft displacement were the important side effects seen in some participants in both the groups.</P>
<P>The only adverse effect reported in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Radmanesh-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Radmanesh 2006</LINK>, was gastric upset in two participants from the PUVA plus azathioprine group. This adverse effect could be attributable to either psoralen or azathioprine.</P>
<P>In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Bhatnagar-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bhatnagar 2007</LINK>, herpes labialis was found in four participants from the NB-UVB group; mild to moderate itching was found in three from the NB-UVB group and four from the PUVA group; acute urticaria and symptomatic dermographism was found in one participant from the NB-UVB group. Sedation, xerosis, exacerbation of acne lesions, and nausea were only observed in the PUVA group, three participants experienced each of these side effects, except for nausea which was observed in two participants.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Yones-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Yones 2007</LINK> reported erythema in 24 participants from the psoralen plus UVA (PUVA) group. Nausea was observed in eight participants treated with PUVA and who switched from 8-MOP to 5-MOP during the study because of nausea.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Sapam-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Sapam 2012</LINK> reported that adverse effects were more common in the PUVA group (57.2%) than the NB-UVB group (7.4%).

<P>There were several comparisons of different psoralen compounds combined with exposure to sunlight which were all based in data from one study (<LINK REF="STD-Pathak-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Pathak 1984</LINK>). There was no difference between 8-MOP plus TMP versus placebo RR 12.05, 95% CI 0.75 to 194.88 <LINK REF="CMP-019.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 19.1</LINK>; or between any doses of TMP and either placebo or other treatments <LINK REF="CMP-020.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 20.1</LINK>. When PUVAsol was compared to other treatments or placebo, only the comparisons in favour of 8-MOP at any dose (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.94) and compared to 8-MOP plus TMP at any dose (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.87) were statistically significant <LINK REF="CMP-021.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 21.1</LINK>. Comparison of 8-MOP at any dose versus other treatments or placebo was only statistically significant for 8-MOP versus psoralen (RR 2.50, 95% CI 1.06 to 5.91) <LINK REF="CMP-022.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 22.1</LINK> (please note that this comparison is the same as shown in RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.94, <LINK REF="CMP-021.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 21.1</LINK> where the intervention groups have been reversed, but repigmentation is better in the 8-MOP group. These results are based on numbers followed up as there is no indication in the trial data of the number randomised to each group.

</P>
<P>In another study (<LINK REF="STD-Ruiz_x002d_Maldonado-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Ruiz-Maldonado 1975</LINK>), there were no side effects in the placebo group. However, in the TMP group one participant had severe pruritus, one had hyperpigmentation of the uninvolved skin, and two of those who used the sun lamp had blisters due to overexposure by the parents. There was no evidence of liver or blood toxicity in either group.</P>
<P>In the study by (<LINK REF="STD-Parsad-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Parsad 1998</LINK>), three participants complained of mild irritation on applying calcipotriol.

However, the investigators did not report their data in such a way that allowed for it to be included in a forest plot, therefore we can only report results as P values taken directly from the text.<BR/>

<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Tegta-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tegta 2006</LINK> study, using the Fisher's Exact test, the proportion of participants achieving more than 75% repigmentation was significantly greater in those who had skin grafts a third of the size of the recipient area compared to participants who had skin grafts only a fifth of the size of the recipient (P = 0.03, Fisher's Exact test). Please note, caution must be used in interpreting the risk ratio and its 95% CI presented in the forest plot due to the small number of events in the intervention groups (RR 11.00, 95% CI 0.69 to 175.86, <LINK REF="CMP-027.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 27.1</LINK>).</P>

However, scarring at the donor site was only observed in those participants whose melanocytes were suspended in normal saline (two cases). Erythema (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Geel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Van Geel 2004</LINK>) was observed in all test lesions during the first two weeks, changing to a pink colour that persisted for a maximum of one month. In the <LINK REF="STD-Ghosh-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ghosh 2012</LINK> study a total of four adverse effects (pyrexia, nasopharyngitis, foot fracture and heat rash) were reported in one participant in each group.

<P>In this update, 39 new studies were retrieved from the literature search, giving a total of 96 studies. Over half of the new studies assessed new interventions, most of which were new combination therapies. New topical interventions included topical anti-oxidant gel containing pseudocatalase, superoxide, glutathione, coenzyme Q10, carotenoids, vitamins A, E, C, and selenium, antioxidant plus mitochondrial stimulating cream (<LINK REF="STD-Galarza-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Galarza 2009</LINK>) and tetrahydrocurcuminoid cream (<LINK REF="STD-Asawanonda-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Asawanonda 2010</LINK>). In terms of oral interventions, two new studies (<LINK REF="STD-Elgoweini-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Elgoweini 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nistico-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Nistico 2012</LINK>) examined the use of oral vitamin E. New light therapies consisted of oral psoralen plus narrowband ultraviolet B light (P-NB-UVB) (<LINK REF="STD-Bansal-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bansal 2013</LINK>), Helium Neon laser (<LINK REF="STD-de-Macedo-2012" TYPE="STUDY">de Macedo 2012</LINK>), broadband ultraviolet A light (BB-UVA) (<LINK REF="STD-El-Mofty-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">El Mofty 2013a</LINK>) and broadband ultraviolet B light (BB-UVB) (<LINK REF="STD-El-Mofty-2013b" TYPE="STUDY">El Mofty 2013b</LINK>).</P>
<P>New combination treatments included topical treatments such as pseudocatalase cream in combination with NB-UVB (<LINK REF="STD-Bakis_x002d_Petsoglou-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Bakis-Petsoglou 2009</LINK>), pimecrolimus in combination with 308-nm excimer laser (<LINK REF="STD-Hui_x002d_Lan-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hui-Lan 2009</LINK>), tacrolimus cream in combination with NB-UVB light (<LINK REF="STD-Nordal-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Nordal 2011</LINK>), topical clobetasol propionate cream in combination with oral zinc sulphate (<LINK REF="STD-Yaghoobi-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Yaghoobi 2011</LINK>), superoxide dismutase combined with catalase (<LINK REF="STD-Paracha-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Paracha 2010</LINK>) and topical tacalcitol combined with 308-nm xenon chloride excimer laser (<LINK REF="STD-Oh-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Oh 2011</LINK>). In terms of new combination light therapies, <LINK REF="STD-Mohaghegh-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Mohaghegh 2012</LINK> used needling plus NB-UVB. New surgical interventions included dermabrasion (<LINK REF="STD-Bayoumi-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bayoumi 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Farajzadeh-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Farajzadeh 2009</LINK>) and ablative fractional CO2 laser (<LINK REF="STD-Shin-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Shin 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Light therapy remains the most common intervention assessed in this update, either as monotherapy or in combination with other treatments. Sixty-five studies of various types of light therapies were assessed in total. Twenty-seven were new studies and 38 were from the previous two versions of the review. This update has shown a considerable increase in the number of studies assessing NB-UVB either as monotherapy or in combination with other therapies (35 in total, 18 from this update, 17 from previous versions). Two studies assessed Helium Neon (HeNe) laser. One in combination with surgical techniques (<LINK REF="STD-Wind-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Wind 2011</LINK>) compared punch grafts alone or combined with UVB, NB-UVB or HeNe laser, and the other as monotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-de-Macedo-2012" TYPE="STUDY">de Macedo 2012</LINK>) compared HeNe laser with 290-320nm UVB fluorescent lamp.</P>
<P>There was also a notable increase in the number of studies assessing surgical interventions for stable vitiligo as well as topical calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus and pimecrolimus) in this update, perhaps reflecting a tendency to use these agents in place of topical corticosteroids, for which the concern about adverse effects may be greater.</P>
<P>We found no studies on camouflage, depigmentation, or psychological interventions in the updated search.</P>
<P>We have not produced a 'Summary of findings' table due to the large number of studies, the complexity of the interventions and the predominance of the intra-participant design.</P>

Only one of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Papadopoulos-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Papadopoulos 2004</LINK>), which assessed psychological interventions, reported quality of life as their primary outcome measure. The only study where investigators found a statistically significant result for this outcome was <LINK REF="STD-Sahni-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Sahni 2011</LINK>, which showed a result in favour of melanocyte suspension suspended in the patient's own serum, compared to suspension in normal saline.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Percentage of repigmentation &gt; 75%</HEADING>
<P>Twenty-five of the new studies in this update assessed the primary outcome of &gt;75% repigmentation. However, not all of the studies used objective methods of scoring repigmentation and thus we were unable to analyse the data on many occasions.</P>
<P>In the previous version of this review, analyses of 15 studies showed statistically significant differences in the proportion of participants achieving &gt;75% repigmentation and these were predominately combination interventions that included some form of light treatment and also included intra-participant studies.</P>
<P>In this update we found only eight studies achieving statistically significant increased risks of repigmentation as we were more specific about &gt;75% repigmentation.

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>Most of the studies included in the updated search assessed adverse effects (33/39 new studies; 84%). Most studies examining topical corticosteroids reported adverse effects including folliculitis, burning, mild pruritus, dryness, mild erythema, atrophy, telangiectasia and acneiform lesions. <LINK REF="STD-Wazir-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wazir 2010</LINK>, however, reported no adverse effects in participants treated with 0.01% mometasone furoate. Similarly, <LINK REF="STD-Bayoumi-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bayoumi 2012</LINK> reported no adverse effects with hydrocortisone butyrate.</P>
<P>Adverse effects of topical tacalcitol included itching, transient erythema, desquamation and contact dermatitis at the site of application. Most studies that examined the use of topical calcineurin inhibitors used 0.1% tacrolimus ointment and the main adverse effects reported were a burning sensation, pruritus, erythema, atrophy and facial flushing after alcohol intake. <LINK REF="STD-K_x00f6_se-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Köse 2010</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Stinco-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Stinco 2009</LINK> used 1% pimecrolimus and similar adverse effects were reported. No adverse effects were reported in the studies that looked at pseudocatalase, except for <LINK REF="STD-Bakis_x002d_Petsoglou-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Bakis-Petsoglou 2009</LINK> who reported some adverse effects although it is not clear if this was in the placebo or pseudocatalase group. <LINK REF="STD-Asawanonda-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Asawanonda 2010</LINK> reported similar rates of adverse effects in participants treated with tetrahydrocurcuminoid cream and NB-UVB to those treated with NB-UVB alone.</P>
<P>With regard to oral therapies, both studies which looked at vitamin E supplementation in combination with other therapies reported lower frequencies of side effects in the vitamin E supplementation group.</P>
<P>In terms of light therapy, new PUVA studies reported adverse effects similar to those previously reported such as erythema, pruritus, nausea, dizziness and thickening of the skin. <LINK REF="STD-Sapam-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Sapam 2012</LINK> reported that adverse effects were more common in the PUVA group in comparison to the NB-UVB group and two participants in this study discontinued oral PUVA therapy due to severe dizziness. Similar adverse effects were reported with BB-UVA, particularly with low-dose BB-UVA, which included itching, burning, erythema and thickening of the skin. With regard to NB-UVB, phototoxic reaction and Koebnerisation have been reported as well as transient itching and dryness of the skin in several older studies. <LINK REF="STD-Bansal-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bansal 2013</LINK> assessed oral psoralen with NB-UVB (P-NB-UVB) versus NB-UVB alone. Nausea was reported in the P-NB-UVB group, and a phototoxic reaction, depigmentation and hyperpigmentation in both groups. Curiously, a meta-analysis of adverse events showed a significantly greater risk of nausea for NB-UVB than for PUVA (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.69). This is unexpected, as the addition of psoralen is expected to cause nausea in some people but NB-UVB does not characteristically produce nausea.</P>
<P>Surgical interventions such as punch grafts or minigrafts sometimes led to adverse effects such as cobblestoning, scarring, graft depigmentation, and graft displacement. Suction blister grafts or split skin grafts led mainly to the Koebner phenomenon, which, because it triggers new vitiligo lesions as a result of damage to the skin, is of major clinical importance. It can also cause hypopigmentation, or, to a lesser extent, hyperpigmentation, scarring, and infection at both donor and recipient sites. In the <LINK REF="STD-Sahni-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Sahni 2011</LINK> study, a halo phenomenon, infection at the recipient site and hyperpigmentation were observed in both treatment groups. Scarring at the donor site was only observed where melanocytes were suspended in normal saline, although the scarring is unlikely to be related to the suspension process and this difference between groups was probably due to the small numbers of participants.</P>
<P>With regard to dermabrasion, delayed healing, oedema and hypertrophic scars have been reported as well as a mild burning sensation reported with microdermabrasion. Purpura was reported as an adverse effect of needling, although this cleared rapidly. All participants undergoing fractional CO2 laser reported pain and burning sensation during laser treatment, and erythema or oedema after laser treatment.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-02-18 14:24:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Most of the studies in this review update have small numbers of participants, due mainly to the large numbers of intra-participant studies (40/96, 42%), of which 14 (35%) are surgical studies. The smallest number of participants in any study was six (<LINK REF="STD-Wind-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Wind 2011</LINK>) and the largest was 596 (<LINK REF="STD-Pathak-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Pathak 1984</LINK>). As with the original review, the majority of studies differ greatly in the ways in which vitiligo is measured and in the myriad combination interventions assessed. As a result, with the exception of one meta-analysis, it was not possible to pool data and so we have had to report the data from individual studies. As well as these data being harder to digest, it is difficult to make any firm inferences from them in respect of recommendations for clinical practice. With regard to the studies with an intra-participant design, it was not possible to calculate the appropriate test statistic for many of these studies because of inadequate data, so we made the decision that to describe them narratively was not going to be of value in such a huge review as these studies are unlikely to be pivotal</P>
<P>In the last review update, we suggested that, given the impact vitiligo has on quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Ongenae-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ongenae 2005a</LINK>), patient-centred outcomes should be incorporated into the study design.  More studies in this review update addressed the primary outcome of patient-rated quality of life. However, such studies are still in a minority; just over 9% (9/96) studies (<LINK REF="STD-Akdeniz-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Akdeniz 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Agarwal-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Agarwal 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Budania-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Budania 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Middelkamp_x002d_Hup-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Middelkamp-Hup 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Papadopoulos-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Papadopoulos 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sahni-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Sahni 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sassi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sassi 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singh-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yones-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Yones 2007</LINK>) addressed this and in only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Papadopoulos-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Papadopoulos 2004</LINK>) was this a primary outcome. Successful treatment as measured by more than 75% repigmentation in affected areas of skin, which was another primary outcome, was assessed in 56% (54/96) of the studies. Five further studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bakis_x002d_Petsoglou-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Bakis-Petsoglou 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-El-Mofty-2013b" TYPE="STUDY">El Mofty 2013b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Zawahry-2012" TYPE="STUDY">El-Zawahry 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kandil-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Kandil 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leone-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Leone 2006</LINK>) reported numbers of participants achieving higher percentages of repigmentation than 75%, but it was not possible to determine the number of participants achieving 75% repigmentation, so data from these studies were not included in our analyses. More than 67% (65/96) of the studies assessed our final primary outcome (adverse effects).</P>
<P>Some studies did not specify greater than 75% repigmentation as an outcome measure, but instead assessed higher levels of repigmentation, whilst others considered greater than 50% repigmentation to be a good response.  It is difficult to know precisely what constitutes a &#8216;good&#8217; or &#8216;successful&#8217; response, especially from the patient&#8217;s perspective. Arbitrary cut-offs such as 75% have traditionally been used, but it is questionable as to whether this is really meaningful for people with vitiligo. Work to develop patient-rated outcome measures is a priority for ongoing vitiligo research.</P>
<P>Of our secondary outcomes, cessation of spread of vitiligo or stabilisation of the disease, was only reported in 6% (6/96) of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Agarwal-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Agarwal 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barman 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dawid-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Dawid 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lim_x002d_Ong-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lim-Ong 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Parsad-2003b" TYPE="STUDY">Parsad 2003b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Siddiqui-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Siddiqui 1994</LINK>), all of which were in the last update, so no new studies addressed this outcome. Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Wind-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Wind 2011</LINK>) assessed permanence of repigmentation after treatment, but only after one year follow-up and the data were presented in a manner such that they could not be interpreted.</P>
<P>In the case of natural phototherapy or sun exposure, variable factors including the compliance of the participant, the degree of exposure, and the country where the trial is conducted, can limit the interpretation and applicability of results. On the other hand, more reliable forms of light therapy such as UV devices are not always accessible or feasible, especially in developing countries.</P>
<P>The majority of studies included participants with symmetrical vitiligo but only one (<LINK REF="STD-Kathuria-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Kathuria 2012</LINK>) included participants with only segmental vitiligo. Sixteen studies included participants with any type of vitiligo. Only seven studies were carried out specifically on children (<LINK REF="STD-Farajzadeh-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Farajzadeh 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ho-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hui_x002d_Lan-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hui-Lan 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khalid-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Khalid 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-K_x00f6_se-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Köse 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lepe-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lepe 2003</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Ruiz_x002d_Maldonado-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Ruiz-Maldonado 1975</LINK>), despite the fact that the onset of vitiligo before the age of 20 has been observed in a large proportion of the population (<LINK REF="REF-Lindhorst-Homan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindhorst Homan 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>A large number of studies (40) used an intra-participant design, 14 (35%) of them were surgical studies. This design can have implications for the applicability of findings, especially for topical interventions, as it is not always possible to exclude systemic effects of different interventions used within the same participant.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-02-18 17:14:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M  Delamere">
<P>Overall, the quality of the studies included in this review was very mixed. Since the last update of the review published in 2010, there has been a further increase in the number of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing interventions for vitiligo. There has also been a small but noticeable improvement in the quality of the design of some of the more recent studies, although the methodological quality of studies is still highly variable. Awareness of the importance of good reporting of trials, such as that proposed in the CONSORT statement (<LINK REF="REF-Begg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begg 1996</LINK>), is increasing, and this is reflected in the quality of reporting in a few, but by no means all, of the studies in this updated review.</P>
<P>Regarding the quality of methodology and reporting, adequate randomisation was reported in 61% (59/96) of the included studies, which is slightly better than for the last update (56%). Nearly 18% (17/96) reported allocation concealment adequately (fewer than for the last update; 21%). Participants were blinded in nearly 20% (19/96) of the studies; clinicians were blinded in nearly 18% (17/96) of the studies and independent assessors were blinded in 39% (38/96) of the studies. In some studies, blinding was not always possible due to the nature of some of the interventions (e.g. surgical interventions) and the intra-participant design of many of the studies could make blinding difficult. However, other aspects of study quality were very good.</P>
<P>The majority of trials reported dropouts of less than 10%, and only two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Pathak-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Pathak 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sharquie-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sharquie 2005</LINK>) reported more than 50% dropouts. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed in 43% (41/96) of the studies. However, only 10 of these studies reported dropouts, and the other 31 were intention-to-treat &#8216;by default&#8217;.</P>
<P>We found five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bakis_x002d_Petsoglou-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Bakis-Petsoglou 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ho-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mehrabi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Mehrabi 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanclemente-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sanclemente 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Geel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Van Geel 2004</LINK>) of high quality that described randomisation, allocation concealment, blinding, and ITT adequately and were judged at low risk of bias for all these domains.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-01-20 16:52:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M  Delamere">
<P>For the new studies in this review update, if the method of randomisation was unclear we tried to seek clarification from the study authors. In the original review, all studies that were described as randomised were accepted as such. If the methods of randomisation were unclear, this was simply recorded but no further clarification was sought. This could potentially introduce some bias into the review process.</P>
<P>This review aimed to provide comprehensive evidence on all interventions, including non-conventional medicines such as Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), for treating vitiligo. However, we did not specifically search Chinese bibliographic databases to identify such studies. As a result, we may have missed relevant studies assessing interventions such as TCM.</P>
<P>There are some other limitations of this review: We were not able to assess for publication bias, due to the small number of studies assessing similar interventions. We also did not assess sources of funding for individual studies, which can have implications for the risk of bias in the studies that we have included.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-02-18 14:24:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>A systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Wu-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2009</LINK>) which looked at the safety and efficacy of topical calcineurin inhibitors (pimecrolimus and tacrolimus) in the treatment of vitiligo, concluded that a combination of tacrolimus and monochromatic excimer light (MEL) could improve the efficacy of vitiligo treatment. It also reported that the combination of pimecrolimus and MEL shortens the number of treatments needed to initiate repigmentation and works better on the face. We are unable to support these findings, as our Cochrane review, which identified studies assessing these interventions, and many more studies and types of interventions, had limited evidence of effect for any intervention.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Szczurko-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Szczurko 2008</LINK> assessed natural health products such as vitamins, herbs, and other supplements for the treatment of vitiligo, and included 15 randomised or non-randomised controlled studies. In common with our review, the studies were of poor methodological quality and the authors did not pool data for meta-analysis due to the number of different outcome measurements and quality of reporting, although L-phenylalanine combined with phototherapy and oral <I>Ginkgo biloba </I>monotherapy were potentially promising interventions. Our review update found evidence of benefit from G<I>ingko biloba</I> but we would be cautious about making any firm inferences from this single study (<LINK REF="STD-Parsad-2003b" TYPE="STUDY">Parsad 2003b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Another systematic review of studies retrieved from searches of nine databases between 1990 and 2010, (<LINK REF="REF-Chan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 2012</LINK>) reported the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions on the quality of life of vitiligo patients. All treatments that improved physical appearance by repigmentation or directly addressed psychological distress improved the quality of life of patients to some degree. However, the authors concluded that current interventions alone were not successful in addressing all the quality of life challenges faced by people with vitiligo. We can concur with this finding as the majority of studies do not really assess this important outcome adequately, if at all.</P>
<P>A systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Eleftheriadou-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eleftheriadou 2012</LINK>) of the outcome measures used in RCTs was compared with outcomes suggested by patients and clinicians used in vitiligo trials. Repigmentation was assessed in 96% of the studies but 48 different scales were used to measure it. The most important outcome for patients and clinicians was cosmetically acceptable repigmentation (rather than percentage of repigmentation) (68%), followed by cessation of spread of vitiligo (15%), quality of life (8%) and maintenance of repigmentation (4%). There is a lack of consensus on core outcome measures and <LINK REF="REF-Vrijman-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vrijman 2012</LINK> in a systematic review, recommended an e-Delphi approach to agree on terminology, and to define core outcome domains which should enable easier comparisons between studies.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Mulekar-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mulekar 2013</LINK> conducted a systematic review of surgical therapies for vitiligo and included searches of PubMed, MEDLINE and Cochrane databases. Split thickness skin grafts had the highest repigmentation success rate but more RCTs of surgical interventions for vitiligo as well as a standardised objective method of assessing repigmentation are needed.</P>
<P>A more recent systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Xiao-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xiao 2014</LINK>) assessed seven studies of combinations of NB-UVB with other treatments in the intervention groups and the control groups. The authors concluded that "NB-UVB showed equivalent efficacies to UVA, PUVA or 308-nm EL control in the treatment of vitiligo. Side effects of NB-UVB were acceptable. More RCTs were needed to validate the results." Although we cannot support these findings, the evidence from our review suggests that combination therapies, particularly those involving some form of light, are superior to monotherapies.</P>
<P>The other reviews and studies we found are broadly in agreement with our findings, particularly those statements concerning the effectiveness of any intervention for vitiligo, the need for better quality of study design and reporting, and in particular, the use of patient-important standardised outcome measures.</P>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-02-18 14:39:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-02-18 14:39:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Although some consensus exists among researchers as to the causes of vitiligo, there is still a wide variety of theories and so the trials performed in recent years examine a wide range of interventions. It is important to stress that, at present, there is neither a cure for vitiligo nor an effective method of limiting the spread of the disease. Current treatment practices tend to centre on whatever theory is believed to be the most important while newer, more controversial ideas take time to become established. The small numbers of participants and heterogeneity of design of the studies in this review makes it difficult to make firm statements regarding recommendations for clinical practice.</P>
<P>The ever-expanding range of interventions being assessed in vitiligo randomised controlled trials (RCTs) is perhaps a reflection of the fact that there are still no interventions which are obviously superior to others. Of the interventions intended to induce repigmentation, we found low-quality RCT evidence for a number of different interventions that produce a varying degree of repigmentation of unknown long-term permanence.</P>
<P>There is moderate evidence for the use of topical corticosteroids, although long-term use is likely to lead to adverse effects. When used as monotherapy, it may be preferable to use superpotent preparations to give a better chance of therapeutic response, but close monitoring for adverse effects will be necessary. The topical immunomodulator, tacrolimus, seems to be a reasonable alternative to topical corticosteroids, particularly on anatomical sites where there may be a higher risk of adverse effects with topical corticosteroids. Although clinical advice has usually been to exercise caution when combining topical immunomodulators with light therapies, due to the theoretical long-term risk of skin cancer, these combinations may have benefit if used under close medical supervision.</P>
<P>In general, combination interventions were superior to monotherapies; the majority of analyses giving significant results were in favour of various combination treatments. Most of the studies that assessed combination interventions employed light therapies (UVA, PUVA, or UVB, particularly NB-UVB) and laser light therapies. Our search uncovered limited to moderate evidence for various types and regimens of light therapy (UVA and UVB) used alone or in combination with psoralens, topical corticosteroids, vitamin D analogues, 5-fluorouracil, azathioprine, and oral prednisolone, although adverse effects were common with the latter. There is some evidence that excimer laser is more effective in combination with topical interventions such as hydrocortisone 17-butyrate, tacrolimus, or tacalcitol. There is also limited evidence for the benefit of oral <I>Ginkgo biloba</I>, and split thickness skin grafts plus PUVAsol. Surgical therapies can be effective for small areas in people with stable disease. Clinicians should bear in mind that suction blister grafts may result in adverse effects, the most significant of which is precipitation of new areas of vitiligo at donor sites, due to the Koebner phenomenon. Autologous transplantation of melanocytes is a promising novel therapy, giving superior cosmetic results compared to more conventional surgical therapies, but access to this treatment may be limited.</P>
<P>Although there is empirical evidence in the literature to support the use of cosmetic camouflage to improve the quality of life of people with vitiligo, we found no trials of this intervention. Depigmentation is sometimes used in severe cases of vitiligo but we found no RCTs of this intervention either. There may also be some people who require more in-depth psychological support. As with the previous update, we found only one RCT comparing the use of cognitive-behavioural therapy and person-centred approaches and this study found little support for any particular psychological intervention; we could not perform statistical analysis of the study data. As things stand, although there is limited evidence for this kind of intervention anecdotal evidence strongly suggests that a form of psychological intervention or support could be of benefit to some individuals.</P>
<P>Although vitiligo commonly presents before the age of 20 years, only seven of the 96 included studies looked specifically at interventions for vitiligo in children. The remainder of the studies either included adults alone or had no specified age. Treatment in children is limited by compliance, tolerance of treatment and concerns regarding long-term side effects. None of the studies had long-term follow-up beyond two years. These seven studies looked at a range of interventions including topical treatments such as tacrolimus and corticosteroids, NB-UVB, PUVA, 308-nm excimer laser and dermabrasion. Stigmatisation can be a particular problem in children with vitiligo and treatment options beyond topical therapies should be explored after a discussion regarding side effects, effectiveness and impact on quality of life. Although further evidence is required, psychological and cosmetic interventions may be of particular benefit in this population of patients.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-02-18 14:25:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Since the original review was carried out in 2006, there has been a rapid increase in the number of clinical trials, particularly randomised controlled trials, assessing interventions for vitiligo. However, it is still not clear which are the best interventions for this condition. Until the causes of vitiligo are better understood, treatments will continue to be based on the many theories that exist for this disease. Although there has been a noticeable increase in basic scientific research, more investment is needed so that new discoveries in experimental models can be systematically advanced to preclinical and clinical stages.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Standardised methodologies for describing and classifying vitiligo and for assessing the effect of interventions need to be developed and used by trial investigators. The establishment of a Vitiligo European Task Force (VETF; <LINK REF="REF-Ta_x00ef_eb-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taïeb 2007</LINK>) is an important step in this direction and the work of this group should hopefully lead to studies measuring repigmentation in a more standardised way. However, many studies still use their own measures, so the work of the VETF group needs to be disseminated as widely as possible.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>There is also a general need for better quality RCTs of treatments for vitiligo. Overall, it seems that there has been only a slight improvement in the quality of the methodology of RCTs since the last update of this review (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>), and since the publication of the "Guidelines for Designing and Reporting Clinical Trials in Vitiligo" (<LINK REF="REF-Gonz_x00e1_lez-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">González 2011</LINK>), which were based on the last update.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Specific recommendations from the "Guidelines for Designing and Reporting Clinical Trials in Vitiligo" (<LINK REF="REF-Gonz_x00e1_lez-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">González 2011</LINK>), which should be followed in order to ensure the best design and reporting of any future vitiligo trials, include the following.</LI>
</UL>
<OL>
<LI>Participants: Clear description of inclusion and exclusion criteria; clear description of baseline characteristics of participants; clear description of study setting.</LI>
<LI>Interventions: Adequate description of intervention(s); adequate choice and description of control group; adherence to treatment should be measurable and reported.</LI>
<LI>Outcomes: Adequate follow-up (at least one year) and frequency of data recording; standardised definition of treatment effect and measurement scales; clear definition of primary, patient-centred outcomes, including quality of life measured using a validated tool and percentage repigmentation; clear definition of secondary outcomes, including cessation of spread or stabilisation of the disease and long-term permanence of repigmentation. (There is currently an international group developing an agreed set of core outcomes for vitiligo trials, as part of the COMET initiative.)</LI>
<LI>Study design: Adequate generation of randomisation sequence and concealment; detailed description of methodology of blinding of assessors and participants; calculation of sample size; clear reporting of losses to follow-up and analysis of the total number of randomised participants.</LI>
<LI>Data reporting: should follow CONSORT reporting guidelines.</LI>
</OL>
<UL>
<LI>Study design should take into account variations in participant features, including skin colour, age or duration of the disease, extent and type of vitiligo, as well as the site of affected areas. These factors may determine the applicability of results in particular clinical settings and may cause the response to treatment to vary. There should also be larger, multi-centre studies and fewer intra-participant studies to allow comparison and meta-analysis.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Melanocytes are slow to grow and develop, so in order to properly assess the efficacy of an intervention, interventions should ideally be continued for long enough to allow complete repigmentation; this may need to be at least six months and possibly up to a year.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Cessation of spread of vitiligo and long-term permanence of repigmentation are very important outcome measures for people with vitiligo. Future studies should include these outcomes and should ideally include at least two-years' follow-up of participants.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Patient-rated outcome measures (especially measures of treatment success) should be incorporated into the design of future studies. Further work is needed to develop and validate suitable outcome measures that are meaningful to patients (<LINK REF="REF-Eleftheriadou-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eleftheriadou 2012</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>The inclusion of health-related quality of life measures such as the VitiQOL scale and the Dermatology Life Quality Index would not only improve the relevance of trials but could allow comparison between trials using different interventions.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>More studies are needed to establish the dosage, safety, and long-term efficacy of NB-UVB monotherapy in treating vitiligo. In particular, the possibility of long-term skin damage and possible skin cancer following prolonged UV treatment for vitiligo needs to be researched.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Topical tacrolimus appears to have a similar effect to topical corticosteroids, but with a better safety profile (<LINK REF="STD-Ho-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 2011</LINK>). More studies are needed to establish it as a viable, cost-effective alternative, particularly in combination with other interventions (e.g. light therapies).</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Larger studies are needed in order to provide stronger evidence for the many combination interventions that have shown promise in treating vitiligo. Because vitiligo is a disease affecting pigment cells, the use of some form of phototherapy may be necessary in order for these cells to proliferate and develop, thus giving faster repigmentation. Combination therapy may therefore be more desirable from both a clinician and participant point of view.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Although there are some studies of complementary or psychological interventions at present, a greater number of well-conducted RCTs in these areas would provide more useful evidence for their efficacy. Psychological interventions are particularly important in view of the fact that the main symptoms of vitiligo are not physical but psychosocial.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Studies are needed on the use of cosmetic camouflage, which is often recommended with no other treatment. Although it helps to disguise the condition and can give some degree of self-confidence, it cannot be used on large affected areas of skin and has to be reapplied frequently. It can also create anxiety in those whose vitiligo is actively spreading. There is no good evidence to show that cosmetic camouflage improves the quality of life of people with vitiligo in the long term.</LI>

<P>Jonathan Batchelor: "I was an investigator on the HI-Light Pilot RCT, assessing hand-held NB-UVB units for early, focal vitiligo. I am Chief Investigator for the main HI-Light Trial (started recruiting in 2015), which will assess the combination of hand-held NB-UVB units and topical mometasone furoate ointment. I have attended or lectured at educational events that were partly or fully funded by sponsorship from a number of pharmaceutical companies that produce topical treatments that can be used to treat vitiligo. These companies include Astellas, Dermal, Galderma, Leo, Pfizer, and Stiefel (a GSK company)."<BR/>Dr Viktoria Eleftheriadou: "I conducted and led a pilot HI-Light trial for home phototherapy for vitiligo in 2012, as part of my PhD funded by the NIHR. This trial is now published. In addition, I am also a co-applicant on a successful NIHR grant application for the conduct of a national trial on home phototherapy for vitiligo (HI-Light trial). This trial is currently in preparation."<BR/>Maxine Whitton: "I was involved in the HI-Light pilot trial and am currently involved in the multicentre trial assessing hand-held NB-UVB devices combined with topical corticosteroid for early onset vitiligo."<BR/>Mariona Pinart: nothing to declare.<BR/>Khaled Ezzedine: nothing to declare.<BR/>Jo Leonardi-Bee: nothing to declare.<BR/>Zainab Jiyad: nothing to declare.<BR/>Urbà González: nothing to declare.<BR/>Clinical referee, Dr Mauro Picardo: "I am the author of two papers reported in the review."</P>

<PRO_REV_DIFF MODIFIED="2015-02-24 09:58:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Laura E Prescott">
<P>In the original review we clarified the objectives, the studies, and the participant groups that we had stated in the published protocol. In terms of outcome measures, in the protocol we had divided these into patient-rated, doctor-rated, and adverse effects. In the review these were classified as primary and secondary outcomes.</P>
<P>Other changes in this updated review include the following.</P>
<UL>
<LI>We have incorporated new information into the background section; and have now added objective measures to the primary outcome of 'quality of life' and to repigmentation from a clinical perspective. We have also limited the repigmentation to &gt; 75% because anything less than that is likely to be visually still disfiguring from the patient perspective. In order to be consistent and objective in our assessments we have also defined our criteria for &gt; 75% repigmentation as follows: 75%, &gt; 75%, &#8805; 75%, 75% to 90%/100% or 76% to 90%/100%</LI>
<LI>We have transferred adverse events from secondary outcomes to primary outcomes.</LI>
<LI>We have removed depigmentation because it is rarely offered as a treatment.</LI>
<LI>We have added cessation of spread as a secondary outcome because of its importance to clinicians as well as to people with vitiligo, and have subdivided this outcome into 'no increase in size of lesions' and 'no new lesions', both within a period of a) less than one year or b) one year or more.</LI>
<LI>We have calculated P values using Fisher's Exact test where small numbers of events were seen in the intervention groups.</LI>
<LI>Where it was not possible to perform a meta-analysis, we summarised the data for each trial and have only presented forest plots for primary outcome measures.</LI>
</UL>
<P>In the original protocol and review we considered outcomes from a participant and clinical perspective. However, in this updated review we have decided to omit patient-rated repigmentation because this could not be measured objectively.</P>

This suspension was loaded in a tuberculin syringe attached to an 18-G needle. On the next day, the recipient vitiliginous area in both groups was anaesthetised by infiltrating 2% lignocaine. It was then manually dermabraded using manual dermabraders until uniform pinpoint bleeding was observed. The melanocyte suspension was uniformly spread onto the dermabraded area (using a tuberculin syringe and 18-G needle) and covered using a multilayered dressing. The first layer was sterile nonadherent chlorhexidine gauze followed by meshed collagen sheet and then a sterile surgical pad soaked in phosphate buffered saline that was kept in place with a sterile transparent occlusive dressing. The area was immobilised by bandaging with Dynaplast, and the patient was advised to restrict movement at the site as much as possible.</P>

<P>The intervention was based on a cognitive behavioural (CBT) model of social anxiety and incorporates CBT techniques presented in a leaflet form. The leaflet included psycho-education, relaxation and attentional refocusing. The cognitive behavioural self-help intervention (CBSH) had three parts: (i) psycho-education, including a description of how social anxiety is likely to be maintained in vitiligo; (ii) symptom monitoring with an emphasis on the recognition of self-focused attention and triggers of anxiety; and (iii) guided imagery based relaxation and techniques for switching attention. In the enhanced cognitive behavioural self-help condition (CBSH+) guidance was also provided on forming specific if-then plans aimed at increasing the use of the interventions. Participants in the control group did not receive any intervention for the duration of the study but received the intervention (CBSH+) after completion of the study.<BR/>

<P>Note: The very unequal numbers of participants in each group suggests that this was not true randomisation, but we have accepted that a random number table was used.</P>
