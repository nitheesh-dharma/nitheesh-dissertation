<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-01-10 15:51:51 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cytomegalovirus (CMV; a herpes virus) is the most common type of virus detected in people who have received solid organ transplants (kidney, heart, liver, lung and pancreas). CMV disease is a major cause of illness and death during the first six to 12 months after transplantation. Two main strategies to prevent CMV disease have been adopted: protection and prevention (prophylaxis) of viral infections for all organ recipients using antiviral drugs, or 'pre-emptive therapy' of organ recipients, who develop evidence of CMV infection during routine screening.</P>
<P>We looked at the benefits and harms of antiviral prophylaxis to prevent CMV disease in people who are solid organ transplant recipients. The evidence we found shows that some antiviral drugs (ganciclovir, valaciclovir and aciclovir) reduced the risk of CMV disease, death due to CMV disease, clinical disease caused by herpes simplex and herpes zoster viruses, bacterial infections and protozoal infections.</P>
<P>For CMV disease and death, the relative benefits of aciclovir, ganciclovir and valaciclovir appear consistent across recipients of heart, kidney and liver transplants. These benefits occur in both CMV positive transplant recipients and CMV negative transplant recipients of CMV positive donor organs, with or without the inclusion of antilymphocyte antibody therapy, and the benefits were seen at all measured time points. We found that ganciclovir is more effective than aciclovir and as effective as valganciclovir, which is currently the most commonly used antiviral drug to prevent CMV disease in transplant recipients.</P>
<P>Extended duration of prophylaxis was found to be more effective than three months of therapy in kidney and lung transplant recipients. More studies are needed to determine the optimum duration and dosage of antiviral drugs for all solid organ transplant recipients.</P>

<P>We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> to February 2004 for the first version of this review.

<P>We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing antiviral medications with placebo or no treatment, comparing different antiviral medications and comparing different regimens of the same antiviral medications in recipients of any solid organ transplant.

</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-11-20 17:05:44 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Two authors independently assessed study eligibility, risk of bias and extracted data. Results were reported as risk ratios (RR) or risk differences (RD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and by mean difference (MD) with 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Statistical analyses were performed using the random-effects model. Subgroup analysis and univariate meta-regression were performed using restricted maximum-likelihood to estimate the between study variance. Multivariate meta-regression was performed to investigate whether the results were altered after allowing for differences in drugs used, organ transplanted, and recipient CMV serostatus at the time of transplantation.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-01-03 10:53:03 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified 37 studies (4342 participants). Risk of bias attributes were poorly performed or reported with low risk of bias reported for sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding and selective outcome reporting in 25% or fewer studies.</P>
<P>Prophylaxis with aciclovir, ganciclovir or valaciclovir compared with placebo or no treatment significantly reduced the risk for CMV disease (19 studies; RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.52), CMV infection (17 studies; RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.77), and all-cause mortality (17 studies; RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.92) primarily due to reduced mortality from CMV disease (7 studies; RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.78). Prophylaxis reduced the risk of herpes simplex and herpes zoster disease, bacterial and protozoal infections but not fungal infection, acute rejection or graft loss.</P>
<P>Meta-regression showed no significant difference in the relative benefit of treatment (risk of CMV disease or all-cause mortality) by organ transplanted or CMV serostatus; no conclusions were possible for CMV negative recipients of negative organs.</P>
<P>Neurological dysfunction was more common with ganciclovir and valaciclovir compared with placebo/no treatment. In direct comparison studies, ganciclovir was more effective than aciclovir in preventing CMV disease (7 studies; RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.60) and leucopenia was more common with aciclovir. Valganciclovir and IV ganciclovir were as effective as oral ganciclovir. The efficacy and adverse effects of valganciclovir/ganciclovir did not differ from valaciclovir in three small studies. Extended duration prophylaxis significantly reduced the risk of CMV disease compared with three months therapy (2 studies; RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.35). Leucopenia was more common with extended duration prophylaxis but severe treatment associated adverse effects did not differ between extended and three month durations of treatment.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-01-10 15:52:13 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most common virus pathogen in solid organ transplant recipients being a major cause of morbidity and mortality during the first six months post-transplant (<LINK REF="REF-Fishman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fishman 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rubin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubin 2000</LINK>). The overall incidence of symptomatic CMV disease in the transplant population ranges from 30% to 50% with the incidence and severity being highest among lung recipients (<LINK REF="REF-Linden-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Linden 2000</LINK>). Approximately 50% of deaths following lung transplantation are attributed to infection (<LINK REF="REF-Michaels-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michaels 2000</LINK>). Like all herpes viruses, CMV has the propensity to establish lifelong latency infection in the host after the initial infection has resolved. Therefore, a solid organ recipient may be infected either by exogenous virus or by reactivation of latent virus if they were CMV positive pre-transplant. Those at highest risk of symptomatic CMV disease are CMV seronegative patients who receive organs from CMV seropositive donors, and CMV seropositive patients on heavily immunosuppressive regimens (<LINK REF="REF-Fishman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fishman 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rubin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubin 2000</LINK>). CMV may manifest as a non-specific illness characterised by fever, mononucleosis, leucopenia and thrombocytopenia, or as a variety of clinical syndromes including pneumonitis, hepatitis, encephalitis and focal gastrointestinal disease. In addition, CMV infection causes morbidity in organ recipients through indirect effects on their immune response (<LINK REF="REF-Rubin-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubin 1989</LINK>), and is associated with increased risk of allograft injury and rejection (<LINK REF="REF-Grattan-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grattan 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Keenan-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keenan 1991</LINK>), opportunistic infections (<LINK REF="REF-Fishman-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fishman 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hadley-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hadley 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-den-Berg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van den Berg 1996</LINK>) and late onset malignancies such as Epstein-Barr virus lymphoproliferative disease (<LINK REF="REF-Basgoz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Basgoz 1995</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-11-20 17:55:21 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two main strategies to prevent CMV disease have been adopted: universal prophylaxis of organ recipients with antiviral agents and/or immunoglobulins, or pre-emptive therapy of organ recipients, who develop evidence of asymptomatic CMV infection during screening (<LINK REF="REF-Rubin-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubin 1989</LINK>). Antiviral medications may be given intravenously (ganciclovir, aciclovir, immunoglobulins) but are now more commonly administered once daily orally with the availability of the longer acting oral preparations valganciclovir and valaciclovir. Prophylaxis is usually administered for three to six months during the time that patients are most at risk of CMV infection and disease. Pre-emptive therapy relies upon monitoring for CMV infection by pp65 antigenaemia assay or for CMV DNA using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with administration of antiviral therapy when CMV infection is diagnosed (<LINK REF="REF-Emery-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emery 2000</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-11-20 17:56:00 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review examines the use of prophylaxis to prevent CMV infection and CMV disease. Prophylaxis is usually administered for the first three to six months after transplant when the recipient is at highest risk of CMV infection. Prevention of CMV disease should reduce the associated morbidity and mortality. In addition, prophylaxis may reduce the indirect effects of CMV infection including opportunistic infections, acute rejection and graft loss.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-01-10 15:56:50 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There remains a lack of consensus on the merits of the various CMV prophylaxis protocols available (<LINK REF="REF-Fishman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fishman 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Humar-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Humar 2009</LINK>). Universal prophylaxis exposes all solid organ transplant recipients to the adverse effects of medications, particularly haematological effects (leucopenia, neutropenia, increased risk of infection) with valganciclovir, and neurological effects with valaciclovir. However, based on epidemiological studies many recipients do not develop disease without prophylaxis (<LINK REF="REF-Humar-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Humar 2009</LINK>). Thus, prophylaxis among kidney transplant recipients has commonly been limited to CMV negative recipients of CMV positive kidneys and to recipients receiving antibodies to lymphocyte antigens. Prophylaxis may also be associated with an increased risk of late onset CMV disease occurring after discontinuation of prophylaxis and with the development of resistant organisms (<LINK REF="REF-Humar-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Humar 2009</LINK>). A systematic review was therefore required to assess the benefits and harms of antiviral prophylaxis in solid organ transplants.</P>
<P>A meta-analysis of prophylactic treatment versus placebo/no treatment was originally published in <I>The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Couchoud-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Couchoud 1998a</LINK>). When this review was updated in 2008, more recent articles comparing prophylaxis with antiviral medications (including aciclovir, ganciclovir, valaciclovir, valganciclovir) were included. This review also included studies comparing one prophylactic antiviral medication with another. We have examined the effect of prophylaxis with antiviral agents in recipients of solid organ transplant recipients on CMV disease, all CMV infection, the incidence of acute rejection, graft loss, opportunistic infections and death. We have compared the treatment effect of each regimen among different solid organs and different risk groups. Finally, the review evaluated potential harms caused by antiviral medications, namely nephrotoxicity, bone marrow suppression, and emergence of resistant CMV strains. Other reviews have evaluated pre-emptive therapy on detection of CMV viraemia (<LINK REF="REF-Strippoli-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strippoli 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Strippoli-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strippoli 2006b</LINK>) and the use of other agents (immunoglobulins, vaccines, interferon) alone or in combination with antiviral medications (<LINK REF="REF-Hodson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodson 2007</LINK>). The review was originally published in 2005 and was updated in 2008. It is now updated in 2013.</P>
<P>The Cochrane review <I>Pre-emptive therapy for cytomegalovirus viraemia to prevent cytomegalovirus disease in solid organ transplant recipients</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Owers-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Owers 2013</LINK>) has been updated concomitantly with this review. Pre-emptive therapy compared with placebo/no specific therapy reduced the risk of CMV disease by 70% (6 studies; 288 participants). While there was no significant difference in the prevention of CMV disease with pre-emptive therapy compared with prophylaxis (7 studies; 753 participants), there was some imprecision of results and significant heterogeneity among studies limiting the applicability of these data to patient management.</P>

</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2012-11-21 14:10:42 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review aimed to assess the benefits and harms of antiviral medications for preventing symptomatic CMV disease in solid organ transplant recipients of all ages, irrespective of CMV serostatus prior to transplantation. The secondary aims were to evaluate the efficacy of antiviral medications in preventing all CMV infection (symptomatic and asymptomatic where CMV is detected only by laboratory investigation) and in decreasing the incidence of acute rejection, graft loss, death (all-cause mortality and mortality due to CMV disease), opportunistic infections and to evaluate the harms of each antiviral medication.</P>
<P>The review compared studies of antiviral medications with placebo/no treatment and explored comparisons between two or more antiviral agents and/or two different doses or durations of the same antiviral agent. Thirdly, it has compared the treatment effect of each regimen between different solid organs and finally, among the different risk groups (i.e. pre-existent CMV serostatus and/or level of immunosuppression).</P>

<P>Two authors independently extracted data from eligible studies using standardised data extraction forms. Studies reported in foreign language journals were translated before data extraction. Participant characteristics (number, age, sex, comorbidities), interventions (type of treatment, dose, duration, co-interventions) and primary and secondary outcome measures were recorded. Authors were contacted to obtain missing information on allocation concealment. Any discrepancies in data extraction were resolved in discussion. Where results of a study were published more than once, the most complete data were extracted from all sources and used in the analysis only once.</P>

<P>To explore clinical differences among studies that might be expected to influence the magnitude of the treatment effect for the primary outcomes of CMV disease and all-cause mortality, subgroup analysis and univariate meta-regression was performed using STATA software (StataCorp LP, Texas, USA) using restricted maximum-likelihood to estimate the between-study variance. The potential sources of variability defined a priori were organ transplanted, antiviral medication used, use of immunosuppressive regimen including antibody therapy, treatment duration, donor/recipient CMV status at transplant, the time from transplant that the outcomes were measured, and methodological quality. Multivariate meta-regression was performed to investigate whether the results were altered after allowing for the differences in drug used, organ transplanted and recipient CMV serostatus at the time of transplantation.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Antiviral agents compared with placebo/no specific treatment</HEADING>
<P>This systematic review found that the antiviral agents, ganciclovir, valaciclovir and aciclovir, improve outcomes for solid organ transplant recipients far beyond the primary indication for use. In addition to reducing the risk of CMV disease by 60%, these agents reduced all-cause mortality by 40%, predominantly due to reduced mortality from CMV disease, as well as reducing clinical disease caused by herpes simplex and herpes zoster (70%), bacterial infections (35%), and protozoal infections (70%). The relative benefits of aciclovir, ganciclovir and valaciclovir in relation to CMV disease and mortality appeared to be consistent among recipients of heart, kidney and liver transplants. These benefits occurred in both CMV positive recipients and CMV negative recipients of CMV positive organs, irrespective of whether immunosuppression included antilymphocyte antibody therapy, and were not dependent on the time of outcome assessment. Although there were no placebo-controlled RCTs of valganciclovir, a study (<LINK REF="STD-Paya-2004-All" TYPE="STUDY">Paya 2004 All</LINK>) comparing valganciclovir (the prodrug of ganciclovir) and ganciclovir demonstrated no significant differences in the risk for CMV disease, all-cause mortality and other outcomes, indicating that outcomes demonstrated in this systematic review in placebo/no treatment studies can be extrapolated to valganciclovir.</P>
<P>There was no clear reduction in graft loss or acute rejection, although a small but clinically important benefit has not been excluded. The summary relative risk for both outcomes favours antiviral agents but the 95% confidence intervals were relatively wide and consistent with there being no effect. The exception was in a predefined subgroup in a single study (<LINK REF="STD-Lowance-1999-Kidney" TYPE="STUDY">Lowance 1999 Kidney</LINK>) in which CMV prophylaxis reduced the risk for biopsy-proven acute rejection in CMV negative recipients of CMV positive kidney transplants by 50%.</P>
<P>Based on data from a single large study (<LINK REF="STD-Lowance-1999-Kidney" TYPE="STUDY">Lowance 1999 Kidney</LINK>) valaciclovir significantly increased the risk for hallucinations. There was no significant increase in adverse effects with aciclovir or ganciclovir, although the 95% CIs were wide. Very few studies adequately reported harms so that significant differences in adverse effects between medication and placebo could be excluded. It is possible that other differences in side effect profiles exist between agents but have not been demonstrated.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Relative efficacy of antiviral medications</HEADING>
<P>Having demonstrated that antiviral agents as a drug class reduce all-cause mortality and CMV disease, we then sought to determine which antiviral regimen was the most beneficial. Indirect comparisons demonstrated no difference between antiviral agents administered. In head-to-head studies ganciclovir was significantly more effective than aciclovir in preventing CMV disease, demonstrating the importance of assessing the comparative effects of drugs in direct comparison studies. This difference may be explained by differences in duration of therapy in the indirect studies. Aciclovir was administered for 84 days or more but ganciclovir was given for shorter durations (9 to 42 days) in seven of the 11 included ganciclovir studies. Hence, agent and duration was evaluated rather than agent alone, as in direct comparison studies.</P>
<P>One large study (<LINK REF="STD-Paya-2004-All" TYPE="STUDY">Paya 2004 All</LINK>) demonstrated no significant difference in efficacy between ganciclovir and its prodrug, valganciclovir. Although three small studies demonstrated no difference in efficacy to prevent CMV disease among ganciclovir or valganciclovir and valaciclovir (<LINK REF="STD-_x0032_VAL-Study-2010-Kidney" TYPE="STUDY">2VAL Study 2010 Kidney</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pavlopoulou-2005-Kidney" TYPE="STUDY">Pavlopoulou 2005 Kidney</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reischig-2005-Kidney" TYPE="STUDY">Reischig 2005 Kidney</LINK>), the wide confidence intervals of the summary estimate (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.15 to 3.75) indicate that a significant difference in efficacy cannot be excluded. Based on existing study data, aciclovir is inferior to ganciclovir, and no clear superiority has been demonstrated between ganciclovir and valganciclovir or between valaciclovir and ganciclovir/valganciclovir.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Prophylaxis with extended durations of valganciclovir</HEADING>
<P>Extended prophylaxis with valganciclovir resulted in significant reductions in the risks of CMV disease, CMV infection and opportunistic infections but no significant differences in other outcomes (acute rejection, all-cause mortality, graft loss). Leucopenia was more common with extended duration of prophylaxis, but hospitalisations due to CMV disease were reduced.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Antiviral agents compared with placebo/no specific treatment</HEADING>
<P>Our major findings, that CMV antiviral prophylaxis prevents CMV disease and all-cause mortality, irrespective of organ transplanted and CMV serostatus, are strengthened by two features of the data; the consistency of these findings across all studies and the finding that almost all eligible studies reported both major outcomes of interest (lack of outcome reporting bias). We identified 19 eligible studies and the summary estimate favours antiviral medication for the outcome 'prevention of CMV disease' in 18 studies. Similarly, 17 studies contributed data to the all-cause mortality outcome. With fewer events, the play of chance would be expected to be greater, but only two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Macdonald-1995-Heart" TYPE="STUDY">Macdonald 1995 Heart</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Merigan-1992-Heart" TYPE="STUDY">Merigan 1992 Heart</LINK>) had point estimates suggesting increased mortality from CMV prophylaxis. Unlike the outcome of CMV disease, no individual study demonstrated a significant reduction in all-cause mortality with antiviral medication. This was evident only from the meta-analytic estimate. The overall I² was 12.6% for CMV disease and 0% for all-cause mortality demonstrating very low heterogeneity beyond chance, despite the clear differences in patient groups (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). Supporting this contention, as shown in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>, no pre-defined potential source of variability for the effects of antiviral medication was significant, including standard quality items for study conduct and reporting such as allocation concealment, blinding and intention-to-treat. We cannot exclude a difference in the magnitude of the effect of antiviral medication in solid organ transplant recipients. However, any difference is likely to be clinically unimportant since data from 19 studies and about 2000 patients were insufficient to demonstrate any difference. In addition, the remarkable consistency in results across all studies suggests any undetected difference would be in magnitude, and not direction of effect.</P>
<P>The data were relatively sparse in four areas, and further research is still needed. For the outcome of all-cause mortality in heart transplant recipients, there are few relevant studies (2), patients (205) and events (4) making the effects of antiviral medications on heart transplant recipients very uncertain. Both studies had higher death rates in the active arms but the 95% confidence intervals were very wide, results are consistent with other patient groups (liver and kidney), and the likely pathway for benefit - reduction in CMV disease - is evident in this patient group.</P>
<P>Second, there were very scant data in the seronegative donor to seronegative recipient group, even though this group is frequently given antiviral agents to prevent CMV disease (<LINK REF="REF-Baliga-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baliga 2004</LINK>). These patients are almost exclusively not enrolled in studies, because of low event rates. However, there are no studies examining the efficacy of antiviral agents to prevent de novo CMV disease in such CMV seronegative patients.</P>
<P>Third, our conclusions on the other benefits of antiviral medications and the adverse effects of these drugs (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>) must be considered more cautiously for reasons of imprecision of summary estimates and that many eligible studies did not report these outcomes. Therefore, these results may be biased. The direction of bias cannot be determined without obtaining additional data from the authors regarding these outcomes.</P>
<P>Fourth, only one study specifically addressed children (<LINK REF="STD-Green-1997-Liver" TYPE="STUDY">Green 1997 Liver</LINK>). This is despite that children commonly receive prophylaxis with antiviral agents since they are at a high risk of CMV disease because many are CMV seronegative and receive organs from CMV seropositive donors. Information on the efficacy of prophylaxis with antiviral agents from RCTs of adult transplant recipients has been extrapolated to children. Non randomised studies suggest valganciclovir is effective and tolerated in children (<LINK REF="REF-Camacho_x002d_Gonzalez-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Camacho-Gonzalez 2011</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Relative efficacy of antiviral medications</HEADING>
<P>The data clearly demonstrated that ganciclovir was superior to aciclovir in preventing CMV disease, and aciclovir is no longer used for prophylaxis. A single large study indicated no significant differences between oral ganciclovir and oral valganciclovir. Clinical practice data from this study have been extrapolated to indicate that oral valganciclovir can substitute for oral ganciclovir and valganciclovir is now generally the preferred agent for prophylaxis. Oral ganciclovir is no longer marketed.</P>
<P>Limited data (3 studies, 188 patients) meant that it remains unclear whether there are any differences in efficacy between valganciclovir/ganciclovir and valaciclovir in preventing CMV disease. The full results of all included patients are awaited for the <LINK REF="STD-_x0032_VAL-Study-2010-Kidney" TYPE="STUDY">2VAL Study 2010 Kidney</LINK> to determine whether any differences in efficacy exist between valganciclovir and valaciclovir. The available studies comparing valganciclovir/ganciclovir with valaciclovir have only enrolled kidney transplant recipients and it is unclear whether the data can be extrapolated to other transplanted organs.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Prophylaxis with extended durations of valganciclovir</HEADING>
<P>Two studies in kidney (318 recipient CMV positive, donor CMV negative participants) and lung transplant recipients (136 donor CMV positive/recipient CMV negative; and donor CMV positive or negative/recipient CMV positive participants) have demonstrated that extended durations of prophylaxis with valganciclovir resulted in a lower risk of CMV disease and infection. Neither study identified an increase in CMV mutations resistant to therapy, but study numbers were likely to be too small to demonstrate any difference. Both studies reported few cases of CMV disease occurring after the end of the extended period of prophylaxis. Further data are required to demonstrate whether the benefits of extended prophylaxis in other organ transplants justify the increased costs and adverse effects.</P>

<P>This review now contains 37 studies. Most studies, including those recently published, did not provide sufficient information to determine whether sequence generation and allocation concealment were at a low risk of bias (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>). It is a matter of concern that there was no blinding of participants, investigators and outcome assessors in almost 75% of studies. The primary outcome of CMV syndrome is a clinical diagnosis supported by laboratory diagnosis of CMV infection and other information. Therefore, it is possible that CMV syndrome was misdiagnosed in some participants. Studies that lack adequate allocation concealment and blinding may overestimate treatment effects (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schultz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schultz 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>The overall quality of the evidence for studies comparing antiviral medications with placebo or no specific treatment was considered high for some outcomes (CMV disease, all-cause mortality, acute rejection, CMV disease in kidney transplant recipients). It was considered moderate for mortality due to CMV disease, CMV disease in liver or heart transplants and graft loss because of limited numbers of studies reporting these outcomes (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>The overall quality of the evidence for studies comparing ganciclovir and aciclovir was considered high for CMV disease in all patients and for acute rejection. It was considered moderate for all-cause mortality, mortality due to CMV disease and other viral infections, and low for other fungal infections and graft loss because of the limited number of events in the studies in which these outcomes were reported (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>The overall quality of the evidence for studies comparing ganciclovir/valganciclovir with aciclovir/valaciclovir was considered low because of the small number of studies with few participants (<LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>).</P>
<P>The overall quality of the evidence for studies comparing extended duration with three months of therapy was considered high for CMV disease, CMV syndrome, CMV infection and total adverse reactions.

<P>The literature search was updated to July 2011. Although 29 additional reports of 13 studies, which had been included in previous versions of the review, were identified, these reports did not provide additional data for the review. It is possible that further reports of studies have been added to the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register since the last search. Preliminary data from one study (<LINK REF="STD-_x0032_VAL-Study-2010-Kidney" TYPE="STUDY">2VAL Study 2010 Kidney</LINK>) have been included in meta-analyses. It is possible that when full recruitment and follow-up are available, different results may be obtained.</P>
<P>About half the studies did not report all important outcomes so there is a risk of selection bias. In particular, there were limited data on death due to CMV disease, on graft loss and on other infections.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2013-01-10 15:56:10 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The results of this review confirm and expand the findings of three previous systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Couchoud-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Couchoud 1998b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Couchoud-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Couchoud 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fiddian-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fiddian 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gourishankar-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gourishankar 2001</LINK>), which included 12, 10 and 9 studies respectively comparing antiviral medications with placebo or no treatment for prevention of CMV disease. All found that prophylaxis reduced the risk for CMV disease in solid organ transplant recipients. One review (<LINK REF="REF-Couchoud-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Couchoud 1998b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Couchoud-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Couchoud 1998a</LINK>) found no effect on mortality (10 studies; RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.18) and a second (<LINK REF="REF-Fiddian-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fiddian 2002</LINK>), which included two studies using immunoglobulin and antiviral agents, found that prophylaxis with aciclovir or valaciclovir significantly reduced all-cause mortality (1321 patients; OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.90). Similarly, a more recent systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Kalil-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kalil 2005</LINK>) including 11 studies, found that prophylaxis with antiviral medications compared with placebo or no specific treatment significantly reduced CMV disease, all-cause mortality and opportunistic infections with similar degrees of benefit to those found in our review, although inclusion criteria differed in the two reviews. Eight studies of prophylaxis included in our review were excluded from the analyses of universal prophylaxis in the review by <LINK REF="REF-Kalil-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kalil 2005</LINK>. The two reviews differed in that our review showed no significant reduction of acute rejection with antiviral prophylaxis but <LINK REF="REF-Kalil-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kalil 2005</LINK> identified a significant reduction in acute rejection with treatment (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.91) using a fixed-effect model for the analysis. However, there was some heterogeneity in the analyses of acute rejection in both reviews. Further analyses using a random-effects model identified that both reviews found no significant differences in the risk of acute rejection between antiviral therapy and placebo/no specific treatment. Both reviews found a significant reduction in acute rejection using a fixed-effect model.</P>
<P>Our systematic review differs from previous reviews in that comparisons of different antiviral medications were included so that conclusions on the comparative effects of agents can be made. In addition, our review included a detailed exploration of potential heterogeneity. The finding of a reduction in all-cause mortality is largely explained by a reduced mortality due to CMV disease, although a reduction in mortality due to other causes cannot be totally excluded. The latter is biologically plausible because CMV disease leads to an increase in other opportunistic infections in heart and liver transplant recipients (<LINK REF="REF-George-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">George 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Valentine-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Valentine 1999</LINK>). This is suggestive of a mechanism whereby the prevention of CMV disease may prevent other infective complications that contribute to overall mortality.</P>
<P>Both prophylaxis and pre-emptive therapy significantly reduce CMV disease compared with placebo or no specific therapy in solid organ transplant recipients. However, the available evidence base for prevention of CMV disease with prophylaxis compared with placebo/no specific therapy (19 studies, 1981 participants) is large and of high quality (GRADE) compared with the low quality data (6 studies, 288 participants) supporting pre-emptive therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Owers-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Owers 2013</LINK>). Further studies are required to determine the relative efficacies, adverse effects and costs of pre-emptive therapy and prophylaxis because currently available data (7 studies, 753 participants), while showing no significant differences in efficacy though a lower risk of leucopenia with pre-emptive therapy, demonstrated considerable heterogeneity among studies thus limiting the applicability of these data to patient management.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-01-03 17:17:29 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This systematic review has shown that prophylaxis of CMV positive recipients and CMV negative recipients of CMV positive organs with antiviral medications given for three months post solid organ transplantation reduces the risk of CMV disease and all-cause mortality and may well reduce the risk of other opportunistic infections. What are the implications of this study to clinical practice? Previous treatment guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Jassal-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jassal 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-der-Bij-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van der Bij 2001</LINK>) recommended CMV prophylaxis for all recipients of solid organ transplants who received immunosuppression with antilymphocyte antibody products and for CMV negative recipients of CMV positive organs. In liver and heart transplant recipients, prophylaxis was also recommended for all CMV positive recipients of solid organ transplants because of the higher risk for CMV disease. Prophylaxis was not generally recommended for CMV positive kidney transplant recipients or for donor negative/recipient negative recipients (<LINK REF="REF-Jassal-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jassal 1998</LINK>) based on the low incidence of CMV disease in these groups. Our data suggested that these recommendations for use were too narrow because the benefits for patient survival and the constant relative benefits for CMV disease, irrespective of CMV serostatus, had not been recognised previously.</P>
<P>Recent guidelines recommend that all kidney transplant recipients except donor negative/recipient negative recipients should receive antiviral prophylaxis for at least three months post-transplant (<LINK REF="REF-KDIGO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">KDIGO 2009</LINK>). Similarly, guidelines from the AST Infectious Diseases Community of Practice (<LINK REF="REF-Humar-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Humar 2009</LINK>) recommend antiviral prophylaxis for both CMV seropositive recipients and for CMV seronegative recipients of CMV seropositive donors of any solid organ transplant. Consensus guidelines from the Infectious Disease Section of the Transplantation Society (<LINK REF="REF-Kotton-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kotton 2010</LINK>) recommended antiviral prophylaxis for CMV seronegative recipients of CMV positive donor organs. These guidelines considered that either prophylaxis or pre-emptive therapies could be used in CMV positive recipients but noted the lack of data on pre-emptive therapy in subpopulations including lung and small bowel transplants.</P>
<P>The absolute effects of antiviral medications on the prevention of CMV disease and all-cause mortality are shown quantitatively in groups of patients at different baseline risk for these outcomes (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). The primary determinants for CMV disease are organ transplanted and serostatus whereas organ transplanted is the most important determinant for all-cause mortality. <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK> shows that benefit exceeds harm for all but the lowest risk groups assuming equal importance of the outcomes. However, given that the clinical importance of all-cause mortality and CMV disease are significantly greater than the adverse effects of medications, most patients and clinicians, when provided with this information, are likely to use CMV prophylaxis with antiviral medications across all risk categories, except in the seronegative donor and recipient groups for whom there are few data.</P>
<P>Two RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-IMPACT-2010-Kidney" TYPE="STUDY">IMPACT 2010 Kidney</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Palmer-2010-Lung" TYPE="STUDY">Palmer 2010 Lung</LINK>) have now demonstrated that extended duration prophylaxis with valganciclovir in CMV seropositive donor/CMV negative recipients of kidney and lung transplants and seropositive recipients of lung transplants reduces the risk of CMV disease compared with three months of therapy suggesting that extended duration prophylaxis should be considered in patients at higher risk of CMV disease (<LINK REF="REF-Humar-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Humar 2009</LINK>).</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-01-03 17:17:42 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>There are no data from RCTs on the efficacy of prophylaxis compared with placebo in lung transplants and few data in heart transplants. However, such studies are no longer ethical based on the demonstration of efficacy in other organ transplants. Future studies may be required in the seronegative donor-recipient group depending on the prevalence of CMV disease in this group with newer and more potent immunosuppressive regimens. Further studies are required to determine optimum duration and dosage of medications in different organ transplants. Currently valganciclovir is most commonly used for prophylaxis. It remains possible that smaller doses than currently recommended may be effective for prophylaxis as demonstrated for IV ganciclovir (<LINK REF="STD-Hertz-1998-Heart_x002f_lung" TYPE="STUDY">Hertz 1998 Heart/lung</LINK>).</P>
<P>Further studies are required to evaluate the comparative effects, including harms, of antiviral medications in clinical use at present or in the future. More information is required on the efficacy of prophylaxis with different regimens of immunosuppressive regimens used for prevention and treatment of rejection in different organ transplants.</P>
<P>Overall, prophylaxis did not significantly reduce the risk for acute rejection or graft loss. Further information is required to determine whether prophylaxis can reduce the risk for rejection in particular groups of patients, whether it affects the number or severity of rejection episodes, and whether it reduces graft loss at time periods beyond one year.</P>
<P>Adequately powered and well-designed RCTs are required to determine the relative efficacies, adverse effects and costs of universal prophylaxis in comparison with pre-emptive therapies particularly in transplant populations at lower risk of CMV disease.</P>
