<P>After a stroke, arm problems are common and their recovery is often limited. This review of 18 studies with 549 relevant participants looked at whether performing identical activities with both arms at the same time (simultaneous bilateral training) could improve performance in daily (or extended daily) activities, movement of the arm and/or reduce arm impairments. In comparison with usual care, bilateral training had no effect on performance in activities of daily living, functional movement of the arm or hand, performance in extended activities of daily living or motor impairment outcomes. In comparison with other arm interventions, bilateral training had no effect on performance in activities of daily living, functional movement of the arm or hand or motor impairment outcomes. One study found that people who undertook bilateral training showed less improvement in performance in extended activities of daily living than people doing another arm intervention. The evidence in this area is limited. Further research is needed to determine the effects of bilateral training.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2010-02-22 15:57:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Stroke Trials Register (last searched August 2009) and 10 electronic bibliographic databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> Issue 3, 2009), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and AMED (August 2009). We also searched reference lists and trials registers.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2009-10-23 11:17:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised trials in adults after stroke, where the intervention was simultaneous bilateral training compared to placebo or no intervention, usual care or other upper limb (arm) interventions. Primary outcomes were performance in activities of daily living (ADL) and functional movement of the upper limb. Secondary outcomes were performance in extended activities of daily living and motor impairment of the arm.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2010-02-22 15:57:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Two authors independently screened abstracts, extracted data and appraised trials. Assessment of methodological quality was undertaken for allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessor, intention-to-treat, baseline similarity and loss to follow up.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-02-22 15:57:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We included 18 studies involving 549 relevant participants, of which 14 (421 participants) were included in the analysis (one within both comparisons). Four of the 14 studies compared the effects of bilateral training with usual care. Primary outcomes: results were not statistically significant for performance in ADL (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.14 to 0.63); functional movement of the arm (SMD -0.07, 95% CI -0.42 to 0.28) or hand (SMD -0.04, 95% CI -0.50 to 0.42). Secondary outcomes: no statistically significant results. Eleven of the 14 studies compared the effects of bilateral training with other specific upper limb (arm) interventions. Primary outcomes: no statistically significant results for performance of ADL (SMD -0.25, 95% CI -0.57 to 0.08); functional movement of the arm (SMD -0.20, 95% CI -0.49 to 0.09) or hand (SMD -0.21, 95% CI -0.51 to 0.09). Secondary outcomes: one study reported a statistically significant result in favour of another upper limb intervention for performance in extended ADL. No statistically significant differences were found for motor impairment outcomes.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-02-02 10:40:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>There is insufficient good quality evidence to make recommendations about the relative effect of simultaneous bilateral training compared to placebo, no intervention or usual care. We identified evidence that suggests that bilateral training may be no more (or less) effective than usual care or other upper limb interventions for performance in ADL, functional movement of the upper limb or motor impairment outcomes.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-02-24 11:36:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Stroke is the main cause of permanent and complex long-term disability in adults and has implications for patients, caregivers, health professionals and society in general (<LINK REF="REF-Feigin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feigin 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kwon-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kwon 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Langhorne-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langhorne 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-der-Lee-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Lee 1999</LINK>). At present there is no routinely available curative treatment for stroke patients and therefore rehabilitation interventions are relied upon to maximise patient outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Langhorne-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langhorne 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Upper limb (arm) hemiparesis is widely reported in the literature as one of the primary impairments following stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Page-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Page 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-der-Lee-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Lee 2001</LINK>). While many patients recover ambulatory function after dense hemiplegia, restoration of arm motor skills is often incomplete (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Page-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Page 2001</LINK>). It has been reported that the paretic arm remains without function in between 30% (<LINK REF="REF-Heller-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heller 1987</LINK>) to 66% (<LINK REF="REF-Sunderland-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sunderland 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wade-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wade 1983</LINK>) of hemiplegic stroke patients, when measured six months post-stroke. Furthermore, only 5% (<LINK REF="REF-Heller-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heller 1987</LINK>) to 20% (<LINK REF="REF-Nakayama-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nakayama 1995</LINK>) of individuals achieve complete functional recovery. Nevertheless, return of voluntary arm movements is one of the most important goals during stroke rehabilitation in order to avoid long-term disability in activities of daily living (ADL), social and occupational activities, and depression (<LINK REF="REF-Broeks-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Broeks 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The aim of rehabilitation is to reduce impairment and minimise disability (<LINK REF="REF-Page-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Page 2001</LINK>) and a number of interventions to achieve these aims and improve arm function after stroke have been suggested (<LINK REF="REF-Barreca-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barreca 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-der-Lee-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Lee 2001</LINK>). The effectiveness of some of these interventions has been, or is in the process of being reviewed within other Cochrane systematic reviews: electromyographic (EMG) biofeedback (<LINK REF="REF-Woodford-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woodford 2004</LINK>), electrostimulation (<LINK REF="REF-Pomeroy-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pomeroy 2006</LINK>), electromechanical and robotic-assisted arm training (<LINK REF="REF-Merholz-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merholz 2008</LINK>), constraint-induced movement therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Sirtori-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sirtori 2003</LINK>) and repetitive task training (<LINK REF="REF-French-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">French 2006</LINK>). However, rigorous systematic evaluation is still required to investigate the effectiveness of simultaneous bilateral training.</P>
<P>Simultaneous bilateral training involves the execution of identical activities with both arms simultaneously but independently (<LINK REF="STD-Mudie-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mudie 2000</LINK>). Beneficial effects of bilateral training are assumed to arise from an interlimb coupling effect, in which movement of the non-paretic arm facilitates movements in the impaired limb (<LINK REF="REF-Kelso-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelso 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morris-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Morris 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Swinnen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swinnen 2002</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Cauraugh-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Cauraugh 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Stinear-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Stinear 2008</LINK> further suggest that bilateral practice of synchronous movements with the paretic and non-paretic limbs allows activation of the intact hemisphere to facilitate activation of the damaged hemisphere through enhanced interhemispheric inhibition. Bilateral training is often combined with other interventions, such as electrostimulation or assistive technology, to assist the affected arm to undertake the simultaneous movements.</P>
<P>Two reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Cauraugh-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cauraugh 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stewart-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 2006</LINK>) report favourable effects of bilateral training. These reviews, however, included studies other than randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and both acknowledge that there are inconsistent findings across bilateral movement studies. A further, more recent narrative review of bilateral training (<LINK REF="REF-McCombe-Waller-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCombe Waller 2008</LINK>) acknowledges that bilateral studies have not shown improvements in all patients and that bilateral training has not been shown to be more beneficial than other training approaches. However this review was not systematic and included a range of study designs, including single case studies. We therefore sought to undertake a complete, up-to-date, systematic review of randomised controlled trials to determine the effects of bilateral training compared to no treatment, placebo or other interventions for improving arm function after stroke.</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES MODIFIED="2010-02-22 15:58:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We included controlled trials where participants had been randomly assigned (that is, each participant had an equal chance of being allocated a particular treatment as another participant). Random allocation could have been completed by having computer-generated random numbers, or using sequentially-numbered opaque sealed envelopes. We only included the first phase of cross-over studies to exclude any carry-over or learning effects. We excluded quasi-randomised trials from this review. We included trials with or without blinding of participants, treating therapist(s) and assessor(s). One of the intervention groups must have included simultaneous bilateral training (see definition in <LINK TAG="CRIT_INTERVENTIONS" TYPE="SECTION">Types of interventions</LINK>) and another group either a no-treatment group, a placebo group, usual ('conventional' or 'traditional') care, or another specific upper limb (arm) intervention or programme.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2010-02-22 15:58:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We included trials of participants with a clinical diagnosis of stroke - 'a syndrome of rapidly developing symptoms and signs of focal, and at times, global, loss of cerebral function lasting more than 24 hours or leading to death, with no apparent cause other than that of vascular origin' (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1989</LINK>) - regardless of time since onset, initial arm impairment, ability to follow instructions, co-morbidities, previous strokes or location of stroke. We included studies that enrolled participants with other neurological disorders if more than 75% of participants were stroke patients.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2010-02-22 15:59:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The included studies had to include simultaneous bilateral training. The definition of simultaneous bilateral training used was; 'when a motor activity is completed at the same time by both upper limbs independently' (<LINK REF="STD-Mudie-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mudie 2000</LINK>). We excluded trials that investigated simultaneous bilateral training in conjunction with another intervention (e.g. assistive technology such as machine, a robot or electrical stimulation) and compared to a control group, for example simultaneous bilateral training and electrical stimulation compared to a control group. This was to ensure that the treatment effect under investigation was bilateral training. However, we did include studies where assistive technology was given to both an intervention (bilateral training) and control (unilateral training) group, as in these cases it is the bilateral component of the training which is the active treatment under investigation, and not the assistive technology. Similarly, we also included trials which investigated bilateral training completed using assistive technology which was compared with a control intervention, also completed using assistive technology.</P>
<P>We included any duration or intensity of programme.</P>
<P>For studies comparing simultaneous bilateral training with 'usual care', we accepted any control intervention which was considered by the original trial authors to be a normal or usual component of stroke rehabilitation. We documented the description of 'usual care', where this was provided by the authors.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2010-02-22 15:59:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The primary or initial aim of many upper limb interventions (including bilateral training) is often to improve functional movement and reduce impairment. However, it is debatable how meaningful these aspects are to individual patients. A more important goal for patients is likely to be to improve their ability to participate in and achieve independence with activities of daily living. Additionally, this is the over-arching aim of most rehabilitation interventions. Since the key motivation of this review is to improve patient care and ensure meaningful outcomes, we therefore felt it was it appropriate to have two primary outcomes of interest: (1) performance in activities of daily living, and (2) functional movement of the upper limb.</P>
<P>We anticipated that the studies would use and report a large variety of different outcome measures relevant to the primary and secondary outcomes of this review. Therefore, for each outcome of interest (primary and secondary) we attempted to identify and list all the common, specific measurement tools or scales that could be included. If we identified a study which reported more than one measurement tool or scale which addressed the same outcome, we used the scale listed earliest in our lists. If a study did not use any of the measures in the list, but measured the outcome using a different measurement tool or scale we included and documented this. These hierarchical lists are given below.</P>

<P>Data collected at follow-up points after the end of the intervention period are important for assessing whether any treatment effects are sustained. However, for this review the primary aim was to determine whether bilateral training had any immediate beneficial treatment effect. If bilateral training is found to have a beneficial treatment effect we will consider including follow-up data within a future update of this review.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Identification of relevant trials</HEADING>
<P>One review author (FC) read the titles of the identified references and eliminated any obviously irrelevant studies. We obtained the abstracts for the remaining studies and then, based on the inclusion criteria (types of studies, types of participants, aims of interventions and outcome measures), two review authors (FC and FvW or AP) independently ranked these as 'possibly relevant' or 'definitely irrelevant'. If both review authors identified a trial as 'definitely irrelevant' we excluded it at this point, but included all other trials at this stage. We then held consensus discussions, with the assistance of additional review authors where appropriate (FvW, AP and JM), concerning the inclusion of the remaining studies, based on the abstracts, and excluded further studies. We then retrieved the full text of the remaining studies, which two authors (FC and FvW or AP) independently reviewed and classified as 'include' or 'exclude'. We excluded trials classified as 'exclude' by both review authors. Where disagreement occurred between the two review authors, or a decision could not be made, the authors reached consensus through discussion and, where necessary, sought the opinion of a third review author.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Documentation of methodological quality</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors independently assessed the methodological quality of the studies using a standard critical appraisal assessment form. Assessment of the quality of studies focused on potential areas of bias within the studies, as this has been shown to affect the estimation of effectiveness of interventions. We considered and documented, where the information was provided, the following:</P>

For example, comparisons of (i) robot-assisted simultaneous bilateral training versus robot-assisted unilateral training or (ii) simultaneous bilateral training plus electrical stimulation versus unilateral training plus electrical stimulation would both be included in comparison 3 (Simultaneous bilateral training versus other specific upper limb interventions). We completed a sensitivity analysis to explore the effect of including studies where the simultaneous bilateral training was combined with another intervention.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data analysis</HEADING>
<P>For each comparison we used the study results for performance in activities of daily living, measures of functional movement, measures of motor impairment, and adverse effects if documented. We used the Cochrane Review Manager software, RevMan 5, for all analyses (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>We presented all outcome measures analysed as continuous data. We calculated standardised mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). We determined heterogeneity using the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic (we considered I<SUP>2 </SUP>greater than 50% as substantial heterogeneity). If I<SUP>2 </SUP>was less than or equal to 50% we used a fixed-effect meta-analysis. If I<SUP>2 </SUP>was greater than 50%, we explored the individual trial characteristics to identify potential sources of heterogeneity. We then performed meta-analysis using both fixed-effect and random-effects modelling to assess sensitivity to the choice of modelling approach.</P>
<P>We planned to complete subgroup analyses (following the Deeks method; <LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2001</LINK>) on differences between acute (time at entry to trials less than three months post-stroke) and chronic (time at entry to trials equal to or more than three months) patients (at entry to the trials) and duration and number of repetitions of the programme (intervention for less than four weeks and intervention equal to or more than four weeks, intervention less than five days per week or equal to or more than five days per week). We planned to undertake these subgroup analyses where data permitted (sufficient data were considered to be more than five trials reporting the information) and undertaken on the primary outcome only. We also planned to complete sensitivity analysis based on methodologicaI quality of studies (i.e. method of randomisation, concealment of randomisation, blinding of outcome assessor, intention-to-treat analysis).</P>

<P>Our search strategy identified 6809 titles. After elimination of duplicates and obviously irrelevant studies we were left with 296 'possibly relevant' abstracts. We obtained these 296 abstracts and two review authors (FC and FvW or AP) independently assessed them for inclusion. Where disagreements or uncertainties arose, we held consensus discussions involving additional authors (FvW, AP or JM) where required. We assessed 82 abstracts as 'include' and we obtained the full papers for these 82 studies. Of these 82 full papers, we excluded 61 (see <LINK TAG="EXCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR" TYPE="SECTION">Excluded studies</LINK> for further details); there was insufficient information to determine inclusion eligibility for five papers (referring to four studies) (listed in <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_AWAITING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of studies awaiting classification</LINK>); leaving 16 studies for inclusion.</P>
<P>In addition, we identified four ongoing trials from searching additional databases. Contact with the principal investigator led to the identification of a relevant publication from one of these trials (<LINK REF="STD-Stoykov-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Stoykov 2009</LINK>). We identified published data relating to a further ongoing study (<LINK REF="STD-Lin-2009b" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2009b</LINK>) from a journal online (ahead of print). We assessed these studies as relevant for inclusion. Thus, we included a total of 18 studies in this review.</P>

<I>Interventions</I>
</HEADING>
<P>The interventions investigated in the included studies varied in terms of types of bilateral tasks completed, duration of interventions and use of a combination of interventions. We provide details of the individual interventions, including types of tasks and durations in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table. Some of the key differences are summarised below.</P>
<P>The interventions of 12 of the 14 included studies each concentrated on one specific upper limb movement or task: four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Cauraugh-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Cauraugh 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cauraugh-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Cauraugh 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cauraugh-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cauraugh 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cauraugh-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Cauraugh 2008</LINK>) were aimed at wrist/finger extension, and one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Mudie-2001_x003a_-Acute" TYPE="STUDY">Mudie 2001: Acute</LINK>) was specific to isometric contractions of wrist extension. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Lum-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lum 2006</LINK>) the intervention involved some form of bilateral reaching, while in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Luft-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Luft 2004</LINK>) the intervention involved bilateral pushing and pulling, and in another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Summers-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Summers 2007</LINK>) the intervention was a bilateral dowel placement task.</P>
<P>The interventions of six of the 14 included studies involved more than one upper limb movement or task: <LINK REF="STD-Morris-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Morris 2008</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Platz-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Platz 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Stoykov-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Stoykov 2009</LINK> completed four, three and six separate bilateral tasks respectively, and <LINK REF="STD-Desrosiers-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Desrosiers 2005</LINK> assessed a package of interventions, which included bilateral tasks in addition to unilateral and bimanually different tasks. <LINK REF="STD-Lin-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2009a</LINK> investigated simultaneous movements during a number of functional tasks in symmetric or alternating patterns. <LINK REF="STD-Lin-2009b" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2009b</LINK> focused on simultaneous bilateral completion of functional tasks with symmetric patterns.</P>
<P>Thirteen of the 14 included studies investigated the effect of training over a training period (rather than single training and evaluation sessions); the training period varied from four days (<LINK REF="STD-Cauraugh-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Cauraugh 2008</LINK>) to eight weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Stoykov-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Stoykov 2009</LINK>). The remaining RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Mudie-2001_x003a_-Acute" TYPE="STUDY">Mudie 2001: Acute</LINK>) did not have a training period as they used one single training and evaluation session.</P>
<P>Five of the 14 studies provided a further intervention as an adjunct to treatment in both the bilateral training and control groups. Four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Cauraugh-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Cauraugh 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cauraugh-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Cauraugh 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cauraugh-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cauraugh 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cauraugh-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Cauraugh 2008</LINK>) included EMG-triggered neuromuscular stimulation, delivered to both the bilateral training and control group. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lum-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lum 2006</LINK>) used a robot to assist movement of the affected limb in both the bilateral training and control (unilateral) groups.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Luft-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Luft 2004</LINK> evaluated bilateral training in conjunction with auditory cueing; auditory cueing was not provided to the control group. This study was included as auditory cueing was not assessed by the authors to be an 'assistive technology', but to be a mode of delivery of an intervention. <LINK REF="STD-Stoykov-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Stoykov 2009</LINK> also used rhythmic auditory cueing as an adjunct, however, this was not used for completion of all tasks and was provided to both groups.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">
<I>Outcome measures </I>
</HEADING>
<P>As anticipated, a variety of outcome measures were used by the included studies. All of the studies included a measure of motor impairment. It was apparent to us that, due to differences in the measures, it would be inappropriate to combine some of the outcomes together within analyses. Therefore, following data extraction we further categorised functional movement of the upper limb into the following subgroups: (1) arm functional movement, and (2) hand functional movement, and categorised motor impairment of the upper limb into the following subgroups: (1) motor impairment scales, (2) temporal outcomes, (3) spatial outcomes and (4) strength outcomes.</P>

<P>We excluded a total of 61 studies following consideration of the full papers. Reasons for exclusion were: not a simultaneous bilateral training intervention (25 studies), not stroke population (two studies), review papers (three studies), bilateral training intervention but not a randomised controlled trial (17 studies), bilateral training intervention completed with assistive technology (seven studies), no relevant outcomes (one study) and bilateral training intervention received by both groups (six studies).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-02-22 16:01:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We found no studies that compared simultaneous bilateral training with placebo or no intervention.</P>
<P>Four of 14 included studies compared simultaneous bilateral training with usual care and found no statistically significant effect of bilateral training on any analysed outcomes (performance of activities of daily living (ADL), arm and hand functional movement, performance in extended ADL or motor impairment measures (motor impairment scales, temporal, spatial and strength outcomes). As stated in the methods we used a random-effects model where heterogeneity was greater than 50%, therefore these conclusions are based on random-effects analysis where appropriate. For motor impairment scales we found a significant result when we used a fixed-effect analysis; however, due to heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 88%) a random-effects model was more appropriate for analysis and this result was non-significant.</P>
<P>Eleven of 14 included studies compared the effects of a bilateral intervention with another upper limb intervention. We found no statistically significant effects in favour of bilateral training for any of the specified outcomes. Data from one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lin-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2009a</LINK>) (40 participants) found a statistically significant result in favour of another upper limb intervention (constraint-induced therapy) for a measure of performance in extended ADL. This result cannot be generalised to other outcomes and further research would be required to confirm this finding.</P>
<P>It must be noted that only six (<LINK REF="STD-Lin-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lin-2009b" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2009b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morris-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Morris 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mudie-2001_x003a_-Acute" TYPE="STUDY">Mudie 2001: Acute</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Platz-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Platz 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Summers-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Summers 2007</LINK>) of the fourteen studies included in the analysis used a single training protocol. The other eight studies included neuromuscular stimulation (<LINK REF="STD-Cauraugh-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Cauraugh 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cauraugh-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Cauraugh 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cauraugh-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cauraugh 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cauraugh-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Cauraugh 2008</LINK>), robotic-assistance (<LINK REF="STD-Lum-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lum 2006</LINK>), rhythmic auditory cueing (<LINK REF="STD-Luft-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Luft 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stoykov-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Stoykov 2009</LINK>) or unilateral and bimanual tasks in combination with bilateral training (<LINK REF="STD-Desrosiers-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Desrosiers 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>In addition to the 14 studies included in the analyses, we identified four relevant cross-over studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dickstein-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Dickstein 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harris_x002d_Love-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Harris-Love 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kilbreath-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kilbreath 2006</LINK>). None of these four studies had data suitable for inclusion in analyses, therefore, while we have included details of these four cross-over studies in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table, <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> (Demographics of included participants) and <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK> (Methodological quality summary), we have not included them in analyses or referred to them within the <LINK TAG="RESULTS" TYPE="SECTION">Results</LINK> or <LINK TAG="DISCUSSION" TYPE="SECTION">Discussion</LINK> sections.</P>
<P>In summary, this review has identified:</P>
<OL>
<LI>insufficient high quality evidence to determine if simultaneous bilateral training is more (or less) effective than placebo, no intervention or usual care;</LI>
<LI>evidence to suggest that bilateral training is no more (or less) effective than other upper limb interventions for the specified outcomes.</LI>
</OL>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2010-02-22 16:01:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The evidence is currently insufficient to answer the review questions: the effects of bilateral training compared to placebo, usual care or other upper limb intervention in terms of performance in ADL, functional movement of the upper limb, performance in extended ADL, motor impairment of the upper limb and adverse events. The included studies, with the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Morris-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Morris 2008</LINK>, had small numbers of participants and reported a diverse range of outcome measures, of which many were unique to single studies or specific to certain impairments. Both these factors limit the completeness of the evidence relevant to this review.</P>
<P>One of the 14 included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Mudie-2001_x003a_-Acute" TYPE="STUDY">Mudie 2001: Acute</LINK>) had a single treatment and evaluation phase, meaning that treatment and evaluation occurred at the same time. It is debatable whether or not this method constitutes an evaluation of an intervention, or whether it is simply a test of performance under different conditions. We investigated the impact of including this study using a sensitivity analysis, and found it to have very limited impact on the results of this review.</P>
<P>Due to limited data we were unable to complete subgroup analysis for different participant subgroups or duration or intensity of training. The characteristics of the included studies indicate that participants within the studies varied in terms of time post-stroke. Additionally, the type, duration and intensity of training varied between the studies.</P>
<P>Another key difference between the studies was the investigation of the effect of a single movement versus the effect of a series of different movements. In future updates of this review we propose to carry out subgroup analysis to explore the effect of single bilateral movements versus a series (more than one) of bilateral movements, as arguably this could have an impact.</P>
<P>All of the included studies had inclusion criteria specifying either minimum or maximum levels of upper limb ability, and preservation of at least some cognitive abilities (including ability to comprehend simple instructions). Therefore, the results of this review may not be generalisable to the wider population of stroke patients.</P>
<P>The lack of sufficient high quality evidence makes it inappropriate to draw conclusions from the results regarding the applicability of bilateral training within the context of current practice.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2010-02-22 16:01:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The quality of most of the evidence was poor, with incomplete reporting of methodological details. The number of participants within the included studies was generally small; only <LINK REF="STD-Morris-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Morris 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Lin-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2009a</LINK> had more than 50 participants and seven of the studies had 20 or fewer participants. Only three of the 14 studies had adequate allocation concealment. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Lin-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lum-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lum 2006</LINK>) clearly did not have allocation concealment and the remaining studies did not mention allocation concealment. Eight studies reported that a blinded assessor was used. No studies reported using an intention-to-treat analysis. The overall quality of the studies limits confidence in the results.<BR/>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2010-02-22 16:01:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Through a thorough searching process we are confident that we should have identified all relevant published studies; however, it must be acknowledged that there is a small possibility that there are additional studies (published and unpublished) that we did not identify.</P>
<P>Four studies were categorised as comparing bilateral training with usual care. It should be noted that the intervention (categorised as usual care) in these studies was dose matched with the bilateral intervention. Therefore, it is likely that these interventions were more intensive than the typical duration of usual care. Furthermore, the interventions which we have classified as usual care differ between the four studies. However, we felt that it was more appropriate to categorise these interventions within the usual care comparison than the other upper limb intervention comparison, as the interventions completed in these four studies were not specific other upper limb interventions or programmes. Within the other upper limb interventions comparison all except one study investigated bilateral training compared to unilateral training (i.e. completing the same activities or activity with both arms compared to completing with the affected arm only). <LINK REF="STD-Lin-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2009a</LINK> compared the effects of bilateral training with constraint-induced therapy which, in addition to undertaking of functional tasks with the affected upper limb (which was dose matched to the bilateral training), involved restraint of the unaffected limb for six hours per day. Combining these studies within these stated comparison groups further increases the heterogeneity between the included studies, limiting the conclusions that can be drawn.</P>
<P>The diversity of the bilateral training paradigms and the variations in reporting between studies led to the review team making some subjective decisions, which may have introduced bias. The studies within this area are heterogenous in terms of what is defined as bilateral training and there were a number of complex strands which required discussion among the review authors and consensus decisions being made. We appreciate that this could be perceived as a limitation of our review.</P>
<P>We used hierarchical lists (see <LINK TAG="CRIT_OUTCOMES" TYPE="SECTION">Types of outcome measures</LINK>) to select which outcome measure should be included if a study reported a number of different relevant outcome measures. There could potentially be biases in the hierarchical order developed for each outcome. However, we carefully considered the order of the hierarchy and reached consensus. Despite the potential limitations and biases of this approach, we believe that because of the large number of different outcome measures used to assess similar domains the pre-stating of a hierarchical list provides substantial advantages in comparison to the alternative option of having to make subjective decisions about the selection of outcome measures after data collection has been completed.</P>
<P>The included studies used a wide range of outcome measures, methodologies and time intervals for follow up making statistical pooling difficult. To overcome the variations in outcome measures and to maximise statistical pooling we categorised the outcomes of functional movement and motor impairment of the upper limb into subgroups. For four studies, mean values were not available (for at least some of the outcomes) and we therefore imputed median values (where these were provided instead of mean values) as mean values and calculated standard deviations from reported standard error (SD = SE &#8730;n). Where data were presented in graphical form two review authors independently estimated values from the graphs. This may have introduced some bias into the review process. However, we believe that including imputed and estimated data from these studies is preferable to excluding the data.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Inclusion of single training and evaluation studies</HEADING>
<P>We included one randomised controlled trial (<LINK REF="STD-Mudie-2001_x003a_-Acute" TYPE="STUDY">Mudie 2001: Acute)</LINK> and four cross-over studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dickstein-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Dickstein 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harris_x002d_Love-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Harris-Love 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kilbreath-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kilbreath 2006</LINK>) (not included in analyses) which involved a single evaluation session. Within these studies there was no training period and it is questionable if these studies constitute intervention studies or merely a test of performance. In addition, the four cross-over studies were not designed or presented as traditional RCTs, but rather participants were randomly allocated to different treatment orders (using a randomised cross-over design). We debated the suitability of including these studies. Only one of these five studies (Mudie 2001) was incorporated in any analysis; therefore including these other studies in the review does not alter the results or conclusions of this review.</P>
<P>For this version of the review we decided to include these studies (although the cross-over studies were included in tables only and not included in analyses or described in the text), however we would appreciate any feedback on this, and may revise this decision in subsequent updates. Options for future updates of this review could therefore be either the exclusion of randomised cross-over studies or the exclusion of any study which only has a single evaluation session. If randomised cross-over studies are to be included in updates of this review, we must first identify appropriate methods of obtaining and including data within analyses.</P>

<P>The results of this review vary from the results presented in the review by <LINK REF="REF-Stewart-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 2006</LINK>, which reported a significant overall effect in favour of bilateral movement training alone or in combination with auxiliary sensory feedback for improving motor recovery post-stroke (Fugl-Meyer, Box and Block Test or kinematic variables). This review was systematic in terms of its methods, however it had a more limited search strategy than our review and included studies that were not randomised controlled trials. The authors did assess trials for randomisation, which was defined as either randomly placed in a treatment or control group or if the treatment was randomly assigned to the participants. Eleven studies were included in the <LINK REF="REF-Stewart-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 2006</LINK> meta-analysis, seven of which were not included in our review (<LINK REF="STD-Cauraugh-2003b" TYPE="STUDY">Cauraugh 2003b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lewis-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Lewis 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mudie-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mudie 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mudie-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mudie 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCombe-Waller-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McCombe Waller 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stinear-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Stinear 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whitall-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Whitall 2000</LINK>). Five of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Mudie-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mudie 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mudie-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mudie 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cauraugh-2003b" TYPE="STUDY">Cauraugh 2003b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lewis-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Lewis 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stinear-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Stinear 2004</LINK>) were assessed to have some form of random assignment within the <LINK REF="REF-Stewart-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 2006</LINK> review, however we disagreed with this decision. Many of these studies were considered not to have an appropriate control group and these types of studies will give an inflated effect of the intervention. Reasons for excluding the above studies from our review are stated in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> table. We included two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dickstein-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Dickstein 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mudie-2001_x003a_-Acute" TYPE="STUDY">Mudie 2001: Acute</LINK>) which were identified by the <LINK REF="REF-Stewart-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 2006</LINK> review, but not included in the meta-analysis due to not having a functional outcome measure (<LINK REF="STD-Dickstein-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Dickstein 1993</LINK>) and not involving bilateral movements as a treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Mudie-2001_x003a_-Acute" TYPE="STUDY">Mudie 2001: Acute</LINK>) respectively. In contrast, we included <LINK REF="STD-Dickstein-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Dickstein 1993</LINK> as it included other outcomes relevant to our criteria, and we assessed that <LINK REF="STD-Mudie-2001_x003a_-Acute" TYPE="STUDY">Mudie 2001: Acute</LINK> did involve some element of bilateral intervention. Ten studies included in this current review were published after the searching for the <LINK REF="REF-Stewart-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 2006</LINK> review was completed (2005) (<LINK REF="STD-Cauraugh-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Cauraugh 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Desrosiers-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Desrosiers 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harris_x002d_Love-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Harris-Love 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kilbreath-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kilbreath 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lin-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lin-2009b" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2009b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lum-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lum 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morris-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Morris 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stoykov-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Stoykov 2009</LINK>).

<P>A narrative review by <LINK REF="REF-Cauraugh-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cauraugh 2005</LINK> reported the findings from a number of studies, including non-randomised studies, and concluded that favourable effects of bilateral training protocols have been found. However, <LINK REF="REF-Cauraugh-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cauraugh 2005</LINK> made no attempt to discuss the quality of the reviewed studies and the potential impact this could have on the individual study results. However, it also acknowledged that some studies have not reported enhanced performance following bilateral training. This review differs from our review as it was not systematic and did not attempt to combine studies.</P>

<P>This review has identified that there is currently insufficient evidence to make any recommendations about the relative effect of bilateral training compared to placebo, no intervention or usual care.

<P>Specific implications for research, based on the findings of this review, are outlined below.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Are further randomised controlled trials required?</HEADING>
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are required to determine the effect of:</P>
<OL>
<LI>simultaneous bilateral training compared to no treatment, placebo or usual care;</LI>
<LI>simultaneous bilateral training compared to other upper limb interventions.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Such randomised controlled trials must:</P>
<OL>
<LI>have adequate power (i.e. with an appropriate power calculation undertaken based on existing trial evidence);</LI>
<LI>have adequate allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessor and intention-to-treat analysis;</LI>
<LI>clearly define trial participants (e.g. time since stroke, initial upper limb deficits);</LI>
<LI>clearly define types, frequency, durations and intensities of bilateral training;</LI>
<LI>include global measures of functioning (i.e. performance of ADL measures) and upper limb function (e.g. Motor Assessment Scale, ARAT);</LI>
<LI>report clear and usable data.</LI>
</OL>
<P>We recommend that future RCTs concentrate on answering the specific question relating to the effectiveness of bilateral training and do not confound the answer to this question by introducing adjunct interventions such as robotics or electrical stimulation. We believe that until such time as the benefits of bilateral training as a single intervention have been established (or refuted) it is not beneficial to investigate the combined effects of bilateral training plus adjunct interventions.</P>
<P>We recommend that future RCTs should have a defined training period, and should not have a single treatment and intervention session, in order to establish the effects of actual skill acquisition (rather than mere performance). Further, we recommend that standard RCT methodology is followed, i.e. random allocation of participants to one of two groups and not random allocation to treatment order.</P>
<P>A number of RCTs are currently ongoing (see the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_ONGOING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of ongoing studies</LINK> table). Once these trials are completed it will be important to update this review, and to re-evaluate the need for further RCTs of bilateral training. If there continues to be no evidence of beneficial effects attributable to bilateral training, we would recommend that no further RCTs are carried out.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Are other primary research studies required?</HEADING>
<P>We do not recommend other study designs aimed at comparing the effectiveness of bilateral training. This review has highlighted the difficulties associated with the large number of outcome measures, which are associated with upper limb function and impairment. There is a need for further research to identify optimal outcome measures for use within future RCTs in this area.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Are further systematic reviews required?</HEADING>
<P>We do not recommend any further systematic reviews aimed at addressing the effectiveness of bilateral training. However, future updates of this review ought to consider longer-term follow-up outcomes. In addition, future updates need to consider whether the inclusion of randomised cross-over trials, or trials with only a single evaluation session, are beneficial to this evidence base.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Summary of findings</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Methodological quality of studies is in general very poor, providing insufficient high quality evidence on which to reach generalisable conclusions.</LI>
<LI>Limited evidence suggests bilateral training is no more or less effective than usual care or other upper limb interventions (unilateral interventions) for functional outcomes.</LI>
<LI>Very limited evidence shows that bilateral training is no less effective than other upper limb interventions for motor impairment outcomes.</LI>
<LI>There is not enough evidence to recommend bilateral training as clinical intervention.</LI>
<LI>Good quality RCTs are needed to compare bilateral and unilateral training.</LI>

<P>Fiona Coupar (FC) co-ordinated the review process and managed searching and main data extraction input. Fiona Coupar, Alex Pollock and Frederike van Wijck (FvW) undertook searching for trials and decided upon trial inclusion/exclusion. Jacqui Morris (JM) provided assistance with this process. All review authors assisted with data extraction and assessment of methodological quality. Peter Langhorne (PL) provided methodological advice and reviewed major drafts to ensure review quality.<BR/>

<P>The protocol stated that trial authors would be contacted to provide additional details relating to aspects of their studies. We did not contact authors to obtain any missing information.</P>
<P>The protocol stated that we would search OT Search. Following advice from the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Search Co-ordinator, we did not do this because this database now requires a subscription.</P>
<P>The protocol stated that we would identify and handsearch relevant journals and conference proceedings that had not been searched on behalf of The Cochrane Collaboration. We did not identify any relevant journals and therefore did not carry out any handsearching.</P>
<P>The protocol stated that we would exclude any studies that used assistive technologies such as robot-devices. We changed this to exclude studies which investigated assistive technologies as active treatment, but include studies that used assistive technologies as an adjunct to both the bilateral training and control intervention.</P>
<P>At the protocol stage we did not state that we would separate upper limb functional outcomes into arm and hand outcomes or that we would separate motor impairment outcomes into motor impairment scales, temporal outcomes, spatial outcomes and strength outcomes. We have explained our reasons for doing this in the text.</P>
