<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-06-18 10:31:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>
<B>Question</B>
</P>
<P>We wanted to compare the effect of routine shunting versus selective or no shunting during carotid endarterectomy, and to assess the effect of different methods for selection of people for shunting.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>About 20% of strokes result from narrowing of the carotid artery (the main artery supplying blood to the brain). Carotid endarterectomy is an operation to remove this narrowing and therefore reduce the risk of stroke. However, there is a 5% to 10% risk of the operation itself causing a stroke. The use of a silicon tube, or shunt, as a temporary bypass can reduce the length of time that blood flow to the brain is interrupted during the operation. This may reduce the risk of perioperative stroke but could also result in arterial wall damage and therefore increase the risk of stroke. Shunt surgery falls into three categories. Firstly, in routine shunting, the surgeon inserts a shunt in every patient. Secondly, in selective shunting, the surgeon only uses a shunt in patients with an inadequate blood supply to the brain following clamping; various cerebral monitoring techniques, such as ultrasound for predicting who needs a shunt, have been used in this policy. Thirdly, in no shunting, surgeons do not employ shunts at all.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We identified six studies up to August 2013, for inclusion in the review. These studies included a total of 1270 participants. Three of the trials compared routine shunting with no shunting, one trial compared routine shunting versus selective shunting, and another two trials compared different methods of monitoring in selective shunting. We have not yet identified any trials that compared selective shunting with no shunting. All the included trials assessed the use of shunting in people undergoing endarterectomy under general anaesthetic. The age of the participants ranged from 40 to 89 years, and overall, there were more male than female participants. Where reported, participants were followed up for no longer than 30 days.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>There is still no evidence for the use of a carotid shunt during carotid endarterectomy. This review suggests a benefit from the use of a shunt, but the overall results were not statistically significant. More trials are needed.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>There were significant problems with the quality of the randomised trials and, overall, the reporting of study methodology was poor.</P>

<P>To assess the effect of routine versus selective or no shunting during carotid endarterectomy, and to assess the best method for selecting people for shunting.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-06-18 10:30:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched August 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I>, 2013, Issue 8), MEDLINE (1966 to August 2013), EMBASE (1980 to August 2013) and Index to Scientific and Technical Proceedings (1980 to August 2013). We handsearched journals and conference proceedings, checked reference lists, and contacted experts in the field.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2014-03-04 15:47:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Randomised and quasi-randomised trials of routine shunting compared with no shunting or selective shunting, and trials that compared different shunting policies in people undergoing carotid endarterectomy.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-06-18 10:30:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Three review authors independently performed the searches and applied the inclusion criteria. For this update, we identified two new relevant randomised controlled trials.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-06-18 10:31:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We included six trials involving 1270 participants in the review: three trials involving 686 participants compared routine shunting with no shunting, one trial involving 200 participants compared routine shunting with selective shunting, one trial involving 253 participants compared selective shunting with and without near-infrared refractory spectroscopy monitoring, and the other trial involving 131 participants compared shunting with a combination of electroencephalographic and carotid pressure measurement with shunting by carotid pressure measurement alone. In general, reporting of methodology in the included studies was poor. For most studies, the blinding of outcome assessors and the report of prespecified outcomes were unclear. For routine versus no shunting, there was no significant difference in the rate of all stroke, ipsilateral stroke or death up to 30 days after surgery, although data were limited. No significant difference was found between the groups in terms of postoperative neurological deficit between selective shunting with and without near-infrared refractory spectroscopy monitoring, However, this analysis was inadequately powered to reliably detect the effect. There was no significant difference between the risk of ipsilateral stroke in participants selected for shunting with the combination of electroencephalographic and carotid pressure assessment compared with pressure assessment alone, although again the data were limited.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-06-03 15:30:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>This review concluded that the data available were too limited to either support or refute the use of routine or selective shunting in carotid endarterectomy. Large scale randomised trials of routine shunting versus selective shunting are required. No method of monitoring in selective shunting has been shown to produce better outcomes.</P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2014-06-18 10:32:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-06-18 10:31:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-06-03 15:49:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Around 20% of people presenting with a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or non-disabling stroke have significant stenosis with unstable atheromatous plaque at or around the bifurcation of the ipsilateral carotid artery. This plaque can lead to the formation of emboli, which may cause a stroke. Carotid endarterectomy is an operation to remove this stenosis together with unstable plaque and, therefore, decrease the risk of stroke.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-06-03 15:51:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Carotid endarterectomy has been shown in large, well-conducted randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to substantially reduce the relative risk of stroke in people with recent TIAs or minor strokes related to severe symptomatic carotid artery stenosis (<LINK REF="REF-ECST-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">ECST 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NASCET-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">NASCET 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rerkasem-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rerkasem 2011</LINK>). To a lesser extent, benefit has also been shown for moderate symptomatic carotid artery stenosis (<LINK REF="REF-Rerkasem-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rerkasem 2011</LINK>). In these trials, the benefits were seen despite a stroke and death rate, within 30 days of the operation, of between 5% to 10%. Most of these strokes occurred during, or within, a few days of surgery, and were presumably related to surgery. More recently, it has been shown that people with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis of greater than 60% may also benefit from carotid endarterectomy, but this relies on an average 30-day stroke and death rate of 3% or less (<LINK REF="REF-ACAS-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACAS 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ACST-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACST 2004</LINK>). Reducing the risk of perioperative stroke and death should therefore increase the number of people who can benefit from carotid endarterectomy. Most of the perioperative strokes are ischaemic and some (especially those that occur during the operation) may be caused by the temporary interruption of blood flow during the procedure whilst the carotid artery is clamped. This reduction in blood flow should be avoided if an intraluminal shunt is placed across the clamped section of the artery and this may reduce the perioperative stroke rate. When carotid endarterectomy is performed under local anaesthetic about 10% to 20% of people develop a transient neurological deficit after the artery is clamped, in which case the vast majority of surgeons would regard a shunt as mandatory. However, the routine or selective use of intraluminal shunting in carotid endarterectomy under general anaesthetic is more controversial. The publication of the results of the GALA trial has shown that the operative risk of stroke and death due to endarterectomy under local anaesthetic versus general anaesthetic is similar and so many operations will continue to be done under general anaesthetic (<LINK REF="REF-Lewis-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 2008</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-06-18 10:31:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Some advocate that routine shunting for all operations be done under general anaesthetic on the assumption that it reduces the risk of perioperative ischaemic strokes; it may also reduce the risk of minor cerebral ischaemic damage, and it also allows the surgeon time to perform an unhurried carotid endarterectomy or to teach a trainee carefully and in an unhurried manner (<LINK REF="REF-Javid-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Javid 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thompson-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 1979</LINK>). Others advocate the selective use of shunting only in people who are at high risk of developing cerebral ischaemia during carotid clamping, but there is no consensus on how to identify which people need a shunt. Methods used to select which people to shunt include: using preoperative features such as a previous ipsilateral stroke or a contralateral carotid occlusion (<LINK REF="REF-Buche-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buche 1988</LINK>); using indirect assessments of cerebral blood flow during the operation by monitoring electroencephalographic (EEG) activity (<LINK REF="REF-Whittemore-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whittemore 1983</LINK>), somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) (<LINK REF="REF-Schweiger-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schweiger 1988</LINK>), carotid stump back pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Ricotta-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ricotta 1983</LINK>), or combinations of these; using direct assessments of cerebral blood flow during the operation using intra-arterial radio-labelled xenon (<LINK REF="REF-Sundt-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sundt 1986</LINK>), or transcranial Doppler (<LINK REF="REF-Steiger-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steiger 1989</LINK>); and assessing the development of new neurological signs in awake patients who have their endarterectomy performed under local anaesthetic (<LINK REF="REF-Benjamin-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benjamin 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Connolly-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Connolly 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Evans-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 1985</LINK>).</P>
<P>None of these monitoring techniques are perfect. Studies in people having endarterectomies performed under local anaesthetic have shown that both EEG monitoring and carotid stump pressure assessment may be normal in 6% to 30% of those who develop neurological signs and that they may be abnormal in 3% to 11% of those who do not develop signs of ischaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Benjamin-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benjamin 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Connolly-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Connolly 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Evans-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 1985</LINK>). Many of these techniques also require additional technology and expert interpretation and so may not be practical in many situations. In addition, shunting may be associated with complications such as air embolism, plaque embolism, dissection of the carotid artery, acute occlusion of the carotid artery, and it also lengthens the time of the procedure and may make it technically more difficult (<LINK REF="REF-Green-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ott-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ott 1980</LINK>). All of these factors may be associated, paradoxically, with an increased risk of perioperative stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Salvian-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salvian 1997</LINK>). Several authors have, therefore, argued that shunting should be avoided (<LINK REF="REF-Ott-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ott 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prioleau-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prioleau 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reddy-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reddy 1987</LINK>). Shunting could also be associated with other complications due to increased manipulation of the artery such as an increased risk of cranial nerve palsy (<LINK REF="REF-Forssell-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forssell 1995</LINK>), arterial haemorrhage or infection, or long-term restenosis, perhaps because of intimal damage leading to intimal hyperplasia (<LINK REF="REF-Ouriel-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ouriel 1987</LINK>), but accurate data on these risks are limited at present.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-06-18 10:31:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The lack of good evidence to support the use of shunts is reflected by a considerable variation in surgical practice. For UK surgeons (N = 76) performing carotid endarterectomy under general anaesthesia, a shunt was always, never, or selectively used by 73.6%, 4.2% and 22.2% respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Girn-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Girn 2008</LINK>). An earlier survey from North America showed that about one-third of carotid endarterectomies were performed with routine shunting, one-third with selective shunting and one-third without shunting (<LINK REF="REF-Fode-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fode 1986</LINK>). Data from the European Carotid Surgery Trialists (ECST) showed highly significant variation in shunting practices for endarterectomy done under general anaesthetic both between individual surgeons and between countries (both P &lt; 0.001) (<LINK REF="REF-Bond-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bond 2002</LINK>). For example, shunts were used in 89% of operations performed in Germany versus 41% performed in Finland and 1% of those performed in France.</P>
<P>The best way to determine the perioperative (and long-term) risks and benefits of shunting during carotid endarterectomy is to compare shunting with no shunting in RCTs. We, therefore, reviewed all such trials, and the trials comparing different methods of selecting which people under general anaesthetic require selective shunting. A comparison of local versus general anaesthetic is dealt with in a separate review (<LINK REF="REF-Vaniyapong--2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vaniyapong 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>This is an update of a Cochrane Review originally published in 1996 and previously updated in 2009.</P>

Also, although people who were asymptomatic were included in some studies, the data were not available in sufficient detail to allow separate analysis of the outcomes of carotid endarterectomy in people with symptoms and those without symptoms. However, it is unlikely that the relative effect of shunting versus no shunting varied qualitatively with symptom status.</P>

<INCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR MODIFIED="2014-06-05 12:06:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>In the included six trials, we identified three trials (including 686 participants) that compared routine shunting with no shunting (<LINK REF="STD-Gumerlock-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Gumerlock 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Palombo-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Palombo 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sandmann-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sandmann 1993</LINK>). One RCT compared the results of routine shunting versus selective shunting based on stump pressure. Two hundred participants were randomised into routine shunting (98 participants) or selective shunting (102 participants). In the selective shunting group, shunting was used only if systolic stump pressure was less than 40 mmHg. Clinical and demographic characteristics were comparable in both groups. In the selective shunting group, shunting was used in 29 participants (28%) (<LINK REF="STD-AbuRahma-2010" TYPE="STUDY">AbuRahma 2010</LINK>). The other two trials compared monitoring methods in selective shunting: <LINK REF="STD-Fletcher-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Fletcher 1988</LINK> (131 participants) compared the use of EEG monitoring combined with an assessment of the carotid stump back pressure with carotid back pressure assessment alone. In the former group, a shunt was only inserted if both the EEG showed significant ipsilateral change within three minutes of clamping and the carotid pressure was less than 50 mmHg, whilst in the latter group a shunt was inserted if the pressure was less than 50 mmHg; <LINK REF="STD-Zogogiannis-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Zogogiannis 2011</LINK> (253 participants) evaluated whether the use of an intraoperative algorithm based on cerebral oximetry with NIRS monitoring, could help in the intraoperative decision for shunt placement, in people undergoing carotid endarterectomy. We have not yet identified any trials that compared selective shunting with no shunting. All trials looked at the use of shunting in people having carotid endarterectomy under general anaesthetic.</P>

<P>One of the six RCTs was published in a journal as a 'Letter to the editor' (<LINK REF="STD-Sandmann-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sandmann 1993</LINK>). For this study, only limited data from the short letter were available. In general, reporting of methodology was poor. The overall results of the 'Risk of bias' analysis are summarised in <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>.</P>
<ALLOCATION MODIFIED="2014-06-18 10:31:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Allocation by randomisation was reported in all studies; however, only three studies reported the method of randomisation. This included odd/even hospital number (<LINK REF="STD-Gumerlock-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Gumerlock 1988</LINK>), computer randomisation (<LINK REF="STD-Palombo-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Palombo 2007</LINK>), and sequentially-numbered sealed envelopes (<LINK REF="STD-Sandmann-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sandmann 1993</LINK>). The methods used for randomisation in the remaining trials were unclear. <LINK REF="STD-Gumerlock-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Gumerlock 1988</LINK> was not truly randomised as it used the patient hospital record number to allocate participants. There was an imbalance in the numbers of participants in each group in this trial (53 shunt versus 65 no shunt), which may have been due to selective inclusion of participants, although it was reported that consecutive patients were entered.</P>
</ALLOCATION>
<BLINDING MODIFIED="2014-06-18 10:31:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Most studies did not report on blinding of participants, surgical teams and assessors to the randomised treatment allocation. In two trials, outcomes were assessed by independent neurologists (<LINK REF="STD-Sandmann-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sandmann 1993</LINK>) and psychologists (<LINK REF="STD-Palombo-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Palombo 2007</LINK>), but <LINK REF="STD-Palombo-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Palombo 2007</LINK> did not report whether these independent assessors knew the randomisation code.</P>
</BLINDING>
<EXCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-06-18 10:31:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Most studies did not report loss-to-follow-up or missing data except <LINK REF="STD-Sandmann-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sandmann 1993</LINK>. There was no available information in this trial to indicate the loss to follow-up. Potentially important outcomes were not measured, such as stroke severity in terms of functional outcome, and long-term restenosis rate. One trial measured post-operative cognitive function (<LINK REF="STD-Palombo-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Palombo 2007</LINK>). In addition, one trial randomised arteries rather than patients (<LINK REF="STD-Sandmann-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sandmann 1993</LINK>), and the number of participants who had only unilateral procedures was not available by treatment group despite contact with the principal trialist. Overall, 441 participants had unilateral procedures and so we had to assume that these participants were roughly equally divided between the two treatment groups (the number of arteries randomised in each group was similar). In this trial the numbers of stroke-related deaths, strokes during surgery, and ipsilateral strokes were not reported by treatment group (and these data were not available from the authors). Therefore, we performed best- and worst-case analyses for these outcomes. This was possible because the total number of each of these events was known, as was the total number of deaths and strokes by treatment group. The best-case analysis assumed that the smallest possible number of events occurred in the shunted group, whilst the worst-case analysis assumed that the smallest number of events occurred in the unshunted group.</P>

<SELECTIVE_REPORTING MODIFIED="2014-06-18 10:31:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Most studies did not indicate prespecified outcomes or report all prespecified outcomes. Only two studies reported all expected outcomes that were prespecified (<LINK REF="STD-Palombo-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Palombo 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zogogiannis-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Zogogiannis 2011</LINK>).</P>

<OTHER_BIAS_SOURCES MODIFIED="2014-06-18 10:31:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Regarding allocation concealment, two trials used sealed envelopes that were opened just before surgery (<LINK REF="STD-AbuRahma-2010" TYPE="STUDY">AbuRahma 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sandmann-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sandmann 1993</LINK>). However, it was not reported if these were opaque. In the other four trials, the method of concealment of allocation was unclear.</P>
<P>We were not able to assess other biases, including measurement bias and funding bias in all studies.</P>
<P>Among the three trials comparing shunt versus no shunt (<LINK REF="STD-Gumerlock-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Gumerlock 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Palombo-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Palombo 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sandmann-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sandmann 1993</LINK>), one trial monitored participants in the unshunted group using EEG and SEP, and during the trial it was decided that participants randomised to no shunt should be shunted if they showed evidence of ipsilateral ischaemia (<LINK REF="STD-Sandmann-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sandmann 1993</LINK>). Hence 3% of all operations in the no shunt group were in fact performed using a shunt. By comparison, in <LINK REF="STD-Gumerlock-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Gumerlock 1988</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sandmann-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sandmann 1993</LINK> combined, 12% of the operations that were randomised to the shunt group were performed without shunting for technical reasons (usually because of difficulty in inserting a shunt). The most recent trial used stump pressure measurement and participants with stump pressure less than 50 mmHg required shunting (<LINK REF="STD-Palombo-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Palombo 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>The treatment groups were generally comparable in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Gumerlock-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Gumerlock 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Palombo-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Palombo 2007</LINK>). In one trial, those in the shunted group had more severe disease in the contralateral artery, which may have biased the results against shunting (<LINK REF="STD-Gumerlock-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Gumerlock 1988</LINK>). The comparability of the groups with respect to age, sex, and vascular risk factors were not available for another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Sandmann-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sandmann 1993</LINK>). However, there were imbalances in the surgical technique in this trial. Patching was performed more frequently in the shunted group (57% versus 39%). In addition, plication, resection or vein interposition was performed at the end of the operation to ensure laminar flow on Doppler, and these were performed more frequently in the unshunted group (56% versus 39%). This trial also noted that the outcome appeared to be better when the operation was performed by a more senior surgeon, and yet the experience of the surgeons was not given by treatment group. Neither trial reported on whether antithrombotic agents were used pre- or post-operatively.</P>
<P>There were other problems with the trials. Participants undergoing bilateral endarterectomies were included, and in one trial it was possible to be randomised twice to different operations (<LINK REF="STD-Sandmann-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sandmann 1993</LINK>). The results of this trial were reported by artery rather than participant, which made analysis of the results using patient-based denominators (death or any stroke) difficult. Data on the comparability of the participants in this trial were not available and some outcomes were not reported by treatment group.</P>

<P>NB. We had to calculate best- and worst-case scenarios for some outcomes because the number of events in each treatment group was not available for one trial.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Deaths within 30 days of surgery</HEADING>
<P>The overall risk of deaths in participants who had unilateral operations or bilateral operations using the same procedure was 1.5% (10/655). All deaths were either due to stroke or coronary artery disease. There was a trend favouring a lower death rate in the shunted group but this was not significant (odds ratio (OR) 0.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13 to 1.59) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Only four patients died of stroke-related deaths (0.6%), so although there was a trend toward fewer stroke deaths in the shunted group, these data were not reliable (best case: <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>; worst case: <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Any stroke (fatal or non-fatal, ischaemic or haemorrhagic, ipsilateral or contralateral, carotid or vertebrobasilar)</HEADING>
<P>During surgery, the risk of stroke during surgery in both treatment groups combined was 2.7% (18/655). The best- and worst-case analyses gave qualitatively different results (that is, shunting was associated with a non-significant 58% reduction or 32% increase in the odds of stroke respectively) highlighting the instability of the data due to small numbers (best case: <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>; worst case: <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>).</P>
<P>During surgery or within 24 hours of surgery, data were available from only two trials, of which one trial showed a significant reduction in the risk of stroke with shunting (<LINK REF="STD-Gumerlock-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Gumerlock 1988</LINK>), and the other trial reported no stroke in either treatment group (<LINK REF="STD-Palombo-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Palombo 2007</LINK>). The pooled result showed a significant reduction in the risk of stroke with shunting (OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.78). However, this result is based on only six strokes in total and so is not reliable (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>).</P>
<P>During surgery or within 30 days of surgery, the overall risk of stroke within 30 days of surgery was 4.0% (26/655). There was a non-significant trend towards fewer strokes in the shunted group but the confidence interval was wide (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.69) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Ipsilateral stroke (fatal and non-fatal, ischaemic and haemorrhagic)</HEADING>
<P>During surgery, all strokes that occurred during surgery were ipsilateral. The risk of ipsilateral stroke in both groups combined was 2.4 per 100 operations (18/737). Again, the best- and worst-case analyses gave qualitatively different results (OR 0.42 and 1.32 respectively), although neither was significant (best case: <LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>; worst case: <LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>) .</P>
<P>During surgery or within 30 days of surgery, the risk of ipsilateral stroke was 3.0 per 100 operations (22/737). There was a trend for fewer strokes in the shunted group in both the best- and worst-case analyses (OR 0.41 and 0.88 respectively) but again, the small number of events makes these results difficult to interpret (best case: <LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>; worst case: <LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Death or stroke within 30 days of surgery</HEADING>
<P>The risk of death or stroke in patients (with unilateral or bilateral identical operations only) was 4.9% (32/655) overall. The best- and worst-case analyses showed non-significant trends favouring shunting (OR 0.62 and 0.81 respectively) but once again, the confidence intervals were wide (best case: <LINK REF="CMP-001.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.12</LINK>; worst case: <LINK REF="CMP-001.13" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.13</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Other complications</HEADING>
<P>The risks of wound haemorrhage or arterial rupture (0.3%) and wound infection (0.2%) were too small to reliably detect any difference between the two treatment groups. Nerve palsies were only recorded in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Gumerlock-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Gumerlock 1988</LINK>) and no significant difference was found between the two groups (3.6% risk overall) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.14</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.15" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.15</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.16" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.16</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Cognitive function</HEADING>
<P>In the most recent trial, all participants underwent neuropsychological testing before the operation and three weeks after surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Palombo-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Palombo 2007</LINK>).

<P>A single randomised controlled trial compared the results of routine shunting versus selective shunting based on stump pressure (<LINK REF="STD-AbuRahma-2010" TYPE="STUDY">AbuRahma 2010</LINK>).There were no significant differences in clinical outcome between routine shunting and selective shunting. The perioperative stroke rate was 0% for routine shunting versus 2% for selective shunting (one major and one minor stroke, both related to carotid thrombosis) No participants died perioperatively. Combined perioperative TIA and stroke rates were 2% in routine shunting versus 2.9% in selective shunting.

<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Fletcher-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Fletcher 1988</LINK> the risks of stroke or death per participant were not available from the published report. Five participants had a stroke within 24 hours of surgery (a risk of 3.5 per 100 operations.) There was no significant difference between combined EEG monitoring and carotid pressure assessment and carotid pressure assessment alone. In the combined monitoring group, two of the three strokes occurred in participants with abnormal EEGs who were not shunted because the carotid artery pressure was greater than 50 mmHg. The other stroke occurred in a participant with a normal EEG and a carotid pressure of greater than 55 mmHg. In the group with carotid stump pressure assessment alone, the two strokes occurred in participants with pressures greater than 55 mmHg. The risk of wound haemorrhage was too low (2.8%) to reliably detect any difference between the treatment groups. The risk of nerve palsies was higher (7.7%) but there was no apparent difference between the two groups. Combined monitoring results in about 50% fewer shunts being inserted (12 per 100 operations) than carotid artery pressure assessment alone (26 per 100 operations), but the numbers were small and so are not reliable.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Zogogiannis-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Zogogiannis 2011</LINK> evaluated whether the use of an intraoperative algorithm based on cerebral oximetry with NIRS monitoring could help in the intraoperative decision for shunt placement, in people undergoing carotid endarterectomy. Two hundred and fifty-three participants who underwent carotid endarterectomy under general anaesthesia were randomly allocated to Group A (83 participants) using NIRS monitoring and the suggested algorithm, Group B (84 participants) using NIRS monitoring without the algorithm and Group C (86 participants) who served as controls. Shunt placement criterion for Groups A and B was a 20% drop in ipsilateral regional saturation from the baseline value recorded before surgery. The rate of shunting was 27.7% in group A, 59.5% in group B and 100% in group C. Regarding the rate of postoperative neurologic deficits, no significant difference was found between the three groups. This study concluded that the use of a specific algorithm based on NIRS monitoring, in people undergoing carotid endarterectomy, may reduce the rate for shunt placement. However, no significant effect of the reduced rate of shunting on the rate of neurological deficit was found.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2014-06-18 10:32:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Since the previous publication of this review there have been several new studies reporting the outcome of routine versus selective shunting in people undergoing carotid endarterectomy. However, most of these have been retrospective studies comparing the outcome of participants operated before and after a change in policy of shunt use (<A HREF="http://www.archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1405251659422975486518551465694&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Bond-2002">Bond 2002</A>; <LINK REF="REF-Goodney-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodney 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nguyen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nguyen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Woodworth-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woodworth 2007</LINK>). Only two trials met the criteria for inclusion in this review (<A HREF="http://www.archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1405251659422975486518551465694&amp;format=REVMAN#STD-AbuRahma-2010">AbuRahma 2010</A>; <A HREF="http://www.archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1405251659422975486518551465694&amp;format=REVMAN#STD-Zogogiannis-2011">Zogogiannis 2011</A>).</P>
<P>Of the six included trials, we identified three trials that compared routine shunting with no shunting (<A HREF="http://www.archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1405251659422975486518551465694&amp;format=REVMAN#STD-Gumerlock-1988">Gumerlock 1988</A>; <A HREF="http://www.archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1405251659422975486518551465694&amp;format=REVMAN#STD-Palombo-2007">Palombo 2007</A>; <A HREF="http://www.archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1405251659422975486518551465694&amp;format=REVMAN#STD-Sandmann-1993">Sandmann 1993</A>); only these three trials could be included in the meta-analysis. Two trials compared different monitoring methods in selective shunting (<LINK REF="STD-Fletcher-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Fletcher 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zogogiannis-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Zogogiannis 2011</LINK>), and one trial compared routine shunting with selective shunting (<LINK REF="STD-AbuRahma-2010" TYPE="STUDY">AbuRahma 2010</LINK>). This trial showed no significant differences between routine shunting and selective shunting; however, too few outcomes were reported to detect any difference in the number of outcomes, especially strokes, between the two groups. More trials are needed.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-03-05 12:26:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The data from RCTs on the use of routine shunting were limited. There were promising but non-significant trends favouring a reduction in stroke-related deaths within 30 days of surgery with routine shunting.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-06-05 13:41:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>These analyses were based on very small numbers of outcome events. A large multicentre randomised trial is required to assess whether shunting reduces the risk of perioperative and long-term death and stroke. Even a modest 25% reduction in the relative risk of perioperative stroke or death would result in approximately 15 fewer strokes and deaths per 1000 people undergoing endarterectomy. However, detecting this reliably (80% power, 5% significance level) would require between 3000 and 5000 participants. The duration of follow-up in the included trials was very short. The main aim of shunting is to reduce the risk of perioperative stroke but it could possibly be associated with an increased risk of restenosis and late recurrent stroke. This risk was not assessed in the included trials.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-03-05 12:28:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>There were significant problems with the quality of the randomised trials. The method used for allocation concealment was inadequately reported in most of the included studies. The duration of follow-up was short in all included studies. It was also unclear in most of the studies whether the outcomes had been assessed blind to treatment allocation. It is well known that studies that have neurologists as assessors are associated with higher stroke and death rates (<LINK REF="REF-Rerkasem-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rerkasem 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rothwell-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rothwell 1996</LINK>). Only two studies reported that they had independent assessors (psychologists, neurologists) (<LINK REF="STD-Palombo-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Palombo 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sandmann-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sandmann 1993</LINK>). Five of the trials reported complete outcome data.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2014-06-18 10:31:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>There were several potential biases such as many cross-overs, imbalance in baseline characteristics and unavailable data for important baseline characteristics. These reduced the reliability of these results.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2014-06-18 10:32:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Our results showed that there were promising but non-significant trends favouring a reduction in both deaths and strokes within 30 days of surgery with the routine shunting policy. Opponents of this policy argue that insertion of a shunt can cause intimal injuries, embolisation, and difficulty in visualising the endpoint of endarterectomy, and that there might be a reduced incidence of stroke due to technical mistakes in patients who are not shunted (<LINK REF="REF-Halsey-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halsey 1992</LINK>). However, accurate data on these risks appear limited and anecdotal. In contrast, many studies reported that routine shunting by experienced surgeons results in a low rate of shunt-induced problems, and a low rate of stroke and death, and is a cost-effective procedure (<LINK REF="REF-Hamdan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamdan 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hertzer-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hertzer 1997</LINK>). Routine shunting avoids the need for test clamping of the common carotid artery (awake testing), which alone can cause embolic stroke. Also, routine shunting obviates the need to intubate urgently, which may force an attempt to place the shunt under less than ideal conditions, possibly raising the risk of technical errors.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Selective shunting versus no shunting</HEADING>
<P>There are no data currently available from RCTs regarding the benefits (or hazards) of selective shunting versus no shunting. </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Comparison of different methods of monitoring in selective shunting</HEADING>
<P>Again, the data from randomised trials on which method should be used to select patients for selective shunting were very limited. We only identified two trials. The first trial (131 patients) compared the use of EEG monitoring combined with an assessment of the carotid stump back pressure with carotid back pressure assessment alone (<LINK REF="STD-Fletcher-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Fletcher 1988</LINK>). This study was small and did not report details of randomisation, blinding of outcome assessment and the numbers of participants in each group. Too few outcomes were reported to detect any difference in the number of strokes in the group that received EEG and carotid pressure assessment compared with the group that received carotid pressure assessment alone. However, from this limited data EEG monitoring did appear more sensitive to cerebral ischaemia than carotid stump pressure: two strokes occurred during the operation in participants who had EEG changes but whose carotid stump pressure remained greater than 50 mmHg, whilst no participants had reduced pressure without EEG changes. Combined EEG and pressure monitoring may reduce the number of shunts inserted but it is difficult to interpret these data without reliable evidence that this method of monitoring does not increase the risk of stroke. In addition, if EEG monitoring is not associated with fewer strokes, the costs of extra EEG monitoring may outweigh the costs saved by inserting fewer shunts.</P>
<P>The second trial assessed whether the use of an intraoperative algorithm based on cerebral oximetry with NIRS monitoring could help in the intraoperative decision for shunt placement, in people undergoing carotid endarterectomy (253 participants) (<LINK REF="STD-Zogogiannis-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Zogogiannis 2011</LINK>). Two hundred and fifty-three participants, who underwent CEA under general anaesthesia, were randomly allocated to Group A using NIRS monitoring and the suggested algorithm, Group B using NIRS monitoring without the algorithm and Group C who served as controls. This study was small and did not report details of randomisation, allocation concealment, blinding of the participants and personnel as well as outcome assessment. Shunt placement criterion for Group A and B was a 20% drop in ipsilateral regional saturation from the baseline value recorded before surgery. The rate of shunting was 27.7% in group A, 59.5% in group B and 100% in group C.  For the rate of postoperative neurologic deficits, no significant difference was found between the three groups. However, too few outcomes (13 participants) were reported to detect any difference in the number of strokes in each group.</P>
<P>There are many other methods of monitoring for cerebral ischaemia that may be more sensitive than EEG, carotid pressure monitoring and NIRS but these have not been subjected to assessment in RCTs. The key question is not whether these methods can reliably detect cerebral ischaemia but whether shunting in these people results in lower perioperative morbidity and case fatality.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-06-18 10:32:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-03-05 12:44:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>There is still insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the use of routine shunting in carotid endarterectomy, although a clinically important benefit from routine shunting cannot be excluded. There is no reliable evidence at present to support the use of selective shunting. In those who wish to use selective shunting in people under general anaesthetic, there is again little evidence to support the use of one form of monitoring over another. Much more data are required to prove this.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-06-18 10:32:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>A large multicentre randomised trial is required to assess whether shunting reduces the risk of perioperative and long-term death and stroke. Even a modest 25% reduction in the relative risk of perioperative stroke or death would result in approximately 15 fewer strokes and deaths per 1000 people undergoing endarterectomy. However, to detect this reliably (80% power, 5% significance level) would require between 3000 and 5000 participants. Two policies could be considered: routine shunting for all people undergoing carotid endarterectomy or selective shunting in those at high risk of intraoperative cerebral ischaemia. The trial would have to be truly randomised, have long-term follow-up (several years) and have blinded outcome assessment preferably by neurologists. Patients should be stratified by age, sex, degree of ipsilateral and contralateral internal carotid stenosis, the experience of the surgeon, the use of patching and, in selective shunting, the method of monitoring of cerebral ischaemia.</P>
<P>As regards the method of monitoring in selective shunting, until the efficacy of shunting has been demonstrated, further trials of the method of monitoring are probably not merited. However, a systematic review of the sensitivity and specificity of the various methods of monitoring for cerebral ischaemia would be worthwhile to identify the best method of monitoring to be used in any trial of selective shunting (<LINK REF="REF-Irwig-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irwig 1994</LINK>).</P>

<P>Quote: "All CEs were performed by either the attending neurosurgeon or by a senior neurosurgical resident under direct supervision". No data showed the percentage of operations done by residents in each arm. Obviously residents had less experience than the attending physician, even though such operations were done under direct supervision. This might be a risk of bias, if there was a significant proportion of residents as operators in 1 group</P>
