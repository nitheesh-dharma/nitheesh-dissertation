<DESCRIPTION>
<P>2006, Issue 4: The original Cochrane Review of malaria vaccines (Graves 2003) has been divided into three parts for pre-erythrocytic vaccines, SPf66 vaccine, and blood-stage vaccines. This review includes the trials of pre-erythrocytic vaccines. The CS-NANP and RTS,S trials from Graves 2003 are included; one trial of CS-NANP vaccine from Nigeria has been reclassified as a multi-stage vaccine (CS/5.1) and will be included in a future Cochrane Review for multi-stage vaccines. Six new trials have been added to this review: one of a new vaccine CS102; one of a new vaccine ME-TRAP; two safety trials of RTS,S; and two efficacy trials of RTS,S. With the addition of new field trials, it became apparent that there was heterogeneity between trials that used experimental and natural challenge, and these have been subgrouped in this review. The text of the review has been extensively updated and revised, and meta-analysis is now done with risk ratio as the default statistic.</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-08-04 11:14:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Malaria is a parasitic disease spread by mosquitoes. It affects millions of people worldwide and causes significant illness and mortality. The symptoms of uncomplicated malaria include fever, headache, muscle pain, and vomiting; and children commonly present also with rapid breathing, cough, and convulsions. Severe malaria leads to unconsciousness and death. Uncomplicated malaria can almost always be cured with appropriate drugs, given soon after symptoms appear, but in small children in particular, progression and death can come within 48 hours. The hope &#8722; bolstered by several decades of increasingly promising research &#8722; remains that one or more vaccines to prevent malaria will augment the existing malaria control tools. The expectation is that successful vaccines will decrease malaria incidence, but because of the complexity of the organism and other factors, protection will not be complete. The malaria parasite develops through several phases in the human body that evoke different immunologic responses, and vaccines for all phases are under development. This review looks at vaccines targeted at the 'pre-erythrocytic' phase of the parasite's life, the phase before the parasites first enter the bloodstream from the liver. Trials of four types of vaccine against <I>P. falciparum,</I> the most important human malaria species, were available for this review. One of these (the RTS,S vaccine) significantly reduced the number of episodes of clinical malaria and severe malaria in children, while the other three vaccines were not effective under the conditions of the trials. No severe adverse events observed following the RTS,S vaccination were judged to be related to vaccination, though minor adverse events like headache, swelling, and malaise were.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2008-08-04 11:20:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Vaccines against all stages of the malaria parasite are in development, mainly for <I>Plasmodium falciparum</I>, which causes the most serious form of malaria. Pre-erythrocytic vaccines act to prevent or delay a malaria attack by attacking the sporozoite and liver stages before the parasite reaches the bloodstream.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the efficacy and safety of pre-erythrocytic malaria vaccines against any type of human malaria.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>In March 2006, we searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2006, Issue 1), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and the Science Citation Index. We also searched conference proceedings and reference lists of articles, and contacted organizations and researchers in the field.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomized controlled trials comparing pre-erythrocytic vaccines with placebo, control vaccine, or routine antimalarial control measures in people of any age receiving an artificial challenge or natural exposure to malaria infection.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-08-04 11:20:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Both authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Results of meta-analyses were expressed as risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using an intention-to-treat analysis.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Nine safety and efficacy trials, and two safety trials, with over 3000 participants were included. In semi-immune children, RTS,S vaccine reduced clinical episodes of malaria by 26% (95% CI 13% to 37%) and severe malaria by 58% (95% CI 15% to 79%) for up to 18 months. Prevalence of parasitaemia was also reduced by 26% (95% CI 11% to 38%) at six months after immunization. RTS,S also reduced clinical malaria episodes by 63% (95% CI 18% to 83%) in semi-immune adult men in the second year of follow up after a booster dose. No severe adverse events were judged to be related to RTS,S vaccine, although the frequencies of injection site pain, swelling, arm motion limitation, headache, and malaise were increased in the vaccine groups. There was no evidence for effect of the CS-NANP vaccines (307 participants, 3 trials), CS102 peptide vaccine (14 participants, 1 trial), or the ME-TRAP vaccine (372 participants, 1 trial).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>RTS,S vaccine was effective in preventing a significant number of clinical malaria episodes, including good protection against severe malaria in children for 18 months. No severe adverse events were attributable to the vaccine. Progression of this vaccine towards licensing is justified while efforts to increase its efficacy continue. The other vaccines do not look promising and further research is a priority.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-08-04 11:14:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Malaria is a severe and debilitating disease caused by the parasitic protozoan <I>Plasmodium</I>, which is transmitted by many species of anopheline mosquitoes. Four <I>Plasmodium </I>species infect humans. <I>Plasmodium falciparum</I> is the most widespread and also the most serious and potentially fatal form. Recent estimates of the annual number of clinical malaria cases worldwide range from 214 to 397 million (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Breman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Breman 2004</LINK>), although a higher estimate of 515 million (range 300 to 660 million) clinical cases of <I>P. falciparum</I> in 2002 has been proposed (<LINK REF="REF-Snow-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Snow 2005</LINK>). Estimates of annual mortality (nearly all from <I>P. falciparum</I> malaria) are thought to be around 1.1 million (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Breman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Breman 2004</LINK>). Malaria deaths are believed to account for 3% of the world's total Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) lost and 10% of DALYs in Africa (<LINK REF="REF-Breman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Breman 2004</LINK>). Malaria also significantly increases the risk of childhood death from other causes (<LINK REF="REF-Snow-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Snow 2004</LINK>). Almost half of the world's population live in areas where they are exposed to risk of malaria (<LINK REF="REF-Hay-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hay 2004</LINK>); increasing numbers of visitors to endemic areas are also at risk.</P>
<P>Despite continued efforts to control malaria, it remains a major health problem in many regions of the world. The number of drugs remaining effective is limited, and new ways to prevent the disease are urgently needed. Currently the major methods used to prevent malaria in endemic areas are impregnated mosquito nets and indoor residual spraying. Vaccines are widely considered a necessary component for the complete success of malaria control, but it is likely that vaccines will need to be used in conjunction with these other methods rather than replacing them completely. Early optimism for vaccines was tempered as the problems caused by genetic (hence, antigenic) variability of the parasite and the difficulty of generating high levels of durable immunity emerged. Recently, hope has been renewed by the development of several new vaccine candidates and delivery systems, as well as new formulations and adjuvants for previously existing candidates (<LINK REF="REF-Ballou-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballou 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moorthy-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moorthy 2004a</LINK>). Vaccines currently under evaluation include recombinant proteins, synthetic peptides (including multiple antigen peptides), DNA vaccines, inactivated whole parasites, and vaccines comprising mixtures of a large variety of potential antigens. All vaccines discussed in this review are candidate vaccines only, since no malaria vaccines are currently licensed in any country.</P>
<P>To be effective, a malaria vaccine could either prevent infection altogether or mitigate against severe disease and death in those who become infected despite vaccination. Four stages of the malaria parasite's life cycle have been the targets of vaccine development efforts. The first two stages are often grouped as 'pre-erythrocytic stages' (ie before the parasite invades the human red blood cells): these are the sporozoites inoculated by the mosquito into the human bloodstream; and the parasites developing inside human liver cells. The other two targets are the stage when the parasite is invading or growing in the red blood cells (blood, merozoite, or erythrocytic stage); and the gametocyte stage, when the parasites emerge from red blood cells and fuse to form a zygote inside the mosquito vector (gametocyte, gamete, or sexual stage). Vaccines based on the pre-erythrocytic stages usually aim to completely prevent infection, while blood-stage vaccines aim to reduce (and preferably eliminate) the parasite load once a person has been infected. Gametocyte vaccines would prevent the parasite being transmitted to others through mosquitoes. Ideally, a vaccine effective at all these parasite stages is desirable (<LINK REF="REF-Richie-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richie 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Given the complexity and wide range of malaria vaccines under development, we have chosen to consider them in three categories: pre-erythrocytic vaccines (the subject of this review); SPf66 vaccine; and blood-stage vaccines. Future Cochrane Reviews may consider transmission-blocking and multi-stage vaccines when these are tested. The SPf66 vaccine was the first to be tested extensively (<LINK REF="REF-Graves-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graves 2006a</LINK>). SPf66 was ineffective in Africa (five trials) and Asia (one trial). It had marginal efficacy in South America (four trials). It is no longer being tested and development towards commercialization is not taking place. However, it is possible that new formulations of SPf66 or combinations with other antigens will be developed in the future.</P>
<P>One blood-stage vaccine has advanced to Phase 2 trials, but it showed limited efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-Graves-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graves 2006b</LINK>). This is currently a highly active area of research and new blood-stage vaccine trials will be described in future updates of the blood-stage vaccine Cochrane Review as they become available.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Pre-erythrocytic vaccines</HEADING>
<P>This review includes the randomized trials conducted to date on the efficacy of four types of pre-erythrocytic vaccines: CS-NANP; CS102; RTS,S; and ME-TRAP.</P>
<P>The CS-NANP-based pre-erythrocytic vaccines were the first to be tested, beginning in the 1980s. The vaccines used in the first trials comprised three different formulations of the four amino acid B-cell epitope NANP, which is present as multiple repeats in the circumsporozoite protein covering the surface of the sporozoites of <I>P. falciparum</I>. The number of NANP repeats in these vaccines varied from three to 19, and three different carrier proteins were used.</P>
<P>The CS102 vaccine is also based on the sporozoite CS protein, but it does not include the NANP epitope. It is a synthetic peptide consisting of a stretch of 102 amino acids containing T-epitopes from the C-terminal end of the molecule.</P>
<P>The RTS,S recombinant vaccine also includes the NANP epitope. It contains 19 NANP repeats plus the C terminus of the CS protein fused to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), expressed together with unfused HBsAg in yeast. The resulting construct is formulated with the adjuvant ASO2/A. Thus the vaccine contains a large portion of the CS protein in addition to the NANP region, as well as the hepatitis B carrier.</P>
<P>The ME-TRAP vaccine is entirely different from the other pre-erythrocytic malaria vaccines. It is a DNA vaccine that uses the prime-boost approach to immunization. It uses a malaria DNA sequence known as ME (multiple epitope)-TRAP (thrombospondin-related protein). The ME string contains 15 T-cell epitopes, 14 of which stimulate CD8 T-cells and the other of which stimulates CD4 T-cells, plus two B-cell epitopes from six pre-erythrocytic antigens of <I>P. falciparum</I>. It also contains two non-malarial CD4 T-cell epitopes and is fused in frame to the TRAP sequence. This sequence is given first as DNA (two doses) followed by one dose of the same DNA sequence in the viral vector MVA (modified vaccinia virus Ankara). Phase 1 studies with this vaccine (excluded from this review) were very promising (<LINK REF="STD-McConkey-2003" TYPE="STUDY">McConkey 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bejon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bejon 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>In addition to the vaccine candidates included in this review, many excluded studies describe Phase 1 trials carried out with other <I>P. falciparum</I> pre-erythrocytic candidates, including other recombinant CS/hepatitis B vaccines (<LINK REF="STD-Walther-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Walther 2005</LINK>), sporozoite DNA vaccines (<LINK REF="STD-Le-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Le 1999</LINK>), and multiple-antigen peptides (<LINK REF="STD-Nardin-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Nardin 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nardin-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nardin 2001</LINK>). Vaccines consisting of killed irradiated <I>P. falciparum</I> sporozoites are also being evaluated (<LINK REF="STD-Hoffman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hoffman 2002</LINK>). Those that progress to efficacy trials will be included in future updates of this review.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. CS-NANP vaccines</HEADING>
<P>Two different constructs containing the NANP epitope of the CS protein were used in the three trials of CS-NANP vaccines. <LINK REF="STD-Guiguemde-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Guiguemde 1990</LINK> used three synthetic NANP repeats conjugated to tetanus toxoid; the control was tetanus toxoid. <LINK REF="STD-Brown-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 1994</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sherwood-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Sherwood 1996</LINK> used a recombinant vaccine (R32toxA) containing 30 NANP and 2 NVDP repeats conjugated to the toxin A of <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> with alum. The controls were tetanus/diphtheria toxoid and hepatitis B vaccine, respectively.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Guiguemde-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Guiguemde 1990</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sherwood-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Sherwood 1996</LINK> were conducted in Africa, and <LINK REF="STD-Brown-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 1994</LINK> was conducted in Asia. All the CS-NANP trials were conducted in situations of natural challenge. <LINK REF="STD-Guiguemde-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Guiguemde 1990</LINK> was carried out with 123 infants (three to five months old) in a highly malaria endemic area. The two trials of R32toxA were in adult males only (199 in <LINK REF="STD-Brown-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 1994</LINK>; 76 in <LINK REF="STD-Sherwood-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Sherwood 1996</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Sherwood-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Sherwood 1996</LINK>, all participants were given a treatment course of quinine/doxycycline before each vaccination.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Guiguemde-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Guiguemde 1990</LINK> used active case detection. <LINK REF="STD-Brown-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 1994</LINK> used a combination of passive and active (bi-weekly) case detection, while <LINK REF="STD-Sherwood-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Sherwood 1996</LINK> did surveillance by daily home visitation.</P>
<P>In the CS-NANP trials in endemic areas, data were reported on clinical and parasitaemic episodes. Clinical malaria was defined as symptoms plus parasitaemia in <LINK REF="STD-Guiguemde-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Guiguemde 1990</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sherwood-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Sherwood 1996</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Brown-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 1994</LINK> was conducted in a less endemic area and the outcome measure was parasitaemia. Both <LINK REF="STD-Brown-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 1994</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sherwood-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Sherwood 1996</LINK> also used time to infection as an outcome measure and employed survival analysis methods. For this review, the incidence of the first episode of either parasitaemia (if given) or clinical malaria (passive and active detection combined) in each group has been used for analysis. Data from <LINK REF="STD-Guiguemde-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Guiguemde 1990</LINK> were reported as the cumulative incidence of parasitaemia over the course of the study. The total number of incident cases was not reported, although some children may have been positive at more than one survey.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">3. RTS,S vaccine</HEADING>
<P>RTS,S is a recombinant product containing 19 NANP repeats as well as another portion of the CS protein, conjugated to the hepatitis B surface antigen and formulated with AS02A adjuvant. Four RTS,S efficacy trials (<LINK REF="STD-Kester-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kester 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bojang-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bojang 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Alonso-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Alonso 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Alonso-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Alonso 2005b</LINK>) and two safety trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bojang-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Bojang 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bojang-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Bojang 2005b</LINK>) are included in this review. One trial of RTS,S in 46 non-immune adults used experimental challenge with infected mosquitoes (<LINK REF="STD-Kester-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kester 2001</LINK>). The control group received hepatitis B vaccine. After promising results, a field trial in 306 semi-immune adult males in The Gambia used natural challenge (<LINK REF="STD-Bojang-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bojang 2001</LINK>). The control group received rabies vaccine. All participants in this trial were given a course of chemotherapy to clear parasites before the third dose of vaccine. A booster dose of vaccine was given to 158 of the participants in the second year.</P>
<P>Safety trials of RTS,S in two cohorts of children (first six to 11 years, then one to four years) were conducted in The Gambia (<LINK REF="STD-Bojang-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Bojang 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bojang-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Bojang 2005b</LINK>). There were 90 children in the first trial and 135 in the second; in both cases the control groups were given rabies vaccine. The first efficacy trials of RTS,S in children were in two cohorts of one- to four-year olds in Mozambique (<LINK REF="STD-Alonso-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Alonso 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Alonso-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Alonso 2005b</LINK>). Cohort one (1605 children) focused on assessing protection from clinical malaria (<LINK REF="STD-Alonso-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Alonso 2005a</LINK>), while cohort two (417 children) assessed mainly new infections (<LINK REF="STD-Alonso-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Alonso 2005b</LINK>). The control vaccines given in both trials were as follows: children under 24 months were given pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (first and third doses) and <I>Haemophilus influenzae b</I> vaccine (second dose); and children over 24 months were given hepatitis B vaccine in three doses. All children in cohort two were treated with amodiaquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine four weeks before the start of surveillance to clear any parasites.</P>
<P>Results of the RTS,S Mozambique trials were reported separately for two periods of follow up &#8722; six months and 18 months &#8722; starting two weeks after the third dose. In this review, the results at six and 18 months are reported separately for some outcome measures (eg prevalence).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Bojang-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bojang 2001</LINK> conducted follow up by daily surveillance for 15 weeks in the first year and nine weeks in the second year. In Mozambique, cohort one was followed mainly by passive surveillance, although monthly home visits were also done (<LINK REF="STD-Alonso-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Alonso 2005a</LINK>). Cohort two was followed more intensely by active surveillance for new infections in addition to passive surveillance through health facilities (<LINK REF="STD-Alonso-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Alonso 2005b</LINK>). Follow up for adverse events was reported for the combined cohorts and tabulated under the trial name <LINK REF="STD-Alonso-2005ab" TYPE="STUDY">Alonso 2005ab</LINK>.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">4. ME-TRAP vaccine</HEADING>
<P>ME-TRAP is a DNA vaccine given in a prime-boost sequence: DNA representing multiple pre-erythrocytic antigen epitopes is given first in two doses followed by DNA inserted in the viral vector MVA (modified vaccinia Ankara). One ME-TRAP trial was conducted with 372 adult males in The Gambia using rabies vaccine in the control group (<LINK REF="STD-Moorthy-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Moorthy 2004b</LINK>). All participants were treated with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine two weeks before the third dose. The follow-up period was 11 weeks after the final dose.</P>

<P>Randomization and allocation concealment were both adequate in <LINK REF="STD-Genton-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Genton 2005</LINK>, and investigators, participants, and outcome assessors were blinded. Two out of 16 participants in the trial did not receive the challenge infection due to previously undisclosed medical histories.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">3. RTS,S vaccines</HEADING>
<P>The RTS,S trials were generally good quality. Both randomization and allocation concealment were adequate in all RTS,S trials except <LINK REF="STD-Kester-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kester 2001</LINK> in which allocation concealment was not used, and all included groups were described as double blind or blinded participants, investigators, and outcome assessors, at least initially. The RTS,S Mozambique trials (<LINK REF="STD-Alonso-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Alonso 2005a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Alonso-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Alonso 2005b</LINK>) technically became single blind after the code was broken and results were reported to investigators after six months follow up. However, only the study statistician held the code, which was not available to other investigators, participants, or assessors, and no further immunizations were given. Therefore, it is unlikely that bias was introduced in the single-blind phase.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Kester-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kester 2001</LINK>, only 52% of those starting the immunization series were subsequently challenged: 50% of the vaccine groups and 58% of the placebo group. There was a relatively high dropout rate in both arms of <LINK REF="STD-Bojang-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bojang 2001</LINK>: 14% of the vaccine group and 22% of the control group dropped out or were excluded between the first dose and the follow-up period in the first year. Fifty-two per cent of original participants took part in the second year of the trial (48% of the vaccine group and 56% of the control group). More than 94% of participants in each of the two trials from The Gambia completed the short follow up (<LINK REF="STD-Bojang-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Bojang 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bojang-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Bojang 2005b</LINK>). In Mozambique, follow up was better in <LINK REF="STD-Alonso-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Alonso 2005a</LINK> (cohort one) where 93% received three doses and 86% completed the first six months follow up, than in <LINK REF="STD-Alonso-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Alonso 2005b</LINK> (cohort two) where the proportions were 92% and 72%, respectively. Some participants not present in the double-blind, six-month, follow-up phase were included in the subsequent single-blind follow up from six to 18 months; over 90% of those entering the single-blind phase completed the follow up in both cohorts.</P>

However, this was a small trial with no allocation concealment and a large number of dropouts between immunization and challenge. When tested against natural challenge, in an intention-to-treat analysis, RTS,S did not significantly prevent new infections within the follow-up period (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.06; 723 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>). No evidence was seen of effect by age group (330 adults, 417 children, <LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>).</P>
<P>RTS,S vaccine significantly reduced the incidence of clinical episodes of malaria in children, up to 18 months after immunization (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.87; 1605 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>). This represents efficacy of 26% (95% CI 13% to 37%). The same effect was not seen in clinical malaria in semi-immune adults in The Gambia in the first season after immunization (306 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>). However, after a booster dose, there was a large reduction in clinical malaria episodes in the second year of follow up (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.82; 158 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-003.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.4</LINK>). This corresponds to a vaccine efficacy of 63% (95% CI 18% to 83%).</P>
<P>In the Mozambique trial (<LINK REF="STD-Alonso-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Alonso 2005a</LINK>), there was a significant reduction in episodes of severe malaria in children by 58% (95% CI 15% to 79%), derived from the risk ratio of 0.42 (95% CI 0.21 to 0.85; 1605 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-003.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.5</LINK>). The number of cases of malaria requiring admission to hospital was also reduced by 32% (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.99; 1605 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-003.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.6</LINK>). No significant effects were seen on admission to hospital for any cause (1605 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-003.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.7</LINK>). However, these efficacy estimates for severe malaria and hospital admission were based on exploratory analyses of outcomes not intended as primary outcome measures in the trial design.</P>
<P>Outcome measures detected by a cross-sectional survey (prevalence and anaemia) were assessed after six months and 18 months of follow up. Prevalence of parasitaemia was reduced significantly by 26% at six months (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.89; 2022 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-003.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.8</LINK>) and by 20% at 18 months (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.99; 1794 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-003.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.8</LINK>). No effect was seen on anaemia at either survey (<LINK REF="CMP-003.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.9</LINK>), but the prevalence of anaemia was low in these study populations.</P>
<P>Adverse events were assessed in adults in the USA and The Gambia, and in children in The Gambia and Mozambique (<LINK REF="CMP-003.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.10</LINK>). In The Gambia (<LINK REF="STD-Bojang-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Bojang 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bojang-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Bojang 2005b</LINK>), adverse events were graded on a one to four scale, but the results given represent the numbers of children with any adverse event, not necessarily those with grade three or four reaction. Also in each of these trials, the results from all three vaccine dose groups have been combined. In Mozambique, adverse events were reported for both cohorts one and two combined (cited here as <LINK REF="STD-Alonso-2005ab" TYPE="STUDY">Alonso 2005ab</LINK>). Severe adverse events are reported by length of follow up: zero to six months; and six to 18 months.</P>
<P>Significantly higher proportions of participants in the malaria vaccine groups reported injection site pain, swelling, arm motion limitation, headache, and malaise after vaccination compared with the control groups (<LINK REF="CMP-003.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.10</LINK>). The frequency of adverse events was stated to be similar in hepatitis B surface antigen-positive and antigen-negative participants (<LINK REF="STD-Bojang-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bojang 2001</LINK>), although five hepatitis B virus (HBV) chronic carriers developed elevated alanine amino-tranferase concentrations after vaccination and were not given further vaccinations. After a fourth booster dose, three of 79 vaccine recipients in the <LINK REF="STD-Bojang-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bojang 2001</LINK> trial developed severe injection site pain compared with none in the control group. In <LINK REF="STD-Bojang-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Bojang 2005a</LINK>, one child in the vaccine group developed grade-two axillary lymphadenopathy after the first vaccine dose; it resolved within four days. In both safety trials from The Gambia, symptoms rated as grade-three severity were infrequent and resolved or decreased within 24 hours. No severe adverse events believed to be related to vaccination were reported. In <LINK REF="STD-Alonso-2005ab" TYPE="STUDY">Alonso 2005ab</LINK>, a high frequency of severe events was reported especially during the first six months (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.85; 1876 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-003.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.11</LINK>), but they were less frequent in the malaria vaccine compared with the control groups, and none was judged to be related to vaccination.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-08-04 11:20:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Four different types of pre-erythrocytic vaccine are described in this review. The RTS,S vaccine has shown significant efficacy against both experimental challenge (in non-immunes) and natural challenge (in participants living in endemic areas) with malaria. Children in Mozambique were protected by RTS,S against episodes of clinical malaria and severe malaria in trials in for up to 18 months after immunization. Protection against clinical malaria in these children was estimated at 26% (95% CI 13% to 37%). It is encouraging that RTS,S also showed significant protection against severe malaria in children, estimated at 58% (95% CI 15 to 79%). However the efficacy estimate for severe malaria in the Mozambique RTS,S trial was based on exploratory analyses and more precise estimates are needed. Further trials of RTS,S are in the planning stages. Although no evidence was found for efficacy of RTS,S against clinical malaria in adults in The Gambia in the first year of follow up, efficacy was 63% (95% CI 18% to 93%) in the second year after immunization, after a booster dose. The results from the Mozambique efficacy trial described here are generally consistent with the efficacy results presented in the published papers (<LINK REF="STD-Alonso-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Alonso 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Alonso-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Alonso 2005b</LINK>), which were based on time-to-event analysis and hazard ratios. These estimated that the efficacy of the vaccine (defined as 1 - hazard ratio) was 29.9% against clinical episodes and 57.7% against severe malaria. However for first infection, this review's finding of lack of significant efficacy (1 - risk ratio) against new infection is different from the published paper's estimate, which was 45%, based on a time-to-infection analysis.</P>
<P>Of the three other types of vaccine reviewed, the CS-NANP vaccine has been tested in three relatively small trials under natural challenge, and CS102 has only been tested in one very small good quality trial in non-immune participants using experimental challenge. Evidence is insufficient to evaluate the efficacy of either of these vaccines, although with current evidence they do not appear promising. The ME-TRAP vaccine has also only been tested in one randomized trial, although it was a good quality, large trial in an endemic area.</P>
<P>There are no significant safety issues with RTS,S vaccines, although the frequency of local and systemic adverse events is increased compared to control. No severe adverse events were judged to be vaccine related.</P>
<P>If further trials of RTS,S show similar results to those already reported, the level of protection against severe malaria justifies speedy progression of this vaccine towards licensing for routine use as well as further development of the vaccine for greater efficacy. In addition to exploring efficacy of other pre-erythrocytic antigens and whole irradiated parasites, methods of improving the immunogenicity and effectiveness of the RTS,S vaccine and its combination with DNA vaccines or antigens from other malaria stages are the highest research priorities. In addition, since infants less than one year old are a high-risk population and the future target group for malaria vaccines, RTS,S and other vaccines must be tested in infants.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The RTS,S vaccine showed extremely promising results, especially with regard to prevention of severe malaria in children and duration of protection of 18 months. The frequency of local and systemic adverse events is increased by RTS,S vaccine, but no severe adverse events were judged to be vaccine related. If further trials show similar results to those already reported, these results justify speedy progression of this vaccine towards licensing for routine use as well as further development of the vaccine for greater efficacy. Progression towards licensing should be accompanied by development of deployment strategies, including funding for the countries most in need of the vaccine.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The CS-NANP epitope alone appears to be ineffective in a vaccine. Research on vaccines that combine the NANP epitope with other antigens may be more productive. CS102 and ME-TRAP have not been evaluated sufficiently to make a judgement about their ultimate value. Methods of improving the immunogenicity and effectiveness of the RTS,S vaccine and its combination with DNA vaccines or antigens from other malaria stages are research priorities, as is testing candidate vaccines in infants. Future trials should be designed to detect effects on clinical and severe malaria.</P>
