<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>People with prolonged or recurrent chest pain may have a condition called unstable angina (UA) or suffer a certain type of heart attack called non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). People with either of these two conditions may be managed by either one of two treatment strategies: the routine invasive strategy, or the conservative or 'selective invasive strategy'. With the first approach, patients have a catheter (a long, patent tube) inserted into the arteries that bring blood to the heart muscle itself, called the coronary arteries. The main objective behind inserting this catheter (in other words, to perform a procedure called coronary angiography) is to look for thickening and hardening of the vessel. If a significant narrowing or a complicated plaque is found, then the artery may be dilated by inserting a balloon catheter that can be inflated wherever the vessel is particularly narrow, so as to open the vessel and improve blood flow. The vessel is held open by inserting a metallic stent. In some cases, the region of vessel narrowing is not amenable to this approach and surgery to bypass it is required. With the other, conservative or 'selective invasive' strategy, patients are initially treated with drugs, and only those who continue to suffer further chest pain or who demonstrate evidence of ongoing coronary artery narrowing via other non-invasive tests, such as stress testing or imaging, undergo coronary angiography and revascularisation if indicated. In this Cochrane review, researchers examined the available evidence to determine which strategy is better.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We included randomised controlled trials that compared routine invasive strategies to conservative strategies in patients with UA and NSTEMI in the stent era. We searched the available literature up to 25 August 2015.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>We included eight studies with 8915 participants: five trials were in the review version published in 2010, and three were new trials. Of the included participants with UA and NSTEMI, there were 4545 in the invasive strategy arm and 4370 in the conservative strategy arm. Evidence failed to show appreciable risk reduction in all-cause mortality and death or non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) with routine invasive management strategy compared to conservative strategies. There was appreciable risk reduction in MI, refractory angina and re-hospitalisation with routine invasive strategies compared to conservative strategies, but this was associated with an increased risk of procedure-related MI and bleeding complications.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of evidence for primary outcomes</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence in this review update ranged from low quality to moderate quality. Low quality evidence was as a result of serious risk of bias and uncertainty surrounding the effect, while moderate quality evidence was only due to serious risk of bias.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusions</B>
</P>
<P>The debate continues as to which strategy is better. The invasive strategy reduces the incidence of further chest pain or re-hospitalisation. Also, long-term follow-up from three studies suggests that it lowers the risk of a heart attack over the next three to five years. However, the invasive strategy also is associated with double the risk of heart attack during or soon after initial treatment, as well as an increased risk of bleeding. In summary, the published scientific research suggests that the invasive strategy may have particular benefit in those patients who are at high risk for recurrent events, and that patients at low risk for a recurrent event may even suffer harm from such an approach.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-05-23 18:09:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>People with unstable angina and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (UA/NSTEMI) are managed with a combination of medical therapy, invasive angiography and revascularisation. Specifically, two approaches have evolved: either a 'routine invasive' strategy whereby all patients undergo coronary angiography shortly after admission and, if indicated, coronary revascularisation; or a 'selective invasive' (also referred to as 'conservative') strategy in which medical therapy alone is used initially, with a selection of patients for angiography based upon evidence of persistent myocardial ischaemia. Uncertainty exists as to which strategy provides the best outcomes for these patients. This Cochrane review is an update of a Cochrane review originally published in 2006, to provide a robust comparison of these two strategies in the early management of patients with UA/NSTEMI.</P>

<P>Two review authors screened the records and extracted data in duplicate. Using intention-to-treat analysis with random-effects models, we calculated summary estimates of the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the primary endpoints of all-cause death, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), combined all-cause death or non-fatal MI, refractory angina and re-hospitalisation. We performed further analysis of included studies based on whether glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists were used routinely. We assessed the heterogeneity of included trials using Pearson &#967;² (Chi² test) and variance (I² statistic) analysis. Using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, we assessed the quality of the evidence and the GRADE profiler (GRADEPRO) was used to import data from Review Manager 5.3 (Review Manager) to create Summary of findings (SoF) tables.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Diagnosis of acute coronary syndromes</HEADING>
<P>Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) encompasses three disorders of related aetiology: ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI); non-STEMI (NSTEMI); and unstable angina (UA). Management of STEMI differs from that for UA and NSTEMI, which can be considered a single clinical entity (UA/NSTEMI). The pathogenesis of UA/NSTEMI involves five non-exclusive causative factors: non-occlusive thrombus on pre-existing plaque; dynamic obstruction; progressive mechanical obstruction; inflammation; and secondary UA associated with increased cardiac workload (<LINK REF="REF-Braunwald-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Braunwald 1998</LINK>). Of these factors, thrombus formation on pre-existing plaque, which is an acute plaque change, is the most common. Indeed, most patients with ACS have an acute change in coronary atherosclerotic plaques, with STEMI usually associated with complete occlusion of the involved vessel(s) (<LINK REF="REF-DeWood-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeWood 1980</LINK>) and UA/NSTEMI usually associated with subtotal occlusion (<LINK REF="REF-DeWood-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeWood 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-TIMI_x002d_IIIA-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">TIMI-IIIA 1993</LINK>). The distinction between UA and NSTEMI depends on the presence of myocardial infarction (MI), as determined by markers of myocardial damage such as troponin I (TnI), troponin T (TnT) and creatine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB).</P>
<P>Compared to STEMI, NSTEMI has a lower 30-day mortality rate, but more recurrent ischaemia and a similar one-year mortality rate (<LINK REF="REF-Armstrong-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armstrong 1998</LINK>). UA/NSTEMI is much more common than STEMI; in the USA, for example, 1.4 million patients per year are admitted to hospital with ACS, approximately 70% of them with UA/NSTEMI (<LINK REF="REF-Rosamond-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosamond 2008</LINK>). Whereas emergency percutaneous coronary revascularisation is now a commonly-used therapy for treating STEMI (<LINK REF="REF-Antman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Antman 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cucherat-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cucherat 2003</LINK>), the role of angiography and possible subsequent revascularisation is less clear in UA/NSTEMI patients. Treatment of UA/NSTEMI initially involves medical therapy followed by one of two variations on the management strategy, which results in differing rates of angiography and revascularisation. In this Cochrane review update we review the medical therapies for UA/NSTEMI briefly before we focus on the management strategies of patients with UA/NSTEMI.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Initial medical management of UA/NSTEMI</HEADING>
<P>Medical treatments, as outlined in the American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF) and American Heart Association (AHA) (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jneid-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jneid 2012</LINK>) and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Hamm-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamm 2011</LINK>), fall into the two major categories: anti-ischaemic and anti-platelet/anti-coagulation. Anti-ischaemic therapies include bed rest, nitroglycerin, beta blockers (or certain non-dihydropyridine calcium antagonist if beta blockers are contraindicated) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Anti-platelet or anti-coagulation therapies include aspirin, P2Y<SUB>12</SUB> receptor inhibitor treatment (clopidogrel, prasugrel and ticagrelor), heparin and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists. Published randomised clinical trials support the use of most of these specific therapies. Among the anti-ischaemic treatments, beta blockers have proven efficacy in patients with evolving MI (<LINK REF="REF-Hjalmarson-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hjalmarson 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yusuf-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yusuf 1988</LINK>), as well as in patients with UA/NSTEMI (<LINK REF="REF-Gottlieb-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gottlieb 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Muller-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muller 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Th_x00e9_roux-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Théroux 1985</LINK>). Non-dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists have proven efficacy in ACS (<LINK REF="REF-Boden-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boden 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gibson-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibson 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pepine-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pepine 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tijssen-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tijssen 1987</LINK>), and are particularly useful in patients with contraindications to beta-blockers. Both the early and late administration of ACE inhibitors can be beneficial for MI (<LINK REF="REF-EUROPA-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">EUROPA 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-HOPE-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">HOPE 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rodrigues-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodrigues 2003</LINK>). Of the anti-platelet or anti-coagulation treatments, aspirin exhibits a consistent benefit for UA/NSTEMI as demonstrated in several clinical trials (<LINK REF="REF-Cairns-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cairns 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lewis-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-RISC-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">RISC 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Theroux-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Theroux 1988</LINK>). Similarly, clopidogrel is a beneficial adjunct to aspirin (<LINK REF="REF-CURE-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">CURE 2001</LINK>). Subsequently, prasugrel, <LINK REF="REF-TRITON_x002d_TIMI-38" TYPE="REFERENCE">TRITON-TIMI 38</LINK>, and ticagrelor, <LINK REF="REF-PLATO" TYPE="REFERENCE">PLATO</LINK>, have been identified as alternatives to clopidogrel. Heparin, in its various forms, or fondaparinux are also beneficial in UA/NSTEMI (<LINK REF="REF-Gurfinkel-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurfinkel 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mehta-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mehta 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neri-Serneri-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neri Serneri 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-RISC-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">RISC 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Theroux-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Theroux 1993</LINK>). The glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists have proven efficacy in the medical treatment of UA/NSTEMI (<LINK REF="REF-Boersma-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boersma 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-PRISM_x002d_PLUS-Trial" TYPE="REFERENCE">PRISM-PLUS Trial</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-PURSUIT-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">PURSUIT 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roffi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roffi 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Topol-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Topol 1999</LINK>). However, this class of drugs appears to have differential effects depending on the patients' risk level and bleeding propensity, and high-risk patients obtain the greatest benefit; consequently, their use should be highly-selective (<LINK REF="STD-ACUITY" TYPE="STUDY">ACUITY</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-EARLY-ACS-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">EARLY ACS 2009</LINK>). The glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists warrant special mention regarding their use in invasive procedures. We expand upon this concept later in this review update.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Management following initial medical treatment: what is the role of early coronary angiography and revascularization?</HEADING>
<P>Two different treatment strategies may be adopted after the initial medical treatment of UA/NSTEMI.</P>
<OL>
<LI>A routine invasive strategy of coronary angi ography and, if indicated, revascularisation in most or all patients who have no contraindication to such an approach.</LI>
<LI>A 'selective invasive' or 'ischaemia guided' (conservative) strategy, in which patients undergo coronary angiography and revascularisation only if there is evidence of recurrent ischaemia. Examples are recurrent infarction, angina at rest, dynamic ST changes on electrocardiograph (ECG), and definitive inducible ischaemia on provocative testing.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Proponents of the routine invasive strategy argue that the early determination of coronary anatomy can be used to tailor revascularisation therapy, avoid lengthy hospital stays and prevent further events. Those with significant coronary disease evident on angiography can be treated expeditiously according to their angiographic findings, which may include revascularisation via percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) comprised of coronary angioplasty and coronary stenting, or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Proponents of the conservative or 'selective invasive' strategy argue that medical therapy can stabilise patients. Stress testing can identify patients at risk for future events and who would therefore benefit most from an invasive intervention. This strategy may also limit the costs and complications of invasive procedures. The evidence for the relative advantages and disadvantages of these two approaches is the subject of this Cochrane review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Interpretation of the evidence from trials: changes in contemporary clinical practice</HEADING>
<P>In routine clinical practice, the outcomes of invasive coronary procedures vary depending upon a number of factors, including clinical expertise (<LINK REF="REF-Singh-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 2000</LINK>), volume of procedures performed (<LINK REF="REF-Magid-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Magid 2000</LINK>), and methods and protocols used, especially regarding pharmacological and procedural co-interventions. Of particular importance in contemporary practice is the use of coronary artery stents (<LINK REF="REF-Al-Suwaidi-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al Suwaidi 2004</LINK>), which improves outcomes and reduces complications when used with invasive procedures. Stenting is associated with fewer major adverse cardiovascular events and a reduced need for emergency cardiac surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Al-Suwaidi-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al Suwaidi 2004</LINK>). Specifically, the reduction in target vessel revascularisation associated with stenting is of particular relevance to trials with longer durations of follow-up.</P>
<P>Upstream glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist use is controversial. Though these drugs initially seemed beneficial (<LINK REF="REF-EPIC-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPIC 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-EPILOG-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPILOG 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-EPISTENT-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPISTENT 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Karvouni-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karvouni 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simoons-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simoons 1997</LINK>), their routine application has been associated with an increased risk of non-life-threatening bleeding (<LINK REF="STD-ACUITY" TYPE="STUDY">ACUITY</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-EARLY-ACS-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">EARLY ACS 2009</LINK>), which has resulted in a paradigm shift from routine to highly-selective use. In the <LINK REF="STD-ACUITY" TYPE="STUDY">ACUITY</LINK> study, patients with UA/NSTEMI treated with an early invasive strategy, bivalirudin without routine glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists, demonstrated significantly reduced rates of major bleeding with non-inferior outcomes in ischaemia endpoints compared to standard heparin or bivalirudin with mandatory glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists (<LINK REF="REF-Stone-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stone 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stone-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stone 2007</LINK>). However, the substitution of bivalirudin for heparin with glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists probably should not be undertaken unless patients have been pretreated with a thienopyridine prior to angiography (<LINK REF="REF-Stone-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stone 2006</LINK>).</P>

<P>We only considered studies undertaken in the stent era for inclusion. If we had included non-stent studies, the analysis would underestimate the benefits of a routine invasive strategy on endpoints such as recurrent angina and rehospitalisation (e.g. due to chest pain). We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared invasive and selectively invasive strategies in participants with unstable angina and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (UA/NSTEMI), and measured at least one of this review's outcomes. The revascularisation approaches in the included studies were percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), as required. We investigated the effect of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist use on outcomes further by undertaking two separate analyses on trials according to routine versus selective use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists during PCI. Thus, the analyses we undertook were as follows.</P>
<OL>
<LI>All studies that deployed stents routinely in revascularisation procedures using PCI, regardless of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist use.</LI>
<LI>Stents and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists deployed routinely in revascularisation procedures using PCI.</LI>
<LI>Stents deployed routinely in revascularisation procedures using PCI with selective glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists use.</LI>

<P>It is important to note that, in recent years, a number of studies have focused on the optimal timing of an invasive strategy. While these studies fulfil many of the criteria for inclusion, often they did not randomise patients to a medically-managed conservative or 'selective invasive' strategy.

<P>Differentiating peri-PCI cardiac biomarker leaks from the outcome measure 'non-fatal myocardial infarction' warrants further comment. A universal definition of MI, including peri-procedural MI, has only recently been adopted and defines peri-procedural MI as a biomarker increase to three times the upper reference limit (<LINK REF="REF-Thygesen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thygesen 2007</LINK>). Unfortunately, as summarised in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>, the included studies inconsistently defined peri-procedural MI and this limited the interpretation of this outcome data across the included trials.

<P>We analysed data on an ITT basis. Where appropriate, we combined data from all trials using the meta-analysis software in Review Manager (RevMan) (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). All outcome measures of this Cochrane review were dichotomous. We combined data using a random-effects model to determine a summary estimate of the risk ratio (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). We assessed heterogeneity using the Pearson &#967;² (Chi²) test (P &lt; 0.10) for all endpoints and the I² statistic for selected endpoints (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). We displayed the I² statistic on the forest plots for all analyses. Furthermore, we performed sensitivity analysis for various prespecified variables that may present sources of inter-study heterogeneity. Since this meta-analysis contained a small number of included studies and we previously identified many potential sources of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Hoenig-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoenig 2010</LINK>), we did not undertake meta-regression. As such, we felt that individual patient data meta-analysis would be more appropriate (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 2005</LINK>). This also would avoid aggregation bias. Given the discrepant definitions of MI between the included studies (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>), we used mortality at end of follow-up when we assessed publication bias or heterogeneity via sensitivity analysis. As stated under the '<LINK TAG="CRIT_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Types of studies</LINK>' section, we analysed all included studies further by assigning them to one of two analyses, depending on the routine use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists.

<P>The original literature search performed for this review (1996 to 2008) yielded 2221 hits (<LINK REF="REF-Hoenig-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoenig 2010</LINK>). Of these, we selected 31 papers that reported on 14 studies for closer attention. We excluded one study because it was based on a registry and hence contained observational data (<LINK REF="STD-MITI-2000" TYPE="STUDY">MITI 2000</LINK>). We excluded another study because it was a post-hoc analysis of a trial that compared hirudin to heparin in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients (<LINK REF="STD-GUSTO2b-2003" TYPE="STUDY">GUSTO2b 2003</LINK>). We excluded four trials because they were undertaken in the pre-stent era or did not encourage the routine use of stents in the invasive strategy (<LINK REF="STD-MATE-1998" TYPE="STUDY">MATE 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TIMI_x002d_3b" TYPE="STUDY">TIMI-3b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VANQWISH-1998" TYPE="STUDY">VANQWISH 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhao-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Zhao 2005</LINK>). Moreover, some studies included patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) but did not report outcomes separately for unstable angina (UA)/non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) (<LINK REF="STD-Eisenberg-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Eisenberg 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MATE-1998" TYPE="STUDY">MATE 1998</LINK>). As stated earlier, studies from the pre-stent era underestimate the value of the invasive strategy and are irrelevant to current practice. Also, we excluded two studies because of inappropriate participant selection or trial design (<LINK REF="STD-ISAR_x002d_COOL" TYPE="STUDY">ISAR-COOL</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TRUCS-2000" TYPE="STUDY">TRUCS 2000</LINK>). More details on the excluded studies can be found in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>' table. We deemed five studies appropriate for inclusion and we have described these in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' table. We analysed these five studies together in Analysis 1. Two studies used a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonist routinely in the routine invasive arm (<LINK REF="STD-ICTUS" TYPE="STUDY">ICTUS</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TACTICS_x002d_TIMI-18" TYPE="STUDY">TACTICS-TIMI 18</LINK>), and we analysed these two studies together via the prespecified Analysis 2 (see the '<LINK TAG="CRIT_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Types of studies</LINK>' section). The three remaining studies satisfied this Cochrane review's stent requirement but did not routinely use glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists in participants randomised to the routine invasive strategy. We analysed these together as Analysis 3 (<LINK REF="STD-FRISC_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">FRISC-II</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-RITA_x002d_3" TYPE="STUDY">RITA-3</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VINO" TYPE="STUDY">VINO</LINK>).</P>
<P>The literature search update (2008 to 2015) yielded 1929 hits, of which 27 were potentially relevant articles. Of these, we added five articles, which related to three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Italian-Elderly-ACS" TYPE="STUDY">Italian Elderly ACS</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-LIPSIA_x002d_NSTEMI" TYPE="STUDY">LIPSIA-NSTEMI</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-OASIS-5" TYPE="STUDY">OASIS 5</LINK>), to the previous analysis. The <LINK REF="STD-Italian-Elderly-ACS" TYPE="STUDY">Italian Elderly ACS</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-OASIS-5" TYPE="STUDY">OASIS 5</LINK> studies were also relevant to Analysis 2, and the <LINK REF="STD-LIPSIA_x002d_NSTEMI" TYPE="STUDY">LIPSIA-NSTEMI</LINK> trial was relevant to Analysis 3. We excluded a number of important randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from the update due to the absence of randomisation to a management arm consistent with the 'selective invasive' strategy as defined in this Cochrane review. These studies generally focused on the optimal timing of an invasive strategy (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-ABOARD" TYPE="STUDY">ABOARD</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ELISA" TYPE="STUDY">ELISA</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ISAR_x002d_COOL" TYPE="STUDY">ISAR-COOL</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-OPTIMA" TYPE="STUDY">OPTIMA</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TIMACS" TYPE="STUDY">TIMACS</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2010</LINK>), or optimal use of antithrombotic medication (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-ACUITY" TYPE="STUDY">ACUITY</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-EARLYACS" TYPE="STUDY">EARLYACS</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-PLATO" TYPE="REFERENCE">PLATO</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-TRITON_x002d_TIMI-38" TYPE="REFERENCE">TRITON-TIMI 38</LINK>). A published conference abstract, <LINK REF="STD-Dimitrov-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Dimitrov 2013</LINK>, eluded to a potentially relevant study. However, as the full text publication was unavailable at the time of the literature search, we classified this study as 'ongoing' and excluded it from the analyses (see the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_ONGOING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of ongoing studies</LINK>' section).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Design</HEADING>
<P>All included studies were RCTs. Due to the procedural nature of the intervention, we presumed that the participants and treating clinicians were not blinded to the intervention. However, a blinded committee could assess outcomes.

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Populations</HEADING>
<P>The included studies were heterogeneous in their participant selection criteria. The inclusion criteria were comprised of different combinations of the following core criteria: chest pain, electrocardiograph (ECG) changes, increased level(s) of cardiac marker(s) or a documented history of coronary artery disease (CAD). We have outlined the specific criteria for each included study in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' table. Clearly, since the included studies used different criteria, the trials randomised participants at different levels of risk. Elevated troponin levels (<LINK REF="REF-Antman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Antman 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Galvani-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Galvani 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lindahl-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindahl 1996</LINK>) or ECG changes (<LINK REF="REF-Cannon-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cannon 1997</LINK>) forebode a worse prognosis for unstable angina and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (UA/NSTEMI). As such, trials that recruited these participants could be expected to exhibit higher event rates. For example, the <LINK REF="STD-VINO" TYPE="STUDY">VINO</LINK> study, which had the highest mortality rate (26.8% per year of follow-up) and the <LINK REF="STD-Italian-Elderly-ACS" TYPE="STUDY">Italian Elderly ACS</LINK> study, which had the second highest mortality rate (13.8% per year follow-up), randomised participants who had chest pain, ECG changes and elevated cardiac markers; whereas in <LINK REF="STD-TACTICS_x002d_TIMI-18" TYPE="STUDY">TACTICS-TIMI 18</LINK>, 27% of the trial participants had accelerating or prolonged chest pain with a history of CAD as the sole entry criteria. Additionally, the <LINK REF="STD-Italian-Elderly-ACS" TYPE="STUDY">Italian Elderly ACS</LINK> only included participants who were 65 years of age or older, with the attendant increased morbidity and mortality that comes with aging. In contrast, the entry criteria for the <LINK REF="STD-RITA_x002d_3" TYPE="STUDY">RITA-3</LINK> study were explicitly aimed at intermediate-risk participants and the <LINK REF="STD-OASIS-5" TYPE="STUDY">OASIS 5</LINK> substudy exclusively recruited female participants.</P>

<P>Within the routine invasive strategy, all participants were randomised to receive angiography, regardless of symptom status. In contrast, with the conservative/'selective invasive' strategy, angiography only was performed in participants with clinical or investigational evidence of ischaemia. It is important to note that angiography is a component of both strategies, and that angiography in the conservative arm did not represent a 'cross-over', as long as it was preceded by myocardial ischaemia or evidence of CAD.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Time to interventions</HEADING>
<P>The times to angiography after randomisation in the routine invasive arms were: mean 6.2 hours in <LINK REF="STD-VINO" TYPE="STUDY">VINO</LINK>, median 22 hours in <LINK REF="STD-TACTICS_x002d_TIMI-18" TYPE="STUDY">TACTICS-TIMI 18</LINK>, median 23 hours in <LINK REF="STD-ICTUS" TYPE="STUDY">ICTUS</LINK>, mean 24 hours in the <LINK REF="STD-Italian-Elderly-ACS" TYPE="STUDY">Italian Elderly ACS</LINK>, median two days in <LINK REF="STD-RITA_x002d_3" TYPE="STUDY">RITA-3</LINK>, median 51 hours in <LINK REF="STD-OASIS-5" TYPE="STUDY">OASIS 5</LINK> and mean four days in <LINK REF="STD-FRISC_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">FRISC-II</LINK>. The invasive strategy in the <LINK REF="STD-LIPSIA_x002d_NSTEMI" TYPE="STUDY">LIPSIA-NSTEMI</LINK> trial included both an immediate invasive strategy and an early invasive strategy with respective mean randomisation to sheath insertion times of 1.1 and 18.3 hours.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-FRISC_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">FRISC-II</LINK> trial authors cited observational data to justify delayed angiography and postulated that a period of "plaque passivation" prior to angiography would be beneficial. However, the <LINK REF="STD-ISAR_x002d_COOL" TYPE="STUDY">ISAR-COOL</LINK> trial subsequently compared an 'early invasive' (angiography within six hours of randomisation) to 'delayed invasive' (angiography in three to five days) strategy in UA/NSTEMI patients and found that early angiography produced superior outcomes. Since that time, a number of RCTs have evaluated the optimal timing of an invasive approach (<LINK REF="STD-ABOARD" TYPE="STUDY">ABOARD</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ELISA" TYPE="STUDY">ELISA</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-LIPSIA_x002d_NSTEMI" TYPE="STUDY">LIPSIA-NSTEMI</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-OPTIMA" TYPE="STUDY">OPTIMA</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TIMACS" TYPE="STUDY">TIMACS</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2010</LINK>). However, at present, there is insufficient evidence to indicate the optimal time for invasive management in general populations and such a discussion is beyond the scope of this Cochrane review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Criteria for ischaemia</HEADING>
<P>There were important differences between the included trials in the criteria for ischaemia that mandated angiography within the selectively invasive arm. In particular, the <LINK REF="STD-FRISC_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">FRISC-II</LINK> criteria were widely criticised for being more stringent than those of the other studies, thereby exaggerating any benefit conferred by the invasive strategy. Furthermore, <LINK REF="STD-FRISC_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">FRISC-II</LINK> did not utilise nuclear imaging or pharmacologic stress testing in its selectively invasive strategy arm. Indeed, application of the <LINK REF="STD-FRISC_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">FRISC-II</LINK> criteria to the <LINK REF="STD-VANQWISH-1998" TYPE="STUDY">VANQWISH 1998</LINK> study, which recruited similar participants, suggests that significant CAD was under-detected in the selectively invasive arm of the <LINK REF="STD-FRISC_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">FRISC-II</LINK> study (<LINK REF="REF-Goyal-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goyal 2002</LINK>). Similarly, the <LINK REF="STD-LIPSIA_x002d_NSTEMI" TYPE="STUDY">LIPSIA-NSTEMI</LINK> trial applied strict criteria for intervention in the conservative arm, including evidence of refractory ischaemia by clinical, ECG and stress testing, and an ejection fraction (EF) via echocardiography of less than 45%. Consequently, 70% of those randomised to the selectively invasive arm underwent an invasive strategy (versus 84% amongst those randomised to receive an invasive strategy). Conversely, the <LINK REF="STD-Italian-Elderly-ACS" TYPE="STUDY">Italian Elderly ACS</LINK> did not require an objective ischaemia measure and relied on symptoms alone. This resulted in lower rates of invasive management in the conservative arm (31% versus 58% amongst those randomised to an invasive strategy).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Commonly reported outcomes included death, myocardial infarction (MI) and recurrent angina. Death was reported as all-cause mortality. The definition of MI varied between the included studies, but included a combination of chest pain, ECG changes and elevated cardiac biomarkers. Not all studies reported peri-percutaneous coronary intervention (peri-PCI) cardiac biomarker leaks without other criteria as an endpoint, but were included as a safety outcome where data were available. We have summarised the variable definitions of MI in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>, which show that some studies required clinical or ECG changes, or both, for MI endpoints, whereas others only required an increased cardiac marker. Importantly, the <LINK REF="STD-ICTUS" TYPE="STUDY">ICTUS</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-LIPSIA_x002d_NSTEMI" TYPE="STUDY">LIPSIA-NSTEMI</LINK> trial protocols mandated the routine measurement of creatine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB) after PCI, and peak levels constituted the endpoint of MI for both and the primary outcome for the <LINK REF="STD-LIPSIA_x002d_NSTEMI" TYPE="STUDY">LIPSIA-NSTEMI</LINK> trial. Such an assessment has the benefit of allowing quantification of overall myocardial necrosis, including that associated with the intervention itself. However, the significance of peri-PCI biomarker leaks is a subject of considerable debate (<LINK REF="REF-Bhatt-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhatt 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cutlip-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cutlip 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The other included trials did not specify the routine measurement of CK-MB after PCI per protocol. Fortunately the <LINK REF="STD-ICTUS" TYPE="STUDY">ICTUS</LINK> trial authors reported 'spontaneous' and 'peri-procedural' MI as separate endpoints (<LINK REF="REF-de-Winter-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Winter 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hirsch-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirsch 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Windhausen-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Windhausen 2007b</LINK>). Extraction of data from <LINK REF="STD-ICTUS" TYPE="STUDY">ICTUS</LINK>, which combined spontaneous and procedural MI into a single MI endpoint, caused significant heterogeneity in a previous version of this meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Hoenig-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoenig 2010</LINK>). Hence, to maximize consistency between trials, we analysed 'spontaneous' MI from the <LINK REF="STD-ICTUS" TYPE="STUDY">ICTUS</LINK> trial with our MI endpoint and reported peri-procedural MI as a safety endpoint. This minimised heterogeneity during meta-analysis and also is justifiable since the significance of peri-procedural biomarker leaks is still a subject of contention. Fortunately, endpoints such as death are indisputable. Follow-up was six months in <LINK REF="STD-TACTICS_x002d_TIMI-18" TYPE="STUDY">TACTICS-TIMI 18</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-VINO" TYPE="STUDY">VINO</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-LIPSIA_x002d_NSTEMI" TYPE="STUDY">LIPSIA-NSTEMI</LINK>; one year in the <LINK REF="STD-Italian-Elderly-ACS" TYPE="STUDY">Italian Elderly ACS</LINK>; two years in the <LINK REF="STD-OASIS-5" TYPE="STUDY">OASIS 5</LINK> substudy; three years for MI but four years for mortality in <LINK REF="STD-ICTUS" TYPE="STUDY">ICTUS</LINK>; five years in <LINK REF="STD-FRISC_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">FRISC-II</LINK>; and five years in <LINK REF="STD-RITA_x002d_3" TYPE="STUDY">RITA-3</LINK>.

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2016-05-24 12:20:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The baseline participant characteristics were equivalent between the two randomised groups across all included studies. We analysed <LINK REF="STD-TACTICS_x002d_TIMI-18" TYPE="STUDY">TACTICS-TIMI 18</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-ICTUS" TYPE="STUDY">ICTUS</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-LIPSIA_x002d_NSTEMI" TYPE="STUDY">LIPSIA-NSTEMI</LINK> together in Analysis 2, since they involved the routine use of both glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists and stents. Analysis 3 included studies that only used stenting routinely, and included <LINK REF="STD-RITA_x002d_3" TYPE="STUDY">RITA-3</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-FRISC_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">FRISC-II</LINK>, the <LINK REF="STD-Italian-Elderly-ACS" TYPE="STUDY">Italian Elderly ACS</LINK>, the <LINK REF="STD-OASIS-5" TYPE="STUDY">OASIS 5</LINK> substudy and <LINK REF="STD-VINO" TYPE="STUDY">VINO</LINK>. Since the trials reported outcomes after different durations of follow-up, we categorised the endpoints for meta-analysis as being index, early, intermediate or late. 'Index' endpoints indicate follow-up over the course of the initial hospitalisation. 'Early' endpoints indicate a follow-up of up to four months. 'Intermediate' endpoints indicate a follow-up from six to 12 months. 'Late' endpoints indicate a follow-up greater than or equal to two years. In studies that supplied endpoints at various time points within a given category, we used the latest follow-up outcomes. For example, if a trial provided outcomes at six and 12 months of follow-up, we used the 12-month data for intermediate analysis. In the 'Summary of findings' table, we reported an all-study analysis that involved all included studies for each outcome. This all-study analysis was seen in studies that reported six to 12 months follow-up period (i.e. intermediate endpoints).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Analysis 1: studies that deployed stents routinely in revascularisation procedures using PCI, regardless of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist use</HEADING>
<P>This analysis included all eight studies undertaken in the stent era, regardless of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist use (<LINK REF="STD-FRISC_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">FRISC-II</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ICTUS" TYPE="STUDY">ICTUS</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Italian-Elderly-ACS" TYPE="STUDY">Italian Elderly ACS</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-LIPSIA_x002d_NSTEMI" TYPE="STUDY">LIPSIA-NSTEMI</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-OASIS-5" TYPE="STUDY">OASIS 5</LINK> substudy; <LINK REF="STD-TACTICS_x002d_TIMI-18" TYPE="STUDY">TACTICS-TIMI 18</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-RITA_x002d_3" TYPE="STUDY">RITA-3</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VINO" TYPE="STUDY">VINO</LINK>).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Death: all causes (index, early, intermediate, late)</HEADING>
<P>Risk of index death significantly increased with a routine invasive versus conservative or selective invasive strategy (risk ratio (RR) 1.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02 to 2.34; six trials, 8094 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). Early (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.70 to 2.00; four trials, 4345 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>), intermediate (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.18; eight trials, 8915 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>) and late (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.08; three trials, 5467 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>) death were not significantly affected by an invasive strategy. There was no evidence of any heterogeneity in inter-study effect sizes across all time points for this endpoint.</P>
<P>The death rates standardised to years of study duration, shown in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>, were 1.1% to 2.8% per year for the <LINK REF="STD-OASIS-5" TYPE="STUDY">OASIS 5</LINK> substudy, <LINK REF="STD-RITA_x002d_3" TYPE="STUDY">RITA-3</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-FRISC_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">FRISC-II</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-ICTUS" TYPE="STUDY">ICTUS</LINK>; whereas <LINK REF="STD-TACTICS_x002d_TIMI-18" TYPE="STUDY">TACTICS-TIMI 18</LINK> had a rate of 7%; the <LINK REF="STD-Italian-Elderly-ACS" TYPE="STUDY">Italian Elderly ACS</LINK> study and <LINK REF="STD-LIPSIA_x002d_NSTEMI" TYPE="STUDY">LIPSIA-NSTEMI</LINK> trial 13% to 14%; and <LINK REF="STD-VINO" TYPE="STUDY">VINO</LINK> had a rate of 27%. For the most part, the levels of risk were concordant with the inclusion criteria employed by each study, as described in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' table, with the exception of <LINK REF="STD-ICTUS" TYPE="STUDY">ICTUS</LINK>. As already discussed, mortality increases as troponin concentrations increase in patients with ACS (<LINK REF="REF-Antman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Antman 1996</LINK>). The <LINK REF="STD-ICTUS" TYPE="STUDY">ICTUS</LINK> trial exclusively enrolled participants with a troponin T (TnT) greater than 0.03 ng/mL and, as such, would be expected to observe a higher mortality rate. Indeed, in <LINK REF="STD-TACTICS_x002d_TIMI-18" TYPE="STUDY">TACTICS-TIMI 18</LINK>, the six-month mortality rate for participants with a TnT greater than 0.01 ng/mL was 4% (<LINK REF="REF-Morrow-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrow 2001</LINK>). Since the <LINK REF="STD-ICTUS" TYPE="STUDY">ICTUS</LINK> trial recruited participants with a TnT greater than 0.03 ng/mL and had a longer duration of 12 months, the standardised mortality would be expected to be greater than 4%. Indeed, in <LINK REF="STD-FRISC_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">FRISC-II</LINK>, participants with a TnT value greater than 0.03 ng/mL had a 12-month mortality rate of 4.2% (<LINK REF="REF-Diderholm-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diderholm 2002</LINK>). Hence, the <LINK REF="STD-ICTUS" TYPE="STUDY">ICTUS</LINK> participants appear to have experienced a lower than expected event rate, based upon the event rates reported for other included trials. Differences between trials in baseline medical therapy do not appear to explain why mortality in the <LINK REF="STD-ICTUS" TYPE="STUDY">ICTUS</LINK> trial was less than the other trials.High rates of background medical therapy seen in both <LINK REF="STD-ICTUS" TYPE="STUDY">ICTUS</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-TACTICS_x002d_TIMI-18" TYPE="STUDY">TACTICS-TIMI 18</LINK>. This observation highlights the importance of global risk stratification over the selection of a single high-risk characteristic when predicting the risk of future events.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">MI (index, early, intermediate, late)</HEADING>
<P>The incidence of MIs during the index hospitalisation was not significantly affected by an invasive strategy (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.80; seven trials, 8694 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>), though significant heterogeneity was identified at this time point (P = 0.003, I² statistic = 70%). Possible reasons for this heterogeneity include the use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists in <LINK REF="STD-TACTICS_x002d_TIMI-18" TYPE="STUDY">TACTICS-TIMI 18</LINK> and the unique definition of MI the <LINK REF="STD-VINO" TYPE="STUDY">VINO</LINK> trial authors used, which excluded any events within the first 72 hours of randomisation (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). Both early (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.08; four trials, 4345 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>) and intermediate (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.00; eight trials, 8915 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>) MI endpoints revealed a non-significant trend towards reduction with an invasive strategy. Interestingly, the previous version of this review, <LINK REF="REF-Hoenig-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoenig 2010</LINK>. identified statistically significant reductions at the early and intermediate endpoints associated with an invasive versus conservative strategy, so that the current analysis represents a reduced effect. Late MI rates were drawn from three studies with these data &#8212; <LINK REF="STD-FRISC_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">FRISC-II</LINK> (five years), <LINK REF="STD-RITA_x002d_3" TYPE="STUDY">RITA-3</LINK> (five years) and <LINK REF="STD-ICTUS" TYPE="STUDY">ICTUS</LINK> (three years) &#8212; and as in the previous meta-analysis, they remained significantly decreased in those treated invasively (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.92; three trials, 5467 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Death (all causes) or non-fatal MI (index, early, intermediate, late)</HEADING>
<P>Index death or non-fatal MI, as a composite outcome, was not decreased in those treated via a routine invasive approach (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.59 to 2.21; four trials, 6618 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>); however, we noted significant heterogeneity (P = 0.001, I² statistic = 81%) and possible reasons include those already discussed for components of the composite outcome. Early death or non-fatal MI, based on 30-day <LINK REF="STD-TACTICS_x002d_TIMI-18" TYPE="STUDY">TACTICS-TIMI 18</LINK> data and <LINK REF="STD-VINO" TYPE="STUDY">VINO</LINK> data, was significantly decreased with an invasive strategy (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.92; two trials, 2351 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>). We observed a trend towards a decreased incidence of intermediate death or non-fatal MI, again as a composite outcome, with the routine invasive strategy and included data from all included studies except for <LINK REF="STD-ICTUS" TYPE="STUDY">ICTUS</LINK> (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.20; seven trials, 7715 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>). Again, as was the case for the intermediate MI component of this composite outcome, we noted heterogeneity (P = 0.007, I² statistic = 66%). As with intermediate MI alone (see the previous paragraph), this represents a loss of significance relative to the previous version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Hoenig-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoenig 2010</LINK>), due to the influence of the <LINK REF="STD-OASIS-5" TYPE="STUDY">OASIS 5</LINK> substudy and <LINK REF="STD-LIPSIA_x002d_NSTEMI" TYPE="STUDY">LIPSIA-NSTEMI</LINK> studies. Late death or non-fatal MI was not significantly decreased (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.08; three trials, 5467 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-001.13" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.13</LINK>). The late follow-up for this composite endpoint was perhaps less important, given the independent benefit observed for the MI endpoint at late follow-up and the 'dilution' of this effect observed with incorporation of mortality into a composite outcome.</P>
<P>Four included studies reported gender-specific data for males and five studies reported it for females, and subanalysis of intermediate death or non-fatal MI demonstrated a statistically-significant benefit of a routine invasive strategy only in males (male: RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.87; four trials, 4454 participants; female: RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.16; five trials, 2521 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-001.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.12</LINK>). Late (five-year) follow-up from the <LINK REF="STD-FRISC_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">FRISC-II</LINK> trial also showed that the invasive strategy only significantly benefited males (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.86). These subgroup analyses should be interpreted with caution, and we have explored them further in the <LINK TAG="DISCUSSION" TYPE="SECTION">Discussion</LINK>.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Refractory angina (early, intermediate)</HEADING>
<P>An invasive strategy decreased early refractory angina, based upon four-month data from <LINK REF="STD-RITA_x002d_3" TYPE="STUDY">RITA-3</LINK> (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.68). Intermediate refractory angina was significantly decreased using a routine invasive strategy (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.79; five trials, 8287 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-001.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.14</LINK>), although we found significant heterogeneity at this time point (P &lt; 0.0003, I² statistic = 81%), which was driven by the <LINK REF="STD-ICTUS" TYPE="STUDY">ICTUS</LINK> results. The null effect for this endpoint in <LINK REF="STD-ICTUS" TYPE="STUDY">ICTUS</LINK> was surprising, given that this study recruited only troponin-positive participants. Indeed, retrospective analysis of troponin-positive participants from the <LINK REF="STD-TACTICS_x002d_TIMI-18" TYPE="STUDY">TACTICS-TIMI 18</LINK> trial revealed that 94% of troponin-positive participants had significant angiographic CAD, 79% of whom were revascularised (PCI or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)) during the index hospitalisation (<LINK REF="REF-Dokainish-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dokainish 2005</LINK>). Hence, the trial participants in <LINK REF="STD-ICTUS" TYPE="STUDY">ICTUS</LINK> would be expected to exhibit high rates of angiographic CAD and to experience considerable symptomatic improvement with an invasive strategy. One possible explanation for this difference in outcomes is that 20% of the participants enrolled in <LINK REF="STD-ICTUS" TYPE="STUDY">ICTUS</LINK> underwent PCI or CABG prior to randomisation, which potentially resulted in artificially-improved outcomes in the conservative arm as these participants likely had the most to gain from a routine invasive strategy.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>

This attenuation of earlier significance was unsurprising, when we considered the narrowing in the difference in revascularisation rates between the two strategies in <LINK REF="STD-ICTUS" TYPE="STUDY">ICTUS</LINK>, from a 36% difference at initial hospitalisation between revascularisation in the routine invasive versus conservative or selective invasive strategies, to only 23% at the termination of follow-up.</P>

Hence, there did not appear to be an early hazard to an invasive strategy when glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists were used upstream of PCI. Early MI was reduced by an invasive strategy, based on <LINK REF="STD-TACTICS_x002d_TIMI-18" TYPE="STUDY">TACTICS-TIMI 18</LINK> data at 30 days (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.79; one trial, 2220 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>).

<P>Data for this composite endpoint at index and early (30-day) time points were only available from <LINK REF="STD-TACTICS_x002d_TIMI-18" TYPE="STUDY">TACTICS-TIMI 18</LINK>. There was no difference between the treatment strategies at index admission (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.17; one trial, 2220 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>). However, the invasive strategy was associated with significant early benefit (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.94; one trial, 2220 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>). Baseline troponin levels were available from 1826 of 2220 trial participants, and these data formed the basis for the prespecified subgroup analysis based on TnT levels greater than (troponin positive) or less than (troponin negative) 0.01 ng/mL. Upon subgroup analysis, the early (30 day) benefit of a routine invasive strategy only achieved statistical significance in troponin-positive participants (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.79). Troponin-negative participants received no significant benefit at 30-days follow-up (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.06), although this CI overlapped with those of troponin-positive participants. Although the <LINK REF="STD-TACTICS_x002d_TIMI-18" TYPE="STUDY">TACTICS-TIMI 18</LINK> trial authors prespecified this subgroup analysis based on troponin, it should nevertheless be interpreted with caution.</P>
<P>Contrary to the early results, at intermediate (six-month) follow-up, adoption of a routine invasive strategy yielded no benefit (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.60; two trials, 2820 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>). The results of this subgroup analysis changed when the <LINK REF="STD-TACTICS_x002d_TIMI-18" TYPE="STUDY">TACTICS-TIMI 18</LINK> authors used a different cardiac biomarker. With subgroup analysis based on a TnI cut-off of 0.1 ng/mL, troponin-positive participants showed early (30 day) and intermediate (six month) benefits of an invasive strategy, with a RR of 0.47 (95% CI 0.30 to 0.73) and a RR of 0.67 (95% CI 0.47 to 0.96) respectively. The <LINK REF="STD-TACTICS_x002d_TIMI-18" TYPE="STUDY">TACTICS-TIMI 18</LINK> authors prespecified such subgroup analysis based on troponin, but should nevertheless be interpreted with caution. The <LINK REF="STD-ICTUS" TYPE="STUDY">ICTUS</LINK> trial suggested no benefit of a routine invasive strategy at late follow-up regardless of baseline risk (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.63; one trial, 1200 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-001.13" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.13</LINK>); we have explored this further in the <LINK TAG="DISCUSSION" TYPE="SECTION">Discussion</LINK>.</P>

However, we noted significant heterogeneity was noted (P=0.02, I² statistic = 68%). This may have been driven by the stringent criteria set by the <LINK REF="STD-FRISC_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">FRISC-II</LINK> group to define failure of conservative therapy; and by the large benefit of an invasive strategy observed in the small <LINK REF="STD-VINO" TYPE="STUDY">VINO</LINK> study, which randomised patients with the highest death rates of all five studies (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). The <LINK REF="STD-FRISC_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">FRISC-II</LINK> trial authors undertook subgroup analysis based on the presence of TnT greater than or less than 0.03 ng/mL and the presence of ST depression on the admission ECG. Mortality assessed at one year was not affected by an invasive strategy in this retrospective analysis, even in the group of participants with both TnT greater than 0.03 ng/mL and ST depression, although the numbers of participants may have been too small to detect any difference. Only <LINK REF="STD-FRISC_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">FRISC-II</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-RITA_x002d_3" TYPE="STUDY">RITA-3</LINK> provided follow-up data for late death at five years, and was not significantly improved by an invasive strategy (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.04; two trials, 4267 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>).</P>

Importantly, the four studies in this analysis did not undertake routine cardiac biomarkers measurements post-PCI, as the <LINK REF="STD-ICTUS" TYPE="STUDY">ICTUS</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-LIPSIA_x002d_NSTEMI" TYPE="STUDY">LIPSIA-NSTEMI</LINK> did, and used clinical symptoms as a diagnostic criterion (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). Significant heterogeneity may be due to the distinct <LINK REF="STD-VINO" TYPE="STUDY">VINO</LINK> definition of MI, which excluded events within 72 hours of randomisation when calculating this endpoint. Early MI, based on 30-day <LINK REF="STD-VINO" TYPE="STUDY">VINO</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-OASIS-5" TYPE="STUDY">OASIS 5</LINK> data, and four-month <LINK REF="STD-RITA_x002d_3" TYPE="STUDY">RITA-3</LINK> data, was not significantly altered by a routine invasive strategy (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.44; three trials, 2125 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>).

Notably, this contrasts with the <LINK REF="STD-FRISC_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">FRISC-II</LINK> data, from which a significant hazard of the routine invasive strategy was identified for this endpoint (RR 2.07, 95% CI 1.42 to 3.03). There was no significant benefit with a routine invasive strategy with respect to early death or non-fatal MI based on 30-day <LINK REF="STD-VINO" TYPE="STUDY">VINO</LINK> data (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.39; one trial, 131 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>). Similarly, there was no difference between strategies at the intermediate time point (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.32; five trials, 4895 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>) with analysis of data from <LINK REF="STD-FRISC_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">FRISC-II</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-RITA_x002d_3" TYPE="STUDY">RITA-3</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-OASIS-5" TYPE="STUDY">OASIS 5</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Italian-Elderly-ACS" TYPE="STUDY">Italian Elderly ACS</LINK>, in addition to <LINK REF="STD-VINO" TYPE="STUDY">VINO</LINK>. However, drawing on five-year results from <LINK REF="STD-FRISC_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">FRISC-II</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-RITA_x002d_3" TYPE="STUDY">RITA-3</LINK>, we noted a significant benefit for this composite outcome with a routine invasive strategy (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.92; two trials, 4267 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-001.13" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.13</LINK>).</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-FRISC_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">FRISC-II</LINK> data revealed that the intermediate (six to 12-month) benefit of a routine invasive strategy was only significant in participants with ST depression at entry, who exhibited a RR of 0.66 (95% CI 0.50 to 0.88). There was no benefit from a routine invasive strategy in participants without ST depression, although such retrospective subgroup analysis should be interpreted with caution. Furthermore, <LINK REF="STD-FRISC_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">FRISC-II</LINK> troponin subgroup analysis identified a RR of 0.71 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.93) at 12 months in troponin-positive participants (TnT greater than 0.1 ng/mL), whereas participants with a TnT of less than 0.1 ng/mL only trended towards benefit with a RR of 0.77 (95% CI 0.53 to 1.11). Again, the CIs of these subgroup analyses overlap and the results should be regarded with caution. In a separate report, the <LINK REF="STD-FRISC_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">FRISC-II</LINK> trial authors undertook subgroup analysis based on the presence of TnT greater than versus less than 0.03 ng/mL and the presence of ST depression on admission ECG.

Likewise, the <LINK REF="STD-FRISC_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">FRISC-II</LINK> trial authors stratified participants by FRISC score when they reported late (five-year) outcomes for this endpoint.

As already discussed, the significance of a peri-procedural cardiac biomarker leak is the subject of considerable debate, but can be modified by background medications, including use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists (<LINK REF="REF-Cutlip-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cutlip 2005</LINK>). Notably, the increased rate of procedure-related MI seen in participants subjected to a routine invasive strategy did not translate into any increased long-term mortality.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Bleeding</HEADING>
<P>The invasive strategy was associated with an increased risk of bleeding (RR 1.73, 95% CI 1.30 to 2.31; six trials, 7584 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>), although we noted considerable variability in bleeding definitions between the included studies that reported this endpoint (<LINK REF="STD-FRISC_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">FRISC-II</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ICTUS" TYPE="STUDY">ICTUS,</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Italian-Elderly-ACS" TYPE="STUDY">Italian Elderly ACS</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-LIPSIA_x002d_NSTEMI" TYPE="STUDY">LIPSIA-NSTEMI</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-OASIS-5" TYPE="STUDY">OASIS 5</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-RITA_x002d_3" TYPE="STUDY">RITA-3</LINK>). Numerous studies of people with UA/NSTEMI have identified major bleeding as a harbinger of a poor ultimate outcome. The <LINK REF="STD-ICTUS" TYPE="STUDY">ICTUS</LINK> trial authors reported major bleeding, which was defined as: fatal bleeding, intracranial bleeding, need for transfusion, a decrease in haemoglobin by 4.8 g/dL, or bleeding causing haemodynamic compromise. Major bleeding occurred in 3.1% and 1.7% (P = not significant) of participants randomised to a routine invasive versus conservative strategy, respectively, during the initial hospitalisation. On four-year follow-up, mortality was 18.6% in the 29 participants with major bleeding during initial hospitalisation, versus just 7.5% in the 1171 participants without an in-hospital major bleed (RR 2.68, 95% CI 1.08 to 6.61).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Contrast reactions</HEADING>
<P>Typically, 1% of participants assigned to an invasive strategy experienced a contrast allergy. The rate in the conservative strategy depended on the proportion that underwent subsequent angiography, and this depended upon the population risk level.

</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analysis</HEADING>
<P>We chose a random-effects model to analyse the results, as it provides a more conservative estimate of effect size in the presence of a small number of studies and variable risk levels among randomised participants. <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> highlights important differences between the included studies, which guided our choice of sensitivity analysis based on the exclusion of certain studies. We did not subject recurrent angina and rehospitalisation endpoints to sensitivity analysis, because RR estimates were the most consistent and robust findings of this meta-analysis and, in general, were not associated with significant heterogeneity.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Time to angiography</HEADING>
<P>As previously discussed, time to angiography in the invasive arm could influence outcomes, and optimal timing remains unclear (<LINK REF="REF-Navarese-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Navarese 2013</LINK>). Indeed, the <LINK REF="STD-ISAR_x002d_COOL" TYPE="STUDY">ISAR-COOL</LINK> study found that, in participants with UA/NSTEMI, a 'delayed invasive' strategy with angiography three to five days postrandomisation approximately doubled the risk of death or non-fatal MI over that observed in participants with an 'early invasive' strategy in whom angiography was performed within six hours of randomisation. The excess events in the late invasive arm occurred prior to angiography; this was observed despite background anti-thrombotic therapy which included aspirin, clopidogrel, tirofiban and heparin. Notably, this study randomised a high risk population with roughly two thirds of participants positive for troponin and ST depression on ECG (<LINK REF="STD-ISAR_x002d_COOL" TYPE="STUDY">ISAR-COOL</LINK>). We have presented the times to angiography in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' table and can be categorised into an 'immediate invasive', 'early invasive' or 'delayed invasive' strategy. The <LINK REF="STD-ICTUS" TYPE="STUDY">ICTUS</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-TACTICS_x002d_TIMI-18" TYPE="STUDY">TACTICS-TIMI 18</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-VINO" TYPE="STUDY">VINO</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Italian-Elderly-ACS" TYPE="STUDY">Italian Elderly ACS</LINK> studies generally employed angiography within 24 hours of randomisation; whereas in the <LINK REF="STD-FRISC_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">FRISC-II</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-OASIS-5" TYPE="STUDY">OASIS 5</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-RITA_x002d_3" TYPE="STUDY">RITA-3</LINK> studies, angiography was typically delayed for at least two days.</P>
<P>The increasing interest in timing of invasive strategies has resulted in more considered comparisons of timing to determine optimal management. The most recently performed study of the included clinical trials, the <LINK REF="STD-LIPSIA_x002d_NSTEMI" TYPE="STUDY">LIPSIA-NSTEMI</LINK> trial, randomised participants to immediate, early and selective invasive approaches with median times from randomisation to angiography of 1.1, 18.6 and 67.2 hours respectively.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Mortality rates In the conservative arm</HEADING>
<P>We have presented mortality rates in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> as the mortality rate in the conservative arm divided by the number of years of follow-up. The <LINK REF="STD-OASIS-5" TYPE="STUDY">OASIS 5</LINK> substudy, <LINK REF="STD-ICTUS" TYPE="STUDY">ICTUS</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-FRISC_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">FRISC-II</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-RITA_x002d_3" TYPE="STUDY">RITA-3</LINK> had mortality rates of 1.1% to 2.8% per year of follow-up, while <LINK REF="STD-TACTICS_x002d_TIMI-18" TYPE="STUDY">TACTICS-TIMI 18</LINK> had a rate of 7%, the <LINK REF="STD-Italian-Elderly-ACS" TYPE="STUDY">Italian Elderly ACS</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-LIPSIA_x002d_NSTEMI" TYPE="STUDY">LIPSIA-NSTEMI</LINK> trials had rates between 13% and 14%, and <LINK REF="STD-VINO" TYPE="STUDY">VINO</LINK> had a rate of 27%.

When we analysed the high-mortality and low-mortality rate studies separately, the previously-reported findings were significantly different, which is likely due to the inclusion of the more recent <LINK REF="STD-Italian-Elderly-ACS" TYPE="STUDY">Italian Elderly ACS</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-LIPSIA_x002d_NSTEMI" TYPE="STUDY">LIPSIA-NSTEMI</LINK> studies.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Percentage of trial participants with a positive troponin</HEADING>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Summary of findings</HEADING>
<P>Eight randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 8915 participants (4545 invasive strategies, 4370 conservative strategies) were eligible for inclusion.</P>
<P>In the all-study analysis, evidence did not show appreciable risk reductions in all-cause mortality (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.18; eight studies, 8915 participants; low quality evidence) and death or non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.2; seven studies, 7715 participants; low quality evidence) with routine invasive strategies compared to conservative (selective invasive) strategies at six to 12 months follow-up. There was appreciable risk reduction in MI (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.63 to 1; eight studies, 8915 participants; moderate quality evidence), refractory angina (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.79; five studies, 8287 participants; moderate quality evidence) and rehospitalisation (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.94; six studies, 6921 participants; moderate quality evidence) with routine invasive strategies compared to conservative (selective invasive) strategies also at six to 12 months follow-up.</P>
<P>There were increased risks in bleeding (RR 1.73, 95% CI 1.3 to 2.31; six studies, 7584 participants; moderate quality evidence) and procedure-related MI (RR 1.87, 95% CI 1.47 to 2.37; five studies, 6380 participants; moderate quality evidence) with routine invasive strategies compared to conservative (selective invasive) strategies. Low quality evidence was as a result of serious risk of bias and imprecision in the estimate of effect, while moderate quality evidence was only due to serious risk of bias.</P>
<P>The risk of index death (during the initial hospitalisation for unstable angina and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (UA/NSTEMI)) was high when an invasive strategy was adopted from the outset, with a RR of 1.54 (95% CI 1.02 to 2.34). However, early death (less than four months), intermediate death (six to 12 months) and late death (four to five years) were not influenced by management strategy. Though index MI was not significantly improved with an invasive strategy, we identified significant heterogeneity within this analysis, possibly driven by the different levels of risk, different rates of background medical therapies and different criteria for ischaemia in the studies included in the analysis. Early MI data from trials that routinely used glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists revealed a significant benefit of a routine invasive strategy (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.79), though in the all-study combined analysis, this failed to achieve statistical significance (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.08).</P>
<P>In comparison to previous versions of this Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Hoenig-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoenig 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hoenig-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoenig 2010</LINK>), the inclusion of <LINK REF="STD-OASIS-5" TYPE="STUDY">OASIS 5</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Italian-Elderly-ACS" TYPE="STUDY">Italian Elderly ACS</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-LIPSIA_x002d_NSTEMI" TYPE="STUDY">LIPSIA-NSTEMI</LINK> studies resulted in the loss of significant benefit in the all-study analysis of a routine invasive approach at the intermediate MI endpoint (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.00). However, we observed a significant difference between strategies at the endpoint with the exclusion of the studies employing routine glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.89). With a routine invasive strategy, the significant reduction observed in late MI remained unchanged (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.92), driven by studies that did not employ routine glycoprotein IIb/IIIa strategy (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.90).</P>
<P>Regarding the composite endpoint of death or non-fatal MI, although a routine invasive approach was not beneficial at the time of index hospitalisation, we observed a significant benefit at the early time point (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.92). The all-study analysis of the this endpoint at the intermediate time point lost significance (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.20). However, an unchanged benefit remained significant amongst males (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.87). Late death or non-fatal MI was unaffected by management strategy (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.08). The studies that reported the death or MI endpoint suggest that any benefits of a routine invasive strategy were significant only in trial participants with high-risk characteristics, primarily positive troponin or dynamic ischaemic electrocardiograph (ECG) changes on admission or secondary diabetes mellitus, renal insufficiency, reduced EF to less than 40%, early postinfarction angina, recent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), prior coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), or intermediate to high Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) risk score (<LINK REF="REF-Hamm-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamm 2011</LINK>). These markers of risk may have identified populations with higher event rates and, hence, enhanced the power to detect differences between the two strategies. The CIs between subgroups overlapped, and these findings from post-hoc analyses should be interpreted with appropriate caution.</P>
<P>We observed a statistically-significant benefit for both refractory angina and rehospitalisation (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.79; and RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.94, respectively) at the intermediate time point, both driven by the benefit of an invasive strategy in studies that did not use routine glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors. However, the narrowing difference in revascularisation rates between the two strategies over time reduces the hospitalisation benefit longer term.</P>
<P>Regarding safety endpoints, the invasive strategy was associated with a 1.9-fold increase in the RR of the variably defined procedurally-related MI endpoint, as well as a 1.8-fold increase in the RR of bleeding. This bleeding was mainly due to wound site bleeding, but was difficult to grade due to inter-trial differences in the definition of bleeds and reporting of data. No increase risk of stroke was noted (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.86).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cardiac troponin status of participants</HEADING>
<P>The baseline cardiac biomarker status of the patient serves as an important tool for risk stratification, though the ideal marker and definitions remain unclear and have evolved over time with advances in technology ( creatine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB) versus troponin versus high-sensitivity troponin). The <LINK REF="STD-TACTICS_x002d_TIMI-18" TYPE="STUDY">TACTICS-TIMI 18</LINK> trial had the prespecified intention of testing the 'troponin hypothesis': that is, to test whether benefit from an invasive strategy was limited to troponin-positive participants. Data for the death or non-fatal MI endpoint from <LINK REF="STD-TACTICS_x002d_TIMI-18" TYPE="STUDY">TACTICS-TIMI 18</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-FRISC_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">FRISC-II</LINK> suggest that only high-risk participants with a positive troponin benefited from a routine invasive strategy with respect to this endpoint. However, the CI for this subgroup analysis showed overlap with that of troponin-negative participants. The <LINK REF="STD-Italian-Elderly-ACS" TYPE="STUDY">Italian Elderly ACS</LINK> reinforced the importance of baseline troponin status on treatment effect, and identified a significant reduction in the primary endpoint (composite of death, MI, disabling stroke and repeat hospital stay for cardiovascular causes or severe bleeding within one year) amongst participants with an elevated troponin on admission (hazard ratio (HR) 0.43, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.80) but not in those with normal troponin (HR 1.67, 95% CI 0.75 to 3.70). Data from <LINK REF="STD-VINO" TYPE="STUDY">VINO</LINK>, which only included participants with clinical symptoms, ECG changes and positive cardiac biomarkers, revealed a significant 72% risk ratio reduction in this endpoint at six months. However, the <LINK REF="STD-ICTUS" TYPE="STUDY">ICTUS</LINK> trial, which also exclusively enrolled troponin-positive participants, had an unexpectedly low baseline mortality rate relative to the other included studies (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). This may be partly due to optimal medical therapy in the <LINK REF="STD-ICTUS" TYPE="STUDY">ICTUS</LINK> trial versus other included trials wherein, in both trial arms, early use of clopidogrel and intensive lipid-lowering therapy was recommended to treating clinicians. Alternatively, this may be a statistical outlier given the large CIs for mortality in these studies. Disparate event rates in participants with positive troponin highlights the importance of global risk stratification as opposed to using cardiac biomarkers as a single risk index. Indeed, in a retrospective analysis of the <LINK REF="STD-FRISC_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">FRISC-II</LINK> data (<LINK REF="REF-Diderholm-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diderholm 2002</LINK>), death or non-fatal MI experienced a significant 40% risk ratio reduction only in participants with both troponin T (TnT) greater than 0.03 ng/mL and ST depression on admission ECG. Hence, although <LINK REF="STD-ICTUS" TYPE="STUDY">ICTUS</LINK> participants all had a TnT of greater than 0.03 ng/mL, this sole criterion did not necessarily identify a risk level that might benefit from invasive treatment. The risk associated with troponin elevation has been shown to be a continuous variable and therefore classification as a dichotomous variable may dilute its predictive power.</P>
<P>Though some have argued that the prognostic value of troponin is greater than that of CK-MB (<LINK REF="REF-Montalescot-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montalescot 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saenger-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saenger 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thompson-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 1979</LINK>), troponin may be overly sensitive for the detection of re-infarction and only elevated CK-MB has been correlated with evidence of myocardial necrosis (<LINK REF="REF-Lim-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lim 2011</LINK>). Retrospective analysis performed by the <LINK REF="STD-TACTICS_x002d_TIMI-18" TYPE="STUDY">TACTICS-TIMI 18</LINK> trial authors highlights the limitations of purely using a positive troponin to predict event rates. Analysis of the invasive arm revealed that 6% of the participants with a positive troponin test did not have significant angiographic coronary artery disease (CAD), defined as greater than 50% stenosis of any coronary artery (<LINK REF="REF-Dokainish-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dokainish 2005</LINK>). At six months, these participants had a 3.1% rate of death or re-infarction, compared to 0% among those with a negative troponin and no angiographic CAD. As would be expected, troponin-positive participants with angiographic CAD had a high rate of death or re-infarction (8.6%) at six months. Interestingly, participants with angiographic CAD who had a negative troponin had a 5.8% rate of death or re-infarction at six months, which is clearly higher than that for troponin-positive participants without angiographic CAD. Hence, troponin alone cannot be used to risk stratify patients. Moreover, this analysis highlights the limitations of angiography in the assessment of plaque burden. In general in unstable angina studies, positive troponin status has been shown to correlate with complex coronary lesions on angiography and reduced coronary flow (<LINK REF="REF-Benamer-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benamer 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heeschen-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heeschen 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hochman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hochman 1999</LINK>), but should not be used alone to identify those at high-risk. However, absolute values of troponin exhibit a linear relationship with subsequent risk of coronary events. Troponin positivity has also been shown to predict benefit from glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists (<LINK REF="REF-Hamm-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamm 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heeschen-1999b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heeschen 1999b</LINK>), an early invasive strategy in the elderly (<LINK REF="STD-Italian-Elderly-ACS" TYPE="STUDY">Italian Elderly ACS</LINK>), and remains a critical element of risk stratification.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">ST depression on admission</HEADING>
<P>As previously mentioned, ECG changes on admission forebode a worse prognosis in UA/NSTEMI patients. Indeed, data from the <LINK REF="REF-TIMI-III-Registry" TYPE="REFERENCE">TIMI III Registry</LINK> shows that patients with ST depression on admission ECG have a 2.5-fold increased risk of death or MI within one year (<LINK REF="REF-Cannon-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cannon 1997</LINK>). In the <LINK REF="STD-ICTUS" TYPE="STUDY">ICTUS</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-TACTICS_x002d_TIMI-18" TYPE="STUDY">TACTICS-TIMI 18</LINK> trials, ST depression was an independent predictor of failure of medical therapy with the conservative strategy (<LINK REF="REF-Sabatine-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sabatine 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Windhausen-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Windhausen 2007b</LINK>). As discussed above, on post-hoc analysis of <LINK REF="STD-FRISC_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">FRISC-II</LINK> data, the benefit of a routine invasive strategy on the endpoint of death or non-fatal MI only achieved statistical significance in participants with ST depression on admission ECG. In <LINK REF="STD-FRISC_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">FRISC-II</LINK> and the <LINK REF="REF-TIMI-III-Registry" TYPE="REFERENCE">TIMI III Registry</LINK>, the prevalence rates for triple-vessel and left main artery disease were approximately 50% and 66%, respectively, in participants who had ST depression on admission ECG. Similarly, the <LINK REF="STD-TACTICS_x002d_TIMI-18" TYPE="STUDY">TACTICS-TIMI 18</LINK> study identified an odds ratio for three-vessel disease of 1.79 in participants with ST deviation of 0.05 to 0.09 mV, and an odds ratio of 1.91 in those with a ST deviation greater than 0.10 mV versus those with a ST deviation less than 0.05 mV. Hence, the ECG can be used as a tool to identify patients who are likely to benefit from revascularisation. Analysis of the <LINK REF="STD-FRISC_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">FRISC-II</LINK> data demonstrated that ST depression was still a predictor of benefit from an invasive strategy, even after baseline differences were accounted for (<LINK REF="REF-Holmvang-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holmvang 2003</LINK>). Furthermore, this analysis also suggested that the benefits of a routine invasive strategy were further amplified with increasing amplitude of ST depression in an increasing number of ECG leads.</P>
<P>Data from <LINK REF="STD-TACTICS_x002d_TIMI-18" TYPE="STUDY">TACTICS-TIMI 18</LINK> confirms the utility of ST segment changes in identifying a higher-risk population that may benefit from an invasive strategy. Unfortunately, we could not obtain data for the composite endpoint of death or non-fatal MI, but the study includes data for the endpoint of death or non-fatal MI or rehospitalisation for ACS. Using this endpoint, the RR was 0.62 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.74) in participants with baseline ST changes, while no effect was observed in those without such changes. The <LINK REF="STD-ICTUS" TYPE="STUDY">ICTUS</LINK> data show a trend towards decreased rates of (spontaneous) MI at one year in those randomised to a routine invasive strategy, with a risk ratio of 0.74 (95% CI 0.40 to 1.38). However, the events were few and CIs were wide. In light of the potential implications of ST-depression on treatment effect, we have provided the percentages of trial participants with ST depression on index ECG in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>, with the highest rates of 62% reported in the <LINK REF="STD-LIPSIA_x002d_NSTEMI" TYPE="STUDY">LIPSIA-NSTEMI</LINK> study. In general the studies eligible for analysis did not provide data for subgroup analysis of ST depression and troponin status. While subgroup analyses may identify populations with increased risk, and hence provide increased power to detect statistical significance, such post-hoc analyses should be interpreted with caution.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Gender</HEADING>
<P>Disparate outcomes of a routine invasive strategy based on gender has been a source of controversy. The all-study (Analysis 1) gender subanalysis for intermediate death or non-fatal MI revealed a benefit of routine invasive strategy confined to males. However, the number of women in the studies was lower than the number of men, and the decreased power to detect any advantage of routine invasive strategy is highlighted by the comparatively wide CIs. <LINK REF="STD-TACTICS_x002d_TIMI-18" TYPE="STUDY">TACTICS-TIMI 18</LINK> identified no significant interaction between gender and outcomes based on treatment strategy. Conversely, the <LINK REF="STD-FRISC_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">FRISC-II</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-RITA_x002d_3" TYPE="STUDY">RITA-3</LINK> trials found significant benefit of a routine invasive strategy for death or MI amongst men, but not women. Supporting this, the <LINK REF="STD-OASIS-5" TYPE="STUDY">OASIS 5</LINK> substudy, which randomly assigned 184 women to a routine or selective invasive strategy, identified significantly more deaths after one year (HR 9.01, 95% CI 1.11 to 72.90) and higher rates of major bleeding at 30 days (HR 11.45, 95% CI 1.43 to 91.96) with a routine invasive strategy.</P>
<P>Confounding comparison and interpretation of these results, women had less severe CAD across the studies analysed, and were less likely to have an elevated troponin level than men (<LINK REF="REF-Clayton-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clayton 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glaser-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glaser 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lagerqvist-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lagerqvist 2001</LINK>). Moreover, in <LINK REF="STD-FRISC_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">FRISC-II</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-RITA_x002d_3" TYPE="STUDY">RITA-3</LINK>, women in the conservative arm had a better prognosis than men in the conservative arm. A retrospective analysis of <LINK REF="STD-TACTICS_x002d_TIMI-18" TYPE="STUDY">TACTICS-TIMI 18</LINK> data suggests that, after adjusting for differences in baseline characteristics, the benefits of an early invasive strategy in women were the same as those seen in men (<LINK REF="REF-Glaser-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glaser 2002</LINK>). In contrast, similar analyses undertaken by <LINK REF="STD-FRISC_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">FRISC-II</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-RITA_x002d_3" TYPE="STUDY">RITA-3</LINK> trial authors failed to demonstrate any benefit of an invasive strategy in women, even after they adjusted for baseline characteristics. The <LINK REF="STD-RITA_x002d_3" TYPE="STUDY">RITA-3</LINK> analysis suggested that women had better outcomes than men when managed conservatively and did not benefit from an invasive strategy, even when those with high-risk features were analysed separately (<LINK REF="REF-Clayton-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clayton 2004</LINK>). Women in <LINK REF="STD-TACTICS_x002d_TIMI-18" TYPE="STUDY">TACTICS-TIMI 18</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-RITA_x002d_3" TYPE="STUDY">RITA-3</LINK> were less likely than men to undergo CABG, even when trials adjusted for the presence of three-vessel or left anterior descending artery disease (<LINK REF="REF-Clayton-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clayton 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glaser-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glaser 2002</LINK>). Notably in <LINK REF="STD-FRISC_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">FRISC-II</LINK>, where the rates of CABG were similar in both men and women, the one-year mortality rate in participants undergoing CABG was 9.9% in women versus just 1.2% in men (<LINK REF="REF-Lagerqvist-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lagerqvist 2001</LINK>). Higher operative CABG mortality has been observed in women enrolled in observational studies and this discrepancy could not be accounted for by age, co-morbidities or smaller body surface area (<LINK REF="REF-Blankstein-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blankstein 2005</LINK>). These retrospective analyses should be interpreted with appropriate caution. They highlight the importance of further research to determine the optimal treatment strategy in women, and the importance of risk stratification, especially in women who are less likely to have angiographic CAD when compared to their male counterparts, and requisite caution extrapolating results from men to women.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Elderly</HEADING>
<P>The elderly (aged over 65 years) comprise the majority of hospital admissions for UA/NSTEMI. Given the higher risk of recurrent events in this group compared to counterparts who are younger, increased absolute risk may translate into a greater absolute risk reduction with improved understanding of the relative benefits of invasive versus conservative management (<LINK REF="REF-Alexander-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alexander 2007</LINK>). Despite this, there is a deficit of knowledge regarding the management of elderly patients, since the included studies in this Cochrane review generally excluded participants over 75 years of age.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Italian-Elderly-ACS" TYPE="STUDY">Italian Elderly ACS</LINK> was the only RCT to specifically compare treatment strategies in elderly participants with non-ST-elevation ACS. Here, we did not identify any statistical difference between early aggressive and initially-conservative groups for the primary endpoint of composite death, MI, disabling stroke and repeat hospital stay for cardiovascular or bleeding causes (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.19) or for mortality (HR 0.87; 95% CI 0.49 to 1.56), MI (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.36) or repeat hospitalisation (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.46) when examined alone. However, stratification of participants dependent on baseline troponin revealed a significant reduction in the primary endpoint amongst troponin-positive (HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.80) versus troponin-negative participants (HR 1.67, 95% CI 0.75 to 3.70; P = 0.03). Implicit in this is the lost advantage of an early invasive strategy in troponin-negative elderly, who can be safely managed conservatively. These findings are supported by the collaborative analysis of individual data from the FRISC II-<LINK REF="STD-ICTUS" TYPE="STUDY">ICTUS</LINK>-RITA 3 (FIR) trials (<LINK REF="REF-Damman-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Damman 2012</LINK>), where a 29% reduction in cardiovascular death or MI was reported with a routine invasive strategy in participant greater than or equal to 75 years old, with sustained benefit still demonstrated at long-term follow-up.</P>
<P>A retrospective analysis of the <LINK REF="STD-TACTICS_x002d_TIMI-18" TYPE="STUDY">TACTICS-TIMI 18</LINK> trial showed that those over 65 years of age were more likely to have high-risk features, such as elevated troponin levels, ST-deviation, diabetes and congestive heart failure (<LINK REF="REF-Bach-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bach 2004</LINK>). Indeed, 90% of those over 65 years old had intermediate to high-risk TIMI scores (score greater than or equal to three), versus just 63% of those under 65 years of age. Overall, the routine invasive strategy reduced early and intermediate death or MI when compared to conservative management amongst those over 65 years of age, with risk ratios of 0.58 (95% CI 0.37 to 0.92) and 0.64 (95% CI 0.45 to 0.93), respectively. The invasive strategy did not significantly benefit those under 65 years old, which suggests that benefit increases with age, though the CIs were wide and overlapped. However, major bleeding was higher with the invasive strategy in those over 65 (RR 1.74, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.70), while no such hazard was observed in those under 65 years of age.</P>
<P>Reassuringly, in both the <LINK REF="STD-Italian-Elderly-ACS" TYPE="STUDY">Italian Elderly ACS</LINK> and the retrospective analysis of the <LINK REF="STD-TACTICS_x002d_TIMI-18" TYPE="STUDY">TACTICS-TIMI 18</LINK> trial, stroke was not increased with an invasive strategy in the elderly, and in fact demonstrated a trend towards decreased events with the routine invasive strategy adopted in <LINK REF="STD-TACTICS_x002d_TIMI-18" TYPE="STUDY">TACTICS-TIMI 18</LINK>. The results of this type of analysis are unsurprising, given that the elderly are at increased risk of events. Therefore, retrospective analysis should have greater power to identify benefits of an intervention with absolute event rates.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-FRISC_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">FRISC-II</LINK> trial authors also published risk ratio estimates for participants based on age; and while the risk estimate was only significant in those over 65 years old, the risk estimate for those under 65 years of age was similar and the CIs overlapped (<LINK REF="REF-Lagerqvist-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lagerqvist 2006</LINK>). However, the results from <LINK REF="STD-TACTICS_x002d_TIMI-18" TYPE="STUDY">TACTICS-TIMI 18</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-FRISC_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">FRISC-II</LINK> differ from older excluded studies such as <LINK REF="STD-TIMI_x002d_3b" TYPE="STUDY">TIMI-3b</LINK>, which showed a significant hazard of intervention in younger trial participants. This point again reinforces the reasoning behind only including studies that were undertaken in the stent era, since older studies are irrelevant to contemporary practice.</P>
<P>The 2012 American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Associate (ACCF/AHA) focused update, <LINK REF="REF-Jneid-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jneid 2012</LINK>, and the 2011 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines, <LINK REF="REF-Hamm-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamm 2011</LINK>, on the management of UA/NSTEMI endorse an early invasive strategy (Level B evidence) for elderly patients, despite increased early procedural risks. Moreover, since elderly patients recruited into clinical trials generally have fewer cardiovascular risk factors, fewer co-morbidities, and better haemodynamics and renal function than community-dwelling elderly, event rates and benefits from a routine invasive strategy might be even greater in the 'real world'. Registry data support the use of the routine invasive strategy in the elderly, and there is no stroke hazard as a consequence of routine intervention reported in contemporary registries (<LINK REF="REF-Bauer-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bauer 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>However, in the real world, acute coronary care for the elderly is provided within the context of the health and co-morbid status of the patient. These factors also need to be considered for therapeutic decision-making. Despite the lack of any statistically-significant benefit with an invasive strategy in younger age groups, this is not to say that younger patients with high-risk features would not benefit from a routine invasive approach. Age is included in the TIMI risk score, which integrates several prognostic variables readily available from the clinical history and first-line investigations (<LINK REF="REF-Antman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Antman 2000</LINK>). Similarly, retrospective analyses from the included studies have suggested that diabetes, peripheral arterial disease and a history of previous coronary artery bypass grafting are co-morbid conditions associated with an increased risk of events and, hence, the potential for enhanced benefit from an early invasive strategy, as well as a more favourable risk-benefit ratio (<LINK REF="REF-Januzzi-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Januzzi 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kugelmass-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kugelmass 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Norhammar-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norhammar 2004</LINK>). However, as with age, there is co-variation with other indicators of high-risk. Consequently, while retrospective analyses that focus on a single indicator of higher risk are interesting, a universal and easily-applied method of risk stratification that can be utilised by the practicing physician would be of greater interest.</P>

<P>The relative benefit of adopting a routine invasive strategy has been a contentious issue amongst people with diabetes, who have both an increased risk of recurrent cardiovascular events and an increased risk of intervention due to co-morbid conditions. A collaborative meta-analysis of RCTs, which incorporated 9904 participants, compared conservative verse invasive treatment strategies between diabetic and non-diabetic patients (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Donoghue-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Donoghue 2012</LINK>). Although an invasive strategy yielded similar reductions in diabetic and non-diabetic participants in overall cardiovascular events, the reduction in recurrent non-fatal MI was greater in diabetic participants. The data presented by <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Donoghue-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Donoghue 2012</LINK> support the 2012 ACCF/AHA focused update (<LINK REF="REF-Jneid-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jneid 2012</LINK>; Level B evidence) and the 2011 ESC guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Hamm-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamm 2011</LINK>; Level A evidence), which recommend use of an invasive strategy for people with diabetes who present with UA/NSTEMI.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">The importance of global risk stratification</HEADING>
<P>As the above discussion highlights, and as subgroup analyses have illustrated, risk stratification is an integral component of managing patients with UA/NSTEMI. The goal of risk stratification is to identify patients with a high likelihood of complicated CAD who are at increased risk of recurrent coronary events or premature death, and to offer such patients the benefits of revascularisation. However, the clinical distinction between UA and NSTEMI does not adequately stratify high-risk patients (<LINK REF="REF-Zaacks-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zaacks 1999</LINK>). Consequently, the current 2012 ACCF/AHA focused update, <LINK REF="REF-Jneid-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jneid 2012</LINK>, and the 2011 ESC guidelines, <LINK REF="REF-Hamm-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamm 2011</LINK>, recommend using several parameters for risk stratification; as occurs with the application of risk scoring tools, for example the TIMI risk score (<LINK REF="REF-Antman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Antman 2000</LINK>). To underscore this point, in a post-hoc analysis of the <LINK REF="STD-FRISC_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">FRISC-II</LINK> data, participants with troponin T of greater than 0.03 ng/mL and ST depression experienced a statistically-significant benefit with a routine invasive strategy, whereas participants with only one of these variables did not (<LINK REF="REF-Diderholm-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diderholm 2002</LINK>). Only <LINK REF="STD-TACTICS_x002d_TIMI-18" TYPE="STUDY">TACTICS-TIMI 18</LINK> undertook subgroup analyses based on TIMI risk scores, and stratified the participants into three categories based on their TIMI risk score: low-, intermediate- or high-risk. In this study, only intermediate- and high-risk participants benefited from the invasive strategy, regarding the primary composite endpoint of death or non-fatal MI or rehospitalisation for ACS. Unfortunately, data for the composite endpoint of death or non-fatal MI were unavailable and therefore we could not incorporate them into this Cochrane review.</P>
<P>The TIMI score was extracted from the unfractionated heparin arm of the TIMI 11B trial (<LINK REF="REF-TIMI-11B-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">TIMI 11B 1999</LINK>). It was validated in the enoxaparin arm of TIMI 11B and in both arms of the <LINK REF="REF-ESSENCE-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESSENCE 1997</LINK> trial. The risk score was shown to be a valid predictor of the composite endpoint encompassing all-cause mortality, MI and urgent revascularisation within 14 days of randomisation. Importantly, the TIMI score also predicted each of the components of this composite endpoint (<LINK REF="REF-Antman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Antman 2000</LINK>). The TIMI risk score was subsequently validated in the <LINK REF="REF-TIMI-III-Registry" TYPE="REFERENCE">TIMI III Registry</LINK>of unselected UA/NSTEMI patients and was shown to predict the endpoint of death, MI or recurrent ischaemia and the components of the composite outcome at both six weeks and one year (<LINK REF="REF-Scirica-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scirica 2002</LINK>). Further, the TIMI risk score was validated for the death, MI or recurrent ischaemia composite endpoint for up to six months in the <LINK REF="REF-PRISM_x002d_PLUS-Trial" TYPE="REFERENCE">PRISM-PLUS Trial</LINK>; and it was shown to predict benefit from tirofiban, even in participants with a negative CK-MB (<LINK REF="REF-Morrow-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrow 2002</LINK>). Hence, this versatile risk score is able to identify patients with high event rates who may also benefit from an invasive strategy. Intuitively, one would expect that patients with higher TIMI scores, and therefore a higher risk for mortality and recurrent events, have more extensive CAD on angiography. This has been confirmed in a retrospective analysis of patients with UA/NSTEMI (<LINK REF="REF-Garcia-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia 2004</LINK>). The <LINK REF="REF-PRISM_x002d_PLUS-Trial" TYPE="REFERENCE">PRISM-PLUS Trial</LINK> authors also confirmed these findings by a retrospective analysis, and found the TIMI score to correlate with impaired epicardial artery blood flow and the presence of visible thrombus on angiography (<LINK REF="REF-Mega-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mega 2005</LINK>). Although there are other published risk scores for UA/NSTEMI (<LINK REF="REF-de-Ara_x00fa_jo-Gon_x00e7_alves-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Araújo Gonçalves 2005</LINK>), the TIMI risk score is perhaps the most widely used. In addition, the low event rates in <LINK REF="STD-ICTUS" TYPE="STUDY">ICTUS</LINK>, which exclusively enrolled troponin-positive participants, highlight the importance of considering multiple variables in risk stratification. Indeed, on five-year follow-up by the <LINK REF="STD-RITA_x002d_3" TYPE="STUDY">RITA-3</LINK> trial authors, nine factors other than treatment group emerged as multi-variate predictors of death or non-fatal MI (<LINK REF="REF-Fox-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fox 2005</LINK>). When the logistic coefficients for the risk factors were added and the study population divided into quartiles based upon risk score, participants in the highest quartile of risk score experienced substantially greater benefit from an invasive strategy. Similarly, the <LINK REF="STD-FRISC_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">FRISC-II</LINK> trial authors developed a FRISC score, ranging from zero to seven, with one point alloted for each of seven factors: age of over 70 years, male sex, diabetes, previous MI, ST depression, increased troponin, and increased interleukin-6 or C-reactive protein (<LINK REF="REF-Lagerqvist-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lagerqvist 2005</LINK>). Having a medium to high-risk (score of three to seven) predicted benefit from an early invasive strategy, with risk ratios of 0.64 (95% CI 0.51 to 0.80) at two years and 0.75 (95% CI 0.64 to 0.89) at five years for the composite endpoint of death or non-fatal MI (<LINK REF="STD-FRISC_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">FRISC-II</LINK>). Low-risk patients (score zero to two) did not benefit and had a trend towards harm for the composite endpoint of death or non-fatal MI, with a RR of 1.62 (95% CI 0.71 to 3.69) at two years and 1.26 (95% CI 0.66 to 2.40) at five years (<LINK REF="STD-FRISC_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">FRISC-II</LINK>). In contrast, the <LINK REF="STD-ICTUS" TYPE="STUDY">ICTUS</LINK> trial authors confirmed the prognostic utility of the FRISC score, but were unable to predict benefit from an early invasive strategy in this trial; even participants with the highest FRISC scores (five to seven) derived no benefit from an early invasive approach (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.69 to 2.47), in terms of the late death or MI endpoint.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Current 'real world' event rates in patients with UA/NSTEMI compared to rates observed in the included trials</HEADING>
<P>The largest multinational registry, the GRACE registry, which collects data from 30 countries, has reported mortality rates in patients hospitalised with various forms of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Entry criteria for this registry include a history of chest pain and one of the following: ischaemic ECG changes, increased cardiac biomarkers or a documented history of CAD. The in-hospital mortality rates for patients recruited between 1999 and 2002 were 5.9% for patients with NSTEMI and 2.7% for patients with unstable angina. Also, the six-month post-discharge mortality rates were 6.2% and 3.6% for NSTEMI and unstable angina, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Goldberg-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldberg 2004</LINK>). Furthermore, rehospitalisation rates six months post-discharge were roughly 20%. Another report from the GRACE registry, which included patients recruited between 1999 and 2003, reported the six-month post-discharge mortality rates as 11.6% for NSTEMI and 6.8% for unstable angina (<LINK REF="REF-Van-de-Werf-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van de Werf 2005</LINK>). Clearly, the mortality rates from this real-world registry are higher than those observed in the studies included in our meta-analysis, as shown in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. However, these patients did not receive optimal medical management in that only approximately 50% of NSTEMI patients received ACE inhibitors, heparin or statins (<LINK REF="REF-Goldberg-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldberg 2004</LINK>). While over 90% of patients received aspirin and over 80% received beta blockers, it is unlikely that many would have received clopidogrel as the patients studied were entered into the registry prior to publication of the CURE trial (<LINK REF="REF-CURE-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">CURE 2001</LINK>); that is, before use of clopidogrel for UA/NSTEMI became accepted as standard therapy. Similarly, participants enrolled in the UA/NSTEMI trials received higher rates of medical therapy than participants enrolled in the CRUSADE registry (<LINK REF="REF-Kandzari-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kandzari 2005</LINK>). However, the discrepancy in mortality rates between the participants in the included studies of this Cochrane review and registry-reported mortality rates is arguably too high to be explained by advances in the medical management of UA/NSTEMI alone. Another explanation may be that selection and recruitment protocols may bias trials towards enrolling participants with a risk lower than that seen in unselected participants entered into registries. While analysis of available data suggests that high-risk patients may benefit from an invasive strategy, this absolute benefit is likely to narrow as early medical therapies and risk stratification procedures for UA/NSTEMI improve, combined with the appropriate use of deferred coronary angiography and revascularisation. Novel medical therapies, such as prasugrel (<LINK REF="REF-TRITON_x002d_TIMI-38" TYPE="REFERENCE">TRITON-TIMI 38</LINK>) and ticagrelor (<LINK REF="REF-PLATO" TYPE="REFERENCE">PLATO</LINK>) instead of clopidogrel, continue to decrease absolute event rates in patients with UA/NSTEMI. Consequently, future trials of invasive versus conservative management for UA/NSETMI will be required as novel medical therapies are adopted. It is likely that only progressively higher-risk patients will continue to benefit from routine invasive intervention in the future. A report from the GRACE registry has shown that increasing use of evidence-based therapies has translated into reduced event rates over time (<LINK REF="REF-Fox-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fox 2007b</LINK>). However, the lack of benefit observed for several endpoints in this review may be due to lower-risk patients having been selected for trial enrolment.</P>
<P>The general paucity of enrolment of participants with cardiogenic shock or an advanced Killip class in the included studies may mean that the results of this systematic review are not applicable to this high-risk subset. Advanced Killip class has been identified as an independent predictor of mortality in patients with NSTEMI (<LINK REF="REF-Khot-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khot 2003</LINK>), while Killip class and congestive heart failure (development of or history of) were shown to predict death and the composite of death or MI in the GRACE registry (<LINK REF="REF-Fox-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fox 2006</LINK>). Indeed, the current ACCF/AHA guidelines for UA/NSTEMI recommend using signs of heart failure as markers of increased risk (<LINK REF="REF-Jneid-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jneid 2012</LINK>). However, most of the included studies did not report Killip class, EF or brain natriuretic peptides among their baseline characteristics; and the event rates in the included studies indicate that participants with cardiogenic shock were excluded. Two exceptions to this are the <LINK REF="STD-FRISC_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">FRISC-II</LINK> trial, in which 13% of participants were reported to have an EF of less than 45% at baseline, and the <LINK REF="STD-VINO" TYPE="STUDY">VINO</LINK> trial, in which 53% of the sample were reported to be Killip class of II or III at baseline. This high percentage of participants with pulmonary oedema in <LINK REF="STD-VINO" TYPE="STUDY">VINO</LINK> may explain why this trial had the highest standardised mortality rates of the included studies (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>); and, while being a small trial, identified a robust benefit for routine invasive strategy. Observational data have revealed that Killip class II and III patients enjoyed a significant mortality benefit (at 30 days and six months) from an invasive strategy, while Killip class I patients did not benefit (<LINK REF="REF-Rott-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rott 2001</LINK>). The <LINK REF="REF-SHOCK-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">SHOCK 1999</LINK> trial (302 participants), which recruited STEMI patients with cardiogenic shock, uncovered a significant mortality benefit for a routine invasive versus conservative strategy at six months, with mortality rates of 50.3% and 63.1% (P = 0.027), respectively (<LINK REF="REF-SHOCK-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">SHOCK 1999</LINK>). These are consistent with observations from the GRACE registry (<LINK REF="REF-Dauerman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dauerman 2002</LINK>). Similarly, elevated N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) has been shown to predict a poor prognosis in patients with UA/NSTEMI, independently of age, Killip class or left ventricular EF (<LINK REF="REF-Jernberg-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jernberg 2004</LINK>). In a retrospective subgroup analyses from <LINK REF="STD-FRISC_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">FRISC-II</LINK> (2017 participants), NT-proBNP measured at median of 39 hours after symptom presentation correlated (correlation coefficient, r) with TnT (r = 0.53, P &lt; 0.001), interleukin-6 (r = 0.29, P &lt; 0.001) and the severity of coronary disease on angiography (<LINK REF="REF-Jernberg-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jernberg 2003</LINK>). A relationship between higher brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and more severe angiographic coronary disease was also evident in a small retrospective analysis from the <LINK REF="STD-TACTICS_x002d_TIMI-18" TYPE="STUDY">TACTICS-TIMI 18</LINK> trial, which also demonstrated higher BNP to be associated with higher TIMI frame counts, consistent with reduced myocardial perfusion (<LINK REF="REF-Sadanandan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sadanandan 2004</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-FRISC_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">FRISC-II</LINK>, NT-proBNP predicted two-year mortality independently of TnT, interleukin-6 and left ventricular EF, but failed to predict the incidence of MI. Importantly, this retrospective subgroup analysis from the <LINK REF="STD-FRISC_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">FRISC-II</LINK> trial authors suggested that the early invasive strategy only improved two-year mortality in participants within the highest tertile for NT-proBNP (greater than 906 ng/L for men, greater than 1345 ng/L for women) and with an interleukin-6 concentration greater than 5 ng/mL (absolute risk reduction of 7.3%; RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.00). Such retrospective analyses are hypothesis-generating and by no means definitive. A similar analysis from <LINK REF="STD-TACTICS_x002d_TIMI-18" TYPE="STUDY">TACTICS-TIMI 18</LINK> (1676 participants) measured BNP instead of NT-proBNP, and dichotomised participants at a BNP of greater than 80 ng/L. The analysis found that participants with an elevated BNP exhibited greater seven-day and six-month mortality (2.5% versus 0.7%, P &lt; 0.01; and 8.4% versus 1.8%, P &lt; 0.01 respectively). However, BNP was not shown to predict any benefit from invasive management (<LINK REF="REF-Morrow-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrow 2003</LINK>). This may be due to the relatively short follow-up performed in the <LINK REF="STD-TACTICS_x002d_TIMI-18" TYPE="STUDY">TACTICS-TIMI 18</LINK> study, which was only six months (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). The <LINK REF="STD-ICTUS" TYPE="STUDY">ICTUS</LINK> trial authors also examined the prognostic influence of NT-proBNP measured a median of 13 hours after presentation in a 1141-participant subgroup extracted from the main trial (<LINK REF="REF-Windhausen-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Windhausen 2007a</LINK>). In the highest quartile (greater than 1170 ng/L for men, greater than 2150 ng/L for women), one-year mortality was 7.3%, compared to just 1.1% among participants in the lower three quartiles. However, as with the retrospective analyses from the <LINK REF="STD-FRISC_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">FRISC-II</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-TACTICS_x002d_TIMI-18" TYPE="STUDY">TACTICS-TIMI 18</LINK> trials, NT-proBNP failed to predict MI and, in contrast to <LINK REF="STD-FRISC_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">FRISC-II</LINK>, elevated NT-proBNP did not predict any benefit from an early invasive strategy in the <LINK REF="STD-ICTUS" TYPE="STUDY">ICTUS</LINK> cohort (<LINK REF="REF-Windhausen-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Windhausen 2007a</LINK>). Hence, the role of natriuretic peptides and the assessment of patients for clinical features of congestive heart failure in UA/NSTEMI need to be further elucidated. In the interim, patients with features of congestive heart failure need to be considered at high-risk for death and managed aggressively.<BR/>
<BR/>The GRACE investigators identified predictors of a poor prognosis that were derived from and validated in cohorts enrolled in GRACE from 1999 to 2002 and 2002 to 2003, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Eagle-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eagle 2004</LINK>). The investigators identified nine variables &#8212; older age, history of MI, history of heart failure, increased heart rate, lower systolic blood pressure, elevated serum creatinine, elevated cardiac biomarkers, ST depression and not undergoing PCI &#8212; as independent predictors of increased six-month mortality across the ACS spectrum. Of particular note is that the GRACE risk score incorporates renal function, which is an important, practical risk prognosticator in UA/NSTEMI that was not considered when the TIMI risk score was derived (<LINK REF="REF-Antman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Antman 2000</LINK>). In a retrospective subgroup analysis of the <LINK REF="STD-FRISC_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">FRISC-II</LINK> trial, creatinine clearance was estimated from serum creatinine using the Cockcroft-Gault formula (<LINK REF="REF-Johnston-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnston 2006</LINK>). In conservatively-managed patients, the rates of death or MI for creatinine clearances of less than 69 mL/min, 69 to 90 mL/min and greater than 90 mL/min were 22.4%, 14.6% and 11.6%, respectively. The corresponding event rates in the invasive group were 14.6% (P &lt; 0.01 versus conservative treatment), 9.9% (P = 0.048) and 11.2% (P = not significant), respectively. Indeed, there was a significant interaction between treatment strategy and outcomes in patients with a creatinine clearance of less than 90 mL/min. These data are indeed sobering, since patients with renal dysfunction are often denied aggressive therapy in the real world, possibly because of clinician concerns about bleeding risk and a poor prognosis regardless of therapy. These data are particularly relevant to clinicians practicing in countries where an estimate of glomerular filtration rate is mandatory on adult electrolyte panels, as is standard in the USA and Australia. Hence, risk stratification is an integral part of the management of patients with UA/NSTEMI and needs to be considered carefully in future prospective RCTs on the topic. Moreover, the roles of estimated glomerular filtration rate and NT-proBNP as risk prognosticators over and above established markers such as the TIMI risk score need to be further evaluated.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Current 'real world' management of patients with UA/NSTEMI, emphasising the relationship between patient risk and subsequent management</HEADING>
<P>Despite the extensive literature that exists on risk stratification, real-world data from the GRACE registry has shown that high-risk patients are no more likely to receive enoxaparin or glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists or to undergo catheterisation and PCI than low-risk patients (<LINK REF="REF-Oliveira-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oliveira 2007</LINK>). In a different analysis from the GRACE registry that only included participants recruited with direct access to a catheterisation laboratory, there was an inverse relationship between the level of patient risk (measured as a GRACE risk score) and the frequency of angiography and PCI (<LINK REF="REF-Fox-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fox 2007a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ranasinghe-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ranasinghe 2011</LINK>). Indeed, the rates of cardiac catheterisation in low-, medium- and high-risk patients with UA/NSTEMI were 72%, 68% and 51%, respectively, while the rates of PCI were 40%, 35% and 25%, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Fox-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fox 2007a</LINK>). In addition, thienopyridines and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists were more commonly used in low-risk patients than medium- or high-risk patients with similar findings in a Canadian registry (<LINK REF="REF-Yan-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yan 2007</LINK>). Likewise, diabetics with UA/NSTEMI, despite their higher risk, are not treated more aggressively than non-diabetics (<LINK REF="REF-Franklin-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Franklin 2004</LINK>). The reasons for the discrepancy between patient risk and treatment have been unclear, but recent data from a Canadian registry suggest that the most common reason for under-utilization of an invasive strategy in high-risk patients is the treating physician's underestimation of patient risk (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2008</LINK>). In this regard, a focused initiative to educate physicians on risk stratification could enhance quality of care in patients with UA/NSTEMI. It is also important to recognise that access and distance to cardiac catheterisation services are established predictors of treatment strategy.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Quality of life endpoints</HEADING>
<P>Although not an initial outcome of this systematic review, this section provides a narrative discussion of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) outcomes. Four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Eisenberg-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Eisenberg 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-RITA_x002d_3" TYPE="STUDY">RITA-3</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-FRISC_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">FRISC-II</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TACTICS_x002d_TIMI-18" TYPE="STUDY">TACTICS-TIMI 18</LINK>) specifically compared HRQOL and functional status following invasive versus non-invasive management for NSTEMI. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Eisenberg-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Eisenberg 2005</LINK>) selected change in QOL as a primary endpoint, and the other three (<LINK REF="STD-RITA_x002d_3" TYPE="STUDY">RITA-3</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-FRISC_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">FRISC-II</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TACTICS_x002d_TIMI-18" TYPE="STUDY">TACTICS-TIMI 18</LINK>) had HRQOL measures as secondary endpoints. In the primary endpoint trial, which included only 88 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Eisenberg-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Eisenberg 2005</LINK>), there was no difference between the two groups at 12 months in terms of the level of peak exercise reached on an endurance exercise treadmill (7.8 versus 6.7 metabolic equivalents). Functional status was improved in the invasive group (Duke Activity Status Index scores 4.3 versus &#8722;3.5, P = 0.04), as was angina-specific quality of life, assessed using the Seattle Angina Questionnaire measure of anginal stability (21.6 versus &#8722;5.3, P = 0.020), anginal frequency (22.9 versus 2.3, P = 0.02) and treatment satisfaction (11.2 versus &#8722;10.3, P = 0.02).</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-RITA_x002d_3" TYPE="STUDY">RITA-3</LINK> trial, <LINK REF="REF-Kim-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 2005</LINK> assessed HRQOL was assessed with the Short Form-36 (SF-36), Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ), EuroQOL Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-VAS) and EuroQOL 5-Dimensional Classification (EQ-5D) scale at baseline, four months and one year follow-up. Mean changes from baseline EQ-VAS scores were better for the invasive versus non-invasive strategy at four months (treatment difference of 3.0, P &lt; 0.001) and one year (2.3, P &lt; 0.01). The EQ-5D utility scores were also higher in the invasive group at four months (treatment difference 0.036, P &lt; 0.01) but not at one year (0.016, P = 0.20). For the SF-36, the invasive strategy group scored significantly better at four months for physical function, physical role function, emotional role function, social function, vitality and general health. The SAQ scores for exertional capacity, anginal stability and frequency, treatment satisfaction and disease perception were significantly better for the invasive strategy group at both four months and one year, though attenuated at the last follow-up. The study authors concluded that improvements in HRQOL associated with the invasive strategy were most likely due to improved in anginal symptoms.</P>
<P>In the<LINK REF="STD-FRISC_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">FRISC-II</LINK> trial, <LINK REF="REF-Janzon-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Janzon 2004</LINK> measured HRQOL was measured using the generic Medical Outcomes Study SF-36 and the disease-specific Angina Pectoris Quality of Life Questionnaire (APQLQ) at baseline and three, six and 12 months follow-up. The invasively-treated group reported a significantly better quality of life in all eight scales and both component scores (physical and mental) of the SF-36 at three and six months of follow-up (P &lt; 0.01) relative to the non-invasively treated group. These differences remained at 12 months follow-up, with significance in seven of the scales and in the physical component score. The invasive group scored significantly higher on all five subscales of the APQLQ scores at three months (P &lt; 0.01), and on four subscales at six months (P &lt; 0.05), but only on one subscale at one year.</P>
<P>Regarding the <LINK REF="STD-TACTICS_x002d_TIMI-18" TYPE="STUDY">TACTICS-TIMI 18</LINK> trial, <LINK REF="REF-Weintraub-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weintraub 1999</LINK> planned to assess health status using some measure of utility in order to perform cost-effectiveness evaluations of invasive versus non-invasive strategy, but subsequent publications failed to disclose HRQOL data (<LINK REF="REF-Mahoney-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahoney 2002</LINK>). From the available evidence, it would appear that improvements in HRQOL as a result of an invasive strategy are modest and last on average no more than 12 months, with anginal relief likely the key determinant of improved HRQOL.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Findings from studies in the pre-stent era and other reviews on this topic</HEADING>
<P>We excluded two large trials that were undertaken during the pre-stent era (<LINK REF="STD-TIMI_x002d_3b" TYPE="STUDY">TIMI-3b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VANQWISH-1998" TYPE="STUDY">VANQWISH 1998</LINK>). The early invasive arm of <LINK REF="STD-TIMI_x002d_3b" TYPE="STUDY">TIMI-3b</LINK> involved cardiac catheterisation an average of 36 hours after randomisation and coronary revascularisation by coronary angioplasty or CABG. The early invasive strategy had no effect on the hard clinical endpoints of death, MI, stroke or the composite of death or MI. As is consistent with more recent clinical trials, the early invasive strategy reduced recurrent hospitalisation at both six weeks and one year, with RRs of 0.54 (95% CI 0.40 to 0.74) and 0.79 (95% CI 0.68 to 0.93), respectively (<LINK REF="STD-TIMI_x002d_3b" TYPE="STUDY">TIMI-3b</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-TIMI_x002d_3b" TYPE="STUDY">TIMI-3b</LINK>, a routine invasive strategy did not reduce the need for anti-angina medications at one year. In contrast, the <LINK REF="STD-VANQWISH-1998" TYPE="STUDY">VANQWISH 1998</LINK> study demonstrated increased risk associated with the early invasive strategy, which involved cardiac catheterisation an average of 48 hours after randomisation. In fact, the early invasive strategy was associated with an increased risk ratio of mortality prior to hospital discharge, and at one month and one year (RR 3.47 (95% CI 1.41 to 8.52); RR 2.53, 95% CI 1.19 to 5.42; and RR 1.60, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.37, respectively) (<LINK REF="STD-VANQWISH-1998" TYPE="STUDY">VANQWISH 1998</LINK>). Similarly, increased risk was associated with the early invasive strategy for the composite endpoint of death or non-fatal MI. The hazard of an early invasive strategy on these endpoints ceased to be significant by the end of the study (average 23 months). Forty-four percent of participants in the invasive arm of this trial underwent a revascularisation procedure, of which 47% involved CABG. The mortality associated with CABG in the invasive arm was 11.6%, compared to 3.4% in the conservative arm. <LINK REF="REF-Braunwald-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Braunwald 2003</LINK> has cited this discrepancy as an explanation for the increased mortality in the early invasive arm of the <LINK REF="STD-VANQWISH-1998" TYPE="STUDY">VANQWISH 1998</LINK> trial. Unsurprisingly, rates of background medical therapy were low by contemporary standards.</P>
<P>Two older meta-analyses on this topic that included the aforementioned pre-stent era trials, plus trials that we excluded for reasons other than low stent use, reached different conclusions than the ones presented here (<LINK REF="REF-Choudhry-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Choudhry 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mehta-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mehta 2005</LINK>). These reviews did not include the most recent trials, including the <LINK REF="STD-OASIS-5" TYPE="STUDY">OASIS 5</LINK> substudy, <LINK REF="STD-LIPSIA_x002d_NSTEMI" TYPE="STUDY">LIPSIA-NSTEMI</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Italian-Elderly-ACS" TYPE="STUDY">Italian Elderly ACS</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-ICTUS" TYPE="STUDY">ICTUS</LINK> studies. A subsequent meta-analysis included the early trials and the one-year results from <LINK REF="STD-ICTUS" TYPE="STUDY">ICTUS</LINK> (<LINK REF="REF-Bavry-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bavry 2006</LINK>). The review by <LINK REF="REF-Mehta-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mehta 2005</LINK> associated an invasive strategy with an increased risk of mortality during the period from randomisation to hospital discharge (RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.27). When <LINK REF="REF-Mehta-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mehta 2005</LINK> analysed the outcomes from hospital discharge to end of follow-up, the early invasive strategy was associated with reductions in death and non-fatal MI (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.94; and RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.68, respectively). When they analysed trial data from randomisation to the end of follow-up, the invasive strategy exhibited no effect on mortality, but induced a reduction in non-fatal MI (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.89). This Cochrane review analysed the endpoints at certain time points, since we felt that combining outcomes collected from studies of short duration (six months) with those of longer duration (five years) would not provide a meaningful point estimate (see the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' table). All reviews consistently found a significant reduction in recurrent angina and rehospitalisation with an invasive strategy (<LINK REF="REF-Bavry-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bavry 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Choudhry-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Choudhry 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mehta-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mehta 2005</LINK>). More recently, a meta-regression analysis that included the earlier studies but excluded <LINK REF="STD-VANQWISH-1998" TYPE="STUDY">VANQWISH 1998</LINK> revealed the benefit of an invasive strategy &#8212; with respect to the endpoint of death or the composite of death or MI &#8212; to be related to the comparator odds ratio for events in the conservative group (<LINK REF="REF-Tarantini-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tarantini 2007</LINK>). This implies that the benefit of an invasive strategy relates to the level of baseline risk in the comparator group. One meta-analysis has been published since the publication of late follow-up data from the <LINK REF="STD-ICTUS" TYPE="STUDY">ICTUS</LINK> trial. This report, which included the older studies, identified no benefit of an invasive strategy on the endpoints of death, MI, or the composite of death or MI (<LINK REF="REF-Qayyum-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Qayyum 2008</LINK>). The findings from our analysis differ, because we excluded older studies and utilised the reported 'spontaneous' MI endpoint for our analysis, in light of the controversy surrounding the routine peri-procedural biomarker assessment undertaken by the <LINK REF="STD-ICTUS" TYPE="STUDY">ICTUS</LINK> trial authors.</P>

The AHA guidelines also endorse the option of treating stabilised but high-risk (for example troponin-positive) patients conservatively, however with only Class IIb recommendation.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Limitations</HEADING>
<P>We have limited the included studies in this Cochrane review to those from the post-stent era. However, a number of changes in practice have occurred over this time which limit the applicability of findings from this meta-analysis to contemporary practice. Of greatest significance, during the post-stent era, is that the routine use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors gained acceptance (<LINK REF="REF-Boersma-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boersma 2002</LINK>). Subsequently, however this practice has been discredited due to the association with increased bleeding (<LINK REF="REF-EARLY-ACS-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">EARLY ACS 2009</LINK>). As such, we have presented analyses of studies in which glycoprotein IIb/IIIa use was routine (Analyses 1 and 2) as of historical interest, with Analysis 3 being the most relevant to contemporary practice. Additionally, across this time period there has been controversy regarding access site efficacy. In particular, the prospective randomised <LINK REF="REF-RIFLE_x002d_STEACS" TYPE="REFERENCE">RIFLE-STEACS</LINK> study reported significant benefit for a transradial verse transfemoral approach for major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE), non-CABG-related bleeding and overall net adverse clinical event (NACE) rate among STEMI patients. Subsequently, the transradial access approach has emerged as the preferred strategy for PCI and has been adopted as routine practice for invasive strategies in ACSs. Despite this, a transfemoral strategy was predominant amongst the included studies in this meta-analysis, which potentially resulted in increased adverse events in the routine invasive strategy compared with contemporary practice. Additionally, improved outcomes have also resulted from refinement in stent design with second-generation drug-eluting stents forming the cornerstone of modern PCI practice (<LINK REF="REF-Sarno-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sarno 2012</LINK>). Both the predominance of a transfemoral approach and use of earlier generation stents amongst the included studies in this meta-analysis potentially and differentially diminish outcomes in the routine invasive arm compared with contemporary practice, thus obscuring any comparison with selective invasive strategies.</P>
<P>These limitations of the current body of evidence form important considerations for future trials designed to compare a routine verse selective invasive strategy in UA/NSTEMI. We recommend that such studies employ a transradial access route, an antithrombotic regime consisting of aspirin and ticagrelor across all study participants and second generation drug-eluting stents to most accurately reflect current practice and difference between routine and selective invasive strategies. Finally, where possible, analyses should allow for the discrete assessment of outcome measures for NSTEMI and UA as the heterogeneity of combined UA/NSTEMI may mask important intervention risk-benefit differences between the two entities.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-05-24 09:34:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The most important new finding of this Cochrane review update is the identification of a significantly increased risk of index death with a routine invasive approach. Conversely, consistent with previous versions of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Hoenig-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoenig 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hoenig-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoenig 2010</LINK>), adopting a routine invasive strategy for the management of UA/NSTEMI patients results in a significant reduction in risk, from six to 12 months of follow-up, for the two endpoints of refractory angina and rehospitalisation. While the invasive strategy is associated with an almost two-fold increase in the risk of peri-procedural myocardial infarction (MI), the data also suggest a significant risk reduction in the rate of MI assessed at three to five years. The importance of peri-procedural infarction continues to be a subject of dispute, with recent suggestions that this endpoint lacks prognostic significance. Hence, the early risks associated with a routine invasive strategy must be weighed against potential long-term benefits in clinical endpoints. However, longer term follow-up of more contemporary trials may find this benefit to be attenuated with more optimal use of medical therapies, the deployment of more rigorous risk stratification protocols in the days immediately following onset of the acute event, and a more conservative/selective invasive approach with high invasive percentages. The benefits of a routine invasive strategy may be more meaningful in higher-risk patients, among whom the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) should be less.</P>
<P>The increased risk of index death noted with the inclusion of the <LINK REF="STD-Italian-Elderly-ACS" TYPE="STUDY">Italian Elderly ACS</LINK> and the <LINK REF="STD-LIPSIA_x002d_NSTEMI" TYPE="STUDY">LIPSIA-NSTEMI</LINK> trials in this review update must be interpreted in the context of the disproportionate representation of populations with known adverse predictors. Increased mortality risk has been associated with both elderly populations (<LINK REF="STD-Italian-Elderly-ACS" TYPE="STUDY">Italian Elderly ACS</LINK>) and routine glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor use (<LINK REF="STD-LIPSIA_x002d_NSTEMI" TYPE="STUDY">LIPSIA-NSTEMI</LINK>), both of which contribute to excess event rates among people treated using a routinely invasive strategy. A more considered approach in the elderly population and a selective use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors is now recommended in most international guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Hamm-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamm 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jneid-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jneid 2012</LINK>). The finding that inclusion of two such populations resulted in an overall increase in index mortality rate associated with an invasive strategy strengthens the current recommendations. Due to the attendant bleeding risk and subsequent increased morbidity/mortality, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors should only be used selectively in people undergoing invasive treatment. Similarly, in elderly populations, a selective invasive approach is appropriate, as invasive interventions carry increased risk, with decisions based upon markers of risk &#8212; in particular, troponin status.</P>
<P>In the all-study analysis, evidence incorporating intermediate endpoints with all included studies (or most of the studies) failed to show appreciable benefit with invasive strategies for unstable angina and non-ST elevation MI compared to conservative strategies in all-cause mortality and death or non-fatal MI at six to 12 months. Evidence showed risk reduction in MI, refractory angina and rehospitalisation with routine invasive strategies compared to conservative (selective invasive) strategies at six to 12 months follow-up. However, routine invasive strategies were seen to be associated with a relatively high risk (almost double the risk) of procedure-related MI, and increased risk of bleeding complications. This systematic analysis of published RCTs supports the conclusion that, in people with unstable angina and non-ST elevation MI (UA/NSTEMI), a selectively invasive (conservative) strategy based on clinical risk for recurrent events is the preferred management strategy.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-05-24 09:35:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This Cochrane review highlights the need for further research on treatment strategies for UA/NSTEMI. To date, published trials have enrolled heterogeneous populations of patients with variable levels of risk and event rates, subjected to a variety of co-interventions, and used outcome measures subject to variable definition and timing. Risk stratification of the participants in each trial based upon a validated risk system (e.g. the TIMI risk score) would allow for more meaningful meta-analyses of available data, and provide a risk score or an absolute event rate above which an invasive strategy is expected to significantly improve outcomes. Clearly as medical therapies for UA/NSTEMI improve, progressively less absolute benefit is likely to be gained via aggressive interventions. Hence, the level of baseline risk at which an invasive intervention becomes warranted is likely to be a moving target. Another major limitation to the analyses undertaken in this review is the under-powering of trials in terms of assessing the effects of an invasive strategy on all-cause mortality, due to the short length of follow-up. Inadequate numbers also hinder the interpretation of subgroup analyses. This could be addressed in future clinical trials by ensuring that sufficient events accrue by way of larger sample sizes, the enrolment of higher-risk participants, and longer durations of follow-up. Finally, further research is required to better define the benefits and hazards of an invasive strategy in females.</P>
<P>Given the support for a routine invasive strategy in the management of non-ST-elevation ACS, it has become difficult to justify the inclusion of a selectively invasive (conservative) arm when designing RCTs, and this is reflected in the paucity of recent research comparing a selective versus routine invasive approach. However, our findings suggest that including a selectively invasive arm is required. Using a routine invasive strategy amongst the elderly requires particular investigation. In light of the results of the <LINK REF="STD-ACUITY" TYPE="STUDY">ACUITY</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-EARLY-ACS-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">EARLY ACS 2009</LINK> studies, studies responsible for discrediting the routine use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors as part of an invasive strategy, it is also prudent to re-evaluate conservative and invasive management strategies in light of the significant potential confounding effect observed in a number of influential studies. Indeed, these studies warrant repeating, albeit employing a highly-selective glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor strategy.</P>

<P>This trial was deemed inappropriate to this review since the included participants were admitted with recurrent angina 48 hours after the index case of unstable angina. Hence, the participants in this trial had all been managed conservatively for at least 48 hours after their index chest pain, and had to suffer another bout of angina before randomisation was considered. The included studies in this review require that participants were randomised at index presentation. This study, by definition, only considered participants with Braunwald class IIIb or IIIc unstable angina, and is therefore dissimilar enough from the included studies to warrant exclusion.</P>
