<P>The searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE have been updated to May 2013, and the search of the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register to October 2013. No new studies have been added. Four studies included in the previous review have been excluded for this update because they assessed parenterally administrated antiplatelet agents, which are now the subject of a separate review. The title of this review was therefore changed to 'Oral antiplatelet agents for acute ischaemic stroke'. There are now eight included trials with 41,483 participants.</P>

<P>
<B>Question</B>
</P>
<P>We wanted to compare the safety and effectiveness of oral antiplatelet therapy versus placebo or no treatment in people with acute ischaemic stroke to see if oral antiplatelet drugs reduced the number of deaths and improved the long-term outcomes in survivors.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Most strokes are caused by a sudden blockage of an artery in the brain that is usually due to a blood clot (called an ischaemic stroke). Immediate treatment with antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin may prevent new clots from forming and hence improve recovery after stroke. However, antiplatelet drugs may also cause bleeding in the brain, which could offset any benefits.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We identified eight studies, up to October 2013, for inclusion in the review. These studies included a total of 41,483 participants. Two of the studies contributed 98% of the data. Four studies tested aspirin, three studies tested ticlopidine and one study tested aspirin plus dipyridamole. The majority of participants in the review were elderly, with a significant proportion over 70 years of age. Males and females were almost equally represented in the trials. There appeared to be some variation in stroke severity among the included trials. The scheduled duration of treatment varied from five days to three months and the scheduled follow-up period varied from 10 days to six months.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Aspirin, at a dose of 160 mg to 300 mg daily started within 48 hours of the onset of stroke symptoms, saved lives and reduced the risk of further stroke occurring in the first two weeks. If treatment was started more than 48 hours after onset but within 14 days, the limited evidence from this review and other external data suggests that aspirin is of benefit even starting at this late stage. Aspirin also increased the chances of being alive and independent and improved the chances of making a complete recovery from the stroke. The risk of serious bleeding was very low. Almost all the evidence in this review comes from trials of aspirin. There is no reliable evidence on the effects of the other oral antiplatelet drugs in acute stroke that were assessed in this review (clopidogrel, ticlopidine, cilostazol, satigrel, sarpolgrelate, KBT 3022, iisbogrel).</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence contributing to these results was generally good.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-03-14 09:42:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>In people with acute ischaemic stroke, platelets become activated and can cause blood clots to form and block an artery in the brain, resulting in damage to part of the brain. Such damage gives rise to the symptoms of stroke. Antiplatelet therapy might reduce the volume of brain damaged by ischaemia and also reduce the risk of early recurrent ischaemic stroke, thereby reducing the risk of early death and improving long-term outcomes in survivors. However, antiplatelet therapy might also increase the risk of fatal or disabling intracranial haemorrhage.</P>

The maximum follow-up was six months.

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-03-14 09:44:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-03-14 09:43:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Stroke is an enormous and serious public health problem. According to the World Health Organization, 15 million people suffer stroke worldwide each year. It is also a major cause of death and disability worldwide. Approximately 80% to 87% of all strokes are ischaemic (that is due to a blockage of an artery in the brain) in white populations (<LINK REF="REF-Jauch-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jauch 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Warlow-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warlow 2001</LINK>) and about 67% in Asian populations (<LINK REF="REF-Tsai-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tsai 2013</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-03-14 09:44:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Platelets become activated in people with acute ischaemic stroke. This review is focused on oral antiplatelet agents. Oral antiplatelet agents work via different mechanisms to inhibit platelet adhesion and aggregation. The types of drugs include cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors (for example acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)), thienopyridine derivatives (for example ticlopidine, clopidogrel), phosphodiesterase inhibitors (for example dipyridamole, cilostazol) and thromboxane A2 antagonists (for example ozagrel).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-03-14 09:44:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Antiplatelet therapy is effective for long-term secondary prevention of serious vascular events in people at high risk of vascular disease (<LINK REF="REF-ATC-1994a" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATC 1994a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ATC-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATC 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ATC-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATC 2009</LINK>). In people with acute myocardial infarction, starting antiplatelet therapy immediately after the event, and continuing it for a month, avoids about 38 vascular events for every 1000 people treated (<LINK REF="REF-ATC-1994a" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATC 1994a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ATC-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATC 2002</LINK>). In individuals with ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA), being on long-term antiplatelet therapy avoids about 36 serious vascular events for every 1000 people treated for three years (<LINK REF="REF-ATC-1994a" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATC 1994a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ATC-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATC 2002</LINK>). Platelets are activated in the acute phase of ischaemic stroke, releasing neurotoxic and thrombogenic eicosanoids including thromboxane B2 (<LINK REF="REF-van-Kooten-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Kooten 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Antiplatelet therapy is, therefore, a logical treatment to evaluate in acute ischaemic stroke. It might reduce early deaths and improve outcomes in survivors by reducing the volume of brain damaged by ischaemia and reducing the risk of early recurrent ischaemic stroke and pulmonary embolism (<LINK REF="REF-ATC-1994a" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATC 1994a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ATC-1994b" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATC 1994b</LINK>). However, antiplatelet therapy could also increase the risk of fatal or disabling intracranial haemorrhage, thus offsetting any benefits (<LINK REF="REF-ATC-1994a" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATC 1994a</LINK>). The initial data were sufficiently promising that two large-scale trials were undertaken, the International Stroke Trial (<LINK REF="STD-IST-1997" TYPE="STUDY">IST 1997</LINK>) and the Chinese Acute Stroke Trial (<LINK REF="STD-CAST-1997" TYPE="STUDY">CAST 1997</LINK>), which together included over 40,000 participants. These trials provided reliable evidence of the net benefit from aspirin in this setting. As a result, evidence-based guidelines in Europe, Canada and USA now recommend aspirin as the standard antithrombotic treatment for acute ischaemic stroke (<LINK REF="REF-CSS-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">CSS 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ESO-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESO 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jauch-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jauch 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-RCP-Guideline-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCP Guideline 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>The majority of the data relating to orally active antiplatelet agents is derived from trials of aspirin. Data regarding the utility of other single oral antiplatelet agents, including clopidogrel, dipyridamole or cilostazol, for the treatment of acute stroke are limited<I> </I>(<LINK REF="REF-CAIST-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">CAIST 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chairangsarit-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chairangsarit 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Suri-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suri 2008</LINK>)<I>. </I>Overall, the data do not provide solid evidence about the utility of these antiplatelet agents in the management of people with acute ischaemic stroke. There has been limited experience and no evidence to support the use of ozagrel in the setting of acute stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2012</LINK>)<I>. </I>Recent trials have investigated the early use of multiple antiplatelet agents in addition to aspirin in the acute phase of stroke. Early initiation of aspirin plus extended-release dipyridamole seem to be as safe and effective in preventing disability as later initiation after conventional aspirin monotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-EARLY-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">EARLY 2010</LINK>). Other trials have examined aspirin and clopidogrel combination therapy. The combination was found to be only significantly effective in the immediate high-risk interval after stroke or TIA<I> </I>(<LINK REF="REF-CHANCE-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">CHANCE 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-FASTER-2007" TYPE="STUDY">FASTER 2007</LINK>

<LINK REF="REF-Hankey-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hankey 2010</LINK>). Ongoing trials continue to seek alternative regimes in dual or triple antiplatelet therapy (<LINK REF="REF-POINT" TYPE="REFERENCE">POINT</LINK>;<I> </I>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-03-14 09:44:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>This review is an update of a previously published review in the <I>Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews </I>(2008, Issue 3) of 'Antiplatelet therapy for acute ischaemic stroke'. The previous version of this Cochrane review was published in 2008 and stated that antiplatelet therapy with aspirin is safe and effective when started within 48 hours after stroke. Since then more trials have been published. For this update we did not include parenterally administrated antiplatelet agents. Platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors are the subject of a separate review (<LINK REF="REF-Ciccone-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ciccone 2006</LINK>). Therefore, we conducted this updated review to assess the efficacy and safety of oral antiplatelet therapy when administered to people with acute ischaemic stroke to provide more up-to-date evidence for clinical practice and to identify trials of newer agents.</P>

We did not include trials that were not truly random (for example alternating or based on date of birth, day of the week, hospital number) or in which allocation to the treatment or control group was not adequately concealed (such as an open random number list) since foreknowledge of treatment allocation might lead to non-random treatment allocation and consequent bias in the estimation of treatment effects (<LINK REF="REF-Odgaard_x002d_Jensen-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Odgaard-Jensen 2011</LINK>).</P>

Screening of participants by clinical observation alone was not considered adequate);</LI>
<LI>had at least one confirmed symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE) diagnosed during life, or at autopsy (symptomatic or not) within the scheduled treatment period;</LI>
<LI>had a recurrent stroke during the treatment period that was either definitely ischaemic (haemorrhage excluded by CT or MR scan or autopsy) or of unknown type (no CT or MR scan or autopsy performed);</LI>
<LI>had a symptomatic intracranial (intracerebral and extracerebral) haemorrhage, including symptomatic haemorrhagic transformation of the cerebral infarct, during the scheduled treatment period (the haemorrhage must have been confirmed by CT (or MR) scanning after clinical deterioration, or by autopsy);</LI>
<LI>had any recurrent stroke (either of ischaemic or unknown type) or symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage during the treatment period;</LI>
<LI>had any major extracranial haemorrhage during the scheduled treatment period (the definition of major haemorrhage was usually taken from the original article but if none was given it was defined as any fatal bleed, or bleeding severe enough to require transfusion or operation);</LI>
<LI>made a complete recovery from their stroke.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Please note, the last outcome is a post hoc analysis for this outcome only, and we acknowledge that the addition of post hoc data is subject to selection bias. However, at the time we assessed the data for this review we realised that two trials (<LINK REF="STD-CAST-1997" TYPE="STUDY">CAST 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-IST-1997" TYPE="STUDY">IST 1997</LINK>) reported data on the number of participants who had made a complete recovery from their stroke, an important functional outcome that was not a widely reported outcome in stroke trials when the protocol for the earlier version of this review was written. With the recently reported effects of thrombolysis on increasing the proportion of people who recover completely from their stroke (for example, the NINDS trial of tissue plasminogen activator (<LINK REF="REF-NINDS-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">NINDS 1995</LINK>)), it seems reasonable to include this outcome here with due allowance for its post hoc nature.</P>

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2014-03-14 09:46:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>For each version of the review, two review authors independently extracted the data on methods, participants, interventions, outcomes and results, and recorded the information on a data extraction form. We sought data on the number of participants with each outcome event by allocated treatment group, irrespective of compliance and whether or not the participant was subsequently deemed ineligible or otherwise excluded from treatment or follow-up, to allow an intention-to-treat analysis. We also sought data on whether CT or MR scanning was performed prior to randomisation. The same two review authors cross-checked all extracted data and resolved any disagreements by discussion. If any of the above data were unavailable from the publications, we sought further information by contacting the study authors.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2014-03-14 09:46:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We calculated ORs with 95% CIs, which were calculated using the Peto fixed-effect method (<LINK REF="REF-ATC-1994a" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATC 1994a</LINK>) using RevMan 5.2 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2012</LINK>). We also calculated the number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) and the number of events avoided per 1000 people treated for each outcome if the result was statistically significant.

<SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2014-03-14 09:46:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We pre-specified the following subgroup analyses for the major outcomes of the review:</P>

<LI>trials in which all participants had intracerebral haemorrhage excluded by CT or MR scanning prior to trial randomisation;</LI>
<LI>trials in which participants were recruited within 48 hours of their stroke.</LI>

<P>We performed an additional post hoc subgroup analysis among participants with intracerebral haemorrhages inadvertently randomised in the trials. Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-CAST-1997" TYPE="STUDY">CAST 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-IST-1997" TYPE="STUDY">IST 1997</LINK>) included a number of participants who did not have a CT scan until after randomisation. Data on those participants in whom the diagnosis of the initial event leading to randomisation was haemorrhagic stroke and who were dead or dependent at follow-up were reported in the IST publication (<LINK REF="STD-IST-1997" TYPE="STUDY">IST 1997</LINK>) and were kindly supplied on request from the CAST trial (<LINK REF="STD-CAST-1997" TYPE="STUDY">CAST 1997</LINK>).</P>

<P>However, following an analysis of the available randomised evidence it became apparent that three of the pre-specified analyses (trials in which participants were randomised within 48 hours, trials with adequate concealment of randomisation and trials with CT scans prior to randomisation) were inappropriate; this is explained in the <LINK TAG="RESULTS" TYPE="SECTION">Results</LINK> section.</P>

<P>We identified a total of 6544 records from the electronic searches. After eliminating duplicates and non-relevant studies from the titles and abstracts, we selected 88 possibly relevant studies. After examining the abstracts, or in some cases the full papers, we excluded 78 records: 12 records relating to previously identified studies and 66 records because they were non-randomised, not of an oral antiplatelet therapy, not acute stroke therapy, had no control group or involved regimens with multiple antiplatelet agents (the latter are reviewed in a separate Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Kamal-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kamal 2012</LINK>)). This process left 10 potentially relevant studies. Of these, six<I> </I>did not fulfil all the inclusion criteria of this review and are listed in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> table, two are ongoing (<LINK REF="STD-CAIST_x002d_J-2006" TYPE="STUDY">CAIST-J 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CAPS-2009" TYPE="STUDY">CAPS 2009</LINK>) and two are awaiting assessment (<LINK REF="STD-Fujimoto-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Fujimoto 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2000</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Fujimoto-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Fujimoto 2010</LINK> has only been published in abstract form so far and further information is required, particularly regarding the method of randomisation; this study is therefore classified as awaiting classification.

<P>We included eight studies involving a total of 41,483 participants (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). Three of the included trials (162 participants) remain unpublished (<LINK REF="STD-Pince-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Pince 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Turpie-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Turpie 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Utsumi-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Utsumi 1988</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Antiplatelet regimens tested</HEADING>
<P>Two of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-CAST-1997" TYPE="STUDY">CAST 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-IST-1997" TYPE="STUDY">IST 1997</LINK>) contributed 98% of the data. <LINK REF="STD-IST-1997" TYPE="STUDY">IST 1997</LINK> was an open-treatment, blinded outcome study with a factorial design; participants were allocated to 14 days of treatment with 300 mg aspirin, heparin, both, or neither; that is the trial tested the effects of aspirin in the presence and absence of heparin (and vice versa). <LINK REF="STD-CAST-1997" TYPE="STUDY">CAST 1997</LINK> was a double-blind randomised trial of one month's treatment with either aspirin 160 mg or matching placebo. In <LINK REF="STD-MAST_x002d_I-1995" TYPE="STUDY">MAST-I 1995</LINK> (a factorial trial of streptokinase and aspirin involving 309 participants) only those participants randomised to aspirin alone and the no treatment group were included in this review as there was a significant interaction between aspirin and streptokinase which invalidated the aspirin plus streptokinase versus streptokinase alone comparison. Other antiplatelet regimens that were compared with control were: aspirin (<LINK REF="STD-R_x00f6_d_x00e9_n_x002d_J_x00fc_llig-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rödén-Jüllig 2003</LINK>), ticlopidine (<LINK REF="STD-Ciufetti-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ciufetti 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Turpie-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Turpie 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Utsumi-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Utsumi 1988</LINK>), and aspirin plus dipyridamole (<LINK REF="STD-Pince-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Pince 1981</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Time window for inclusion</HEADING>
<P>Trials included participants randomised within six hours (<LINK REF="STD-MAST_x002d_I-1995" TYPE="STUDY">MAST-I 1995</LINK>), 12 hours (<LINK REF="STD-Ciufetti-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ciufetti 1990</LINK>), 48 hours (<LINK REF="STD-CAST-1997" TYPE="STUDY">CAST 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-IST-1997" TYPE="STUDY">IST 1997</LINK>), 72 hours (<LINK REF="STD-R_x00f6_d_x00e9_n_x002d_J_x00fc_llig-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rödén-Jüllig 2003</LINK>) or six days (<LINK REF="STD-Pince-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Pince 1981</LINK>) of stroke onset. In two trials, the formal entry criterion was a stroke within the previous four weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Turpie-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Turpie 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Utsumi-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Utsumi 1988</LINK>) but as most participants were entered within two weeks they were included in this review. Data on only those participants entered within two weeks were not available from the authors or the pharmaceutical company.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Exclusion criteria</HEADING>
<P>The two main trials in the review (<LINK REF="STD-CAST-1997" TYPE="STUDY">CAST 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-IST-1997" TYPE="STUDY">IST 1997</LINK>) did not precisely specify exclusion criteria as they used the uncertainty principle, but suggested that these might include participants thought to be at high risk of adverse effects (for example clotting disorders, hepatic or renal failure) or those with a small likelihood of worthwhile benefit.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">CT scanning</HEADING>
<P>Three trials adequately excluded people with intracerebral haemorrhage by CT scanning all possible participants before entry into the trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ciufetti-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ciufetti 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MAST_x002d_I-1995" TYPE="STUDY">MAST-I 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-R_x00f6_d_x00e9_n_x002d_J_x00fc_llig-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rödén-Jüllig 2003</LINK>). Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-CAST-1997" TYPE="STUDY">CAST 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-IST-1997" TYPE="STUDY">IST 1997</LINK>) performed a CT scan in almost all participants; in these trials clinicians had to have a low suspicion of intracranial haemorrhage prior to randomisation. In <LINK REF="STD-CAST-1997" TYPE="STUDY">CAST 1997</LINK> 87% had a CT prior to randomisation; by discharge this number had risen to 94%. In <LINK REF="STD-IST-1997" TYPE="STUDY">IST 1997</LINK> 67% were scanned before randomisation and 29% after randomisation, so that overall 96% of participants were scanned. Two trials performed no CT scans (<LINK REF="STD-Pince-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Pince 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Turpie-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Turpie 1983</LINK>) and in <LINK REF="STD-Utsumi-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Utsumi 1988</LINK> the use of CT scanning was uncertain. As a result of the variable use of pre-randomisation CT scanning, some people with intracerebral haemorrhage were inadvertently entered in the trials and these were included in the main analyses of this review. This may have biased the results against antiplatelet agents although this is unlikely given the relatively small numbers of participants involved. Furthermore, the inclusion of these people may actually make the conclusions of the review more broadly applicable, since many hospitals admitting people with acute stroke do not have immediate access to CT scanning and so acute treatment may have to be started without definite knowledge of the pathological type of stroke.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Stroke severity at entry</HEADING>
<P>There appeared to be some variation in stroke severity among the included trials. For example, in the control group of <LINK REF="STD-IST-1997" TYPE="STUDY">IST 1997</LINK> early death was recorded as 9%, but was only 4% in <LINK REF="STD-CAST-1997" TYPE="STUDY">CAST 1997</LINK>, even though <LINK REF="STD-CAST-1997" TYPE="STUDY">CAST 1997</LINK> assessed participants at four weeks versus two weeks for <LINK REF="STD-IST-1997" TYPE="STUDY">IST 1997</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-R_x00f6_d_x00e9_n_x002d_J_x00fc_llig-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rödén-Jüllig 2003</LINK> used a Scandinavian Stroke Supervision Scale score of one point or more as the inclusion criterion.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Scheduled duration of trial treatment</HEADING>
<P>The scheduled duration of treatment varied from five days (<LINK REF="STD-R_x00f6_d_x00e9_n_x002d_J_x00fc_llig-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rödén-Jüllig 2003</LINK>) to three months (<LINK REF="STD-Utsumi-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Utsumi 1988</LINK>). The scheduled follow-up period varied from 10 days (<LINK REF="STD-Pince-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Pince 1981</LINK>)<B> </B>to six months ( <LINK REF="STD-IST-1997" TYPE="STUDY">IST 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MAST_x002d_I-1995" TYPE="STUDY">MAST-I 1995</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Measures of outcome</HEADING>
<P>Clinically important outcomes were poorly reported in the smaller trials. All trials evaluated death during the treatment period. Comparable definitions of dependence were used in most of the trials. They included: the modified Rankin disability scale (greater than or equal to three) (<LINK REF="STD-CAST-1997" TYPE="STUDY">CAST 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MAST_x002d_I-1995" TYPE="STUDY">MAST-I 1995</LINK>); and needing help from another person with daily activities (<LINK REF="STD-IST-1997" TYPE="STUDY">IST 1997</LINK>). For <LINK REF="STD-R_x00f6_d_x00e9_n_x002d_J_x00fc_llig-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rödén-Jüllig 2003</LINK> we used 'living in an institution' as equivalent to being dependent. Three trials (<LINK REF="STD-CAST-1997" TYPE="STUDY">CAST 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-IST-1997" TYPE="STUDY">IST 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MAST_x002d_I-1995" TYPE="STUDY">MAST-I 1995</LINK>) used validated scales (<LINK REF="REF-Bamford-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bamford 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dennis-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dennis 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Candelise-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Candelise 1994</LINK>, respectively). In two trials the primary outcome was DVT (<LINK REF="STD-Pince-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Pince 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Turpie-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Turpie 1983</LINK>); these trials did not formally evaluate survival free of dependency for activities of daily living. Progression of stroke symptoms measured by the Scandinavian Stroke Supervision Scale was the primary outcome event of <LINK REF="STD-R_x00f6_d_x00e9_n_x002d_J_x00fc_llig-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rödén-Jüllig 2003</LINK>. Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-CAST-1997" TYPE="STUDY">CAST 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-IST-1997" TYPE="STUDY">IST 1997</LINK>) recorded information on participants making a complete recovery from their stroke, and this information has been included in a post hoc analysis as discussed in the <LINK TAG="CRIT_OUTCOMES" TYPE="SECTION">Types of outcome measures</LINK> section of this review.

<P>Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Pince-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Pince 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Turpie-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Turpie 1983</LINK>) that included randomised data from 133 participants (less than 0.3% of participants included in the overall review) sought to systematically determine the effect of antiplatelet agents on the occurrence of 'symptomatic or asymptomatic DVT' at the end of the treatment period, as detected by I-125 fibrinogen scanning. DVT was observed in 16/67 (23.9%) of those allocated to antiplatelet treatment and 19/66 (28.8%) of those allocated to control, a non-significant result (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.67; P = 0.52) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). There was substantial heterogeneity between these two trials (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 82.9%), one of which involved ticlopidine and one a combination of aspirin and dipyridamole. This heterogeneity may have been due to chance or to the fact that the time between stroke onset and starting treatment varied in the two trials: less than six days in one (<LINK REF="STD-Pince-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Pince 1981</LINK>) and less than four weeks in the other (<LINK REF="STD-Turpie-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Turpie 1983</LINK>).

<P>Data were available from seven trials, including data from 41,042 participants.

For aspirin, for every 1000 people treated one person would avoid PE (NNTB 693) (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). This may be an underestimate if antiplatelet treatment prevented both major and minor PE since minor PE was not sought systematically in any trial. Sensitivity analysis showed no statistically significant difference in this outcome between trials of a double-blind design (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.16) or not (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.04).</P>

A total of 495 of the 551 reported recurrent ischaemic strokes took place in <LINK REF="STD-CAST-1997" TYPE="STUDY">CAST 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-IST-1997" TYPE="STUDY">IST 1997</LINK>.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 1.7: symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage during treatment period</HEADING>
<P>Data were available for seven trials including 41,042 participants. It remained unclear (even after correspondence) how haemorrhages were detected in three small trials (<LINK REF="STD-Pince-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Pince 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Turpie-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Turpie 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Utsumi-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Utsumi 1988</LINK>). However, it was likely that participants who deteriorated neurologically were scanned using CT, or that haemorrhages were found at autopsy. In one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Pince-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Pince 1981</LINK>) four participants, two in each group, were excluded after randomisation because they were found to have intracerebral haemorrhage. These participants were included as having symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage in this analysis. In the trials where participants did not have a CT scan before randomisation, it was difficult to determine whether any intracranial haemorrhage first identified after treatment had been started was new or had been present before randomisation. For the purposes of this analysis, we assumed that all such haemorrhages were new. Antiplatelet therapy significantly increased the odds of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.50; P = 0.04) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>). For every 1000 people treated with aspirin, two people would have a symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage; the number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) was 574 (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). There was the possibility of some bias within these data as there may have been a lower threshold for re-scanning participants who had deteriorated clinically if they were known to be receiving antithrombotic treatment (for example in <LINK REF="STD-IST-1997" TYPE="STUDY">IST 1997</LINK>, which was not blinded). However, this was not demonstrated in the sensitivity analysis (data not shown in forest plots), which found no statistically significant difference in the effect of treatment on symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage during the treatment period between trials which were of a double-blind design (OR 1.24, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.63) or not (OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.64).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 1.8: any recurrent stroke or intracranial haemorrhage during treatment period</HEADING>
<P>Immediate use of antiplatelet agents reduced the odds of ischaemic stroke but also appeared to increase the odds of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage. An outcome which combines these two (without double counting, that is participant allowed only one of ischaemic stroke or intracranial haemorrhage with the first event being the one which was included) was useful for assessing the net short-term effects of antiplatelet agents. However, symptomatic intracranial haemorrhages are more likely to cause death or disability than ischaemic recurrences, and so the severity of the recurrence also needed to be considered. No trial reported the severity of recurrences. Data were available from seven trials that included 41,042 participants. Antiplatelet therapy was associated with a net reduction in the odds of this outcome (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.97; P = 0.01) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>). For every 1000 people treated with aspirin, five people would avoid recurrent ischaemic stroke or symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (NNTB 200) (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Sensitivity analysis showed that although the effect was somewhat smaller in trials of double-blind design (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.11) compared with non-double blind trials (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.93) the difference (test for interaction) was not significant.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Re-evaluation of the planned sensitivity and subgroup analyses in light of the available data</HEADING>
<P>After an evaluation of the available evidence from the randomised trials, it became apparent that three of the planned sensitivity analyses were inappropriate. These were the analyses restricted to trials: (1) in which participants were randomised within 48 hours of the stroke; (2) with adequate concealment of randomisation; and (3) with 100% CT scans prior to randomisation. As the overwhelming majority of the data came from trials that randomised participants within 48 hours of stroke onset, the planned sensitivity analysis evaluating the effects of treatment beyond 48 hours was largely uninformative. Similarly, the analyses based on the concealment of treatment allocation were uninformative about trials with inadequate concealment as these trials contributed so few data. An analysis based on whether or not all participants had brain imaging prior to randomisation to rule out haemorrhage would exclude <LINK REF="STD-CAST-1997" TYPE="STUDY">CAST 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-IST-1997" TYPE="STUDY">IST 1997</LINK>, and would therefore disregard 98% of the data.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Strength of evidence of benefit on major outcomes</HEADING>
<P>This systematic review has reliably established that antiplatelet therapy is safe and effective in the acute phase of ischaemic stroke. The conclusion is based on data from over 40,000 participants. Ninety-eight per cent of the data came from two trials of medium dose aspirin, that is 160 mg to 300 mg daily (<LINK REF="STD-CAST-1997" TYPE="STUDY">CAST 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-IST-1997" TYPE="STUDY">IST 1997</LINK>). Overall, antiplatelet therapy with aspirin started within 48 hours of onset of presumed ischaemic stroke was beneficial. Although associated with a small but definite risk of bleeding, this hazard was more than offset by the reduction in recurrent ischaemic stroke. The analysis of the effects of aspirin among participants who were first scanned after randomisation and who turned out to have had a haemorrhagic stroke was reassuring.</P>
<P>The benefits of a short course of antiplatelet therapy in acute ischaemic stroke compare very favourably with longer-term antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention in vascular disease. Two to four weeks of treatment in <LINK REF="STD-IST-1997" TYPE="STUDY">IST 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-CAST-1997" TYPE="STUDY">CAST 1997</LINK> resulted in about eight fewer deaths per 1000 participants treated, whereas in long-term secondary prevention a month of antiplatelet therapy typically avoids less than one death per 1000 (<LINK REF="REF-ATC-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATC 2002</LINK>). Similarly, long-term antiplatelet use prevents about one recurrent stroke per 1000 people per month (<LINK REF="REF-ATC-1994a" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATC 1994a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ATC-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATC 2002</LINK>), whereas in the acute phase of ischaemic stroke one month of antiplatelet therapy prevents about four recurrent strokes per 1000 people (seven fewer ischaemic strokes and three extra haemorrhagic strokes).</P>
<P>The main conclusions of this review have not changed from the last update, despite the exclusion of the trials of intravenous antiplatelet agents.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Effects on venous thromboembolism</HEADING>
<P>Aspirin reduced the odds of PE by 29%, but since the reported rate of pulmonary emboli was low the absolute benefit, one event prevented per 1000 participants treated, is very small. However, if there was a substantial under-ascertainment of pulmonary emboli in the trials included in this systematic review, then the absolute benefits of aspirin may have been underestimated. Clinical series report a range of 0% to 3% for symptomatic PE (<LINK REF="REF-Davenport-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davenport 1996</LINK>). If the observed 29% reduction in the odds of PE was applied to a population with a 3% risk of pulmonary embolism the absolute reduction would increase to eight for every 1000 people treated. It seems reasonable to conclude that routine use of aspirin alone in people with acute ischaemic stroke will reduce the risk of DVT and PE somewhat yet not be associated with any substantial excess of intracerebral haemorrhages. It remains unclear whether aspirin alone is as good as heparin alone at preventing venous thromboembolism in acute ischaemic stroke, but data from <LINK REF="STD-IST-1997" TYPE="STUDY">IST 1997</LINK> suggest no statistically or clinically significant difference between aspirin and heparin in the prevention of PE.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Robustness of the findings</HEADING>
<P>The sensitivity analyses have shown that the conclusions about the benefits of antiplatelet therapy are robust. A meta-analysis based on individual patient data from <LINK REF="STD-CAST-1997" TYPE="STUDY">CAST 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-IST-1997" TYPE="STUDY">IST 1997</LINK> confirmed this (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2000</LINK>). It showed no clear heterogeneity of treatment effect with delay in starting aspirin, age, gender, stroke type, infarct subtype, the presence of impaired consciousness or the presence or absence of atrial fibrillation. These results suggest that a wide variety of people with ischaemic stroke are likely to benefit from antiplatelet therapy with aspirin (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2000</LINK>). As a result of the strength of evidence, aspirin is now recommended as a standard therapy. Four major recent evidence-based guidelines make strong recommendations for the routine use of aspirin for all people with acute ischaemic stroke (<LINK REF="REF-CSS-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">CSS 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ESO-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESO 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jauch-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jauch 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-RCP-Guideline-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCP Guideline 2012</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Public health impact</HEADING>
<P>It can be argued that, although effective, the net benefits of aspirin are rather small when compared with the effects of stroke unit care (the OR of death or dependency was 0.79, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.90) (<LINK REF="REF-SUTC-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">SUTC 2013</LINK>), and thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator within three hours of stroke (the OR of death or dependency was 0.71, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.96) (<LINK REF="REF-Wardlaw-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wardlaw 2009</LINK>). However, aspirin is inexpensive, easy to administer and safe, which increases its potential public health impact worldwide and especially in developing countries. In a study published in 1997, the World Health Organization estimated that there were 4.6 million cerebrovascular deaths in the world in 1990 (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1997</LINK>). The global disease burden of stroke increased by 19% between 1990 and 2010 (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 2012</LINK>) and current projections estimate the number of deaths worldwide will rise to 6.5 million in 2015<I> </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Strong-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strong 2007</LINK>).<I> </I>It is reasonable to estimate that about 80% of the deaths (5.2 million) are due to ischaemic stroke. If treatment with aspirin prevents seven deaths per 1000, then an additional 36,400 lives could be saved worldwide per year with substantial numbers of survivors avoiding long-term disability.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Aspirin dose and route of administration</HEADING>
<P>The benefits of aspirin in acute stroke are drawn from trials that tested a dose of aspirin between 160 mg and 330 mg daily. In acute myocardial infarction, 160 mg is the lowest dose that has been shown to be effective (<LINK REF="REF-ATC-1994a" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATC 1994a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ATC-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATC 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dalen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dalen 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Patrono-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patrono 1998</LINK>). Lower doses of aspirin are effective for long-term secondary stroke prevention but have not been evaluated in acute stroke. There is some (but not abundant) evidence that at least 120 mg of aspirin is needed to acetylate all circulating platelets within a short period of time (<LINK REF="REF-Patrono-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patrono 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Gijn-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Gijn 1992</LINK>). There is also some experimental evidence that a dose of 160 mg to 300 mg of aspirin daily is required in the acute phase of an ischaemic cerebral or cardiac event in order to achieve rapid inhibition of thromboxane biosynthesis (<LINK REF="REF-Patrono-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patrono 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Kooten-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Kooten 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Kooten-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Kooten 1997</LINK>). For people who can swallow, aspirin can be given by mouth. However, as many people with stroke are unable to swallow another route may need to be used on occasions. In <LINK REF="STD-CAST-1997" TYPE="STUDY">CAST 1997</LINK> aspirin was given via a nasogastric tube, and in <LINK REF="STD-IST-1997" TYPE="STUDY">IST 1997</LINK> as a rectal suppository or intravenously as 100 mg of the lysine salt of acetylsalicylic acid.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Other antiplatelet agents</HEADING>
<P>The indirect comparisons of different agents in this review showed no evidence of significant heterogeneity of effect between the different agents tested, aspirin alone, ticlopidine alone, the combination of aspirin and dipyridamole. However, the data from the non-aspirin regimens were extremely limited and such indirect comparisons are unreliable (<LINK REF="REF-ATC-1994a" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATC 1994a</LINK>). The focus of current research is on comparing the effects of short-term (30 days to three months) combination therapy with single agents, chiefly in people with TIA and minor stroke (<LINK REF="REF-CHANCE-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">CHANCE 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-POINT" TYPE="REFERENCE">POINT</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TARDIS" TYPE="STUDY">TARDIS</LINK>); these regimes are the subject of a separate review (<LINK REF="REF-Kamal-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kamal 2012</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Combination of aspirin with anticoagulants</HEADING>
<P>Another question that remains unanswered is whether the addition of low-dose subcutaneous heparin to aspirin could further reduce the risk of DVT and PE without unduly increasing the risk of intracranial and extracranial haemorrhage. A systematic review of the randomised trials of anticoagulants in acute myocardial infarction showed that the addition of intravenous or subcutaneous heparin did not add worthwhile extra benefit to the use of antiplatelet therapy alone (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 1996</LINK>). However, the addition of low-dose subcutaneous heparin to aspirin might be more effective in acute stroke. The only trial that provided a direct randomised comparison of aspirin with aspirin plus low-dose heparin was <LINK REF="STD-IST-1997" TYPE="STUDY">IST 1997</LINK>, yet the available data did not provide conclusive evidence that the combination was more effective than aspirin alone. The question of whether or not to add low-dose heparin to aspirin can, therefore, only be answered reliably by a further, much larger trial that randomly allocates participants to aspirin or aspirin plus low-dose subcutaneous heparin. Symptomatic PE (and intracranial haemorrhage) are infrequent in people with ischaemic stroke. Therefore, any proposed trial would need to include several 10s of 1000s of participants in order to provide reliable evidence on the size of any difference in the effects of these two antithrombotic regimens.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Time window for benefit from aspirin</HEADING>
<P>There was clear evidence of net benefit when aspirin therapy was started within 48 hours of stroke onset. A more detailed meta-analysis based on individual patient data from <LINK REF="STD-IST-1997" TYPE="STUDY">IST 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-CAST-1997" TYPE="STUDY">CAST 1997</LINK> showed no clear evidence that the benefit declined with increasing time from stroke onset up to 48 hours (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2000</LINK>). The evidence on the effects of starting treatment at more that 48 hours and within 14 days of onset was extremely limited in this review. However, taken with the data from the Antithrombotic Trialists Collaboration the evidence is very strongly suggestive that starting after 48 hours but within 14 days of onset and continuing long-term is highly likely to be of net benefit (<LINK REF="REF-ATC-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATC 2002</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Interaction with thrombolytic therapy</HEADING>
<P>Thrombolytic therapy for acute ischaemic stroke within 4.5 hours of symptom onset has received regulatory approval (or is recommended in guidelines) in many places, and is the subject of ongoing research. Since antiplatelet and thrombolytic therapy can cause serious bleeding, it is important to assess the evidence for any interaction between the two agents. The subject is dealt with in some detail in the Cochrane systematic review of thrombolytic therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Wardlaw-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wardlaw 2009</LINK>). The interaction between thrombolytic drugs and antithrombotic drugs given simultaneously (or the latter very soon after the former) was only tested by random allocation in <LINK REF="STD-MAST_x002d_I-1995" TYPE="STUDY">MAST-I 1995</LINK>, which therefore provides the only truly valid evidence. In <LINK REF="STD-MAST_x002d_I-1995" TYPE="STUDY">MAST-I 1995</LINK> there was a clinically important adverse interaction between aspirin and streptokinase when given simultaneously, resulting in a substantial increase in case fatality (early and late), which was not offset by a reduction in the number of dead or dependent participants at the end of follow-up; 28% of those allocated to streptokinase alone versus 43% of those allocated to streptokinase plus aspirin were dead by the end of follow-up (P &lt; 0.001), and 62% and 63% were dead or dependent, respectively (versus 68% in the control group). The actual cause of the increase in early and total deaths with streptokinase and aspirin appeared largely to be due to neurological events. Aspirin with streptokinase significantly increased the number of deaths in hospital from all causes (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.3 to 3.8), neurological causes (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1 to 3.7), and intracranial haemorrhage on CT scan or at autopsy (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.0 to 5.0) when compared with the group who received streptokinase alone. There was no difference in deaths from neurological causes without intracranial haemorrhage, but note that more participants in the streptokinase plus aspirin group died of neurological causes without a CT scan or autopsy so they could also have had an intracranial haemorrhage. That is, the increase in intracranial haemorrhage with aspirin and streptokinase may be even greater. Information is also available on antithrombotic drug use in 12 other trials. There was a trend towards increased case fatality, which was more frequent the nearer to the administration of thrombolysis the concomitant antithrombotic drug use was (OR 1.95 when all participants received antithrombotic drugs within 24 hours of thrombolysis; 1.27 when some participants received antithrombotic drugs within 24 hours; 1.21 when no participants received antithrombotic drugs within 24 hours but some thereafter; and 0.89 for no antithrombotic drugs within the first 10 to 14 days). Although these data are based mainly on non-randomised comparisons, they do support the evidence of a clinically significant adverse interaction between the concurrent use of thrombolysis and antithrombotic drugs as found in <LINK REF="STD-MAST_x002d_I-1995" TYPE="STUDY">MAST-I 1995</LINK>. This is confirmed by the recent <LINK REF="STD-ARTIS-2012" TYPE="STUDY">ARTIS 2012</LINK> trial comparing recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rTPA) plus intravenous aspirin with rTPA alone.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">New developments</HEADING>
<P>The concept of acute stroke (and the differentiation of stroke from TIA) is changing as people with acute cerebral ischaemia are assessed and treated increasingly earlier and more aggressively. The boundary between acute treatment and very early initiation of secondary prevention is becoming blurred, as evidenced by the <LINK REF="STD-FASTER-2007" TYPE="STUDY">FASTER 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-CHANCE-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">CHANCE 2013</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-TARDIS" TYPE="STUDY">TARDIS</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-POINT" TYPE="REFERENCE">POINT</LINK> trials. There is clearly a place for further trials of more intensive antiplatelet regimens, started as soon after symptom onset as possible. However, since aspirin will remain the comparator treatment, such trials will need to be even larger than current trials if they are to produce reliable results.</P>

<OL>
<LI>The review provided strong evidence for the benefits of aspirin 160 to 300 mg, given as soon as is practicable (and continued as a once daily dose), in people with suspected acute ischaemic stroke. This evidence applied chiefly to people seen within 48 hours of stroke onset and in whom intracranial haemorrhage had been excluded, or was thought to be clinically unlikely, and had no definite contraindications to aspirin. In people who are unable to swallow safely, aspirin may be given per rectum as a suppository, via a nasogastric tube or intravenously (as 100 mg of the lysine salt of acetylsalicylic acid).</LI>
<LI>The assessment of the safety and efficacy of antiplatelet agents in people with primary intracranial haemorrhage was not the aim of this review. However, it did provide limited evidence on the effects of aspirin in people in whom intracranial haemorrhage had not been ruled out by brain scanning before treatment was started and who subsequently were shown to have had an intracranial haemorrhage. There was no evidence of net harm in such people. Thus, if there is likely to be a delay before CT or MR brain scanning can be performed to exclude intracranial haemorrhage it may be reasonable to give aspirin until the scan result is known. If the scan shows intracranial haemorrhage then aspirin should probably be discontinued.</LI>
<LI>In people who cannot tolerate aspirin an alternative antiplatelet agent should be considered, although the evidence for other agents is inadequate at present.</LI>
<LI>In view of the potential interaction, people who have been treated with thrombolytic therapy should not be started on aspirin for 24 to 48 hours.</LI>
<LI>Although this review provided very limited evidence on the effects of starting aspirin in people who first present with stroke at between 48 hours and 14 days of onset, what little evidence there was, supported by strong external evidence, suggested net benefit from starting aspirin even at this late stage.</LI>
<LI>This review confirmed the benefit of continuing treatment in hospital, and external evidence supports its continuation after hospital discharge.</LI>

<OL>
<LI>The overall treatment effect of antiplatelet agents in acute ischaemic stroke is not large and better acute therapies are therefore necessary. The question of whether any particular antiplatelet agent is superior to aspirin 160 mg to 300 mg in the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke remains to be determined, and would require a very large randomised trial to be answered reliably.</LI>
<LI>In people with unstable coronary artery disease, trials have evaluated the addition of low molecular-weight heparin or another antiplatelet agent (such as a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor or clopidogrel) to aspirin. There is a case for such trials to be undertaken in acute ischaemic stroke. There is also a case for further trials of low-dose subcutaneous heparin (or low-dose low molecular-weight heparin) plus aspirin versus aspirin alone in the prevention of post-stroke deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and in reducing neurological disability from the original or recurrent strokes. Such trials would need to include several 10s of 1000s of participants.</LI>
<LI>Future trials comparing more intense antiplatelet or antithrombotic regimens with aspirin in acute ischaemic stroke will need to include several 10s of 1000s of participants.</LI>

<P>The <LINK TAG="IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH" TYPE="SECTION">Implications for research</LINK> section states: 'There is also a case for further trials of low-dose subcutaneous heparin (or low-dose low-molecular-weight heparin) plus aspirin versus aspirin alone in the prevention of post-stroke deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and in reducing neurological disability from the original or recurrent strokes. Such trials would need to include several tens of thousands of patients'. This review should be updated to reflect that, given the lack of efficacy of anticoagulants in multiple trials and high bleeding risk in stroke patients, further trials with low-dose heparin or low-dose low-molecular-weight heparin would be unethical.</P>

<P>This comment was submitted in response to the previous version of this review (this response to feedback was delayed by a number of unavoidable administrative factors). We do not agree that the data are sufficiently robust to support a statement that 'further trials with low-dose heparin or low-dose low-molecular-weight heparin in acute ischemic stroke would be unethical.' Such  decisions should  rest with the relevant research ethics committees and the trialists (advised by their steering and data monitoring and safety committees).</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY MODIFIED="2014-06-24 12:47:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>I read with interest the Cochrane Review by Sandercock et al which reviewed the use of oral antiplatelet therapy for acute ischemic stroke, and commend the authors on doing an excellent job filtering through the literature and analyzing all available data<SUP>1</SUP>. While I do agree with the majority of the authors' conclusions and the overall trend of their therapeutic recommendations, I believe that some conclusion statements regarding use of aspirin post-stroke are stronger than the data supporting them.</P>
<P>The majority of data in this review (98%) were drawn from two large trials in 1997, CAST<SUP>2</SUP> and IST<SUP>3</SUP>. The authors acknowledge that 601 total participants from these trials were lost to follow-up (300 treatment and 301 control), with the majority coming from CAST (219 treatment and 232 control), but claim that due to the relatively small percentage of patients missing, they can safely assume that these patients did not have an outcome event for the primary analysis. Unfortunately, using Review Manager 5.2 to run sensitivity analyses on several comparisons revealed that results found to be statistically significant in this review became non-statistically significant when only a few events were added to a group. The CAST trial was used for my analyses due to the larger amount of missing data, and I specifically analyzed the comparisons of death or dependence at the end of follow-up, all-cause death during treatment, all-cause death at follow-up, pulmonary embolism, and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. The primary comparison of death or dependence at end of follow-up was relatively robust, and required an almost worst-case scenario of all 219 missing patients in the aspirin group to have had an event to push the result to statistical non-significance. On the other hand, only five more deaths in the aspirin group for the comparison of all-cause death during treatment period pushed the upper end of the CI to 1.01. All-cause death at follow-up became non-significant when 50 deaths were added to the treatment group. The finding of reduced pulmonary embolism became non-significant when only two events were added to the treatment group. Adding 27 events to the aspirin group for the outcome of any recurrent stroke during treatment period similarly results in non-significance. Interestingly, adding only one symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage to the control group for the outcome looking at this event during treatment period pushed the confidence interval to non-significance. I believe the results of this review will be viewed in a more accurate light if a discussion of the potential confounding effect of the missing data was included, especially for the outcomes where only a handful of missing events could result in non-significant data.</P>
<P>There also appears to be an underlying issue with the methodology of the IST study. The IST study was deemed to be at "low risk of bias" by the Cochrane group, even though there was no use of placebo, and trial participants/assessors were not blinded during treatment. They do mention the fact that at follow-up, the majority of patients appear to not remember what treatment they received and are therefore effectively blinded towards the primary endpoint of death and disability at six months; however, there is no mention of the fact that the open design could have introduced significant bias. It is feasible that clinicians may have been more likely to conduct CT scans on patients who deteriorate clinically while on an antiplatelet, increasing the likelihood of detecting intracranial hemorrhages. On the other hand, clinicians who knew their patient was not receiving an antiplatelet may have tended to follow these patients more closely or found other ways to counterbalance what they may have believed was suboptimal therapy. Sensitivity analyses were done for each comparison, including only double-blinded studies which essentially excluded IST data and reported CAST results in isolation. This resulted in six comparisons (including the primary) to become statistically non-significant. I believe it is important to mention how the open design of the IST trial may have affected results in either a positive to negative direction in either the section discussing blinding of trials or in a separate limitations section.</P>
<P>To summarize, I appreciate the effort and dedication put into this periodically updated Cochrane review, but feel that there should be more discussion on the limitations inherent to the two main studies which this review is based on to avoid overestimation of the resulting data.</P>
<P>I certify that I have no affiliations with or involvement in any organisation or entity with a direct financial interest in the subject matter of my criticisms.</P>

<P>Thank you for these comments on the review. Lee and Ng's comment focus on two points.</P>
<P>1. That the estimates of effect of aspirin are not robust in various sensitivity analyses, applying 'worst case scenario methods' to examine the effect of missing data on some of the outcomes. While this is one approach to assessing the plausibility of the effects of aspirin observed in patients with acute ischaemic stroke, it is important to view the estimates in the context of the effects of aspirin in other patients with acute vascular events (e.g. acute MI) and in secondary prevention after an ischaemic event of the brain heart or peripheral circulation. From that perspective, the effects observed in acute stroke are consistent with those observed in other categories of patients at high risk, which we mention in the discussion.</P>
<P>2. The lack of blinding in IST is a potential source of bias that was not sufficiently discussed in the review. The lack of blinding is discussed, but not exhaustively, partly because, as set out in the primary report of the IST trial, the impact on the primary outcome was likely to be small and the estimates of effect on the secondary outcomes were remarkably similar in the unblinded (IST) and blinded (CAST) studies. The 1997 report of the IST in the Lancet stated: "To minimise bias in the assessment of the 6 month outcome the assessors in most countries were blind to treatment allocation. Moreover, the pilot phase of the study indicated that most patients could not recall their treatment allocation at 6 months,3 so they too were effectively blinded. Estimates of treatment effects among those with central follow-up (which is likely to be largely blinded) and those without were not significantly different. Thus, lack of blinding probably did not materially affect the main findings for the primary outcomes. Clinicians might, however, have been more likely to arrange repeat CT scanning in patients on active treatment who worsened clinically, detecting more intracranial haemorrhages, so the open design may have introduced some bias in the assessment of the secondary outcomes. However, the apparent effects of aspirin in the open IST were similar to those in CAST, which was placebo-controlled."<BR/>
