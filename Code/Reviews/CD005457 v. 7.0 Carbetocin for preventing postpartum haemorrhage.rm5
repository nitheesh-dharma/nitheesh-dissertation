<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-03-12 10:10:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>In low- and middle-income countries, postpartum haemorrhage is a major cause of maternal deaths and ill health. In high-income countries, the problems are much less but there is still a small risk of major bleeding problems for women after giving birth. Active management of the third stage of labour, which is generally used to reduce blood loss at birth, consists of giving the mother a drug that helps the uterus to contract, early cord clamping and controlled cord traction to deliver the placenta. Different drugs have been tried and generally either intramuscular oxytocin or intramuscular syntometrine is given. Carbetocin is an oxytocin agonist. Oxytocin agonists are a group of drugs that mimic the oxytocin action, oxytocin being the natural hormone that helps to reduce blood loss at birth. This review includes 11 randomised controlled trials involving 2635 women. The trials compared carbetocin against either oxytocin or syntometrine given after delivery, vaginally or by caesarean section. The comparison between intramuscular carbetocin and oxytocin showed that there was no difference in the risk of heavy bleeding, but that women who received carbetocin were less likely to require other medications to produce uterine contractions following caesarean sections. Comparisons between carbetocin and syntometrine showed that women who received carbetocin had less blood loss compared to women who received syntometrine after vaginal delivery, and were much less likely to experience side effects such as nausea and vomiting. The incidence of hypertension at 30 and 60 minutes post delivery was also significantly lower in women who received carbetocin compared to those who received syntometrine. Five of the 11 studies were known to be supported by a pharmaceutical company.</P>

<P>Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is one of the major contributors to maternal mortality and morbidity worldwide. Active management of the third stage of labour has been proven to be effective in the prevention of PPH. Syntometrine is more effective than oxytocin but is associated with more side effects. Carbetocin, a long-acting oxytocin agonist, appears to be a promising agent for the prevention of PPH.</P>

<P>We included 11<B> </B>studies (2635 women) in the review. Six trials compared carbetocin with oxytocin; four of these were conducted for women undergoing caesarean deliveries, one was for women following vaginal deliveries and one did not state the mode of delivery clearly. The carbetocin was administered as 100 µg intravenous dosage across the trials, while oxytocin was administered intravenously but at varied dosages. Four trials compared intramuscular carbetocin and intramuscular syntometrine for women undergoing vaginal deliveries. Three of the trials were on women with no risk factor for PPH, while one trial was on women with risk factors for PPH. One trial compared the use of intravenous carbetocin with placebo. Use of carbetocin resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the need for therapeutic uterotonics (risk ratio (RR) 0.62; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 0.88; four trials, 1173 women) compared to oxytocin for those who underwent caesarean section, but not for vaginal delivery. Compared to oxytocin, carbetocin was associated with a reduced need for uterine massage following both caesarean delivery (RR 0.54; 95% CI 0.37 to 0.79; two trials, 739 women) and vaginal delivery (RR 0.70; 95% CI 0.51 to 0.94; one trial, 160 women). There were no statistically significant differences between carbetocin and oxytocin in terms of risk of any PPH (blood loss greater than 500 ml) or in risk of severe PPH (blood loss greater than 1000 ml). Comparison between carbetocin and syntometrine showed a lower mean blood loss in women who received carbetocin compared to syntometrine (mean difference (MD) -48.84 ml; 95% CI -94.82 to -2.85; four trials, 1030 women). There was no statistically significant difference in terms of the need for therapeutic uterotonic agents, but the risk of adverse effects such as nausea and vomiting were significantly lower in the carbetocin group: nausea (RR 0.24; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.40; four trials, 1030 women); vomiting (RR 0.21; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.39; four trials, 1030 women). The incidence of postpartum hypertension was also significantly lower in women who received carbetocin compared to those who received syntometrine. Cost-effectiveness of carbetocin was investigated by one study published as an abstract, with limited data.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-03-12 10:09:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>For women who undergo caesarean section, carbetocin resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the need for therapeutic uterotonics compared to oxytocin, but there is no difference in the incidence of postpartum haemorrhage. Carbetocin is associated with less blood loss compared to syntometrine in the prevention of PPH for women who have vaginal deliveries and is associated with significantly fewer adverse effects. Further research is needed to analyse the cost-effectiveness of carbetocin as a uterotonic agent.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-12-21 12:28:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) or excessive bleeding at or after childbirth is a potentially life-threatening complication and is one of the major contributors to maternal mortality and morbidity worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Lewis-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 2004</LINK>). Maternal death often occurs within a short period of time due to irreversible shock (<LINK REF="REF-Kane-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kane 1992</LINK>). The effects on maternal morbidity include anaemia, fatigue and depression (<LINK REF="REF-McCormick-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCormick 2002</LINK>). Although there has been a marked improvement in management in recent years, it is known to contribute to almost one-quarter of all maternal deaths worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Carroli-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carroli 2008</LINK>). Etuk et al reported a postpartum haemorrhage case fatality rate of 2.2% in a teaching hospital in Nigeria (<LINK REF="REF-Etuk-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Etuk 1997</LINK>). Maternal mortality rates are much lower among developed countries, but haemorrhage remains one of the top causes of maternal deaths over the years (<LINK REF="REF-Cantwell-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cantwell 2011</LINK>). Uterine atony accounts for a significant majority of PPH. Prevention of PPH is therefore of great importance in the pursuit of improved health care for women. This is particularly important in the current context of increasing caesarean delivery rate (<LINK REF="REF-Villar-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Villar 2006</LINK>), with operative delivery being a recognised risk factor for PPH.</P>
<P>PPH is defined as blood loss of 500 ml or more and severe PPH as 1000 ml or more in the third stage of labour. Active management of the third stage of labour has been proven to be effective in the prevention of PPH (<LINK REF="REF-Begley-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begley 2010</LINK>). Active management of the third stage of labour has three components - use of an uterotonic agent, early cord clamping and controlled cord traction. The pharmacologic agents currently used are mainly syntometrine (a combination of oxytocin and ergometrine) and oxytocin. The Cochrane review by <LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2004</LINK> concluded that syntometrine is associated with a statistically significant reduction in the risk of PPH for blood loss exceeding 500 ml but not exceeding 1000 ml when compared to oxytocin alone. However, the unpleasant side effects of nausea, vomiting and elevated blood pressure in previously normotensive women have been well documented as being considerably higher in women receiving syntometrine (<LINK REF="REF-McDonald-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 1993</LINK>). The incidence of these side effects in the western studies was as high as 20% to 30%. These side effects are mainly due to the ergometrine component. The Cochrane review on the prophylactic use of ergot alkaloids in the third stage of labour concluded that ergot alkaloids are effective in reducing blood loss and PPH, but adverse effects include vomiting, elevation of blood pressure and pain after birth requiring analgesia, particularly with the intravenous route of administration (<LINK REF="REF-Liabsuetrakul-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liabsuetrakul 2007</LINK>). Some authors also reported a higher incidence of retained placenta associated with the use of syntometrine compared with oxytocin (<LINK REF="REF-Yuen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yuen 1995</LINK>). More importantly, syntometrine has also been associated with severe complications such as coronary artery spasm (<LINK REF="REF-Carey-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carey 1993</LINK>) and intracerebral haemorrhage (<LINK REF="REF-Dumoulin-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dumoulin 1981</LINK>). In addition, syntometrine cannot be used in 10% to 20% of the obstetric population as a result of co-existing medical conditions such as pre-eclampsia and cardiac conditions. These women are then given oxytocin which, because of its short duration of action, is less effective in preventing PPH.</P>
<P>Over the past two decades, several other alternatives have been explored, including the use of prostaglandins such as misoprostol and carboprost. Promising results have been published recently with the use of misoprostol for the prevention of postpartum haemorrhage compared to placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Chong-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chong 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gulmezoglu-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulmezoglu 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mobeen-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mobeen 2011</LINK>). The recent Cochrane review by Gulmezoglu et al concluded that oral or sublingual misoprostol shows promising results when compared to placebo in reducing blood loss postpartum. However, oral misoprostol is associated with higher risk of severe postpartum haemorrhage and use of additional uterotonics compared to the conventional injectable uterotonics (<LINK REF="REF-Gulmezoglu-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulmezoglu 2011</LINK>). Among the other agents or interventions that have been studied for prevention of postpartum haemorrhage, oxytocin agonist (carbetocin) appears to be a promising agent for this indication (<LINK REF="REF-Chong-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chong 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Carbetocin is a long-acting synthetic octapeptide analogue of oxytocin with agonist properties. The clinical and pharmacological properties of carbetocin are similar to those of naturally occurring oxytocin. Like oxytocin, carbetocin binds to oxytocin receptors present on the smooth musculature of the uterus, resulting in rhythmic contractions of the uterus, increased frequency of existing contractions and increased uterine tone. In pharmacokinetic studies, intravenous injections of carbetocin produced tetanic uterine contractions within two minutes, lasting six minutes, followed by rhythmic contractions for a further hour. Intramuscular injection produced tetanic contractions in less than two minutes, lasting about 11 minutes, and followed by rhythmic contractions for an additional two hours. The prolonged duration of activity after intramuscular compared with the intravenous carbetocin was significant (<LINK REF="REF-Hunter-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hunter 1992</LINK>). In comparison to oxytocin, carbetocin induces a prolonged uterine response when administered postpartum, in terms of both amplitude and frequency of contractions.</P>
<P>The potential advantage of intramuscular carbetocin over intramuscular oxytocin is its longer duration of action. Its relative lack of gastrointestinal and cardiovascular side effects should also prove advantageous compared to syntometrine and other ergot alkaloids. Carbetocin is currently indicated for prevention of uterine atony after delivery by caesarean section in spinal or epidural anaesthesia in 23 countries. However, it is not approved by the FDA for use following vaginal births. We conducted a systematic review of the literature for studies on this subject and performed a meta-analysis in order to assess the effectiveness and safety of carbetocin, an oxytocin agonist, in the prevention of PPH.</P>

<P>To avoid duplication of data, in September 2010, the Pregnancy and Childbirth Group developed a hierarchy of reviews on prevention of PPH for women giving birth vaginally.</P>
<P>Each review includes comparisons between one of the methods (from two to 11) with only those methods above it on the list. Thus, this review of ergometrine + oxytocin (4) will include only comparisons with ergometrine (3), oxytocin (2) or placebo (1). If we identify methods in the future, we will add them to the end of the list. The current list is as follows.</P>

<P>The authors of the reviews that were published before the introduction of this plan will update their reviews according to the above hierarchy when they next update their reviews. Due to the limited number of studies involving carbetocin at the moment, we have covered prevention strategies to reduce the risk of PPH after both vaginal and caesarean deliveries in this review. With more studies in this topic, separate reviews following vaginal and caesarean deliveries will be generated in the future.</P>

<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>). We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials were examining the same intervention, and we judged the trials&#8217; populations and methods sufficiently similar. If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if we detected substantial statistical heterogeneity, we used random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful. We treated the random-effects summary as the average range of possible treatment effects and discussed the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect was not clinically meaningful, we have not combined trials.</P>

<P>Six trials compared the use of carbetocin with oxytocin; four were conducted for women undergoing caesarean deliveries (<LINK REF="STD-Attilakos-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Attilakos 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Borruto-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Borruto 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boucher-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Boucher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dansereau-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dansereau 1999</LINK>) and one was for women who had vaginal deliveries (<LINK REF="STD-Boucher-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Boucher 2004</LINK>). The mode of delivery is not clear in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Del-Angel_x002d_Garcia-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Del Angel-Garcia 2006</LINK>). A standard dose of 100 µg carbetocin as an intravenous bolus is administered across all trials, but the dose of the comparator drug, oxytocin, varies across the trials. Out of the four trials that compared carbetocin with oxytocin, two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Boucher-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Boucher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dansereau-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dansereau 1999</LINK>) were conducted on women who underwent elective caesarean deliveries. Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Attilakos-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Attilakos 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Borruto-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Borruto 2009</LINK>) included participants undergoing both elective and emergency caesarean sections. Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Attilakos-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Attilakos 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dansereau-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dansereau 1999</LINK>) recruited women with or without risk factors for postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) while the study by <LINK REF="STD-Borruto-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Borruto 2009</LINK> enrolled women with at least one risk factor for PPH. In <LINK REF="STD-Dansereau-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dansereau 1999</LINK>, differences in baseline characteristics were noted between the groups receiving oxytocin and carbetocin, such as the number of women with history of PPH and gestational diabetes. We performed a post-hoc analysis following correction for the imbalance in distribution of some (such as history of gestational diabetes) but not all of these characteristics (such as past history of PPH). Subgroup analysis was performed by the authors for women with risk factors for PPH in <LINK REF="STD-Attilakos-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Attilakos 2010</LINK>. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Boucher-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Boucher 2004</LINK>) comparing carbetocin and oxytocin was conducted on women with at least one risk factor for PPH who underwent vaginal deliveries.</P>
<P>Four trials compared the use of carbetocin and syntometrine for women undergoing vaginal deliveries (<LINK REF="STD-Askar-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Askar 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leung-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Leung 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nirmala-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Nirmala 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Su-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Su 2009</LINK>).

<P>One trial compared the use of carbetocin with placebo following caesarean deliveries (<LINK REF="STD-Barton-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Barton 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the trial conducted by <LINK REF="STD-Attilakos-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Attilakos 2010</LINK>, participants included women undergoing both elective and emergency caesarean section, as well as women with or without risk factors for PPH. However, subgroup analysis was performed for the risk of PPH and it was concluded that the use of additional oxytocics was reduced in the carbetocin group, irrespective of the presence of risk factors for PPH.</P>
<P>Prior to the full publication, two of the above studies were presented at more than one conference, followed by the publication of abstracts in conference proceedings. We have listed references for these abstracts with the main publication in the <LINK TAG="INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Included studies</LINK> section, but we only extracted the data for pooling from the full publications. However, <LINK REF="STD-Barton-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Barton 1996</LINK> was not published in full; we therefore had to extract the data from the abstract.</P>
<P>The study by <LINK REF="STD-Del-Angel_x002d_Garcia-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Del Angel-Garcia 2006</LINK> compared the use of carbetocin and syntocinon in women with risk factors for PPH. The main objective of this study, which was only published in an abstract, was economic evaluation of carbetocin for the prevention of uterine atony in patients with risk factors for PPH. In this study, patients who received carbetocin were compared against patients who received syntocinon. However, the mode of delivery was not clear from the abstract and there was a lack of raw data in the abstract. The results of the study in terms of efficacy were therefore not used for analyses.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">(1) Random sequence generation and allocation concealment (selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>The randomisation process in general and concealment of allocation in particular are considered the most important and sensitive indicators that bias has been minimised in a clinical trial (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). All the studies were randomised.</P>
<P>For studies comparing carbetocin and oxytocin, method of randomisation was by computer-generated numbers for three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Attilakos-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Attilakos 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boucher-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Boucher 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dansereau-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dansereau 1999</LINK>), but it was not clear in the other three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Borruto-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Borruto 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boucher-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Boucher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Del-Angel_x002d_Garcia-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Del Angel-Garcia 2006</LINK>). Three studies did a block randomisation (<LINK REF="STD-Attilakos-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Attilakos 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boucher-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Boucher 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dansereau-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dansereau 1999</LINK>) with a block size of two, four and 10 respectively. However, adequate concealment allocation was only described in two out of the six trials (<LINK REF="STD-Attilakos-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Attilakos 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boucher-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Boucher 2004</LINK>). The use of a randomisation block size of two (<LINK REF="STD-Dansereau-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dansereau 1999</LINK>) made allocation concealment less effective, as every second participant's allocation could be correctly predicted.</P>
<P>For trials comparing carbetocin and syntometrine, computer generated randomisation and adequate concealment allocation were performed for all the four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Askar-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Askar 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leung-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Leung 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nirmala-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Nirmala 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Su-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Su 2009</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">(3) Attrition bias and selective reporting bias</HEADING>
<P>For <LINK REF="STD-Boucher-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Boucher 1998</LINK>, three women were excluded from the study because they did not receive the study medication. This is unlikely to affect the results, although not all the analyses were performed on all of the 57 women who received the medications. There was therefore no intention-to-treat analysis, resulting in unclear risk of reporting bias.</P>
<P>For <LINK REF="STD-Dansereau-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dansereau 1999</LINK>, 35 women were withdrawn from the study before the study drug was received. Twenty-four women were subsequently not included in the primary efficacy analysis due to major protocol violations. However, post-hoc analyses were carried out, including the 24 women who had protocol violations, and when the 24 women were considered as treatment success (i.e. no need for further oxytocic therapy), the same result was obtained. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed for analyses of the adverse symptoms or signs. However, it was not performed for the analyses looking at the efficacy of the interventions, as the 24 women who had protocol violations were not included in these analyses.</P>
<P>For <LINK REF="STD-Boucher-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Boucher 2004</LINK>, only four women were excluded postrandomisation, the small number of which is unlikely to influence the result. Certain data were not available, resulting in a lower number of participants being assessed for certain outcomes. For example, the outcome of mean blood loss and the percentage of women with estimated blood loss greater than 500 ml was only assessed in 64/83 (77.1%) in the carbetocin group and 67/77 (87.0%) in the oxytocin group.

<P>We analysed a total of 11 trials in this review. Analyses were performed for the three comparisons: (1) carbetocin versus oxytocin; (2) carbetocin versus syntometrine and (3) carbetocin versus placebo. Oxytocin can be used following both vaginal and caesarean deliveries. The types of participants for vaginal and caesarean deliveries were different and the mode of delivery is an important factor which could influence the treatment outcomes. We therefore carried out separate analyses for caesarean and vaginal deliveries in studies which compared the use of carbetocin versus oxytocin. For studies which compared the use of carbetocin and syntometrine, we carried out subgroup analyses for women with and without risk factors for PPH, as these two groups of women are at very different risks of PPH. The exact number of trials and participants varied for each outcome, with some comparisons only having one trial available, which limits the conclusions that can be drawn for some comparisons. For our secondary objective, no study has been conducted to determine the best route of administration and the optimal dose of oxytocin agonist for the prevention of PPH.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-03-12 10:11:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Current evidence shows that carbetocin significantly reduces the need for therapeutic uterotonics compared to placebo and oxytocin in women undergoing caesarean delivery. However, pooled data showed that the risk of any postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) or severe PPH (blood loss greater than 1000 ml) was similar in both the group receiving carbetocin and the group receiving oxytocin. Carbetocin results in a reduced need for uterine massage postdelivery in both caesarean and vaginal deliveries. In fact, one of the recommendations from The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada for PPH prevention is that carbetocin, 100 µg given as an intravenous bolus over one minute, should be used instead of continuous oxytocin infusion in elective caesarean section for the prevention of PPH and to decrease the need for therapeutic uterotonics (<LINK REF="REF-Leduc-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leduc 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Following our previous review, four trials have been completed comparing the use of carbetocin and syntometrine for women who undergo vaginal deliveries, three studies for women with no risk factor for PPH and one for women with risk factors for PPH. The results showed no statistically significant difference in terms of the outcome of the need for therapeutic uterotonics and PPH. The finding that carbetocin is more effective in preventing PPH compared to oxytocin but not when compared to syntometrine is consistent with the prior knowledge that syntometrine is a more effective uterotonic agent than oxytocin. However, pooled analyses from the comparison between carbetocin and syntometrine showed a lower postpartum mean blood loss for women who received carbetocin compared to women who received syntometrine. Difficulty in accurate measurements of estimated blood loss is widely acknowledged, and fewer investigators are using estimated blood loss as a primary clinical outcome measure. However, comparison of this secondary outcome showed a statistically lower mean blood loss in women who received carbetocin.</P>
<P>For trials comparing carbetocin and oxytocin, adequate randomisation was conducted for three out of the six trials, while allocation concealment was adequate for two out of the six studies. As there were very few studies and as the results showed similar trends across studies, we did not perform a sensitivity analysis. However, in the next update of this review, if more trials are identified and if allocation concealment is a significant factor for heterogeneity, we will perform a sensitivity analysis. Intention-to-treat analyses were performed for two out of the six studies in the review. For trials comparing carbetocin and syntometrine, all the studies were of high methodological quality, with computer generated randomisation and adequate concealment allocation. Intention-to-treat analyses were performed for three of the four studies in the review. None of the studies did an intention-to-treat analysis when analysing the effectiveness of oxytocin and carbetocin. An intention-to-treat analysis was only performed for outcomes related to safety in the <LINK REF="STD-Dansereau-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dansereau 1999</LINK> study.</P>
<P>Although our initial objective was to look at several primary and secondary outcomes, the identified trials did not report certain outcomes mentioned in our initial protocol. These outcomes include incidence of retained placenta, major maternal morbidity, maternal deaths, thromboembolic events and additional treatment on PPH. There were also no data reported regarding the use of carbetocin and breastfeeding, and the neonatal outcomes such as jaundice, admission to intensive care unit and respiratory distress. Future trials should therefore consider the assessment of these outcomes in addition to the outcomes already reported, so that the systematic review can evaluate the evidence from an overall perspective.</P>
<P>Although there is a trend towards less nausea and vomiting with carbetocin in some studies, no statistically significant differences were found in women given carbetocin versus oxytocin for both types of deliveries. Adverse drug-related events are usually uncommon with uterotonic agents such as oxytocin and carbetocin. Therefore, trials with large sample sizes may be required to show any difference in the adverse effects of the two medications.</P>
<P>Syntometrine, a commonly used uterotonic agent, is known to be associated with more adverse effects than oxytocin (<LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2004</LINK>). Pooled data comparing syntometrine and carbetocin showed that adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, tremor and uterine pain were less likely to be experienced by women who received carbetocin compared to syntometrine. Minimising these adverse effects in the immediate postnatal period adds an additional benefit and enhances the delivery process for the women. <LINK REF="STD-Leung-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Leung 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Nirmala-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Nirmala 2009</LINK> looked at the outcome of postnatal blood pressure and did not show any statistically significant difference between the two groups. Another significant finding in this review is that women who received carbetocin were statistically less likely to have hypertension at 30 and 60 minutes post delivery compared to syntometrine, which is an important outcome to study. This finding could be potentially beneficial for women with known hypertension for whom the use of syntometrine is contraindicated. However, women with known hypertension were excluded from the studies in the review. While the data show favourable data for carbetocin from the aspect of hypertension, the safety of carbetocin use in women with hypertension or pre-eclampsia remains an important question and needs to be further evaluated. Neonatal outcomes were not evaluated in the trials in this review.</P>
<P>Another perceived benefit of carbetocin is the long-acting nature leading to prolonged uterine response. Although intravenous or intramuscular oxytocin bolus is used in many units, no trial has compared the use of carbetocin with intravenous or intramuscular bolus of oxytocin. Intravenous oxytocin infusion, instead of intravenous oxytocin bolus, was the route of administration for oxytocin in all three trials in this review.</P>
<P>Our secondary objective was to determine the best route of administration and the optimal dose of oxytocin agonist for the prevention of PPH. However, as carbetocin was given as an intravenous bolus of 100 µg across the three trials, no comparison of the route of administration and dosage of carbetocin could be performed.</P>
<P>Besides medical considerations, the choice of the most appropriate uterotonic agent will be dependent on factors such as cost, especially in countries with lower resource settings. The unit cost of carbetocin is known to be considerably higher than oxytocin. <LINK REF="STD-Del-Angel_x002d_Garcia-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Del Angel-Garcia 2006</LINK> from Mexico performed the first study which compared the cost-effectiveness of prophylactic carbetocin and oxytocin following caesarean section, and the results showed that the mean cost per woman was significantly lower following carbetocin treatment compared with oxytocin treatment. The study is only published in the form of an abstract and there is a lack of raw data for analyses. There is a paucity of data regarding cost-effectiveness of carbetocin, and more research is therefore needed to address this important issue.</P>
<P>Convenience of carbetocin may be another factor to consider in choosing the uterotonic agent. Carbetocin is used as a standard 100 µg dose which comes in one ampoule; whereas oxytocin infusion often requires the use of multiple ampoules of medication, which is more time-consuming.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Caesarean delivery</HEADING>
<P>Current evidence shows that carbetocin significantly reduces the need for therapeutic uterotonics and the need for uterine massage compared to placebo and oxytocin in women undergoing caesarean delivery. Pooled data showed no difference in risk of postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) in women who received carbetocin compared to oxytocin following caesarean deliveries. </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Vaginal delivery</HEADING>
<P>Carbetocin is similar to syntometrine in the prevention of postpartum haemorrhage for women who have vaginal deliveries, with limited evidence showing a lower postpartum mean blood loss for women who received carbetocin compared to syntometrine. What is statistically and clinically significant is the much lower adverse effects experienced by women who received carbetocin compared to syntometrine. Limited evidence shows significant reduction in the need for uterine massage if given carbetocin compared to oxytocin.</P>
<P>There is evidence to show the benefit of carbetocin over oxytocin for preventing PPH following caesarean deliveries. Carbetocin should also be considered as an option over syntometrine, due to the lower likelihood of adverse effects.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-12-14 01:58:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>More trials comparing the use of carbetocin with either oxytocin or syntometrine will help to allow better assessment of the efficacy of carbetocin, particularly whether the medication allows reduction of the rates of PPH, besides the reduction in the use of therapeutic uterotonic agents. The safety profile of carbetocin in women with hypertension and cardiac diseases need to be further studied. Cost-effectiveness of carbetocin versus other uterotonic agents and the use of carbetocin as a therapeutic agent for PPH are other useful areas to investigate.</P>

<P>To avoid duplication of data and consistency in reviews, the Pregnancy and Childbirth Group developed a hierarchy of reviews on prevention of postpartum haemorrhage for women giving birth vaginally as well as a set of core outcomes. The hierarchy and core outcomes were derived through consensus between the Editors and review authors and have been incorporated into this review.</P>
<P>We have added an additional outcome (need for uterine massage) which was not prespecified in our published protocol.</P>
<P>We have changed the title of this update because our search strategy did not identify trials of oxytocin agonists apart from carbetocin.</P>

<P>Study design: double-blind randomised trial.</P>
<P>Method of randomisation: the randomisation sequence (1:1 ratio - blocks of 10, no stratification) was generated by computer.</P>
<P>Concealment of allocation: the preparation of the 'blinded' ampoules was undertaken by external agency which provided 380 sequentially numbered and labelled boxes, each containing 1 ampoule of the study drug. The next consecutively numbered box was used following randomisation.</P>
<P>Blinding: all boxes and ampoules were identically labelled, with the study number (1-380) being the only differentiating feature between different drug packs. The participants and investigators were blinded to the random allocation sequence.</P>
<P>Sample size: based on a previous audit, additional oxytocics were used after 21% of caesarean sections. A sample size of 338 women (169 in each arm) was needed to detect a difference of 21% versus 10% for the use of additional oxytocics (power 80%, &#945; = 0.05). A total of 380 women were recruited to allow for participant withdrawal, mistakes in randomisation, etc.</P>

<CHAR_METHODS>
<P>Study design: double-blind randomised trial.<BR/>Method of randomisation: separate randomisation lists using a block size of 4 were prepared for each study site by an independent statistical group using computer-generated codes.<BR/>Concealment of allocation: adequate, randomisation codes were sealed in sequentially-numbered envelopes. Women were randomised when reaching 6 cm (multiparous) or full (primiparous) cervical dilatation.<BR/>Blinding: clinical staff and the participants were blinded to the intervention.<BR/>Sample size: sample size was determined using an estimate that 20% of high-risk pregnant women would require additional uterotonic medication (primary outcome measure) following vaginal delivery to prevent PPH. With a power of 80% to detect a 15% difference between study groups, 152 women were required.<BR/>Intention-to-treat analysis was not strictly followed.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">(1) Selection of trials</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors (Lin Lin Su (LLS) and Miny Samuel (MS)) independently examined the abstracts of studies identified by the search strategy. Full publications were retrieved for qualifying abstracts. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion and by seeking the opinion of the third author (Yap-Seng Chong).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">(2) Assessment of methodological quality</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors (LLS and MS) extracted information on participants, methods, interventions, outcomes, and results, and evaluated the methodological quality of each trial. Trial quality was assessed according to methods set out in section six of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005a</LINK>).</P>
<P>The following features were considered:<BR/>(a) method of randomisation;<BR/>(b) method of allocation concealment;<BR/>(c) blinding of participants, surgeons and outcome assessors;<BR/>(d) completeness of follow up;<BR/>(e) use of intention-to-treat analysis.</P>
<P>The allocation concealment of each study were scored A (adequate), B (unclear), C (inadequate) or D (not used) according to the rating system outlined in <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005a</LINK>.</P>
<P>Trials that were explicitly clear that there were concealment of allocation, blinding of outcome assessment and handling of dropouts and withdrawals with an intention-to-treat analysis were considered to be of high quality (<LINK REF="REF-Juni-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juni 1999</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">(3) Data collection</HEADING>
<P>Data were extracted using methods set out in section seven of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005b</LINK>) by two authors (LLS and MS) independently. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">(4) Data synthesis</HEADING>
<P>Presentation of statistical data included the use of relative risks for binary data and weighted mean difference for continuous data. When study designs were judged to be homogenous, the results from the various trials were combined by calculating the pooled relative risks/weighted mean difference and their 95% confidence interval.</P>
<P>Assessment of heterogeneity - we applied tests of heterogeneity between trials using the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic. If high levels of heterogeneity among the trials were identified (exceeding 50%), we explored it by prespecified subgroup analysis and performed sensitivity analysis. A random-effects meta-analysis was used as an overall summary if that was considered appropriate. Separate analyses were performed for women who underwent vaginal deliveries and for women who had caesarean deliveries. The other prespecified subgroup analysis was for women at high risk of postpartum haemorrhage (PPH). However, the only trial for vaginal delivery was on women who had risk factor(s) for PPH. No randomised controlled trial has been published so far for the use of oxytocin agonists in women at low risk of PPH.</P>
