<P>Shigellosis is a bacterial infection of the colon that can cause diarrhoea, dysentery (diarrhoea with blood and/or mucus) and may lead to death. It occurs mainly in low- and middle-income countries where overcrowding and poor sanitation exist, and may lead to around 1.1 million deaths per year globally, mostly in children under five years.</P>
<P>The intention of giving antibiotics in shigellosis is to speed recovery, reduce the seriousness of the disease, and reduce the length of time patients are infective. However, some antibiotics can have serious side effects while others may not be effective against the Shigella bacteria.</P>
<P>The review examined both the effectiveness and the safety of antibiotics in treating Shigella dysentery. While antibiotics tested here appeared safe and effective, there was insufficient evidence to suggest which antibiotics were superior. More well designed trials will help inform decision making.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-08-04 17:57:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Shigella dysentery is a relatively common illness and occasionally causes death, worldwide. Mild symptoms are self-limiting but in more severe cases, antibiotics are recommended for cure and preventing relapse. The antibiotics recommended are diverse, have regional differences in sensitivity, and have side effects.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate the efficacy and safety of antibiotics for treating Shigella dysentery.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2009-08-06 17:56:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In June 2009 we identified all relevant trials from the following databases: Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2008, issue 4), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT). We also checked conference proceedings for relevant abstracts, and contacted researchers, organizations, and pharmaceutical companies.</P>

<P>Randomized controlled trials of antibiotics for Shigella dysentery.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-07-30 15:31:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne-Marie Stephani">
<P>Four authors, working in pairs, independently assessed trial eligibility, methodological quality, and extracted data. We calculated risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous data, and used the random-effects model for significant heterogeneity. We explored possible sources of heterogeneity, when present, in subgroup analyses of participant age and percentage of participants with confirmed Shigella infection.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-08-07 08:39:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne-Marie Stephani">
<P>Sixteen trials (1748 participants), spanning four decades and with differing sensitivity to Shigella isolates, met the inclusion criteria. Seven were judged to be at risk of bias due to inadequate allocation concealment or blinding, and 12 due to incomplete reporting of outcome data. Limited data from one three-armed trial of people with moderately severe illness suggest that antibiotics reduce the episodes of diarrhoea at follow-up (furazolidone versus no drug RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.48, 73 participants; cotrimoxazole versus no drug RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.59, 76 participants).</P>
<P>There was insufficient evidence to consider any class of antibiotic superior in efficacy in treating Shigella dysentery, but heterogeneity for some comparisons limits confidence in the results. All the antibiotics studied were safe. There was inadequate evidence regarding the role of antibiotics in preventing relapses.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-08-06 12:27:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne-Marie Stephani">
<P>Antibiotics reduce the duration of Shigella dysentery.</P>
<P>Regularly updated local or regional antibiotic sensitivity patterns to different species and strains of Shigella are required to guide empiric therapy.

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-08-07 08:39:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne-Marie Stephani">
<P>Shigellosis is a bacterial infection of the colon that causes diarrhoea and can lead to death. Dysentery (frequent mucoid or bloody stools) when caused by Shigella is called Shigella dysentery. Of the estimated 164.7 million Shigella diarrhoeal episodes occurring globally every year, most occur in developing countries (99%) and mainly in children (69%) (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>). Of the 1.1 million deaths due to Shigella, 69% are in children aged less than five years (<LINK REF="REF-Kotloff-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kotloff 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Microbiology and mode of spread</HEADING>
<P>
<I>Shigella dysenteriae</I>, <I>S. flexneri, S. sonnei</I>, and <I>S. boydii</I> are the four species of small, Gram-negative, non-motile bacilli that cause shigellosis, and all but <I>S. sonnei</I> have more than one genetically distinct subtype (serotype) (<LINK REF="REF-von-Seidlein-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">von Seidlein 2006</LINK>). The species distribution varies globally; for example, <I>S. flexneri</I> was reported to be most prevalent in India (58%, <LINK REF="REF-Dutta-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dutta 2002</LINK>) and Rwanda (68%, <LINK REF="REF-Bogaerts-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bogaerts 1983</LINK>), while <I>S. sonnei</I> was the most frequently detected species in Thailand (85%, <LINK REF="REF-von-Seidlein-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">von Seidlein 2006</LINK>), Israel (48.8%, <LINK REF="REF-Mates-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mates 2000</LINK>), and the USA (75%, <LINK REF="REF-Gupta-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shiferaw-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shiferaw 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Shigellae are transmitted by the faeco-oral route, via direct person-to-person contact, and via food, water, and inanimate objects. Only a small number of ingested bacteria are required to produce illness. The disease is communicable as long as an infected person excretes the organism in the stool, which can extend up to four weeks from the onset of illness. Secondary attack rates, the number of exposed persons developing the disease within one to four days following exposure to the primary case (<LINK REF="REF-Park-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Park 2005</LINK>), can be as high as 40% among household contacts (<LINK REF="REF-Sur-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sur 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Shigellosis occurs predominantly in developing countries and is most common where overcrowding and poor sanitation exist. It occurs in densely populated areas and institutions where populations are in close contact with each other, such as day-care centres, cruise ships, institutions for people with mental or psychological problems, and military barracks (<LINK REF="REF-Shane-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shane 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gupta-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 2004</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Clinical features</HEADING>
<P>The clinical manifestation of shigellosis ranges from an asymptomatic illness to bacteraemia and sepsis. Symptoms include fever, diarrhoea and/or dysentery with abdominal cramps and ineffectual and painful straining at stool or in urinating (<LINK REF="REF-Niyogi-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Niyogi 2005</LINK>). Shigellosis may be associated with mild to life-threatening complications, such as rectal prolapse, arthralgia (painful joints), arthritis, intestinal perforation, and toxic mega colon (extreme inflammation and distension of the colon), central nervous disorders, convulsions, enteropathy (protein-losing disease of the intestines), electrolyte imbalance of salts, and sepsis (<LINK REF="REF-Sur-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sur 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2005b</LINK>). About 3% of those infected with <I>S. flexneri</I> and who are genetically predisposed can develop Reiter's syndrome (pains in their joints, irritation of the eyes, and painful urination) that can lead to a difficult to treat chronic arthritis (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2005</LINK>). Haemolytic uraemic syndrome (a complication resulting in kidney failure, bleeding, and anaemia) and leukemoid reaction (blood findings resembling leukaemia) complicate infection due to <I>S. dysenteriae </I>type 1 and may be fatal (<LINK REF="REF-Sinha-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sinha 1987</LINK>). <I>S. dysenteriae </I>type 1 is the only Shigella species with chromosomal genes encoding the protein known as Shiga toxin (<LINK REF="REF-Thorpe-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorpe 2001</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Diagnosis</HEADING>
<P>The clinical features of fever with blood and/or mucous diarrhoea associated with abdominal pain suggest that the aetiology of diarrhoea is Shigella. Routine microscopy of fresh stool is a simple screening test that is cheap, rapid, and easy to perform; and visualization of numerous poly-morphonucleocytes suggests a bacterial aetiology. Definite diagnosis of shigellosis can only be made by stool culture (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2005a</LINK>). However, Shigella species die rapidly in unfavourable environments and stool culture should ideally be supplemented by attempts to identify Shigella DNA using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (<LINK REF="REF-von-Seidlein-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">von Seidlein 2006</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Relapse</HEADING>
<P>Clinical relapse can occur. This manifests as an initial clinical improvement or apparent cure with the treatment, followed by the recurrence of diarrhoea after the course of drug treatment is completed. In some instances people have sought the continued presence of Shigella in cultures of stool after the treatment, irrespective of apparent clinical recovery and have documented these as bacteriological failures (<LINK REF="STD-Martin-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 2000</LINK>), indicative of the potential for relapse. Relapse is an important indicator of treatment failure, though it is clinically difficult to differentiate a relapse of infection with the same species or serotype of Shigella without additional testing for Shigella DNA using PCR analysis (<LINK REF="REF-von-Seidlein-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">von Seidlein 2006</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Mortality</HEADING>
<P>The case-fatality rate is estimated to be less than 1% among those with mild illness (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2005a</LINK>), which is usually self-limiting (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2005</LINK>), and those affected are usually treated as out-patients. However, case fatality is as high as 15% among patients with <I>S. dysenteriae </I>type 1 who require hospitalization; this rate is increased by delayed arrival and treatment with ineffective antibiotics. Infants, non-breast fed children, children recovering from measles, malnourished children, and adults older than 50 years have a more severe illness and a greater risk of death (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2005a</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Shigella and HIV infection</HEADING>
<P>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection may be an important risk factor for Shigella infection. Particularly in HIV-positive people, shigellosis is associated with extensive illness, including Shigella septicaemia, and increased health-care expenditures. The diagnosis of shigellosis in an otherwise healthy adult without obvious exposure risk for Shigella should prompt consideration of the possibility of HIV infection (<LINK REF="REF-Huebner-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huebner 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Baer-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baer 1999</LINK>).</P>

</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-08-07 08:39:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne-Marie Stephani">
<P>The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that all suspected cases of shigellosis based on clinical features be treated with effective antimicrobials (antibiotics). The choice of antimicrobial drug has changed over the years as resistance to antibiotics has occurred, with different patterns of resistance being reported around the world. The following antibiotics were used to treat Shigella dysentery:</P>
<UL>
<LI>class: beta-lactams: ampicillin, amoxicillin, first and second generation cephalosporins (cefixime, ceftriaxone) and pivmecillinam;</LI>
<LI>class: quinolones: nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin;</LI>
<LI>class: macrolides: azithromycin; others: sulphonamides, tetracycline, cotrimoxazole, and furazolidone.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The WHO now recommends that clinically diagnosed cases of Shigella dysentery be treated with ciprofloxacin as first line treatment, and pivmecillinam, ceftriaxone, or azithromycin as second line treatment and lists the others as ineffective (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2005a</LINK>). However, resistance to quinolones has also been observed since the late 1990s, and some authors have questioned the effectiveness of this class for Shigella (<LINK REF="REF-Datta-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Datta 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sarkar-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sarkar 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sur-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sur 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pazhani-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pazhani 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Talukder-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Talukder 2004</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-08-04 18:32:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>When an effective antibiotic is given, clinical improvement is anticipated within 48 hours (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2005a</LINK>). This lessens the risk of serious complications and death, shortens the duration of symptoms, and hastens the elimination of Shigella and the subsequent spread of infection (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2005a</LINK>). Since the antibiotics used for treating shigellosis can have adverse effects (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-BNF-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF 2007</LINK>), some life-threatening, the clinician is faced with a dilemma in choosing an appropriate drug to treat shigellosis. This drug must be effective, locally available at affordable costs, be associated with minimum adverse effects and be sensitive to local Shigella species and strains. We undertook this review in the hope of identifying such a drug or group of drugs.</P>

<P>Two pairs of authors (PC and KVD, and SMJ and VS ) independently assessed the results of the literature search to determine whether the title or abstract of each trial cited was an RCT . We retrieved the full reports of all trials considered by one or both pairs of authors as potentially relevant as well as those that were unclear from scrutinizing the abstracts. Each pair used a standard eligibility form based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria to assess the trials. We resolved disagreements through discussion. If eligibility was uncertain due to unclear or inadequate information, we attempted to contact the trial authors for clarification. The reasons for excluding studies were noted in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>' table.

<P>The pairs of authors independently assessed the risk of bias in each included trial for the following six components: sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding or masking, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other sources of bias. For each of these components, we assigned a judgment regarding the risk of bias as 'yes', 'no', or 'unclear' (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). We recorded follow up to be adequate if more than 90% of the randomized participants were included in the final analysis, inadequate if less than or equal to 90%, or unclear if this information was not available from the report or trial authors. We recorded these assessments in the standard table in RevMan 5 (<LINK REF="REF-Review-Manager-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Review Manager 2008</LINK>), and summarized them in 'Risk of bias' tables and a graph (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>).

In the remaining trials, only the data from participants with microbiologically confirmed Shigella were reported and thus only those data were included in the analyses. Ten trials were carried out only in children, five in adults, and one included both. Among the 10 trials in children, only one (<LINK REF="STD-Dutta-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Dutta 1995</LINK>) included malnourished children (11 of 72) but did not provide data on them separately.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-07-30 15:40:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne-Marie Stephani">
<P>This review identified 16 trials conducted over a span of four decades that randomized 1748 participants to evaluate the safety and efficacy of antibiotics in the treatment of Shigella dysentery. Most trials were at risk of bias due to limitations in reporting details of randomization or allocation concealment or blinding, but the most common source of bias occurred due to failure to report outcome details for participants who were randomized but in whom Shigella could not be isolated from stool culture.</P>
<P>In this review we focused on trials done with antibiotics belonging to different classes compared against placebo or no treatment or to each other. We found limited evidence to support the use of antibiotics in children and adults with Shigella dysentery compared to no treatment or placebo. One trial reported that antibiotics are effective in reducing the proportion of those with diarrhoea but it did not report on relapse. Another trial suggested that antibiotics were effective in reducing the duration of fever though they did not reduce the time to cessation of diarrhoea or bloody stool.</P>
<P>We did not find robust evidence to suggest that antibiotics of a particular class were better than those belonging to a different class. However, there were limited data from a subgroup of studies to suggest that a fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin) was more effective than a beta-lactam (ampicillin) in reducing diarrhoea among adults and that beta-lactams were more effective than fluoroquinolones in reducing diarrhoea among children with proven Shigella dysentery. Oral gentamicin was also reported to be inferior to nalidixic acid in achieving bacteriological cure and reducing fever in one small trial. The trials in this review report that at various periods of time different antibiotics have been effective against isolates of Shigella dysentery (<LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>) in different parts of the world. They are: ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, nalidixic acid, fluoroquinolones like ciprofloxacin, pivmecillinam, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin. However oral gentamicin was relatively ineffective, due to poor absorption when given orally, compared to nalidixic acid and therefore is not recommended. There was insufficient evidence to comment on the use of tetracyclines, sulphonamides, and chloramphenicol.</P>
<P>There is also insufficient evidence to indicate that any antibiotic class prevents relapse of Shigella dysentery.</P>
<P>None of the antibiotics studied in the trials were associated with major adverse events that were drug related.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2009-04-10 17:15:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>With respect to the review's objectives, this review found limited evidence that antibiotics reduce diarrhoea and the duration of fever compared to no antibiotic. However, we are unable to recommend an antibiotic or an antibiotic class for the treatment of Shigella dysentery. The studies identified could not sufficiently address relapse. All the antibiotics studied in this review were safe.</P>
<P>The studies addressed both adults and children. However, populations at risk for complicated Shigella dysentery, such as HIV infected populations and malnourished children, were not included (or adequately represented) in the trials we identified.</P>
<P>In current practice, antibiotics are recommended and used in the treatment of Shigella dysentery. The conclusions of this review confirm these recommendations and current practice. However this review is unable to recommend a specific antibiotic or antibiotic group as universally effective for the treatment of Shigella dysentery.</P>
<P>Even though mild forms of Shigella dysentery are said to be self-limiting, this review is unable to comment on the need for antibiotics in this group since the included trials did not grade patients with respect to the severity of illness.</P>
<P>This review did not include studies using drugs belonging to similar antibiotic classes. Another review is needed to study differences between antibiotics belonging to the same class and also between different antibiotic dosing schedules, and short-course versus longer-course therapy of the same antibiotic.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2009-08-06 17:58:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The body of evidence identified does not allow a robust conclusion regarding the objectives of the review or strong recommendations regarding the choice of preferred antibiotics. Of the 16 trials (1748 participants) included in the review, most had methodological limitations including inadequate reporting of the generation of allocation sequence, inadequate allocation concealment, and lack of blinding. Many trials removed participants after randomization since they did not grow Shigella in their stool culture and had not reported their outcome. This is a serious methodological error. Most trials were thus graded of low or very low quality and further research may change the estimates of efficacy and our confidence in these estimates.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2009-08-06 17:58:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We selected trials that compared the efficacy and safety of antibiotics of different classes only and deferred inclusion of trials evaluating antibiotics of the same drug class to an update or a separate review. Seventeen trials were excluded on the basis of this. This might have biased the results and conclusions of this review. We also did not include comparisons of different doses, routes of administration, or duration of treatment of the same antibiotic in Shigella dysentery.</P>
<P>We selected trials which included participants with clinical evidence of dysentery. However, Shigella infection can also present as diarrhoea in up to three-quarters of infections, particularly in Asian countries (<LINK REF="REF-von-Seidlein-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">von Seidlein 2006</LINK>). Excluding such patients in trials of antibiotics in Shigella and excluding trials using a broader definition than that used in this review could have biased the evidence presented. Many trials in this review also excluded participants randomized to receive antibiotics if their stool did not grow Shigella isolates. However, Shigella species and strains are highly sensitive to inhospitable environments and failure to grow Shigella in culture does not rule out Shigella infection (<LINK REF="REF-von-Seidlein-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">von Seidlein 2006</LINK>). None of the included trials utilized alternative or additional, sensitive, diagnostic techniques such as identification of Shigella DNA using real-time PCR. Exclusion of data from such participants in these trials, and exclusion of more stringent inclusion criteria for the diagnosis of Shigella dysentery in this review is likely to have introduced reporting and selection biases, respectively.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2009-04-10 17:15:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The overall results of this review suggest that most of the antibiotics used were effective. However, only 10 of the 16 included trials reported the proportion of participants that were sensitive to the antibiotics used. The outcomes in these trials correlated with the sensitivity patterns of the antibiotics used.</P>
<P>The WHO recommended nalidixic acid as the first line treatment for Shigella dysentery until 2004 when complete resistance to nalidixic acid in large parts of China and Bangladesh led to recommendations by the WHO to avoid using nalidixic acid altogether in Shigella dysentery (<LINK REF="STD-Legros-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Legros 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2005a</LINK>). However, nalidixic acid continues to be a potential option in parts of the world where resistance to this drug is not, as yet, a widespread problem, such as the Dakar region of the Senegal, where resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and cotrimoxazole are common (<LINK REF="REF-Sire-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sire 2008</LINK>). However, widespread use of nalidixic acid may increase resistance to ciprofloxacin due to cross-resistance of some strains of Shigella and thus has limited utility (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2005a</LINK>). The WHO recommends the use of ciprofloxacin as the first line antibiotic in suspected Shigella dysentery but also suggests that this choice should be based on sensitivity patterns of Shigella strains recently isolated in the area (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2005a</LINK>). Temporal and geographical shifts in Shigella strains are reported in parts of the world (<LINK REF="REF-von-Seidlein-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">von Seidlein 2006</LINK>) and regular surveillance and ascertainment of antimicrobial sensitivity to local and regional strains is necessary to determine the choice of antibiotic to be used as first line in Shigella dysentery. Emerging drug resistance to ciprofloxacin and second line drugs such as pivmecillinam, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin is increasingly being reported in many parts of the world, as is multiple-drug resistance (<LINK REF="REF-Kosek-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kosek 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kuo-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuo 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pazhani-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pazhani 2008</LINK>). The results of this review provides systematically ascertained evidence that the most commonly used antibiotics are potentially effective against Shigella dysentery, provided the local species and strains of Shigella are susceptible. Regular, periodic antibiotic-susceptibility testing of isolates is required to guide local empiric therapy for Shigella dysentery.<BR/>

<P>We recommend the use of antibiotics for moderate to severe Shigella dysentery. The choice of antibiotic to use as first line against Shigella dysentery should be governed by periodically updated local antibiotic sensitivity patterns of Shigella isolates.

<P>Randomized controlled trials which adhere to the CONSORT guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-CONSORT-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">CONSORT 2008</LINK>) are required to address many of the issues such as the need for antibiotics in mild Shigella dysentery, the class or classes of antibiotics best suited against Shigella in populations at risk of high case-fatality such as malnourished children, older adults, patients presenting with serious complications due to shigellosis, and HIV infected individuals.</P>
<P>Trials should stratify participants according to severity of clinical presentation and report the effects of antibiotics separately for each group. Trials must report outcomes for all randomized participants including those with confirmed Shigella and those with negative culture. Antibiotic sensitivity patterns should also be studied and reported. Data regarding outcomes presented in graphs and pictures also need to be expressed in numbers. See <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK> for the suggested features of a future trial.</P>

<P>PC conceived the review and drafted the protocol. KVD, SMJ, and SV helped develop the protocol. Two teams of authors (PC and KVD &amp; SMJ and SV) independently selected trials, assessed quality, extracted and entered data. All authors analysed and interpreted results and wrote the final review.</P>

<PRO_REV_DIFF MODIFIED="2009-08-06 12:37:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne-Marie Stephani">
<P>We intended to analyse combinations of an antibiotic drug versus another antibiotic drug of the same class or different drug classes. Comparisons of antibiotics within the same class were deferred to a subsequent review and thus 17 potential trials of this comparison were excluded from this review. The protocol was developed using Review Manager (RevMan) 4.2 and the review using RevMan 5 (<LINK REF="REF-Review-Manager-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Review Manager 2008</LINK>). We intended to assess methodological quality of included studies using the methods described in <LINK REF="REF-Juni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juni 2001</LINK>. However, since the introduction of RevMan 5 (<LINK REF="REF-Review-Manager-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Review Manager 2008</LINK>), a more detailed assessment of the risk of bias in included trials was undertaken, reported in 'Risk of bias' tables for each trial and graphically summarized in <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>. We also used the GRADE profiler, version 3.2 (<LINK REF="REF-GRADE-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADE 2004</LINK>) to create 'Summary of findings' tables for the primary outcomes in the review.</P>
<P>Had continuous data been summarised using geometric means, we would have combined them on the log scale using the generic inverse variance method and reported them on the natural scale.</P>
<P>Had outcomes been reported both at baseline and at a follow up or at trial endpoints, we would have extracted both the mean change from baseline and the standard deviation of this mean for each treatment group. We would also have extracted the means and standard deviation at baseline and follow up in each treatment group. If the data had been reported using geometric means, we would have recorded this information and extracted a standard deviation on the log scale.</P>
<P>Had count data been reported in trials, we intended to extract the total number of events in each group and the total amount of person-time at risk in each group. We also intended to record the total number of participants in each group. If this information was not available, we would have extracted alternative summary statistics such as rate ratios and confidence intervals if available. Again, if count data were presented as dichotomous outcomes, we would have extracted the number of participants in each intervention group and the number of participants in each intervention group who experienced at least one event. If count data were presented as continuous outcomes or as a time-to-event outcomes, we would have extracted the same information as outlined for continuous and time-to-event outcomes. Count data would have been compared using rate ratios when the total number of events in each group and the total amount of person-time at risk in each group are available, or by relative risks or weighted mean difference had the data been presented in dichotomous or continuous forms respectively. Hazard ratios from survival data would have been combined on the log scale using the inverse variance method and presented on the natural scale.</P>
<P>Had time-to-event outcomes been reported, we would have extracted the estimates of the log hazard ratio and its standard error. If standard errors were not available we would have extracted alternative statistics such as CIs or P values.</P>

<FOOTNOTES>
<P>
<SUP>1</SUP> Very serious limitations: The method of randomization was not described and there were baseline imbalances in duration of diarrhoea. Allocation concealment and blinding were not reported and this increases the risk of bias in the detection and reporting of some adverse events, though not for other primary outcomes that were objectively ascertained. <BR/>
<SUP>2</SUP> Serious indirectness: The single trial included only children and hence the evidence for effectiveness of antibiotics over no antibiotics in adults is uncertain. Though the trial did not exclude participants who were malnourished, it is unclear if any participant was malnourished. <BR/>
<SUP>3</SUP> No imprecision: Both limits of the point estimate of the trial indicated benefit with furazolidine over not receiving an antibiotic<BR/>
<SUP>4</SUP> No imprecision: Both limits of the point estimate showed appreciable benefit with cotrimoxazole over not receiving an antibiotic<BR/>
<SUP>5</SUP> Very serious limitations: Allocation was not concealed and there were baseline imbalances in antibiotic sensitivity to those allocated to ceftriaxone (100%) and ampicillin (80%)<BR/>
<SUP>6</SUP> Serious indirectness: The trial randomized only adults. The antibiotics assessed were ceftriaxone and ampicillin. <BR/>
<SUP>7</SUP> Very serious imprecision: The 95% CI of the point estimate of the trial includes appreciable risk of adverse events for antibiotics over placebo with no significant differences between interventions.</P>

<SUP>1</SUP> No serious limitations: Four of the six trials in this comparison had limitations in reporting outcomes for some participants but a sensitivity analysis did not appreciably alter the results<BR/>
<SUP>2</SUP> Serious inconsistency: I squared for the pooled data from six trials was 83% but could be partially explained by subgroup analyses of adults and children and by culture-confirmed versus unconfirmed diagnosis of Shigella dysentery and resultant sensitivity patterns. The one trial in adults showed that a fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin) was superior (no imprecision) to a beta-lactam (ampicillin) when sensitivity of the Shigella isolates was 100% for the former and 43% for the latter . Homogenous data (I squared 0%) from two trials in children showed that beta-lactams (ampicillin and intra-muscular ceftriaxone) were superior to fluoroquinolones (nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin) when &gt;90% of participants had culture-confirmed Shigella dysentery with 100% sensitivity to the antibiotic used (no imprecision). <BR/>
<SUP>3</SUP> No serious indirectness: The six trials included children and adults and only two excluded severely malnourished children. The fluoroquinolones used included nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin and the macrolides used included ampicillin, ceftriaxone and pivmecillinam.<BR/>

<SUP>6</SUP> Serious inconsistency: The I squared for the pooled data was 63% and could not explained by subgroup analyses.<BR/>

<P>
<B>Blinding:</B>
<BR/>Those recruiting and assigning participants, those administering the intervention, and those assessing the outcomes, must all be blind to the allocated group; the administered drugs have to be identical or a double dummy technique has to be used. Liquid medications have to be in similar looking bottles, identical in shape and weight; the medications must themselves be similar in colour and flavour.</P>

<P>Entry criteria can be clinical dysentery, i.e. acute onset frequent loose stools with blood or mucus or both lasting for less than 72 hours and at least 3 stools per day. Other features, such as fever and tenesmus at presentation, have to be recorded but need not be necessary for inclusion into study.</P>
<P>If it is possible to presumptively or decisively detect Shigella in stool before inclusion into study, it should be done. Real-time PCR is a rapid but expensive method to diagnose Shigella early (<LINK REF="STD-Legros-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Legros 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Sample size: </B>
<BR/>(See <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>). Age group: trials should be separately done for adults and children (less than 15 years of age) or at least presented separately if they are in the same trial. In children, infants must be a separate group.</P>
<P>Setting: in- or out-patients. The number of participants, if hospitalized for standardization of administration of the interventions, have to be reported separately from those hospitalized due to complications.</P>

<P>Once patients are randomized into the treatment groups, they should not be removed until final analysis.

The data have to be presented according to the severity of illness the patients presented with.</P>
<P>Antibiotic sensitivity patterns have to be reported for all antibiotics studied and in all groups</P>
<P>Response to treatment stratified by in vitro antibiotic sensitivity also needs to be reported</P>
