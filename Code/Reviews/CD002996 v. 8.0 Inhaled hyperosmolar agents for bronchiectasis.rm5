Thank you.20/12/2013&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monday, 25 November 2013&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Steve and Anna,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have had a look at the first outcome in the first comparison (change in SGRQ) and note that there is a small short cross-over study, and two larger and longer parallel group trials. I have been able to check that the data entered from Bilton 2013 matches the 95% CIs reported in the paper, but I would love to know how you derived the SE for the GIV analysis from the Goldman trial. There are not details in the methods or results, so this is not currently transparent. Also I could not find any results for the 12 months NCT trial, so cannot check the data entry. What was the data source and how did you derive the SE for this one too?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can you furnish me with further details of the methods used and the sources of the data for this review? We need to add both to the reporting of methods and results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Steve has discussed above with CJC. 7 Dec 2013&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Emma W notes 01/11/2013&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for submitting your update. I made quite a few copy editing type changes and moved the order of the SGRQ reporting round quiet a bit as it jumped around - some of these are in tracked changes but I accepted some for clarity. A major comment is the abstract - the background is too long and detailed, but there is hardly any information about the included studies. Can you look at the abstract checklist here&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;http://airways.cochrane.org/sites/airways.cochrane.org/files/uploads/MECIR%20abstract%20checklist.pdf and make sure evertyhing on there is covered.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Other minor points listed below: Hi Emma we hope this is OK now for you. Please could you let me know what you think. Steve&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Background - &lt;/b&gt;There seems to be a switch between the 2 units molarity (I assume) and percentages which is confusing &amp;quot;The first documented use of such a strategy was in 1978 using nebulised 1.21 M saline (&lt;a link_type=&quot;REFERENCE&quot; href=&quot;Pavia 1978&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Pavia 1978&lt;/a&gt;). Since then concentrations from 3 to 14.4% (&lt;a link_type=&quot;REFERENCE&quot; href=&quot;Daviskas 1996&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Daviskas 1996&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a link_type=&quot;REFERENCE&quot; href=&quot;Robinson 1997&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Robinson 1997&lt;/a&gt;) have been used in various studies.&amp;quot; Can you chose whichever is the most clinically relevant and convert or present both. We have looked at this and hope this has now been fixed (Steve and Iain)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Report the results in the same order as the outcomes Thank you, There appears to be a mismatch because there are no forest plots for the first few outcomes it was not possible to enter data and we are referring to the analyses reported by the authors &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the median time to exacerbation was not a pre-specified outcome - what is the relative importance of this outcome compared to other outcomes? Are you sure it should be there - can you make it clear in the review if you decide to keep it in. What is the risk of selective reporting? Did they record the number of people experiencing one or more exacerbations and chose not to report it for some reason? Yes we took the view that as exacerbations is such an important outcome in this review it was clinically important to include information on 'median time to exacerbation' as it was available to the review in that format. In my view it is not an issue of selective reporting in the trial. We have added a couple of lines to acknowledge that this and antibiotics for exacerbations were so closely related to exacerbations that we feel on balance that it is clinically important to include this information&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;again course of antibiotics was not an outcome. Should it be retrospectively added? Or are you taking it as an indication of an exacerbation, in which case make it explicit Please see point immediately above&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quality of life&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;at Airways we have been advised not to confuse quality of life and health status before, so recommend removal of the term 'health status' Many thanks - I think it is now OK&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Suggest reporting the total score first and domains afterwards if necessary to report them and edited that section Thanks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Suggest delete the part about statistical agreement I agree! This has been re-worded to include the estimate of heterogeneity, but without comment on its meaning which might not be much,given the size of the studies. Anna&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Benoor 'data'. If it is that unclear what the reduction relates to, it is safer to say it could not be used, in my opinion. Could they be contacted and did they respond? Needs to be made clearer The abstract does refer to a comparison with placebo. I have removed the p-values as these are not informative. I still think that their qualitative findings are important, but the lakc of data is also important. Text amended Anna&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mortality - no data reported - assume no deaths? Can you confirm and edit text if necessary. Deaths were reported in Bilton 2013 only, and these are now included, Anna&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Data and analysis - &lt;/b&gt;I turned off a few totals where there was only one study contributing data to a particular forest plot in comparison 1, can you do same for comparison 3 Many thanks we have now done so. Steve&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Characteristics of included studies.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;few strange typos, highlighted, please check I think these are now OK. Steve&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;need to add finding for one or more studies, again, highlighted I think these are now OK. Steve&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;in a few places there were extra returns which have arrived because of copy and pasting - think I got most of them, but please double check I think these are now OK. Steve&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;17 Jan 06&lt;br&gt;Thanks for seeing to this Toby. I have made a further small change to the conclusions in the main text so that it accords better with the abstract conclusion.&lt;br&gt;This is now ready for submission.&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;br&gt;CJC Edit jan 2006&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors' Contribution ok&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's new: ****Please provide a short summary of the new studies found and any changes in results and conclusions here.****&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL: DONE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives: unchanged&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References: done by Liz&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of included studies: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaview Labels: % predicted clarified in labels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsis: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract: We do not usually report single study outcomes in the abstract, let alone non randomised studies, so I have cut out the latter.&lt;br&gt;[ &amp;quot;Two other non-randomised studies indicated that a single-dose administration of mannitol led to short term improvement in mucociliary clearance, and showed that less mucus retention was still observable 24 hours after dosing in one study. In a third study of mannitol administered once daily over 12 days (open label) an improvement in health status persisted for 7 days after cessation of treatment.&amp;quot;]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Tenses changed as no pooling was actually carried out in the review. ***Please update outcome section of description of studies to include Goldman outcomes******&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: *** Please report the DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RESULTS IN THE TWO ARMS OF THE NEW STUDY as a difference with 95% CI, not just whether each arm showed a significant change from baseline. Also the difference in Leung funcion needs a CI. This paragraph needs a re-write please**** This data is presented in the Forest plots and one domain seems to achieve significance. Is this in accord with the abstract? At present the abstract results and the main text do not tie up, and the text does not accord with the Forest plots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL: DATA WERE EXTRACTED AND CONVERTED FROM WITHIN GROUP STATS TESTS OF SIGNIFICANCE TO CHANGE AND ASSOCIATED SE ESTIMATED FROM THE P VALUES. I DID NOT REPORT THE DATA FROM THE ANALYSES ORIGINIALLY BECAUSE THEY WERE FROM A SINGLE STUDY IN EACH CASE. I HAVE AMENDED THE PARAGRAPHS HERE TO REFLECT YOUR COMMENT RE REPORTING OF DATA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion: Limitations in the results are well reported here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL: FINE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Too strong to say evidence for Mannitol is accumulating! I have amended this to tone it down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL: FINE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spellchecked: done&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next action: Back to authors please for attention to areas with asterisks above.&lt;br&gt;Thanks for the hard work on this update.&lt;br&gt;Chris Cates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;br&gt;SS section and refs checked &amp;amp; amended 04/01/2005 Liz&lt;br&gt;***********&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.3 Beta&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.3&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.1&lt;br&gt;I agree that there is no evidence that mucus retention does cause accelerated decline in lung function and have omitted the suggestion that it does. I have expanded the synopsis/background to include the rationale for hyperosmolar treatments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Young's syndrome was probably caused by Hg, I agree not synonymous with mercury poisoning &amp;amp; have omitted the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As there was only one prospectively determined outcome measure, I made this singular not pleural.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I rewrote the &amp;quot;Description of Studies&amp;quot; - I hope, to clarify it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have expanded &amp;quot;Method. quality...&amp;quot; at your suggestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &amp;quot;Reults&amp;quot; section I added &amp;quot;inspiratory manoevers&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;cough.&amp;quot; I also included the raw data, as suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I only found one study to include, with no excluded studies. The review returned to me states that there was one excluded study, but this was not referenced. Have I missed something? I have rewritten stating one study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The text of the study states the mannitol dose to be 320 mg (although the abstract states &amp;quot;approximately 300 mg&amp;quot;) - I use the figure of 320.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike Greenstone's name &amp;amp; details appear nowhere in the review yet - I guess you will see to this.&lt;br&gt;Old title: *Inhaled hyperosmolar agents for bronchiectasis UPDATE (WITH PW _ DON'T NEED PEER REVIEW AS NO CHANGE 03122003)&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2014-05-09 13:36:00 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Emma Welsh" REVIEW_NO="IHA-BRO" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.2.7 " REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="8.0">

<TITLE MODIFIED="2008-07-28 16:35:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">Inhaled hyperosmolar agents for bronchiectasis</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-04-02 14:18:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We wanted to know if inhaled hyperosmolar agents - treatments which help people cough up sputum - may be helpful for people with bronchiectasis. We only included trials on people who had bronchiectasis and who did not have cystic fibrosis. Therefore we are unable to draw any conclusions for people with cystic fibrosis.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Bronchiectasis is a lung condition that usually develops after a series of lung problems (such as childhood infections, problems in the lung structure, tuberculosis, and cystic fibrosis). A lot of mucus (phlegm) collects in the lungs, causing discomfort and the need to cough it up. The phlegm also collects bacteria, which can add to breathing difficulties and make people very ill by causing recurring lung infections that are difficult to clear with antibiotics. Breathing in (inhaling) hypertonic saline (salt solutions with a greater salt content than blood) liquids may help clear this mucus, as may the drug mannitol (inhaled in dry powder form). This is because the concentrated salt or sugar (mannitol) draws water into the mucus in the lung and makes it thinner and easier to cough out.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We found 11 randomised controlled trials on 1021 participants that compared inhaled hyperosmolar agents versus no mucolytic treatment. Five studies compared inhaled mannitol versus placebo (with a total of 883 participants) and two very small studies (with a total of just 25 participants) compared inhaled mannitol with no treatment. We also found four studies (with a total of 113 participants) that compared hypertonic saline with isotonic (normal) saline.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>For the comparison between mannitol and placebo only one study (a 12-month trial with 461 participants) provided information on the number of people who had an exacerbation (or flare up) over the course of a year. This study showed that people who were treated with mannitol had 8% fewer exacerbations on average compared with placebo. Overall, we felt the quality of this evidence was moderate and new trials would be likely to change either how effective we think the treatment is or how confident we are about it.</P>
<P>Three trials assessed the effect of mannitol on health-related quality of life, and again the quality of the evidence was rated as moderate. An analysis of adverse events data, also based on moderate quality evidence, revealed no difference between mannitol and placebo</P>
<P>The trials comparing hypertonic saline with isotonic saline had conflicting results for most of the outcomes of interest. Because we were unable to combine the data, it is not possible to draw robust conclusions for this comparison and judgments should be reserved until further data are available. Our analysis of adverse events between hypertonic saline versus isotonic saline showed no significant difference however this was based on a single study and the quality of the evidence was moderate.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Details of how the patients in the trials were allocated to receive mannitol or not was clearly described in only one of the studies, and similarly only one of the hypertonic saline versus isotonic saline studies provided this information. The general lack of information on this point was considered carefully in the review in relation to our level of uncertainty in interpreting the results. Taking this into account, the quality of evidence was generally regarded as moderate both for the mannitol and hypertonic saline studies.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2014-05-09 13:36:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-03-31 17:58:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Mucus retention in the lungs is a prominent feature of bronchiectasis. The stagnant mucus becomes chronically colonised with bacteria, which elicit a host neutrophilic response. This fails to eliminate the bacteria, and the large concentration of host-derived protease may contribute to the airway damage. The sensation of retained mucus is itself a cause of suffering, and the failure to maintain airway sterility probably contributes to the frequent respiratory infections experienced by many patients.</P>
<P>Hypertonic saline inhalation is known to accelerate tracheobronchial clearance in many conditions, probably by inducing a liquid flux into the airway surface, which alters mucus rheology in a way favourable to mucociliary clearance. Inhaled dry powder mannitol has a similar effect. Such agents are an attractive approach to the problem of mucostasis, and deserve further clinical evaluation.</P>

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-04-02 14:17:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria of the review (1021 participants).</P>
<P>Five studies on 833 participants compared inhaled mannitol with placebo but poor outcome reporting meant we could pool very little data and most outcomes were reported by only one study. One 12-month trial on 461 participants provided results for exacerbations and demonstrated an advantage for mannitol in terms of time to first exacerbation (median time to exacerbation 165 versus 124 days for mannitol and placebo respectively (hazard ratio (HR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63 to 0.96, P = 0.022) and number of days on antibiotics for bronchiectasis exacerbations was significantly better with mannitol (risk ratio (RR) 0.76, 95%CI 0.58 to 1.00, P = 0.0496). However, exacerbation rate per year was not significantly different between mannitol and placebo (RR 0.92 95% CI 0.78 to 1.08). The quality of this evidence was rated as moderate. There was also an indication, from only three trials, again based on moderate quality evidence, that mannitol improves health-related quality of life (mean difference (MD) -2.05; 95% CI -3.69 to -0.40). An analysis of adverse events data, also based on moderate quality evidence, revealed no difference between mannitol and placebo (OR 0.96; 95% CI 0.61 to 1.51). Two additional small trials on 25 participants compared mannitol versus no treatment and the data from these studies were inconclusive.</P>
<P>Four studies (combined N = 113) compared hypertonic saline versus isotonic saline. On most outcomes there were conflicting results and the opportunities for the statistical aggregation of data from studies was very limited. It is not possible to draw robust conclusions for this comparison and judgments should be reserved until further data are available.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-04-02 14:17:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>There is an indication from a single, large, unpublished study that inhaled mannitol increases time to first exacerbation in patients with bronchiectasis. In patients with near normal lung function, spirometry does not change dramatically with mannitol and adverse events are not more frequent than placebo. Further investigation is required in a patient population with impaired lung function.</P>
<P>It is not possible to draw firm conclusions regarding the effect of nebulised hypertonic saline due to significant differences in the methodology, patient groups, and findings amongst the limited data available. The data suggest that it is unlikely to have benefit over isotonic saline in patients with milder disease, and hence future studies should test its use in those with more severe disease</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-05-09 13:36:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>Bronchiectasis is a disorder of the lungs characterised by irreversible dilatation of the bronchi. It is the end result of a number of different insults to the lungs. These include inherited diseases of the lungs&#8217; defence mechanisms, such as ciliary dyskinesia and primary immunodeficiencies, congential structural lung abnormalities and acquired problems, such as the aftermath of tuberculosis or childhood respiratory infection, large airway obstruction and chronic inflammatory conditions (for example, rheumatoid arthritis). Many cases of bronchiectasis are idiopathic (<LINK REF="REF-Anwar-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anwar 2013</LINK>). Cystic fibrosis is the cause of the majority of cases of severe bronchiectasis (<LINK REF="REF-Sly-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sly 2013</LINK>), however the management of cystic fibrosis-related bronchiectasis is considered separately in other reviews.</P>
<P>Impaired lung defences, changes in mucus consistency and mechanical obstruction of the bronchi all lead to a higher risk of lung infection and associated damage and dilatation of the bronchi. This dilatation in turn promotes mucus retention, leading to further and more protracted pulmonary infection and hence, a vicious cycle of disease progression.</P>
<P>The true population prevalence of bronchiectasis is unknown (<LINK REF="REF-Frey-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frey 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shoemark-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shoemark 2007</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Weycker-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weycker 2005</LINK> suggested the prevalence could be as high as 270 cases per 100,000 in the over 75s. Bronchiectasis frequently complicates other respiratory diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) where its presence is an independent predictor of mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Martinez-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martinez 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Diagnosis is by high resolution computed tomography of the thorax (<LINK REF="REF-Bonavita-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bonavita 2012</LINK>) in patients with symptoms of chronic or recurrent pulmonary suppuration.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-04-02 16:44:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>Inhaled hyperosmolar agents are used in conditions, such as non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis, COPD and asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Daviskas-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daviskas 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Elkins-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elkins 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pavia-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pavia 1978</LINK>). The aim of treatment is to facilitate tracheo-bronchial mucous clearance. The first documented use of such a strategy was in 1978 using nebulised 1.21 M saline (approximately 7% saline) (<LINK REF="REF-Pavia-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pavia 1978</LINK>). Since then concentrations from 3% to 14.4% (<LINK REF="REF-Daviskas-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daviskas 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robinson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 1997</LINK>) have been used in various studies. Various devices have been used to drive the nebulisation, from air-driven small-volume chambers, as typically used for delivering nebulised bronchodilators in asthma, through to low- and high-volume ultrasonic devices. The nebulisation process can be somewhat cumbersome and time consuming. Inhaled dry powder mannitol, which was developed initially as a bronchial challenge agent in asthma, is being increasingly used as an alternative. It is delivered from capsules via a purpose-designed inhaler device.</P>
<P>National guidelines on the diagnosis and management of bronchiectasis from several countries (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-TSANZ-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">TSANZ 2010</LINK>) generally ignore hyperosmolar agents on the grounds of insufficient evidence to make a positive recommendation. Anecdotally however hyperosmolar agents, particularly hypertonic saline, are increasingly prescribed in clinical practice.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-04-02 14:24:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>The key clinical feature of bronchiectasis is chronic mucus hypersecretion, mucus retention or both. These are central to the vicious cycle of disease progression described above, causing the characteristic chronic productive cough and predisposing to recurrent lower respiratory tract infections. One of the central tenets of treatment for bronchiectasis is therefore the application of strategies to facilitate mucus clearance. This includes chest clearance manoeuvres instigated and taught by specialist respiratory physiotherapists (<LINK REF="REF-Pasteur-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pasteur 2010</LINK>). Such clearance is however hindered both by the volume but also the viscosity of the sputum.</P>
<P>Whilst the specific clinically relevant mechanism has not been elucidated, hyperosmolar agents are used principally to reduce sputum viscosity and therefore ease chest clearance. When inhaled they are deposited in the airway, and the consequence of their hyperosmolarity in theory is that they draw fluid from the airway epithelium onto the mucosal surface and hence into contact with the mucous (<LINK REF="REF-Wills-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wills 2006</LINK>). This then has the effect of both loosening the mucous and making it less viscous (<LINK REF="REF-Shibuya-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shibuya 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wills-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wills 1997</LINK>) which (particularly when used together with effective chest clearance techniques) will facilitate expectoration (<LINK REF="STD-Daviskas-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Daviskas 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kellett-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kellett 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>One potential disadvantage of such agents occurs where there might be an asthmatic element to the bronchiectasis, such as in allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Inhaled hyperosmolar agents also have the effect of desiccating airway inflammatory cells, disrupting the cell membrane and causing release of bronchoconstricting and pro-inflammatory mediators, such as histamine and leukotrienes. This may cause significant acute bronchoconstriction, and hence it is recommended that a supervised test dose be administered with spirometry or peak expiratory flow (PEF) measurements before and after (<LINK REF="REF-Pasteur-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pasteur 2010</LINK>). Those at risk of bronchial hyperresponsiveness should be pre-treated with an inhaled bronchodilator (<LINK REF="REF-Pasteur-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pasteur 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Potential non-mucolytic mechanisms for the benefit of hypertonic saline could arise from its relative pro- and anti-inflammatory effects. Recent <I>in vitro </I>studies suggest that high concentrations of salt induce type 17 helper T lymphocytes, which in turn produce the antibacterial cytokines interleukins 17, 21 and 22 (<LINK REF="REF-Kleinewietfeld-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kleinewietfeld 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wu-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2013</LINK>). It also may also have beneficial antiinflammatory effects by decreasing local interleukin 8 levels (<LINK REF="REF-Reeves-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reeves 2011</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-04-02 16:44:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Clinically bronchiectasis manifests as chronic mucus production, along with a variable amount of airflow limitation. Mucus hypersecretion is a distressing symptom. Mucus plugging (obstruction of small- or medium-sized airways with mucus) can cause breathlessness and hypoxia. Inhaled hyperosmolar agents should in theory draw water into the airways, particularly the airway surface layer of fluid (<LINK REF="REF-Enderby-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Enderby 2007</LINK>). This has the effect of improving ciliary function, of making sputum thinner, more watery and easier to cough out, and of stimulating cough (<LINK REF="REF-Elkins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elkins 2006</LINK>), thus improving mucus clearance and the reducing risk of mucus plugging. If inhaled hyperosmolar agents are able to reduce these effects to a clinically significant degree <I>in vivo</I>, they would be useful drugs in the treatment of non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Inhaled mannitol versus placebo</HEADING>
<P>Five studies (combined N = 883) compared mannitol versus placebo: <LINK REF="STD-Bennoor-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bennoor 2012</LINK> (50 participants), <LINK REF="STD-Chandra-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Chandra 2008</LINK> (12 participants), <LINK REF="STD-Bilton-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bilton 2013</LINK> (362 participants randomised and 343 analysed), <LINK REF="STD-Daviskas-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Daviskas 2004</LINK> (17 participants) and <LINK REF="STD-NCT00669331" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00669331</LINK> (461 participants). Only one of the six studies <LINK REF="STD-Daviskas-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Daviskas 2004</LINK> was a cross-over design and <LINK REF="STD-Bennoor-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bennoor 2012</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Bilton-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bilton 2013</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Chandra-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Chandra 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-NCT00669331" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00669331</LINK> were parallel group trials. Personal communication with Dr Bilton confirmed that people on placebo in <LINK REF="STD-NCT00669331" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00669331</LINK> were given 50 mg of mannitol (intended as a non-therapeutic dose), and there is a possibility that this may have led to conservative estimates of the treatment effects. In most cases the results presented in the trial reports were not in a format that enabled the data to be entered into RevMan for the purposes of meta-analysis and are therefore reported narratively here. The quality of evidence for this comparison where GRADE assessments were applied was moderate (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Exacerbations</HEADING>
<P>The only data available from the included trials for this outcome were provided by <LINK REF="STD-NCT00669331" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00669331</LINK>, a C trial with 461 participants, and reported as exacerbation rate per year. There was an 8% reduction (risk ratio (RR) 0.92 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 1.08) in favour of mannitol, however this was not significant. These data for this study are unpublished and were presented at the European Respiratory Society Conference 2013.</P>
<P>However, the median time to first exacerbation was significantly different between the two groups (median: 165 versus 124 days for mannitol and placebo respectively (hazard ratio (HR) 0.78, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.96, P = 0.022, <LINK REF="STD-NCT00669331" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00669331</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was also a significant difference in favour of mannitol (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.00, P = 0.0496) for the number of days on antibiotics for pulmonary exacerbations (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00669331" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00669331</LINK>). We acknowledge that time to first exacerbation and antibiotics for pulmonary exacerbations, per se, were not prespecified in our planned outcomes for this review. However, we are including this additional information as these outcomes are so very closely linked to our prespecified outcome of exacerbations.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Hospital admissions</HEADING>
<P>Data for this outcome were provided by one trial on 461 participants (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00669331" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00669331</LINK>), as hospitalisations due to pulmonary exacerbations. There was no significant difference between the two groups (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.09, P = 0.093).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Mortality</HEADING>
<P>Only one study reported deaths (<LINK REF="STD-Bilton-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bilton 2013</LINK>). They reported 2/241 deaths in the mannitol-treated group, but stated that they were not related to study treatment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Health-related quality of life</HEADING>
<P>Three trials on 821 participants reported St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) data (<LINK REF="STD-Bilton-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bilton 2013</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Daviskas-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Daviskas 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-NCT00669331" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00669331</LINK>). The direction of scaling on the SGRQ indicates that a score of 100 represents worst possible quality of life and zero represents best possible quality of life. There was a significant difference in favour of mannitol on SGRQ total scores (mean difference (MD) -2.05; 95% CI -3.69 to -0.40 <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). There were considerable differences in duration of the three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bilton-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bilton 2013</LINK> 12 weeks, <LINK REF="STD-Daviskas-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Daviskas 2004</LINK> two weeks and <LINK REF="STD-NCT00669331" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00669331</LINK> 52 weeks), but low heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> very near zero). The difference between the two groups is less than four points which is generally regarded as the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) for SGRQ total scores in COPD studies (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2005</LINK>) and the lower confidence limit is smaller than that threshold (-3.69); whether this MCID may also hold for bronchiectasis studies is unclear.</P>
<P>In separate analyses of component scores, data were available from only <LINK REF="STD-Bilton-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bilton 2013</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Daviskas-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Daviskas 2004</LINK>. There were no significant differences between mannitol versus placebo on symptoms component (MD -1.42; 95% CI -5.12 to 2.28 <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>) and activity component (MD -0.84; 95% CI -3.95 to 2.28 <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>); however there was a significant difference in favour of mannitol on impact component scores (MD -3.16; 95% CI -5.77 to -0.55 <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). In view of the high level of heterogeneity (I = 58%) on the impact component scores analysis we used a random-effects model and on that basis the significant difference was not observed (MD -2.21; 95% CI -5.92 to 1.49 <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>); we therefore conclude that the significant effect on impact scores reported in <LINK REF="REF-Wills-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wills 2006</LINK> should be viewed with caution in light of the data now available from <LINK REF="STD-Bilton-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bilton 2013</LINK>.</P>
<P>However, in a recent parallel group study of 50 patients with stable bronchiectasis <LINK REF="STD-Bennoor-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bennoor 2012</LINK> reported a significant reduction from baseline in SGRQ symptom scores and impact scores but did not provide any summary data. There was no difference between the two groups with respect to SGRQ activity scores. With regard to total SGRQ scores and dyspnoea scores, there was a significant advantage in favour of mannitol (P &lt; 0.001). These results were not reported in a format that enabled us to include the study in the meta-analyses.</P>

<P>At 12 weeks, in <LINK REF="STD-Bilton-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bilton 2013</LINK>, there was no significant difference between mannitol versus placebo with respect to FVC (MD 0.04; 95% CI -0.15 to 0.23 <LINK REF="CMP-001.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.14</LINK>) or FEF25-75 ((MD 0.07; 95% CI -0.09 to 0.23 <LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>).

The latter suggests dose response effects (with 160, 320 and 480 mg mannitol) in mucus clearance from the whole right lung when compared to no treatment over 75 minutes; each of the three doses produced significantly more mucus clearance at that time point versus a no treatment condition, with 480 mg producing significantly more mucus clearance than 160 mg (P &lt; 0.0001). The difference between treatment and no treatment was: 160 mg condition: 12.0% mean clearance P &lt; 0.01, 320 mg condition: 16.8% mean clearance P &lt; 0.001 and 480 mg condition: 21.9% mean clearance P &lt; 0.001).</P>

At this stage, in view of the paucity of data, these impressions are in need of further clarification with larger studies and serve largely as hypotheses for further investigations.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-04-02 16:44:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>In one relatively large trial, mannitol significantly extended the time to first bronchiectasis exacerbation from just over four months to around five and a half months. This translated into a trend towards a reduction in annual exacerbations with mannitol but did not reach conventional significance. The number of days patients spent taking antibiotics for exacerbations of bronchiectasis was also significantly reduced, though overall use of courses of antibiotics was probably unchanged.</P>
<P>The effect of mannitol on sputum volume is unclear. <LINK REF="STD-Bilton-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bilton 2013</LINK> reported a reduction in sputum volume in the placebo group, whereas sputum production was maintained in the mannitol group. <LINK REF="STD-Bennoor-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bennoor 2012</LINK> reported no difference in sputum production between the mannitol and placebo arms. The clinical implications of sputum production differ in different patients. A reduction in expectorated sputum volume may reflect either a reduction in chronic bronchial sepsis or increased infection due to retained secretions. For some, but not all, patients sputum expectoration is a troubling symptom and changes in sputum expectoration need interpreting in this light.</P>
<P>Despite changes in the number of exacerbations, respiratory related quality of life was not clinically improved in those taking mannitol. These were, by and large, patients with long standing chronic illness and quality of life was not systematically recorded during exacerbations so this may be due to the timing of quality of life assessments. Alternatively it may be that such patients have adapted their lifestyles so that chest exacerbations do not dramatically impair their quality of life. Quality of life was generally assessed by means of the SGRQ. This includes questions on cough. The relationship between hyperosmolar therapy and cough may be complex. Hyperosmolar agents are directly irritant to the lungs and thus stimulate coughing in the short term, worsening some symptom elements of the SGRQ. However, they may also change the characteristics of the cough. Consequent thinner mucus might make cough less painful or embarrassing and thus improve these elements of the SGRQ and improved mucus clearance may reduce overall cough in the medium or long term. It is possible that quality of life is being modified by these therapies without overall improvement. Individual SGRQ question level data were not available.</P>
<P>On the whole, no dramatic effects of mannitol on lung function were noted. Potentially mannitol could have improved spirometry by reducing the amount of mucus plugging in the small airways (and thus increasing the effective small airway diameter). Mannitol can trigger bronchoconstriction so a detrimental effect on spirometry was also possible. With the exception of <LINK REF="STD-NCT00669331" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00669331</LINK>, patients in the included trials were selected as having relatively normal spirometry before inclusion as well as not having a large reduction in spirometry during a mannitol provocation test so large changes in spirometry would be surprising in these groups. A significant effect (good or bad) in those with abnormal baseline spirometry is not excluded by these studies. Spirometric data have not yet been reported for <LINK REF="STD-NCT00669331" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00669331</LINK>, though significant bronchospasm was not observed as an adverse outcome.</P>
<P>Inhaled mannitol did not appear to cause many adverse events. Lung function did not decrease as might have been expected and <LINK REF="STD-Bilton-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bilton 2013</LINK> reported no significant difference in the rates of adverse events between mannitol and placebo. <LINK REF="STD-Bennoor-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bennoor 2012</LINK> described a number of symptoms in patients taking mannitol but severity and causality were unclear.</P>
<P>Two very small studies (<LINK REF="STD-Daviskas-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Daviskas 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Daviskas-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Daviskas 2008</LINK>) looked at mannitol against no treatment. In one (<LINK REF="STD-Daviskas-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Daviskas 2008</LINK>), lung function was reported as unchanged, though the methodology used (radioisotope deposition not spirometry) was unusual. Both studies suggested a dose response effect with greater radioisotope evidence of sputum movement with increasing doses of mannitol. The small scale, preliminary nature of these studies should be noted, along with their use of a measurement technique not widely used in clinical practice.</P>
<P>Two of the four included studies that investigated the use of nebulised hypertonic versus isotonic saline (<LINK REF="STD-Kellet-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kellet 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nicolson-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Nicolson 2012</LINK>) contributed data on exacerbation rates, antibiotic use and/or hospitalisations. The studies of <LINK REF="STD-Bradley-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Bradley 2011</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kellett-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kellett 2005</LINK> were too short to assess an effect on exacerbation frequency, hospitalisations or antibiotic use, the former with a four-week treatment period, and the latter comparing the effect of four different single-dose treatment regimens.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Nicolson-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Nicolson 2012</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kellet-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kellet 2011</LINK> studies provide contrasting results. Whilst Nicholson found that treatment with both isotonic and hypertonic saline resulted in a very large drop in exacerbation frequency over the year of the study, there was no difference between the treatments. Likewise, there were no differences in number or length of hospital admissions. In contrast <LINK REF="STD-Kellet-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kellet 2011</LINK> reported a statistically significant and clinically important reduction in exacerbations in the hypertonic saline group (annualised exacerbation rate 2.1 for hypertonic saline, 4.9 for isotonic saline), with a comparable reduction in use of antibiotics (annualised rate 2.4) versus isotonic saline (5.4). As noted below, these differences in impact between the two studies were also seen on many other shared outcomes, and likely to be due at least in part to significant methodological differences between the studies.</P>
<P>The strong impact of both treatments on outcomes in the Nicholson study merits further consideration. The pre-study exacerbation rate data were collected retrospectively and so relied presumably on patient recall. To patients the usual definition of an exacerbation would likely include the requirement for antibiotics and/or hospital admission, and probably last for more than a day. It is not possible therefore to directly relate this rate to the multiple definitions applied prospectively during the study period (i.e. the retrospective baseline definition of exacerbation was not the same as any of the prospective definitions). Nevertheless, the reported rates certainly imply a large benefit of study participation in both groups, also reflected in the very low requirement for antibiotics (median 0.5 courses per year in the isotonic saline group; 1.0 per year in the hypertonic saline group). The median &#8220;pre-study&#8221; exacerbation rate was five per annum, but during the study there were only a median one to two &#8220;exacerbation days requiring antibiotics&#8221; for the group as a whole. This fairly dramatic finding (and the similar findings in this study relating to quality of life as discussed below) could be explained by the benefit that could be obtained by participating in a study which provides relatively frequent medical review, and possibly more importantly the potential for increased self-awareness related to the disease process. Volunteers were all nebulising twice daily and filling in daily diaries reporting their symptoms, and 85% were using chest clearance techniques. It is also possible that retrospective recall overestimates exacerbation rate. The third potential contributing issue (applicable to all studies here) is that isotonic saline in fact is not really a placebo in this context and may have benefits by increasing airway hydration, with further benefit possibly conferred by the respiratory manoeuvres that participants were instructed to undertake during nebulisation. The Nicholson paper also did not select patients on the basis of features that could theoretically confer a differential benefit of hypertonic saline, such as frequent exacerbators or those with large volumes of sticky sputum. It is therefore possible that any potential signal due to &#8220;between-treatment&#8221; difference was overwhelmed by the benefit of study participation. One interesting finding of the Nicholson study was that at the end of the study far more patients in the hypertonic saline group chose to stay on their study medication long term than in the isotonic saline group. The exact numbers are not clear; it is stated in the results that six chose to remain on isotonic saline, whereas 23 stayed on hypertonic saline, but this latter is likely to be a typographical error as only 20 participants used hypertonic saline during the trial, and in the discussion section &#8220;nearly three-quarters&#8221; of the group were said to have remained on this treatment.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Kellet-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kellet 2011</LINK> study, which demonstrated significant benefits for hypertonic saline, is described as single blind, as the study medicines were presented in specific ampoules identifiable to the study team. In addition the adequacy of patient-blinding was not checked (as it was in the Nicholson study), and it seems very likely that volunteers could taste a clear difference between 7% and 0.9% saline, especially as all patients had a test dose of hypertonic saline at the beginning of the study, and with the cross-over design all patients received both treatments allowing direct comparison during the study. Another difference between the <LINK REF="STD-Nicolson-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Nicolson 2012</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kellet-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kellet 2011</LINK> studies was that the former gave nebulised saline twice daily, the latter once only. The definition of exacerbation was different in the <LINK REF="STD-Kellet-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kellet 2011</LINK> study and required contact with a primary or secondary care physician for a deterioration in bronchiectasis-related symptoms. Again, retrospective baseline exacerbation rate data were used, but not required for the primary treatment comparison because of the cross-over design. It is also worth noting that this study excluded patients colonised with <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I>, for unexplained reasons. Such patients represent a subgroup in bronchiectasis with poor outcomes <LINK REF="REF-Evans-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Martinez-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martinez 2007</LINK>, and who might potentially benefit from mucolytic therapy, so their exclusion here is difficult to explain.</P>
<P>Nicholson and colleagues assessed health-related quality of life using the general respiratory SGRQ and cough-specific LCQ. As for exacerbations, a large clinically relevant improvement in all domains of both measures occurred during the study with both strengths of saline, with no difference between treatment groups. On the other hand, <LINK REF="STD-Kellet-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kellet 2011</LINK> reported statistically and clinically significant improvements in SGRQ total scores and symptom and impact domains. Potential explanations for this are discussed above.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Bradley-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Bradley 2011</LINK> reported a statistically and clinically relevant improvement in the physical domain of the LCQ with hypertonic versus isotonic saline, as well as in the respiratory symptoms domain of the QOL-B, although this latter quality of life questionnaire has not been validated and the minimal important difference is not known. However, multiple comparisons were performed in a small number of participants in this feasibility study, with no adjustment for multiple testing, hence the probability of these being false-positive findings is not known.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Nicolson-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Nicolson 2012</LINK> study, mean lung function was very good at baseline, for example mean FEV1 was 80% predicted in the isotonic saline group and 85% predicted in the hypertonic saline group, which may have lead to a ceiling effect explaining the minimal, although statistically significant, 90 mL improvement in both groups. No differences were seen between groups. Again a contrast is provided by the <LINK REF="STD-Kellet-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kellet 2011</LINK> study, which investigated the use of hypertonic saline in bronchiectasis patients with more severe disease than Nicholson at least in terms of lung function, with mean FEV1 66% predicted. This paper reports a significant benefit of hypertonic over isotonic saline, with a 15% improvement in FEV1 following three months treatment with the former compared to a 2% improvement with the latter, with a similar-sized effect difference on FVC also.</P>
<P>The limited data available from the <LINK REF="STD-Bradley-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Bradley 2011</LINK> abstract do not enable the size of effect on FEV1 to be calculated, nor whether the change was statistically significant, whilst <LINK REF="STD-Kellett-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kellett 2005</LINK> reported no improvement in lung function after a single dose of hypertonic saline versus isotonic saline.</P>
<P>No effects on sputum weight or volume were reported in the Nicholson paper, although the frequency of positive sputum cultures in both groups improved over the year of the study, with no between-group difference. <LINK REF="STD-Kellet-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kellet 2011</LINK> reported unquantified benefits of hypertonic over isotonic saline on sputum viscosity and ease of expectoration in the abstract of their article, but no further results are given in the main results section. No meaningful interpretation of the effect of hypertonic saline on sputum is possible from the limited data available from the <LINK REF="STD-Bradley-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Bradley 2011</LINK> abstract.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Kellett-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kellett 2005</LINK> looked at the effect of single dose isotonic or hypertonic saline in combination with chest clearance (active cycle of breathing technique) in patients who specifically reported &#8220;thick, sticky&#8221; sputum, and expectorating small volumes (less than 10 g per day), but who nevertheless had required at least one antibiotic course over the preceding six months. The outcomes of this study were particularly focused on the acute effect of first-dose of saline solutions on sputum parameters, and hence, whilst they provide useful data in this regard, they cannot be extrapolated to longer-term effects. In addition, the study&#8217;s objective was to perform a four-way comparison (the other two treatment schedules were chest clearance alone and nebulised bronchodilator plus chest clearance) and hence the comparison of outcomes between hypertonic and isotonic saline was performed post-hoc, with the variables grouped in multiple ways, and again with no adjustment for multiple-testing. With these qualifications, single dose hypertonic saline use was associated with increase sputum weight, decreased viscosity, and improved ease of expectoration when compared with isotonic saline.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Nicolson-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Nicolson 2012</LINK> study, two patients reported side effects considered potentially due to hypertonic saline; one with transient chest tightness, which was relieved after treatment for an exacerbation, and another with atrial fibrillation which resulted in withdrawal from the study (NB all participants inhaled 200 mcg salbutamol prior to saline nebulisation). There were no adverse reactions noted in the isotonic saline group. <LINK REF="STD-Bradley-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Bradley 2011</LINK> reported no difference in side effects between the hypertonic and isotonic saline treatment groups. Two of the 32 patients screened for the <LINK REF="STD-Kellet-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kellet 2011</LINK> study were excluded because of bronchial hyperresponsiveness to the test dose of hypertonic saline. Adverse events during the study period are not reported.</P>

<P>Whilst the five studies (combined N = 883) comparing mannitol versus placebo provide more clarity in this area than was available in the previous version of this review, the opportunities for the aggregation of data were limited. Data comparing hypertonic saline with isotonic saline were, by comparison, relatively sparse and there were even more obvious limitations for meta-analyses. Over the last seven years since the last update of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Wills-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wills 2006</LINK>), a number of new studies have been published, however one very recent large study comparing mannitol with placebo over a 12-month period <LINK REF="STD-NCT00669331" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00669331</LINK> has yet to be published in full.

The risk of bias for the remaining nine trials was evaluated as unclear as details of the random sequence generation were not described in the trial report. In terms of the blinding of participants and personnel, only three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bilton-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bilton 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kellett-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kellett 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nicolson-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Nicolson 2012</LINK>) were judged to be at low risk of bias (performance bias), and only one of those trials compared mannitol with placebo (or no treatment).</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2014-04-02 16:44:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>The Cochrane Airways Group provides exceptional support in the identification of potentially relevant trials; however, concerns regarding study selection bias or publication bias are an issue in this review as with any other. We are mindful that a failure to identify unpublished trials may lead to an incomplete estimation of hyperosmolar agents. Even though an extensive search of the published literature, without language restrictions, for potentially relevant clinical trials was undertaken using a systematic search strategy to minimise the likelihood of bias, we acknowledge that additional unidentified trials may still be undetected. We note that improvements in the standardisation of reporting would facilitate the opportunities to draw comparisons among trials.</P>

<P>The availability of data in this update is considerable when compared to the previous version of this review <LINK REF="REF-Wills-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wills 2006</LINK> and the number of included studies has increased from two to 11. Whereas the previous review highlighted the paucity of evidence in this area, we now note that five studies (combined N = 883) compared mannitol versus placebo, enabling us to assess the clinical benefits of hyperosmolar agents over periods up to 12 months. Whilst a paucity of evidence remains in relation to some important outcomes, and we note that there is still a need for more information from randomised studies in relation to exacerbations and hospitalisations in particular, the additional nine trials available to this version of the review have provided considerably more clarity than was available hitherto in this important area.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-04-02 16:45:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Inhaled mannitol increases time to infective exacerbation in patients with bronchiectasis, without improving respiratory quality of life. It has a role in reducing exacerbations and antibiotic use in those with normal or mild to moderately impaired spirometry. Its safety has not been studied in patients with severe lung function impairment.</P>
<P>For hypertonic saline, the two full studies published to date that describe chronic dosing and hence could help guide clinical practice have produced conflicting results, which is likely due to their different patient groups and study designs. The magnitude of the effect size in the <LINK REF="STD-Kellet-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kellet 2011</LINK> study on important endpoints including exacerbation rates, antibiotic use, lung function and quality of life suggest that there might be a clinically relevant effect of hypertonic saline in similar patients, despite the methodological concerns arising mainly from the potentially inadequate blinding. On the other hand, the results of <LINK REF="STD-Nicolson-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Nicolson 2012</LINK> suggest that hypertonic saline does not confer any clear benefit over isotonic saline when it is introduced to treatment in those with physiologically mild disease.</P>
<P>Future larger scale studies should focus on targeting those with established disease and poor lung function, whilst addressing the potential bias associate with inadequate blinding.</P>

<P>Larger, more long-term studies into the use of inhaled hyperosmolar agents in bronchiectasis are now starting to appear. Future studies should focus on those with impaired spirometry and consider using health economy important measures such as hospitalisation rate and antibiotic usage. Long-term studies of hyperosmolar agents in patients with early bronchiectasis and relatively normal spirometry are also justified to see if these agents can prevent progression to impaired lung function.</P>

<P/>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Nicolson-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Nicolson 2012</LINK> there were no significant differences between hypertonic saline versus isotonic saline on exacerbations (over 12 months), exacerbations requiring antibiotics, number of exacerbation days or number of exacerbation days requiring antibiotics. Median number of exacerbations (inter-quartile range) were 1 (0 to 4) for isotonic saline and 3 (0 to 6) for hypertonic saline (P = 0.24) .</P>
