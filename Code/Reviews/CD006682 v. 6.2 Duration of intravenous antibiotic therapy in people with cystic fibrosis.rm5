<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We reviewed the evidence about how long intravenous antibiotic treatment (antibiotics given directly into the blood stream) is needed to clear flare ups of chest symptoms in people with cystic fibrosis.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Flare ups of symptoms (exacerbations) in people with cystic fibrosis are treated aggressively to prevent further damage to the lungs. This practice has led to better survival rates for people with cystic fibrosis in recent years. However, there are no clear guidelines on how long treatment with intravenous antibiotics should be to treat these flare ups. Different centres tend to use different treatment regimens. Most centres use 10 or 14 days, extending this to 21 days if there is no improvement in a person's symptoms. This is an update of previously published reviews.</P>
<P>
<B>Search date</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence is current to: 05 May 2016.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We could not find any studies comparing 10 days treatment with 14 days or longer treatment.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>A shorter duration of treatment may be better as these courses of treatment are easier for people to complete. They are also less expensive and cause fewer drug reactions than longer treatments. However, it is not clear if shorter treatment is enough to treat infections adequately. It is also not clear whether shorter treatment results in early recurrence or increased frequency of chest infections. Further research is needed to find the best duration of treatment for exacerbations.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-06-11 14:30:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Respiratory disease is the major cause of mortality and morbidity in cystic fibrosis. Life expectancy of people with cystic fibrosis has increased dramatically in the last 40 years. One of the major reasons for this increase is the mounting use of antibiotics to treat chest exacerbations caused by bacterial infections. The optimal duration of intravenous antibiotic therapy is not clearly defined. Individuals usually receive intravenous antibiotics for 14 days, but treatment may range from 10 to 21 days. A shorter duration of antibiotic treatment risks inadequate clearance of infection which could lead to further lung damage. Prolonged courses of intravenous antibiotics are expensive and inconvenient and the incidence of allergic reactions to antibiotics also increases with prolonged courses. The use of aminoglycosides requires frequent monitoring to avoid some of their side effects. However, some organisms which infect people with cystic fibrosis are known to be multi-resistant to antibiotics, and may require a longer course of treatment. This is an update of previously published reviews.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing different durations of intravenous antibiotic courses for acute respiratory exacerbations in people with CF, either with the same drugs at the same dosage, the same drugs at a different dosage or frequency or different antibiotics altogether, including studies with additional therapeutic agents. </P>

</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There are no clear guidelines on the optimum duration of intravenous antibiotic treatment. Duration of treatment is currently based on unit policies and response to treatment. Shorter duration of treatment should improve quality of life and compliance; result in a reduced incidence of drug reactions; and be less costly. However, this may not be sufficient to clear a chest infection and may result in an early recurrence of an exacerbation. This systematic review identifies the need for a multicentre, randomised controlled trial comparing different durations of intravenous antibiotic treatment as it has important clinical and financial implications.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-06-11 14:33:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-10-06 13:54:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common life-limiting autosomal recessive genetic disorder in Caucasians (<LINK REF="REF-Kosorok-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kosorok 1996</LINK>). Respiratory disease is the major cause of mortality and morbidity in CF (<LINK REF="REF-Penketh-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Penketh 1987</LINK>). About 40 years ago, most people with CF died in their first decade of life. With advances in treatment, life expectancy has increased dramatically since then from a median of two years to a projected median survival of over 50 years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Dodge-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dodge 2007</LINK>). One of the major reasons for this increase in survival is the mounting use of antibiotics to treat chest exacerbations caused by bacterial infections.</P>
<P>The abnormal CF gene causes a combination of increased sodium and defective chloride absorption across the airway epithelium, which in turn causes dehydration and leads to a build up of thick sticky mucus. This accumulates in the lungs and causes chronic pulmonary infections and bronchiectasis. In people with CF, bacterial pathogens are the main causes of respiratory exacerbations (<LINK REF="REF-Petersen-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petersen 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wat-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wat 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>In small children, <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I> (<I>S. aureus</I>) and <I>Haemophilus influenzae </I>(<I>H. influenzae</I>) are the most common organisms isolated and thought to be responsible for chest exacerbations, but pneumococci and sometimes Enterobacteriaceae are also isolated. In older children and adults, the major pathogen is <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> (<I>P. aeruginosa</I>), although the other organisms mentioned above can also be responsible and, in some centres <I>Burkholderia cepacia </I>(<I>B. cepacia) </I>too (<LINK REF="REF-Hodson-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodson 2000a</LINK>).</P>
<P>At birth the lungs of infants with CF are normal, but shortly thereafter many become infected with bacteria (<LINK REF="REF-Accurso-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Accurso 1997</LINK>). Endobronchial infection commonly occurs within the first one to two years of life (<LINK REF="REF-Armstrong-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armstrong 1995</LINK>). The most common organism isolated from the sputum of adults is <I>P. aeruginosa</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Horre-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horre 2004</LINK>), with traditionally 80% of people with CF being infected by 18 years of age (<LINK REF="REF-CF-Foundation-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">CF Foundation 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hodson-2000b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodson 2000b</LINK>). This is no longer the case and chronic colonisation with <I>P. aeruginosa </I>can be prevented or delayed by segregation and aggressive eradication treatment of first isolates (<LINK REF="REF-Hansen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hansen 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stuart-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stuart 2010</LINK>). Prevalence data from the UK indicates a rate of chronic <I>P. aeruginosa</I> infection of 45% in 16 to 19 year olds, riding to a peak of 67% in 28 to 31 year olds (<LINK REF="REF-CF-Trust-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">CF Trust 2009</LINK>). Chronic infection with <I>P. aeruginosa</I> is however associated with a more rapid decline in lung function (<LINK REF="REF-Emerson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emerson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schaedel-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schaedel 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Most people with CF are initially infected with non-mucoid <I>P. aeruginosa</I>, which is relatively sensitive to antibiotics, but after a period of time it changes to a mucoid state (<LINK REF="REF-Starner-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Starner 2005</LINK>). Early acquisition of mucoid <I>P. aeruginosa</I> was associated with a four-fold greater decrease in cumulative survival (<LINK REF="REF-Demko-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Demko 1995</LINK>). Mucoid <I>P. aeruginosa</I> is much more difficult to treat and eradicate because it adopts a defensive mode of growth that leads to creation of a surrounding biofilm (<LINK REF="REF-Hentzer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hentzer 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-H_x00f8_iby-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Høiby 2000</LINK>). Biofilms are communities of bacteria enclosed in a self-produced polysaccharide matrix and which are adherent to a surface. The biofilm protects <I>P. aeruginosa</I> from normal host defences and antibiotics. In addition, bacterial adherence to mucus is increased in CF which also contributes to difficulties in clearing it from the airways (<LINK REF="REF-Donaldson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donaldson 2003</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-03-31 15:20:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>At the time of initial infection, the majority of <I>P. aeruginosa</I> isolates are susceptible to commonly used antibiotics but, as individuals are exposed to repeated courses of antimicrobial therapies, they often develop drug resistance (<LINK REF="REF-Gilligan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilligan 1999</LINK>). Multi-resistant <I>P. aeruginosa</I> is associated with more severe lung disease, more rapid decline in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> and progression to end-stage lung disease (<LINK REF="REF-Lechtzin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lechtzin 2006</LINK>). People with CF who are infected with multi-resistant <I>P. aeruginosa</I> require longer duration of intravenous antibiotics, more courses of intravenous antibiotics per year and more clinic visits (<LINK REF="REF-Lechtzin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lechtzin 2006</LINK>). Certain highly transmissible <I>P. aeruginosa </I>strains, which can be detected by genomic fingerprinting, are also known to be multi-resistant and have a greater requirement for intravenous antibiotics than those harbouring unique strains (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2002</LINK>). These epidemic, multi-resistant strains can spread among people with CF with significant resource implications (<LINK REF="REF-Cheng-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheng 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Edenborough-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edenborough 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jones-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2001</LINK>). Other organisms which infect people with CF and are known to be multi-resistant to antibiotics are <I>B. cepacia</I> complex, <I>Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (S. maltophilia)</I> and <I>Achromobacter (Alkaligines) xyloxidans </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Elborn-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elborn 2004</LINK>). Infection with multi-resistant organisms is associated with more severe respiratory exacerbations requiring a longer duration of intravenous antibiotics (<LINK REF="REF-Frangolias-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frangolias 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lechtzin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lechtzin 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Intravenous antibiotics are given either as home intravenous antibiotic treatment (HIVAT) or in hospital. For the treatment of chest exacerbations, the choice of intravenous antibiotics is generally based on recent culture results of airway secretions. In infections caused by <I>P. aeruginosa</I>, a combination of aminoglycoside and beta lactam is preferred as it enhances the activity against target organisms (synergy) and decreases the risk of antibiotic resistance developing (<LINK REF="REF-Cheng-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheng 1996</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-03-27 13:03:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Deciding on an optimal combination of antibiotic regimens depends on many factors, namely the type of organisms, antibiotic sensitivity, allergies, previous response to treatment and local policies. A good response to treatment can be expected if a suitable antibiotic combination is chosen.</P>
<P>The duration of a course of intravenous therapy to treat chest exacerbations varies but these are frequently between 10 and 21 days of antibiotics (<LINK REF="REF-CF-Trust-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">CF Trust 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Doring-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doring 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-D_x00f6_ring-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Döring 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gibson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hodson-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodson 2000a</LINK>). The optimal duration of intravenous antibiotic therapy is not clearly defined (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenberg-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenberg 1993</LINK>). Response to therapy (as reflected by improved pulmonary function, oxygen saturation returning to pre-exacerbation levels, levelling off of weight loss, normalisation or significant falls in inflammatory markers, decreased bacterial density in sputum, improved well-being and clinical symptomatology scores) may be used to guide the optimal duration of intravenous antibiotic therapy (<LINK REF="REF-CF-Trust-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">CF Trust 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Doring-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doring 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-D_x00f6_ring-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Döring 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hodson-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodson 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ramsey-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramsey 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Individuals are usually commenced on a 10- to 14-day course of intravenous antibiotics (<LINK REF="REF-CF-Trust-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">CF Trust 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Doring-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doring 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-D_x00f6_ring-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Döring 2012</LINK>). This may be extended in people with severe exacerbations and incomplete recovery (<LINK REF="REF-Doring-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doring 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-D_x00f6_ring-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Döring 2012</LINK>). However a consensus of opinion states that intravenous antibiotics should not be extended more than three weeks, except under very special circumstances and that patients with multi-drug resistant <I>P. aeruginosa</I> may require therapy (<LINK REF="REF-D_x00f6_ring-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Döring 2012</LINK>).Some studies also mention 10 days (<LINK REF="REF-CF-Trust-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">CF Trust 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Doring-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doring 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hodson-2000b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodson 2000b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McLaughlin-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">McLaughlin 1983</LINK>) and 21 days (<LINK REF="REF-Gibson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ramsey-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramsey 1996</LINK>) as the duration required to treat chest exacerbations. With a shorter duration of antibiotic treatment there is a risk of inadequate clearance of infection which could lead to further lung damage. Prolonged courses of intravenous antibiotics are expensive and inconvenient to individuals. The incidence of allergic reactions to antibiotics also increases with prolonged courses (<LINK REF="REF-Koch-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koch 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parmar-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 2005</LINK>). Moreover, the use of aminoglycosides requires frequent monitoring of antibiotic levels to avoid some of their side effects namely, ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity (<LINK REF="REF-Hodson-2000b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodson 2000b</LINK>).</P>

<P>People with CF, diagnosed clinically and by sweat or genetic testing, of all ages and all degrees of disease severity and who are being treated with intravenous antibiotics for a chest exacerbation.</P>
<P>We will require all studies to clearly state how they will define a chest exacerbation. We will regard as important or as a minimum, according to criteria published by the 1994 Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Microbiology and Infectious Disease Consensus Conference (<LINK REF="REF-CF-Foundation-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">CF Foundation 1994</LINK>), the presence of at least three of the following eleven new findings or changes in clinical status when compared to the most recent baseline visit:</P>
<OL>
<LI>increased cough;</LI>
<LI>increased sputum production, change in appearance of expectorated sputum, or both;</LI>
<LI>fever (greater or equal to 38°C for at least four hours in a 24-hour period) on more than one occasion in the previous week;</LI>
<LI>weight loss greater than or equal to 1 kg or 5% of bodyweight associated with anorexia and decreased dietary intake;</LI>
<LI>school or work absenteeism (due to illness) in the previous week;</LI>
<LI>increased respiratory rate, increased work of breathing, or both;</LI>
<LI>new finding on chest examination (e.g. rales, wheezing, crackles);</LI>
<LI>decreased exercise tolerance;</LI>
<LI>decrease in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> of greater than or equal to 10% from previous baseline study within past three months;</LI>
<LI>decrease in haemoglobin saturation (as measured by oximetry) from baseline value within past three months of greater than or equal to 10%;</LI>
<LI>new finding on chest radiograph.</LI>
</OL>
<P>For paediatric chest exacerbations, the presence of three or more of the following characteristics will be used to define a chest exacerbation:</P>
<OL>
<LI>in children under six years of age - new crackles, increased cough frequency, decline in weight and impression of increased sputum production;</LI>
<LI>in children six years or over - relative decrease in per cent predicted FEV<SUB>1</SUB>, increased cough frequency, new crackles and haemoptysis (<LINK REF="REF-Rabin-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rabin 2004</LINK>).</LI>

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Comparison of different durations of intravenous antibiotic courses, which can either be the same drugs at the same dosage, the same drugs at a different dosage or frequency or different antibiotics altogether.

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2016-01-19 21:28:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For binary outcome measures, in order to allow an intention-to-treat analysis, we will seek data on the number of participants with each outcome event, by allocated treated group, irrespective of compliance and whether or not the individual was later thought to be ineligible or otherwise excluded from treatment or follow up. We aim to calculate a pooled estimate of the treatment effect for each outcome across studies using relative risk where appropriate.</P>
<P>For continuous outcomes, we plan to record either mean relative change from baseline for each group or mean post-treatment or intervention values and standard deviation. If standard errors are reported, and where possible, these will be converted to standard deviations. We will calculate a pooled estimate of treatment effect by calculating the weighted mean difference.</P>
<P>For any time-to-event outcomes included in the review, we plan to obtain a mixture of logrank and Cox model estimates from the trials; we will combine all results using the generic inverse variance method since we will be able to convert the logrank estimates into log hazard ratios and standard errors as detailed in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2008-05-14 10:04:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Ideally, when conducting a meta-analysis combining results from cross-over trials we will use the inverse variance methods that are recommended by Elbourne (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). However, if there are restrictions on the data available, we may only be able to either use the first arm data only or to treat the cross-over trials as if they are parallel trials. Elbourne says that this approach will produce conservative results as it does not take into account within-patient correlation (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). Also each participant will appear in both the treatment and control group, so the two groups will not be independent.</P>

We may impute missing standard deviations according to the methodology described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We will collect any outcomes not available and report these in a risk of bias table. We plan to conduct an intention-to-treat analysis by contacting all authors for missing data.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-05-04 10:00:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Cystic fibrosis is a life-limiting disease. While every effort needs to be focused on treating chest infections aggressively, there have been no clear guidelines on how long the optimum duration of intravenous antibiotics should be. Most studies show chest exacerbations are treated for 14 days as a routine (<LINK REF="REF-Aaron-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aaron 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Burkhardt-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burkhardt 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hoogkamp-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoogkamp 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hyatt-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hyatt 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smyth-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smyth 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vic-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vic 1998</LINK>); however, there are studies which show 10 days are sufficient (<LINK REF="REF-Beaudry-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beaudry 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Master-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Master 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McLaughlin-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">McLaughlin 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Penketh-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Penketh 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Penketh-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Penketh 1984</LINK>). A study by Mendelman found 21 days to be more effective in treating chest exacerbations (<LINK REF="REF-Mendelman-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mendelman 1985</LINK>). None of these studies are RCTs which compare different durations of antibiotic courses and are therefore not eligible to be included in the Results section of this review. There are no clear reasons for choosing 14 days or 21 days as the optimum duration, besides the assumption that longer treatment may clear the infection more thoroughly. Moreover, not all chest exacerbations are due to the usual bacteria known to infect the lungs of people with CF. Viruses, atypical bacteria and fungi are also implicated in causing exacerbations (<LINK REF="REF-Olesen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olesen 2006</LINK>). Physiotherapy and bronchodilators on their own, sometimes, have the same effect as intravenous antibiotics in treating chest exacerbations (<LINK REF="REF-Gold-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gold 1987</LINK>). As it is difficult to clinically distinguish bacterial and viral exacerbations, clinicians usually err on the side of treating them with antibiotics.</P>
<P>In most adults and adolescents with CF, eradication of the infecting bacterial organism is almost impossible as infections tend to be chronic and ineradicable. Therefore, extending duration of antibiotic therapy would not be expected to result in clearance of infection. In contrast to acute infections associated with other diseases, the duration of antibiotic therapy for CF exacerbations should probably be guided based on improvement in clinical status of the affected individual rather than based on attempts at rendering the airways sterile of bacteria.</P>
<P>We did not find any RCTs comparing different treatment durations. Reducing the treatment duration to 10 days may have significant benefits; improved quality of life, improved compliance, less incidence of drug reactions and lower cost. However, it is uncertain if this duration of 10 days is sufficient to clear a chest infection and does not result in an early recurrence of next exacerbation. Moreover, multi-resistant organisms may require longer duration to treat them effectively.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There are no published data to recommend the optimum duration of intravenous antibiotic therapy for treating a chest exacerbation. Duration of treatment is currently decided based on unit policies and the individual's response to treatment and we have found no evidence to change this practice. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-05-08 11:22:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>This systematic review has identified the need for a well-designed, adequately-powered, multicentre randomised controlled trial to assess the optimum duration of intravenous antibiotic therapy to treat chest exacerbations, an issue which has important clinical and financial implications. This type of study could be done by randomising participants to receive either 7 days, 10 days, 14 days or 21 days of intravenous antibiotics and comparing outcome measures at these various end points. Long-term follow up is needed to look at the time to next exacerbation, frequency of chest exacerbations and development of antibiotic-resistant strains. Outcome measures, such as pulmonary function tests, time to next exacerbation and improvement in quality of life scores should be clearly stated and multicentre trials should be co-ordinated so that maximum power is available to achieve a clear result.</P>
