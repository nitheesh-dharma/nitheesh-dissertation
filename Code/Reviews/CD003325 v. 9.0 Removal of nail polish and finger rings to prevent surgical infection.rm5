<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-06-11 12:01:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Elizabeth Royle">
<P>People having surgery can get a serious wound infection from bacteria (germs) on the hands of operating theatre staff (doctors, nurses, and assistants). Theatre staff scrub their hands intensively before operations to reduce the number of bacteria on them. It may be that nail polish (varnish) and rings (jewellery) hide bacteria and reduce the effectiveness of hand scrubbing. This review could not locate any trials that investigated the effect of theatre staff wearing rings, but did find one small trial that investigated the number of bacteria before and after scrubbing on the hands of theatre staff with varnished and unvarnished nails. This trial did not identify any clear differences between the number of bacteria on varnished and unvarnished nails, but evidence from more trials is required before we can be certain that this is a true result.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-06-11 11:57:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Elizabeth Royle">
<P>Surgical wound infections may be caused by the transfer of bacteria from the hands of surgical teams to patients during operations. Surgical scrubbing prior to surgery reduces the number of bacteria on the skin, but wearing rings and nail polish on the fingers may reduce the efficacy of scrubbing, as bacteria may remain in microscopic imperfections of nail polish and on the skin beneath rings.</P>

<BR/>We found one small RCT (102 scrub nurses) that evaluated the effect of nail polish on the number of bacterial colony forming units left on hands after pre-operative surgical scrubbing. Nurses had either unpolished nails, freshly-applied nail polish (less than two days old), or old nail polish (more than four days old). There were no significant differences in the number of bacteria on hands between the groups before and after surgical scrubbing.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2014-07-24 11:50:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-06-11 15:30:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It has been estimated that approximately one in ten patients in acute hospital settings have a hospital-acquired infection (HAI). In addition, an unquantifiable number of patients discharged from hospital into the community have an infection related to their hospital stay (<LINK REF="REF-NINSS-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">NINSS 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Analysing the cost of HAIs is complex. The cost to the patient may range from a few extra days absence from work, to considerable pain and immobility, while the social and economic burdens of lost earnings and productivity - as well as social security payments - attributable to HAIs are difficult to quantify (<LINK REF="REF-NINSS-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">NINSS 1999</LINK>). Deaths from HAIs are also difficult to quantify because infection may be one of several contributory factors (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 1995</LINK>). As previously mentioned, studies have indicated that one in ten patients in acute hospitals have an HAI, and, assuming that England has a similar mortality rate to that in the USA, it is estimated that one per cent of these patients will die as a direct result of their infection, and that HAIs will be a contributory cause in the deaths of a further three per cent (<LINK REF="REF-NINSS-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">NINSS 1999</LINK>). In addition, the direct and indirect cost of hospital treatment must also be considered. Patients with HAIs may require further surgery, additional nursing care, drug therapy and consumables. HAIs also increase the length of hospital stay by an average of four to ten days, and so prevent the admission of other patients needing care and treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 1995</LINK>). It has been calculated that a ten per cent reduction in the incidence rate of HAIs in England would deliver a £93 million saving in expenditure (<LINK REF="REF-Plowman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Plowman 1999</LINK>). The National Priorities Guidance (1999/00-2001/02) emphasised the obligation of the National Health Service to ensure the continuing and effective protection of the public's health against communicable disease, including HAIs (<LINK REF="REF-NINSS-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">NINSS 1999</LINK>). This review of finger rings and nail polish, may contribute to the development of effective guidelines and policies on HAIs.</P>
<P>Surgical wound infection accounts for up to 20% of all HAIs, most of which occur because of microbial contamination of the wound during surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Ayliffe-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ayliffe 1999</LINK>). The incidence of surgical infection varies according to surgical site and between hospitals (<LINK REF="REF-NINSS-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">NINSS 1999</LINK>). Infections may derive from the resident flora or transient microbiological flora found on the hands of health care workers (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 1995</LINK>). Resident flora are microbes that live deep in the crevices of the skin, in hair follicles and sebaceous glands. Transient flora are microbes acquired on the surface of the skin through contact with other people, objects, or the environment (<LINK REF="REF-Price-1938" TYPE="REFERENCE">Price 1938</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 1995</LINK>). The composition of transient flora varies, but reflects the extent of contact with patients, their environments, and the micro-organisms that are prevalent (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Generally, it is recognised that the hands of hospital staff are the most common vehicles by which micro-organisms are transmitted between patients (<LINK REF="REF-Gould-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gould 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kerr-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kerr 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-May-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">May 1998</LINK>), although <LINK REF="REF-Ayliffe-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ayliffe 1999</LINK> suggested that there was little statistical evidence to support this view. Despite this view, <LINK REF="REF-Ayliffe-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ayliffe 1999</LINK> also concurred that hand washing or disinfection is the most important technique for prevention of cross-infection.</P>
<P>Pathogenic micro-organisms are acquired in the greatest number when handling moist, heavily-contaminated substances such as body fluids. These fluids frequently contain large numbers of micro-organisms, and are a major source of the pathogens that cause HAIs. Team members within the environment of the operating theatre are frequently, and routinely, exposed to a variety of potentially pathogenic micro-organisms during the handling body fluids, specimens and contaminated instruments. These, alongside the resident skin flora on the hands of the theatre team, put staff at risk of transmitting infection to patients, and are of particular concern at the surgical scrub stage in the surgical procedure.</P>
<P>Prior to surgical procedures, a particular form of hand washing - the surgical scrub - is used before putting on sterile surgical gloves. Most people use antiseptic formulations for surgical scrubbing that are highly effective in removing or destroying bacteria that might pass through punctured or damaged gloves during surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Ayliffe-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ayliffe 1999</LINK>). It is believed that the presence of finger rings and nail polish (also called nail varnish) may reduce the efficacy of the scrub, because an increased number of micro-organisms may be harboured in the microscopic imperfections on the surface of nail polish and on the skin beneath rings. Rings may also harbour bacteria, and rip surgical gloves. As a result, the reluctance of theatre staff to remove rings or nail polish is an issue.</P>
<P>There is a lack of uniformity in guidelines and policies regarding the optimum technique for scrubbing (<LINK REF="REF-AORN-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">AORN 1999</LINK>), specifically scrubbing agent, duration of hand scrubbing, nail length, and whether wearing nail polish and rings on the fingers is acceptable. If we can identify evidence for an association between the removal of finger rings, and nail polish, and a subsequent reduction in the number of surgical wound infections, the potential benefit for patients could be high, whilst the cost of changing clinical practice would be comparatively low.</P>

<P>Both clinical and statistical heterogeneity were explored.

This examines the percentage of total variation across studies due to heterogeneity rather than to chance. Values of I² over 75% indicate a high level of heterogeneity. Where pooling is appropriate and in the absence of clinical and statistical heterogeneity a fixed effect model will be applied to pool data.  In the presence of statistical heterogeneity (as estimated by the I² ) a random effects model would be applied for meta-analysis. Where synthesis was inappropriate we undertook a narrative overview.</P>

<P>We found no randomised controlled trials, controlled trials, cohort, or case controlled studies, that compared the wearing of finger rings with their removal. One eligible, randomised controlled trial (RCT) was identified that compared unpolished nails, freshly-applied polish and old, or chipped, nail polish. The following manufacturers of surgical scrubbing solutions were contacted to request reports of any trials they might know of: Seton Healthcare Group PLC (Betadine Surgical Scrub), Zeneca Ltd (Hibiscrub), Maxime Medical Europe (Chlorhexidine Gluconate 4% in detergent impregnated brushes, PCMX 3%, PVP Iodine in detergent), Diversey Lever (Alcohol gel hand rub), but no further trials were identified as a result of this effort.</P>
<P>The searches for the updates of this review did not identify any further relevant trials. Manufacturers have been contacted, but no further trials have been identified from their replies to date.</P>

<INCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR MODIFIED="2010-06-11 16:17:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Only one eligible RCT was identified for the first publication of this review (<LINK REF="STD-Wynd-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Wynd 1994</LINK>), and no new studies have been identified since. This included study was conducted in Cleveland Clinic Foundation, USA. Participants were a convenience sample of 102 scrub nurses. (The necessary sample size was estimated from previous studies.) Scrub nurses are nurses who scrub surgically, wear sterilised gloves and clothing, and work as part of the surgical scrub team. In the trial, subjects were randomly assigned to three groups: freshly-polished fingernails, chipped nail polish, or unpolished fingernails. The trialists defined fresh nail polish as having been applied to the hands within a two-day time span. Old, or chipped, nail polish was defined as either obviously chipped, or applied to the hands four days before data collection and fingernail culturing. Unpolished fingernails were fingernails that had not been polished within the four-day period before data collection and fingernail culturing. Participants complied with instructions on fingernail preparation contained in the envelopes assigned to them, and the number of bacteria cultured from each of the groups was compared. The process of data collection and fingernail culturing was timed to take place immediately prior to surgery.</P>
<P>Only the dominant hands of subjects were assessed, and nails were swabbed to determine the number of bacteria on them (measured in colony forming units (CFUs)) both before and after the surgical scrub. Although numbers of CFUs were measured, postoperative wound infection rates were not reported. Logarithmic representations of numbers of bacteria are commonly used to express this type of result, since the number of bacteria on a single swab is enormous, and can number millions of CFUs. One-hundred colony-forming units are expressed as 1x10<SUP>2 </SUP>CFUs (one-hundred is equal to 10 squared (counted and recorded as log <SUB>10</SUB> CFUs by <LINK REF="STD-Wynd-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Wynd 1994</LINK>)). <LINK REF="STD-Wynd-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Wynd 1994</LINK> estimated that there was an 80% chance of detecting a three-log reduction in the number of bacteria on the hands of nurses (at P &lt; 0.05). This size of effect would equate to, for example, a reduction from 1x10<SUP>6</SUP> CFUs to 1x10<SUP>3 </SUP>CFUs, i.e. from one-million CFUs to one-thousand CFUs.</P>
<P>The study was carried out in the clinical area with participants who had scrubbed on a daily basis for at least two weeks before entering the study. Only the participants' dominant hands were sampled. The justification for not sampling both hands was stated as being insufficient time, though the additional time required to conduct tests on both hands by the trialists would have been minimal. Logic suggests that participants would prepare both hands as a matter of course and that the sampling of both might have produced a more valid data set, as there could be differences in between the dominant and non-dominant hand following surgical scrub.</P>
<P>All participants were required to undertake a "modified surgical scrub" which consisted of a set of instructions indicating precisely how the scrub should be conducted, however, this may be different to normal operating theatre technique. Different pharmacological surgical scrubbing solutions were used by participants in the study, and standardisation in this respect would have produced results of greater consistency. The timing at which the post-scrub specimen was taken was not made explicit, and this may have had an impact upon the numbers of CFUs recorded by the trialists. Staged sampling over pre-determined periods might have produced more informative results with greater value and consistency.</P>
<P>A surgical scrub observation tool was developed to monitor the performance of participants conducting the modified surgical scrub. The pilot test of the observation tool was tested on ten subjects for inter-rater reliability. The Pearson product moment correlation co-efficient was used to analyse the results, but requires greater numbers of pairings than the pilot test was able to provide. In addition, although this test is appropriate for establishing correlation, it does not establish that the observers are measuring the same actions in the performance of participant scrub, and thus was not an appropriate test.</P>
<P>The table produced from the pilot of ten subjects indicated that nine people did not score well against the prescribed surgical scrub criteria. Despite this, <LINK REF="STD-Wynd-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Wynd 1994</LINK> stated that surgical scrub performance was not a factor affecting outcomes, though no rationale was offered for this conclusion. The trial authors also stated that vigorous hand washing and nail brushing may generally be avoided by practitioners in an effort to protect nail polish and expensive manicures, and that this may affect outcomes. <LINK REF="STD-Wynd-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Wynd 1994</LINK> state that 30% of the nurses across all three groups had a statistically insignificant increase in numbers of CFUs following the surgical hand scrub. Increased bacterial counts following surgical scrubbing has been reported, and may be due to release of organisms from the subungual spaces, and <LINK REF="STD-Wynd-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Wynd 1994</LINK> highlighted this. The trial authors also suggested that it could result from mechanical disturbance and transfer of bacteria from hands to culture mediums.</P>
<P>As CFUs are a proxy measure for possible patient outcomes, the significance for patients was not made clear in the study, although <LINK REF="STD-Wynd-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Wynd 1994</LINK> assert that a three-log reduction is clinically significant. <LINK REF="STD-Wynd-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Wynd 1994</LINK> correlated nail length and bacterial counts using the Spearman correlation analysis for both pre- and post-scrub and within each of the three subject groups, and stated that no significant correlations were revealed.</P>
<P>No dropouts were recorded.</P>

<P>Randomisation was by sealed envelopes prepared by a biostatistician; it was not stated how the randomisation sequence had been generated. It was also unclear whether allocation was concealed. The trial report did not state whether the envelopes used were sequentially-numbered or opaque. Due to the nature of the comparison groups (freshly polished fingernails, old or chipped nail polish, or unpolished fingernails), blinding of participants was not possible; nor was it possible to blind the personnel taking the swabs. It was unclear whether the outcome assessors were blind to the comparison groups under investigation. Data were available for all randomised participants and for the pre-specified outcome (bacterial colonies) (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2010-06-11 16:30:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Only one RCT comparing unpolished nails, freshly-applied polish and old or chipped nail polish was found. <LINK REF="STD-Wynd-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Wynd 1994</LINK> compared the bacterial load on the nails of 102 scrub nurses randomly assigned to unpolished nails (34 nurses), freshly-polished nails (34 nurses) or old, or chipped, polished nails (34 nurses). The mean values of the bacterial load are shown in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. In the freshly-polished nails group the data obtained from the sample were skewed because one participant carried a large number of CFUs before the scrub. No indications were given about why this might have occurred. Due to large deviations in mean bacterial CFUs, median counts were examined by the trialists who reported no significant differences in pre-scrub (i.e. baseline) readings (P value 0.122) among the three groups. The median values were not, however, given in the trial report.</P>
<P>Comparing the mean values we found no difference between the pre-scrub bacterial loads, expressed as CFUs (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Post-surgical scrub values of bacterial load (CFUs) are probably more important clinically than pre-scrub values as they indicate the potentially available reservoir of bacteria that can be transferred to the patient via perforations in gloves or other breaches of sterile technique.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-06-11 15:39:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is currently no evidence of the effect of nail polish and finger ring wearing on postoperative wound infection. A single, small study, comparing chipped and fresh nail polish with unpolished nails collected data only on the bacterial colonisation of the dominant hand and found no statistically significant differences. This trial was underpowered for detection of clinically important differences in colonisation.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-06-11 12:51:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Elizabeth Royle">
<P>There is insufficient trial evidence concerning the impact of no nail polish, or fresh, or chipped nail polish on bacterial density on the fingernails of scrubbed personnel within operating theatres to draw any conclusions. There are no RCTs that assess surgical wound infection rates when surgical scrub personnel wear, or remove, finger rings or nail polish. Given the lack of evidence for either the safety or the harm that may be associated with nail polish and finger rings, health care organisations must continue to develop institutional policies based on expert opinion.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-06-11 16:34:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Well-designed randomised controlled trials are needed to evaluate the effect of scrubbed personnel wearing finger rings and nail polish. Primary outcome measures should include those of clinical significance, especially surgical infection rates. Trials should be adequately powered to detect any difference in the incidence of surgical wound infection as statistically significant. In addition, trials should have adequate methods of generating the randomisation sequence, should ensure allocation is concealed and that outcome assessors are blinded. Interventions should be well defined and the acceptability of the interventions to staff should also be evaluated.</P>

<P>For this fourth update, the following databases were searched:</P>
<UL>
<LI>The Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 27 January 2012);</LI>
<LI>The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2012, Issue 1);</LI>
<LI>Ovid MEDLINE (2010 to January Week 2 2012);</LI>
<LI>Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process &amp; Other Non-Indexed Citations, January 26, 2012);</LI>
<LI>Ovid EMBASE (2010 to 2012 Week 03);EBSCO CINAHL (2010 to January 6 2012)..</LI>
</UL>
<P>The following search strategy was used in CENTRAL:</P>
