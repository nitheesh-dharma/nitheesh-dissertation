<DESCRIPTION>
<P>This review updates the review "Formula milk versus preterm human milk for feeding preterm or low birth weight infants" published in The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2001 (Henderson 2001).<BR/>
<BR/>In this update, the structure of the review has been revised in the following manner:<BR/>1. The comparison description is now "formula milk versus maternal breast milk." A companion review addresses the comparison of "formula milk versus donor breast milk" (Quigley 2007).<BR/>2. The inclusion criteria includes trials that compared feeding with formula versus maternal breast milk as a sole diet or as a supplement to formula milk (previous review restricted to sole diet).<BR/>
<BR/>No eligible trials were identified on updated search. The previous review had identified a trial that compared feeding with formula milk versus donor preterm milk. This trial is no longer eligible for inclusion but is now included in the companion review of "formula milk versus donor breast milk" (Quigley 2007).</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Formula milk may contain more nutrients than maternal breast milk but it lacks the antibodies and other substances present in breast milk that protect and develop the immature gut of preterm or low birth weight infants. No trials that compared feeding with formula milk rather than their own mother's breast milk were identified. However, since another Cochrane review has found that feeding with formula compared to donor breast milk increases the risk of serious gut problems in preterm or low birth weight infants, it is unlikely that a such a trial would be acceptable to mothers and caregivers.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-06-12 08:49:23 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Maternal breast milk is the recommended form of enteral nutrition for preterm or low birth weight infants (<LINK REF="REF-AAP-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 1997</LINK>). A major benefit of feeding with breast milk is that the delivery of immunoprotective and growth factors to the immature gut mucosa may prevent serious adverse outcomes including necrotising enterocolitis and invasive infection (<LINK REF="REF-Beeby-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beeby 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lucas-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Lucas 1990</LINK>). However, there is concern that the nutritional requirements of preterm or low birth weight infants, who are born with relatively poor nutrient reserves and are subject to additional metabolic stresses compared with term infants, may not be fully met by enteral feeding with breast milk (<LINK REF="REF-Tsang-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tsang 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hay-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hay 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schanler-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schanler 1995</LINK>). These deficiencies may have adverse consequences for growth and development (<LINK REF="REF-Lucas-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucas 1994</LINK>). Evidence exists that supplementation of human milk with nutrient fortifiers increases short-term growth rates (<LINK REF="REF-Kuschel-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuschel 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>As an alternative to maternal breast milk, a variety of formula milks (usually modified cow milk) are available for feeding preterm or low birth weight infants. These vary in energy, protein and mineral content. Broadly, formula milk can be considered as:<BR/>(a) "Term" formulae; designed for term infants, based on the composition of mature breast milk. The typical energy content is between about 67 to 70 kilocalories per 100 millilitres.<BR/>(b) "Preterm" formulae; designed to provide nutrient intakes to match intra-uterine accretion rates. These are energy-enriched (typically up to about 80 kilocalories per 100 millilitres), and variably protein- and mineral-enriched (<LINK REF="REF-Fewtrell-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fewtrell 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>This review focuses on the comparison of feeding preterm or low birth weight infants with formula milk versus maternal breast milk. The comparison of formula milk with donor breast milk is addressed in a separate review (<LINK REF="REF-Quigley-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quigley 2007</LINK>).</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the effect of feeding low birth weight or preterm infants with formula milk compared with maternal breast milk on rates of growth and developmental outcomes. </P>
<P>The following subgroup analyses were planned:</P>
<P>1. "Term" formula milk (containing up to 72 kilocalories per 100 millilitres) vs. maternal breast milk.<BR/>2. "Preterm" formula milk (containing more than 72 kilocalories per 100 millilitres) vs. maternal breast milk.<BR/>3. Formula milk vs. maternal breast milk given as a sole diet. <BR/>4. Formula milk vs. maternal breast milk given as a supplement to formula milk.<BR/>5. Formula milk vs. nutrient-fortified maternal breast milk (defined as supplementation with more than one of the following components: protein, fat, carbohydrate, or minerals).</P>

</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>The standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used. This consisted of searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2007), MEDLINE (1966 - June 2007), and EMBASE (1980 - June 2007), and CINAHL (1982 - June 2007). The electronic search used the following text words and MeSH terms: [Infant, Newborn OR Infant, Premature OR Infant, Low Birth Weight OR infan* OR neonat*] AND "Infant-Nutrition"/ all subheadings OR Infant Formula OR milk OR formula]. The search outputs were limited with the relevant search filters for clinical trials. No language restriction was applied. References in previous reviews and studies were examined. Abstracts presented at the Society for Pediatric Research, European Society for Pediatric Research, the North American Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition, and the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition between 1990 and 2006 were searched. Trials reported only as abstracts were eligible if sufficient information was available from the report, or from contact with the authors, to fulfil the inclusion criteria. The UK National Research Register (http://www.nrr.nhs.uk), and Current Controlled Trials (http://www.controlled-trials.com) websites were searched for completed or ongoing trials. </P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>1. The title and abstract of all studies identified by the above search strategy were screened and the full articles for all potentially relevant trials obtained. The full text of any potentially eligible reports was re-assessed and those studies that did not meet all of the inclusion criteria were excluded. Any disagreements were discussed until consensus was achieved.</P>
<P>2. We planned to use the criteria and standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group to assess the methodological quality of any included trials in terms of allocation concealment, blinding of parents, carers, and assessors to the intervention, and completeness of assessment in all randomised individuals. </P>
<P>3. We planned to use a data collection form to extract relevant information from each included study. If data from the trial reports were insufficient, we planned to contact the trialists for further information.</P>
<P>4. We planned to present outcomes for categorical data as relative risk, risk difference, and number needed to treat, and for continuous data, the weighted mean difference (with respective 95% confidence intervals).</P>
<P>5. We planned to estimate the treatment effects of individual trials and examine heterogeneity between trial results by inspecting the forest plots and quantifying the impact of heterogeneity in any meta-analysis using a measure of the degree of inconsistency in the studies' results (I- squared statistic). If we detected statistical heterogeneity, we planned to explore the possible causes (for example, differences in study quality, participants, intervention regimens, or outcome assessments) using post hoc sub group analyses. We planned to use a fixed effects model for meta-analyses. </P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-06-12 08:49:23 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>No randomised controlled trials of formula milk versus maternal breast milk for feeding preterm or low birth weight infants were identified. This is likely to be due to reluctance of researchers and consumers to assess an intervention that results in infants not receiving the non-nutritional benefits of breast milk. Observational studies have found lower incidences of necrotising enterocolitis in infants fed a formula milk compared with maternal breast milk (<LINK REF="STD-Lucas-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Lucas 1990</LINK>). Meta-analysis of data from randomised controlled trials indicates that feeding with formula milk, compared with donor breast milk, leads to higher rates of feed intolerance and necrotising enterocolitis in preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Quigley-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quigley 2007</LINK>). Since maternal breast milk contains higher levels of putative immunoprotective factors (secretory immunoglobulin-A, lysozyme, lactoferrin, epidermal growth factors) than donor breast milk (<LINK REF="REF-Fewtrell-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fewtrell 1999</LINK>), it is plausible that feeding with maternal breast milk has will have the same protective effect. Furthermore, if there is concern regarding the nutritional adequacy of maternal breast milk, infants can receive supplemental nutrition via multicomponent fortification without losing the non-nutrient benefits of breast milk (<LINK REF="REF-Kuschel-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuschel 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>In resource-poor countries, where the risk of infection in the neonatal period is much higher than in resource-rich countries, the anti-infective properties of breast milk may confer further advantages for preterm or low birth weight infants. In India, a randomised trial in low birth weight infants "at risk of infection" found that serious infections (diarrhoea, pneumonia, septicaemia) were statistically significantly less common in infants allocated to receive "expressed human milk" versus formula milk (<LINK REF="STD-Narayanan-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Narayanan 1982</LINK>). "Expressed human milk" in this trial referred to a mixture of maternal and donor breast milk. As these could not be separated into subgroups, the data could not be included in the review.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There are no data from randomised controlled trials to determine whether feeding preterm or low birth weight infants with formula milk versus maternal breast milk affects growth, development, or other clinically important outcomes. However, maternal breast milk remains the default choice of nutrition for feeding preterm or low birth weight infants because of its putative non-nutrient advantages, and because nutrient fortification of breast milk can address concerns regarding nutrient content and growth rates. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Mothers who wish to breast feed, and their health care advisors, would require very clear evidence that feeding with formula milk had major advantages for their infants before electing not to feed (or to reduce feeding) with maternal breast milk. It is unlikely that equipoise exists amongst consumers and caregivers to undertake such a trial. Data from observational studies, and meta-analyses of trials that compared feeding with formula milk versus donor breast milk, suggest that feeding with breast milk has major advantages, for preterm or low birth weight infants.</P>

The infants were fed either human milk (n = 11), SMA Super Preemie formula (n = 9), or Similac, Special Care formula (n = 8). Fasting and postprandial activity of digestive enzymes, pH, and gastric volume (measured before or during 50 min after gavage feeding) did not differ as a function of diet among the three groups of infants. Gastric lipase output, 23.1 +/- 5.1, 28.3 +/- 6.6, and 22.5 +/- 6.4 (U/kg of body weight) in human milk-, SMA SP-, or Similac SC-fed infants was comparable to the gastric lipase output of healthy adults fed a high fat diet (22.6 +/- 3.0). Pepsin output was, however, significantly lower (597 +/- 77, 743 +/- 97, and 639 +/- 142 U/kg of body weight) in human milk-, SMA SP-, and Similac SC-fed infants) than in healthy adults (3352 +/- 753 U/kg). The hydrolysis of dietary fat was 1.7-2.5-fold higher (p &amp;lt; 0.01) in human milk-fed infants than in infants fed either formula. We conclude that differences in type of feeding, i.e. different fatty acid profiles (long chain or medium chain triglycerides), different emulsions (natural or artificial), and different fat particle sizes do not affect the level of activity of gastric enzymes. However, the triglyceride within milk fat globules appears to be more accessible to gastric lipase than that within formula fat particles. We suggest that the contribution of gastric lipase to overall fat digestion might be greater in the newborn (a period of pancreatic insufficiency) than in the adult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2008-06-12 08:49:52 -0400" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">

In this study, the effects of feeding premature infants either human milk (HM), fortified human milk (FHM), or special premature formula (Similac Special Care [SSC]) on growth, phosphorus metabolism, and serum type I procollagen (pColl-I-C) were evaluated. Infants fed FHM exhibited a rate of weight gain and an increase in head circumference comparable with infants fed SSC and significantly greater than infants fed HM, despite the fact that both the FHM group and the HM group demonstrated biochemical evidence of phosphorus deficiency. The pColl-I-C concentrations in VLBW infants were tenfold to 20-fold greater than concentrations in normal children older than 2 years of age. The pColl-I-C levels correlated positively with weight gain and were significantly greater in the FHM and SSC groups than in the HM group. By contrast, serum alkaline phosphatase levels did not correlate with weight gain and were significantly lower in the rapidly growing SSC group than in either of the two groups with phosphorus deficiency and presumed poor bone mineralization. We conclude that the serum pColl-I-C concentration is a biochemical marker of growth in VLBW infants and may prove useful as a predictor of growth responses to various nutritional and therapeutic interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2008-06-12 08:50:02 -0400" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">

Mortality was 26% in stringently confirmed cases. In exclusively formula-fed babies confirmed disease was 6-10 times more common than in those fed breast milk alone and 3 times more common than in those who received formula plus breast milk. Pasteurised donor milk seemed to be as protective as raw maternal milk. Among babies born at more than 30 weeks' gestation confirmed necrotising enterocolitis was rare in those whose diet included breast milk; it was 20 times more common in those fed formula only. Other risk factors included very low gestational age, respiratory disease, umbilical artery catheterisation, and polycythaemia. In formula-fed but not breast-milk-fed infants, delayed enteral feeding was associated with a lower frequency of necrotising enterocolitis. With the fall in the use of breast milk in British neonatal units, exclusive formula feeding could account for an estimated 500 extra cases of necrotising enterocolitis each year. About 100 of these infants would die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2008-06-12 08:50:13 -0400" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">
