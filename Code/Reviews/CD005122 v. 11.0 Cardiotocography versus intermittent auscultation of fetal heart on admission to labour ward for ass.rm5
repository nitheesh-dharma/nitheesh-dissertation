<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-01-13 11:08:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>What is the issue?</B>
</P>
<P>When healthy women with low-risk pregnancies are admitted to labour wards, does a cardiotocograph (CTG) or listening to the fetal heart rate (FHR) for one minute following a contraction lead to better outcomes for mothers and their babies?</P>
<P>
<B>Why is this important?</B>
</P>
<P>Monitoring of the FHR is one of the most common methods for checking a baby's wellbeing. The two most common ways of monitoring the FHR are by listening to the heart beat using a fetal stethoscope, Pinard (special trumpet shaped device), hand-held Doppler ultrasound device (known as intermittent auscultation) or by an electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) machine that produces a printout of the baby&#8217;s heart rate and the mother&#8217;s contractions, called a CTG.</P>
<P>The admission CTG is a commonly used test consisting of a short, usually 20 minute, recording of the FHR and uterine activity that is performed when the woman is admitted to the labour ward with signs of labour. The admission CTG was introduced to try and identify those babies who were at greatest risk of becoming compromised with a lack of oxygen during labour. These babies could be monitored more intensively by continuous EFM, or they may benefit from an immediate intervention such as being delivered by caesarean section.</P>
<P>
<B>What evidence did we find?</B>
</P>
<P>We compared the admission CTG with intermittent auscultation of the FHR performed on the woman's admission to the labour ward. We searched for evidence to 30 November 2016 but found no new studies for this updated review (previously published in 2012). This review includes four studies and there is one study that is not yet complete. The included studies (carried out in the UK and Ireland) involved more than 13,000 women with low-risk pregnancies. Three trials were funded by the hospitals were the trials took place and one trial was funded by the Scottish government. </P>
<P>Women allocated to admission CTG were probably more likely to have a caesarean section than women allocated to intermittent auscultation (moderate quality evidence). There was no difference in the number of instrumental vaginal births (low quality evidence) or in numbers of babies who died during or shortly after labour (moderate quality evidence) between women in the two groups. Admission CTG was associated with an increase in the use of continuous EFM (with an electrode placed on the baby&#8217;s scalp) (low quality evidence) and fetal blood sampling (a small blood sample taken from a baby's scalp) during labour. There were no differences in other outcomes measured such as artificial rupture of the membranes, augmentation of labour, use of an epidural, damage to the baby's brain due to lack of oxygen (very low quality evidence), or the baby having fits or seizures just after birth (low quality evidence). No studies reported if the babies developed any severe problems in brain or central nervous system growth and development after one year of age.</P>
<P>
<B>What does this mean?</B>
</P>
<P>Although many hospitals carry out CTGs on women when they are admitted to hospital in labour, we found no evidence that this benefits women with low-risk pregnancies. We found that admission CTGs may increase numbers of women having a caesarean section by about 20%.</P>
<P>The included studies did not include enough women to show if admission CTGs or intermittent auscultation were better at keeping babies safe. However, studies to show which is better at keeping babies safe would have to be very large. Based on this review, low-risk pregnant women who have an admission CTG could be more likely to have a caesarean section. The benefits to these women of having an admission CTG are not certain.</P>
<P>All of the included studies took place in developed Western European countries. The review findings might not be useful to people in very different countries or where different ways of FHR monitoring are used. However, countries that use admission CTGs should start to question why, because there are not clear benefits to using admission CTGs, and they could be causing women harm by making them more likely to have a caesarean section.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-01-13 11:04:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included no new trials in this update. We included four trials involving more than 13,000 women which were conducted in the UK and Ireland and included women in labour. Three trials were funded by the hospitals where the trials took place and one trial was funded by the Scottish government. No declarations of interest were made in two trials; the remaining two trials did not mention declarations of interest. Overall, the studies were assessed as low risk of bias. Results reported in the 2012 review remain unchanged.</P>
<P>Although not statistically significant using a strict P &lt; 0.05 criterion, data were consistent with women allocated to admission CTG having, on average, a higher probability of an increase in incidence of caesarean section than women allocated to intermittent auscultation (risk ratio (RR) 1.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00 to 1.44, 4 trials, 11,338 women, I² = 0%, moderate quality evidence). There was no clear difference in the average treatment effect across included trials between women allocated to admission CTG and women allocated to intermittent auscultation in instrumental vaginal birth (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.27, 4 trials, 11,338 women, I² = 38%, low quality evidence) and perinatal mortality rate (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.30 to 3.47, 4 trials, 11,339 infants, I² = 0%, moderate quality evidence).</P>
<P>Women allocated to admission CTG had, on average, higher rates of continuous electronic fetal monitoring during labour (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.48, 3 trials, 10,753 women, I² = 79%, low quality evidence) and fetal blood sampling (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.45, 3 trials, 10,757 women, I² = 0%) than women allocated to intermittent auscultation. There were no differences between groups in other secondary outcome measures including incidence and severity of hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (incidence only reported) (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.37 to 3.90; 2367 infants; 1 trial; very low quality evidence) and incidence of seizures in the neonatal period (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.61; 8056 infants; 1 trial; low quality evidence). There were no data reported for severe neurodevelopmental disability assessed at greater than, or equal to, 12 months of age.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-01-10 10:36:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Contrary to continued use in some clinical areas, we found no evidence of benefit for the use of the admission CTG for low-risk women on admission in labour.</P>
<P>Furthermore, the probability is that admission CTG increases the caesarean section rate by approximately 20%. The data lacked power to detect possible important differences in perinatal mortality. However, it is unlikely that any trial, or meta-analysis, will be adequately powered to detect such differences. The findings of this review support recommendations that the admission CTG not be used for women who are low risk on admission in labour. Women should be informed that admission CTG is likely associated with an increase in the incidence of caesarean section without evidence of benefit.</P>
<P>Evidence quality ranged from moderate to very low, with downgrading decisions based on imprecision, inconsistency and a lack of blinding for participants and personnel. All four included trials were conducted in developed Western European countries. One additional study is ongoing.</P>
<P>The usefulness of the findings of this review for developing countries will depend on FHR monitoring practices. However, an absence of benefit and likely harm associated with admission CTG will have relevance for countries where questions are being asked about the role of the admission CTG.</P>
<P>Future studies evaluating the effects of the admission CTG should consider including women admitted with signs of labour and before a formal diagnosis of labour. This would include a cohort of women currently having admission CTGs and not included in current trials.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2017-01-13 10:55:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-01-10 10:50:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Assessment of fetal wellbeing throughout pregnancy, labour and birth is widely regarded as a fundamental component of maternity care and essential for optimising fetal outcomes. Although a variety of methods are used to assess fetal wellbeing, including fetal movement counting and biophysical tests such as Doppler ultrasound, monitoring of the fetal heart rate (FHR) remains the most common method for the assessment of fetal wellbeing (<LINK REF="REF-Alfirevic-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alfirevic 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NCCWCH-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCCWCH 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>The FHR undergoes constant changes in response to changes in the intrauterine environment and to other stimuli such as uterine contractions. These changes in the FHR can be monitored to assess the wellbeing of the fetus during pregnancy and labour.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-01-10 10:50:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two common methods of monitoring the FHR are by intermittent auscultation and by an electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) machine that produces a printout called a cardiotocograph (CTG) (<LINK REF="REF-Ayres_x002d_de_x002d_Campos-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ayres-de-Campos 2015</LINK>). Intermittent auscultation involves listening to the fetal heart at predetermined intervals using either a Pinard stethoscope or a hand-held Doppler ultrasound device. The CTG is a graphical printout of the FHR and uterine contractions. The FHR recorded on a CTG may be captured externally via an ultrasound transducer attached to the mother's abdomen, or internally via a fetal scalp electrode placed directly on the baby's head. Uterine contractions are recorded via a pressure transducer attached to the mother's abdomen or, less commonly, by an intrauterine pressure device placed in the uterine cavity (<LINK REF="REF-Ayres_x002d_de_x002d_Campos-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ayres-de-Campos 2015</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-01-09 23:17:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>The admission CTG is a commonly-used screening test consisting of a short, usually 20 minute, recording of the FHR and uterine activity performed on the mother's admission to the labour ward with signs of labour (<LINK REF="STD-Cheyne-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cheyne 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Impey-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Impey 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mires-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mires 2001</LINK>). Anecdotally, some women will have an admission CTG performed before assessments aimed at diagnosing the onset of labour, while others will not have the admission CTG until a diagnosis of labour has been established. The implications of this are that some women will have an admission CTG performed on admission to the labour ward or labour assessment room where, on subsequent assessment, a diagnosis of not being in labour is made. Differences in timing of the admission CTG with respect to the onset of labour may result in differences in outcomes assessed. We planned to explore this through subgroup analysis (see <LINK TAG="SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS" TYPE="SECTION">Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-01-09 23:31:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>Pioneered in the 1950s and 1960s as an alternative to intermittent auscultation of the FHR by stethoscope or Pinard (<LINK REF="REF-Caldeyro_x002d_Barcia-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caldeyro-Barcia 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hammacher-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hammacher 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hon-1958" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hon 1958</LINK>), EFM was introduced into widespread clinical practice in the 1970s to 1980s on the premise that it would facilitate early detection of abnormal FHR patterns thought to be associated with hypoxia (lack of oxygen), to enable earlier intervention to prevent fetal neurological damage and death or both (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>However, because antenatal risk factors do not identify all fetuses who will subsequently experience morbidity, mortality, or both, the admission CTG was introduced as a means of attempting to identify those fetuses of low-risk mothers at greatest risk of intrapartum hypoxia (<LINK REF="REF-Arulkumaran-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arulkumaran 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-RCOG-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCOG 2001</LINK>) who might benefit from more intensive monitoring by continuous EFM and fetal scalp blood gas analysis or both, or from immediate intervention (e.g. expedited birth). </P>
<P>Current prevalence rates of perinatal mortality, neonatal encephalopathy and cerebral palsy are relatively low and, of those, only a small proportion are thought to be attributable directly to intrapartum causes (<LINK REF="REF-RCOG-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCOG 2001</LINK>). Changes in FHR patterns are neither sensitive (the ability of a test to identify those who have the disease or condition) nor specific (the ability of the test to correctly identify those without the disease or condition) to any particular cause (<LINK REF="REF-MacLennan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacLennan 1999</LINK>). Multiple late decelerations and decreased FHR variability have been shown to be associated with an increased risk of cerebral palsy (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 1996</LINK>). However, the associated false positive rate is reported as high as 99.8% in the presence of tracings displaying these abnormalities in the FHR pattern (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 1996</LINK>). This poor positive predictive value implies that to identify the fetus who may be compromised, EFM identifies abnormal FHR patterns in many healthy fetuses who are not truly compromised.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-01-10 10:37:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a lack of evidence of benefit supporting the use of the admission CTG in low-risk pregnancy. Despite recommendations that it should not be recommended for this group of women (<LINK REF="REF-Liston-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liston 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NCCWCH-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCCWCH 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-RCOG-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCOG 2001</LINK>), the admission CTG was used by approximately 79% of maternity units in the UK in 2000 (<LINK REF="REF-CESDI-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">CESDI 2001</LINK>), by 96% of units in Ireland in 2004 (<LINK REF="REF-Devane-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Devane 2007</LINK>) and by approximately 76% of Canadian hospitals (<LINK REF="REF-Kaczorowski-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaczorowski 1998</LINK>). More recently, the admission CTG was used in all (100%, n = 42) labour units in Sweden in 2008 (<LINK REF="REF-Holzmann-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holzmann 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although the admission CTG remains in widespread use, several issues remain controversial. These include whether the admission CTG (a) should be offered routinely to all women without risk factors for intrapartum hypoxia; (b) whether the admission CTG is effective at predicting those fetuses who will subsequently develop intrapartum hypoxia; and (c) the effect of the admission CTG on neonatal mortality and on maternal and neonatal morbidity.</P>
<P>It was important to undertake this systematic review to explore these issues and to evaluate the efficacy of admission CTG compared to intermittent auscultation as a method of assessing fetal wellbeing in women on admission to the labour ward, or labour assessment room, with signs of possible labour. This review complements other Cochrane systematic reviews evaluating the effectiveness of other interventions for the assessment of fetal wellbeing including the following.</P>

<P>Pregnant women between 37 and 42 completed weeks of pregnancy and considered to be at low risk of intrapartum fetal hypoxia and of developing complications during labour were included. It is recognised that there is much debate surrounding the definition of what constitutes 'normality' and concerns have been expressed at what some regard as the disempowering concept of risk classification (<LINK REF="REF-Gail_x002d_Thomas-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gail-Thomas 2003</LINK>). In addition, the predictive value of risk scoring during pregnancy is poor (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1999</LINK>). However, given the consensus of opinion that continuous electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) should be reserved for women whose fetuses are at high or increased risk of cerebral palsy, neonatal encephalopathy or perinatal death (<LINK REF="REF-Liston-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liston 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NCCWCH-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCCWCH 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-RANZCOG-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">RANZCOG 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-RCOG-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCOG 2001</LINK>), where sufficient detail was provided by trial authors, we determined eligibility of participants based on absence of risk factors identified in international guidelines for EFM (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>).</P>

A summary of the intervention effect and a measure of quality for each of the above outcomes was produced using the GRADE approach. The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome. The evidence can be downgraded from high quality by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious) limitations, depending on assessments for risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates or potential publication bias.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2016-09-12 13:48:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We carried out statistical analyses using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). The largest of the four included trials (<LINK REF="STD-Impey-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Impey 2003</LINK>) included women in whom the liquor was known to be clear (i.e. only women who had either a spontaneous rupture of the membranes or an amniotomy were included in the study). This knowledge of the presence of clear liquor would have given clinicians an additional clinical feature used in the assessment of fetal well being that would not have been available for all women included in the other three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Cheyne-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cheyne 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mires-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mires 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mitchell-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mitchell 2008</LINK>) where membrane rupture and clear liquor were not inclusion criteria. Because of this, we believed that there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects would differ between the included trials (and in particular between the <LINK REF="STD-Impey-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Impey 2003</LINK> trial and the other three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Cheyne-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cheyne 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mires-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mires 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mitchell-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mitchell 2008</LINK>)). We therefore used random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary of the average treatment effect across the four included trials. We have treated this random-effects summary as the average range of possible treatment effects. For each outcome reported, we present the results of the random-effects analyses as the average treatment effect with its 95% confidence interval, and the estimates of Tau² and I².</P>

All four studies included women in labour. Therefore, we were unable to perform our planned subgroup analysis by whether or not women were in labour or not on clinical assessment post the admission cardiotocograph (CTG) (see <LINK TAG="SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS" TYPE="SECTION">Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</LINK>).</P>
<P>Three studies included women in spontaneous labour only (<LINK REF="STD-Cheyne-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cheyne 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mitchell-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mitchell 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mires-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mires 2001</LINK>) and one included women who were in spontaneous or induced labour (<LINK REF="STD-Impey-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Impey 2003</LINK>). All studies included women who were regarded as being at "low risk" of maternal and fetal complications with the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Impey-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Impey 2003</LINK> who included a relatively small (approximately 5%) proportion of women with a previous caesarean section and prior to 37 completed weeks' gestation.

<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Mires-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mires 2001</LINK>) recruited women (N = 3752) to the study and randomised them to admission CTG or intermittent auscultation during the third trimester. However, some women developed an obstetric complication between randomisation and admission in labour that warranted continuous FHR monitoring in labour, such that only 2367 women were judged to be at low risk when in labour (1186 admission CTG, 1181 intermittent auscultation). Of the 1881 women randomised to intermittent auscultation in the third trimester, 704 (37%) developed complications during pregnancy and required an admission CTG on admission to the labour ward. However, the proportion of women who developed complications were similar in each group, suggesting an absence of differential treatment of women post-randomisation. The trial author kindly provided data separately for the outcomes in this subgroup of women, and we have included these data in the main analyses in this review (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>).</P>
<P>A second study (<LINK REF="STD-Impey-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Impey 2003</LINK>) randomised women at the point of labour. However, this study included a relatively small number (fewer than 5%) of women who had a previous lower segment caesarean section and who went into labour prior to 37 completed weeks' gestation. The trial author kindly provided data separately for the outcomes for women between 37 and 42 completed weeks with no previous caesarean section and we have included these data in the main analyses in this review. We explored the dependency of the findings of this review on the decision to use data from the low-risk subgroups of women in both the <LINK REF="STD-Impey-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Impey 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mires-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mires 2001</LINK> studies through a post-hoc sensitivity analysis in which the primary analysis was repeated with data from the whole groups as randomised in both studies. Results for this were consistent with primary comparison effects for the low-risk subgroup of women with the exception of two outcomes. Caesarean section became statistically significant, with significantly more women allocated to admission CTG having, on average, a caesarean section compared with women allocated to intermittent auscultation (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.34, 4 trials, 13,247 women, T² = 0.00, I² = 0%, Analysis 2.1). Epidural also became significant, with significantly more women allocated to intermittent auscultation having, on average, an epidural compared with women allocated to admission CTG (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.22, 2 trials, 4085 women, T² = 0.00, I² = 0%, Analysis 2.6).</P>
<P>In the main comparison, three outcomes (instrumental vaginal birth, continuous EFM during labour and epidurals) had significant statistical heterogeneity where T² was greater than zero and either I² was greater than 30% or there was a low P value (&lt; 0.10) in the Chi² test for heterogeneity. On investigating this heterogeneity, we found that the <LINK REF="STD-Mires-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mires 2001</LINK> study appeared to drive the heterogeneity for instrumental vaginal birth and continuous EFM during labour. When <LINK REF="STD-Mires-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mires 2001</LINK> was removed from analyses for each of these two outcomes, the heterogeneity was no longer substantial. Removal of <LINK REF="STD-Mires-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mires 2001</LINK> from analyses for each of these two outcomes did not alter the direction or significance of the effect. Heterogentity for the third outcome, epidural, seemed to be driven by <LINK REF="STD-Impey-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Impey 2003</LINK>, which in contrast to the direction of effect of the other two studies included in this outcome, found a non-significant reduction in epidurals in women allocated to admission CTG.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-01-10 01:58:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>This updated review included four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Cheyne-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cheyne 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Impey-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Impey 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mires-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mires 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mitchell-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mitchell 2008</LINK>) involving more than 13,000 women. All four studies included women in labour. No new studies were included in the update.</P>
<P>The admission cardiotocograph (CTG) was introduced as a means of attempting to identify those fetuses at greatest risk of intrapartum hypoxia (<LINK REF="REF-Arulkumaran-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arulkumaran 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-RCOG-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCOG 2001</LINK>) who might benefit from more intensive monitoring by continuous electronic fetal monitoring and fetal scalp blood gas analysis, or both, or from immediate intervention (e.g. expedited birth). Although there was no significant difference in caesarean sections (using a strict P = 0.05 criterion) between women allocated to admission CTG and women allocated to intermittent auscultation, on average the probability is that admission CTG increases the caesarean section rate by approximately 20%. This is reinforced by the 95% confidence interval (CI) just reaching 1.00 and by the absence of measurable heterogeneity in this outcome analysis. Further, all four included studies found fewer caesarean sections associated with intermittent auscultation, although no individual study showed a statistically significant difference. Although numbers needed to treat/harm (NNT/H) analyses remain controversial in the context of meta-analysis, and should be interpreted with caution, we estimated that overall, one additional caesarean section was performed for every 136 women monitored continuously (risk difference (RD) (controls-treated) = -0.0074 (-0.015 to -0.0002), 95% CI 69 to 5641).<BR/>
</P>
<P>On average, women allocated to admission CTG had a significantly higher rate of continuous electronic fetal monitoring during labour and fetal blood sampling than women allocated to intermittent auscultation.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-01-10 10:39:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All four included studies provide relevant evidence on the effects of the admission CTG compared with intermittent auscultation on maternal and infant outcomes for pregnant women without risk factors on their admission to the labour ward. There are three important points in discussing how the results of the review fit into the context of current practice. Firstly, the largest study in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Impey-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Impey 2003</LINK>) included women in which the colour of the liquor was known to be clear. As such, clinicians caring for these women had an additional, and important, feature used in the overall assessment of fetal wellbeing. Secondly, all four studies included women in either spontaneous or induced labour. In some practice contexts, the admission CTG is performed in the absence of a diagnosis of labour, that is, an admission CTG is done before an assessment to diagnose labour is made. Thirdly, in <LINK REF="STD-Mitchell-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mitchell 2008</LINK>, women allocated to admission CTG received a routine 15-minute CTG. This is less than the 20 minutes recommended for visual assessment of fetal heart rate (FHR) reactivity by some guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-RCOG-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCOG 2001</LINK>). These points should be considered in determining the applicability of the evidence presented here to different practice contexts.</P>
<P>It is reasonable to assume that outcomes related to perinatal death are perhaps those of most importance to women and maternity care professionals. In this review, there was no significant difference in perinatal mortality between admission CTG and intermittent auscultation. However, to identify correctly a 20% reduction in proportion of perinatal deaths (assuming a developed world rate of seven per 1000) between admission CTG and intermittent auscultation, a sample size of more than 100,000 is required (with &#945; = 0.05, &#946;-1 = 20%) and even then a 20% reduction might be regarded as optimistic, with lower effect sizes requiring higher sample sizes. Such sample sizes are unlikely, except perhaps in the largest of mega-trials, and therefore, typical randomised trials and systematic reviews of these trials, including this review, are insufficiently powered to evaluate the effects of different fetal monitoring modalities on fetal and neonatal mortality measures. Therefore, while this review found no evidence of an effect for admission CTG on perinatal mortality, this should not be confused with evidence of no effect.</P>
<P>There are other important outcomes, which are not reported, are unavailable or are not in a suitable format to be included in the analysis; these include perceived control and satisfaction with labour. This reflects a widespread tendency among the clinical and research community to frame outcomes in a non-salutogenic or pathological manner (e.g. operative birth) rather than in a salutogenic, wellbeing-orientated manner (e.g. normal birth). It may also reflect the relative difficulty of quantifying outcomes that are subjective and difficult, although important, to measure.</P>
<P>In addition to statistical heterogeneity, there was evidence of clinical heterogeneity between studies in the numbers of women having an epidural. In <LINK REF="STD-Impey-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Impey 2003</LINK>, significantly more women allocated to intermittent auscultation had an epidural compared with women allocated to admission CTG. This contrasts with <LINK REF="STD-Mires-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mires 2001</LINK>, who found significantly fewer epidurals in women allocated to intermittent auscultation. The third study reporting on this outcome, <LINK REF="STD-Cheyne-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cheyne 2003</LINK>, found no significant difference in epidurals between groups. It is difficult to explain such heterogeneity. All three studies found an increased rate of continuous electronic fetal monitoring for women allocated to admission CTG, making it unlikely that differing practices in use of continuous electronic fetal monitoring indications give rise to differential effects on epidural use. Futhermore, although the labours of nulliparous women in <LINK REF="STD-Impey-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Impey 2003</LINK> were managed actively, the package of care for active management in labour has not been shown to impact on epidural rates (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2008</LINK>).</P>

<P>Overall, risk of bias of the four included studies was assessed as low across all domains (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>) with the exception of performance bias, which was judged to be high risk across all included outcomes for all studies, and blinded outcome assessment (detection bias), which was unclear in <LINK REF="STD-Mitchell-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mitchell 2008</LINK> and not carried out in <LINK REF="STD-Cheyne-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cheyne 2003</LINK>. Of the 3752 women randomised during the third trimester in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Mires-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mires 2001</LINK>, 37% developed an obstetric complication between randomisation and admission in labour that warranted continuous FHR monitoring in labour. Specific complications are given and these are in line with clinical norms reported in the literature. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Impey-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Impey 2003</LINK> also included a small proportion of women with risk factors. Both <LINK REF="STD-Impey-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Impey 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mires-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mires 2001</LINK> provided data for the subgroup of low-risk women, and these data were used in the main analyses in this review. Sensitivity analyses were done in which the outcomes for all randomised women were used. Results were consistent with the main comparison effects, with the exception of two outcomes. Caesarean section became statistically significant, with significantly more women allocated to admission CTG having, on average, a caesarean section compared with women allocated to intermittent auscultation. Epidural also became significant, with significantly more women allocated to intermittent auscultation having, on average, an epidural compared with women allocated to admission CTG. However, these findings should be interpreted with caution. For the outcome caesarean section in whole-group comparison, <LINK REF="STD-Mires-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mires 2001</LINK> contributes most weight to the meta-analysis. However, in this study 37% (N = 704) of women randomised to intermittent auscultation developed complications during pregnancy and required admission CTG on admission.</P>
<P>Funding was provided by the hospitals where the trials took place (<LINK REF="STD-Cheyne-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cheyne 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Impey-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Impey 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mitchell-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mitchell 2008</LINK>) or by government grants (<LINK REF="STD-Mires-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mires 2001</LINK>). There were no declarations of interest made in <LINK REF="STD-Impey-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Impey 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mires-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mires 2001</LINK>. The other two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Cheyne-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cheyne 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mitchell-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mitchell 2008</LINK>) did not mention any declarations of interest.</P>
<P>The GRADE approach was used to assess evidence quality. All outcomes, with the exception of perinatal mortality rate, were downgraded for lack of blinding because it was felt that knowledge of allocation could affect the outcomes. The level of evidence for incidence of caesarean section was graded moderate. The other maternal outcomes (incidence of operative vaginal birth and of continuous electronic fetal monitoring during labour) were downgraded for imprecision and inconsistency respectively; the level of evidence for both outcomes was graded low. The evidence for perinatal mortality rate was graded moderate for imprecision due to wide confidence intervals crossing the line of no effect. Incidence of seizures in the neonatal period was graded low for imprecision<I>.</I> Incidence of hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy was downgraded for wide confidence intervals crossing the line of no effect, few events and having data contributed from one small study meaning its level of evidence was graded very low. One main outcome (severe neurodevelopmental disability assessed at 12 months of age or more) selected for the 'Summary of findings' table was not reported. See <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>.</P>

<P>It is possible that we introduced bias during the review process. However, we attempted to minimise bias by applying the following approaches: two review authors (DD, JGL) independently assessed for inclusion all the potential studies identified as a result of the search strategy. We attempted to identify all relevant trials by conducting a comprehensive search of the literature.</P>
<P>Declan Devane and Valerie Smith are currently conducting a trial, known as the ADCAR Trial, evaluating the effectiveness of the admission CTG compared with intermittent auscultation. This study is ongoing; however, if it is completed for future review updates, neither author will be involved in assessing the trial for inclusion, assessing risk of bias, or data extraction.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-01-05 00:27:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>Contrary to continued use in some clinical areas, we found no evidence of benefit for the use of the admission cardiotocograph (CTG) for low-risk women on admission in labour. Furthermore, the probability is that admission CTG increases the caesarean section rate by approximately 20%. The data lacked power to detect possible important differences in perinatal mortality. However, it is unlikely that any trial, or meta-analysis, will be adequately powered to detect such differences. The findings of this review support recommendations that the admission CTG not be used for women who are low risk on admission in labour (<LINK REF="REF-Liston-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liston 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NCCWCH-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCCWCH 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-RCOG-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCOG 2001</LINK>). Women should be informed that admission CTG is likely associated with an increase in the incidence of caesarean section without evidence of benefit.</P>
<P>It is important to note that all four trials included in this review were conducted in developed Western European countries. The usefulness of the findings of this review for developing countries will depend on FHR monitoring practices. However, an absence of benefit and likely harm associated with admission CTG will have relevance for countries where questions are being asked about the role of the admission CTG.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-01-05 00:23:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>All four included studies used the admission CTG on women in spontaneous or induced labour. Future studies evaluating the effects of the admission CTG should consider including women admitted with signs of labour and prior to a formal diagnosis of labour. This would include a cohort of women currently having admission CTGs and not included in current trials. The largest study in this review includes women where the colour of the liquor was known to be clear. Additional studies that evaluate the effects of the admission CTG on women where the colour of the amniotic fluid is not known are needed. Should future trials, including the ongoing ADCAR trial, identify differences in short term perinatal outcomes, information about long term neurodevelopmental outcomes will become important.</P>

<B>Participants randomised:</B> 3752 women randomised. "No data collected n = 1" (1866 admission CTG, 1885 intermittent auscultation).</P>
<P>A total of 3752 women were recruited to the study and randomised during the third trimester. However, some women developed an obstetric complication between randomisation and admission in labour that warranted continuous FHR monitoring in labour, such that only 2367 women were judged to be low-risk when in labour (1186 admission CTG, 1181 intermittent auscultation). The trial author kindly provided data separately for the outcomes in this subgroup of women and these data are used in the main analyses in this review. Sensitivity analyses were done in which the outcomes for all randomised women were used.</P>
