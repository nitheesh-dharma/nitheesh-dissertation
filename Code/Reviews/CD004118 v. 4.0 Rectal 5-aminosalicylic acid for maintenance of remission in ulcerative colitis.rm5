<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-10-11 11:53:10 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) is a commonly used medication for treatment of mild and moderately active ulcerative colitis (UC) and UC in remission. When UC affects only the lower third of the colon, 5-ASA can be delivered as a rectal suppository, foam or liquid enema. This review includes nine randomized trials with a total of 484 participants. The limited data available suggest that rectal 5-ASA is effective and safe for maintenance of remission in UC. Rectal 5-ASA was found to be superior to placebo (e.g. enema or suppository with no active medicine). There was no difference in the incidence of side effects between rectal 5-ASA and placebo groups. Side effects were generally mild in nature and common side effects included anal irritation and abdominal pain. Studies comparing rectal 5-ASA with oral 5-ASA (pills) found no differences in effectiveness for maintenance therapy. Well designed randomized trials are needed to investigate different doses of rectal 5-ASA for maintenance therapy, Future studies should assess the effectiveness of combination therapy of oral 5-ASA with rectal 5-ASA as this has been found to be effective in active UC and has not been investigated for maintenance therapy. Future studies should also compare rectal 5-ASA with rectal corticosteroids.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-10-11 11:51:49 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials comparing rectal 5-ASA to placebo or another active treatment for a minimum duration of six months. Symptom scores needed to be assessed in at least one study outcome. Patients had to be at least 12 years of age with disease extent less than 60 cm from the anal verge or distal to the splenic flexure, as determined by barium enema, colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy. Patients were expected to be in remission prior to the treatment trial.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-10-11 12:38:00 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Study eligibility was independently assessed by three authors. Data were extracted using standardized forms by two independent reviewers, with inter-rater agreement assessed using Cohen's Kappa and disagreements resolved by consensus. In cases where clarification of study results or methodology was needed, corresponding authors were contacted. The methodological quality of each trial was assessed by the Cochrane risk of bias tool and by a 30-point scale developed and used previously by the authors. Pooled risk ratios (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) for continued clinical, endoscopic and histologic remission were estimated for comparisons between rectal 5-ASA and placebo or oral 5-ASA, and for comparisons among 5-ASA doses. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test and visual inspection of forest plots. If no significant heterogeneity was identified (P &gt; 0.10 for Chi<SUP>2</SUP>) a fixed-effect model (Mantel-Haenstzel) was used. If heterogeneity was significant, a random-effects model was used.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-10-11 12:38:18 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nine studies (484 patients) met the pre-specified inclusion criteria (Kappa 1.00). Six studies were rated as low risk of bias. Three studies were rated as high risk of bias due to blinding (two open label and one single-blind). The total daily dose of rectal 5-ASA ranged from 0.5 g to 4 g, and dose frequency ranged from once to three times daily. 5-ASA was delivered as liquid enema in five studies or as a suppository in four studies. Follow-up ranged from 6 to 24 months. Rectal 5-ASA was significantly superior to placebo for maintenance of symptomatic remission over a period of 12 months.Sixty-two per cent of patients in the rectal 5-ASA group maintained symptomatic remission compared to 30% of patients in the placebo group (4 studies; 301 patients; RR 2.22, 95% CI 1.26 to 3.90; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 67%; P &lt; 0.01). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence for the primary outcome was low due to imprecision (i.e. sparse data 144 events) and inconsistency (i.e. unexplained heterogeneity). Rectal 5-ASA was significantly superior to placebo for maintenance of endoscopic remission over a 12 month period. Seventy-five per cent of patients in the rectal 5-ASA group maintained endoscopic remission compared to 15% of patients in the placebo group (1 study; 25 patients; RR 4.88, 95% CI 1.31 to 18.18; P &lt; 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of patients who experienced at least one adverse event. Sixteen per cent of patients in the rectal 5-ASA group experienced at least one adverse compared to 12% of placebo patients (2 studies; 160 patients; RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.63 to 2.89; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%; P = 0.44). The most commonly reported adverse events were anal irritation and abdominal pain. No statistically significant differences between rectal and oral 5-ASA were identified for either symptomatic or endoscopic remission over a period of six months. Eighty per cent of patients in the rectal 5-ASA group maintained symptomatic remission compared to 65% of patients in the oral 5-ASA group (2 studies; 69 patients; RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.66; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%; P = 0.15). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence for the primary outcome was low due to imprecision (i.e. sparse data 50 events) and high risk of bias (i.e. both studies in the pooled analysis were open label). Eighty per cent of patients in the rectal 5-ASA group maintained endoscopic remission compared to 70% of patients in the oral 5-ASA group (2 studies; 91 patients; RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.45; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%; P = 0.26). In two small trials, one comparing 2 g/day 5-ASA enemas to 4 g/day 5-ASA enemas and the other comparing 0.5 g/day 5-ASA suppositories to 1 g/day 5-ASA suppositories no dose response relationship was observed. </P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-10-11 11:51:00 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>The limited data available suggest that rectal 5-ASA is effective and safe for maintenance of remission of mild to moderately active distal UC. Well designed randomized trials are needed to establish the optimal dosing regimen for rectal 5-ASA, to compare rectal 5-ASA with rectal corticosteroids and to identify subgroups of patients who are more or less responsive to specific rectal 5-ASA regimens. The combination of oral and rectal 5-ASA appears to be more effective than either oral or rectal monotherapy for induction of remission. The efficacy of combination therapy for maintenance of remission has not been assessed and could be evaluated in future trials. </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-10-11 11:56:38 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the colon which results in diarrhea, rectal bleeding and pain and reduced quality of life. The inflammation of UC always involves the rectum, and extends proximally in a continuous fashion for a variable distance. In distal UC, the disease does not extend proximal to the splenic flexure. Patients with UC often experience relapses of their disease followed by periods of remission which can last months or years. The goals of drug therapy are to induce and maintain remission, improve quality of life and minimize side effects. 5-ASA is considered a first-line therapy for mild to moderately active UC. Although its precise mechanism of action remains unclear, 5-ASA is believed to act topically. Oral 5-ASA formulations are designed to release active drug to the site of active inflammation. However 5-ASA can also be administered rectally in the form of a suppository, foam or liquid enema. The use of rectal 5-ASA has a number of potential advantages, including direct delivery of medication to the site of maximum inflammation and reduced systemic toxicity from mucosal absorption.</P>

<P>The Cochrane risk of bias tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) involves an assessment of the following items: the method of allocation generation (i.e. was the allocation sequence adequately generated?), allocation concealment (i.e. was allocation adequately concealed?), blinding (i.e. was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study?), incomplete outcome data (i.e. were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed?); and selective outcome reporting (i.e. are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting?). A judgement of 'Yes' indicates low risk of bias, 'No' indicates high risk of bias, and 'Unclear' indicates unclear or unknown risk of bias. </P>
<P>We used the GRADE approach for rating the overall quality of evidence for the primary outcomes and selected secondary outcomes of interest. Randomized trials start as high quality evidence, but may be downgraded due to: (1) limitations in design and implementation (risk of bias), (2) indirectness of evidence, (3) inconsistency (unexplained heterogeneity), (4) imprecision (sparse data), and (5) reporting bias (publication bias). The overall quality of evidence for each outcome was determined after considering each of these elements, and categorized as high quality (i.e. further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect); moderate<I> </I>quality<I> </I>(i.e. further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate); low quality (i.e. further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate); and very low quality (i.e. we are very uncertain about the estimate) (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2011</LINK>).</P>

<B>Statistical Analysis:</B>
</P>
<P>Risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for each binary endpoint (clinical, endoscopic, and histologic remission) for each trial. An intention to treat principle was followed, with the total number of patients randomized to each study arm used as the denominator for each proportion. A pooled RR and 95% CI was then calculated for each endpoint across all trials reporting that endpoint. A fixed-effect model (Mantel-Haenstzel) was used unless the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test and visual examination of forest plots showed significant heterogeneity (P &lt; 0.10). In that situation, a random-effects model was used. Pooled risk ratios were calculated for comparisons of rectal 5-ASA versus placebo and rectal 5-ASA versus oral 5-ASA, and for comparisons among rectal 5-ASA doses and formulations.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Andreoli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Andreoli 1994</LINK> conducted a two-phase single-blind study in patients with endoscopically documented active mild to moderate left-sided UC. In the first phase, 37 subjects received 5-ASA enemas 4 g daily after stopping all oral 5-ASA therapy. In the second phase, 31 subjects who entered endoscopic and histologic remission were randomized to either 5-ASA enemas 4 g twice weekly (n = 16) or oral sulphasalazine (SASP) 1 g twice daily (n = 15) for six months. Clinical outcomes were assessed monthly, and endoscopy was performed by a blinded endoscopist at six months or upon suspected relapse. The mucosal appearance was graded from zero to three according to <LINK REF="REF-McPhee-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">McPhee 1987</LINK>. Endoscopic relapse was defined by an endoscopic score greater than zero. After 6 months, 12 patients on rectal 5-ASA and 9 on oral SASP maintained clinical and endoscopic remission (difference not significant). The mean time to relapse was 3.0 months in the oral SASP group compared to 4.1 months in the rectal 5-ASA group (difference not significant). No significant adverse events were reported. The authors concluded that twice weekly 5-ASA enemas are as effective as oral SASP for maintaining remission induced by rectal 5-ASA.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Biddle1988" TYPE="STUDY">Biddle1988</LINK> randomized 25 subjects with endoscopically documented left-sided UC to 1 g 5-ASA enemas or placebo daily for one year. Subjects were eligible if they had been in symptomatic and endoscopic remission for at least one month using 1 g 5-ASA enemas and having weaned off concomitant oral 5-ASA and corticosteroids. Subjects were assessed clinically and endoscopically every four to six weeks. Disease activity was scored for stool frequency, rectal bleeding, mucosal appearance and physician global assessment with possible scores ranging from 0 to 12. Subjects with either no or mild symptoms, and either normal mucosal appearance or minimally active disease at endoscopy were considered to be in remission. Nine of 12 subjects on 5-ASA and 2 of 13 on placebo group remained in remission for 46 weeks (P &lt; 0.005). Two subjects in the 5-ASA group withdrew for personal reasons, and one subject relapsed 8 weeks after discontinuing 5-ASA for allergy (31 weeks after randomization). Of 13 subjects on placebo, 11 relapsed after a mean of 16 weeks. The authors concluded that 1 g 5-ASA enemas are safe and effective in maintaining remission of left-sided UC.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-d_x0027_Albasio-1990" TYPE="STUDY">d'Albasio 1990</LINK> randomized subjects with symptomatically, endoscopically and histologically quiescent ulcerative proctosigmoiditis, to 5-ASA enemas 4 g daily (n = 29) for the first seven days of each month or oral SASP 2 g daily (n = 31) for two years. All subjects were in clinical, histologic and endoscopic remission for at least two months prior to enrolment. Subjects were assessed clinically every two months. Disease activity was evaluated according to the <LINK REF="REF-Truelove-1956" TYPE="REFERENCE">Truelove 1956</LINK> criteria. Colonoscopy was performed by a blinded endoscopist every six months or upon symptom relapse, and graded according to <LINK REF="REF-Baron-1964" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baron 1964</LINK>. Subjects with mild symptoms and normal mucosa were considered to be in remission. Six patients on 5-ASA and nine on SASP stopped treatment or dropped out due to poor compliance. The actuarial relapse rates on 5-ASA compared to SASP were 20% and 24% at 12 months, and 37% versus 43% at 24 months (no significant difference). Mean time to relapse and severity of relapse were also similar. The study authors concluded that intermittent 5-ASA enemas are effective for maintaining remission of left-sided UC.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-d_x0027_Albasio-1998" TYPE="STUDY">d'Albasio 1998</LINK> conducted a multicenter double-blind trial to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of 5-ASA suppositories (500 mg twice daily or 500 mg once daily) versus placebo to maintain remission of ulcerative proctitis. Eligible subjects had a confirmed diagnosis of ulcerative proctitis that had relapsed within the previous six months but were currently in clinical, endoscopic and histological remission. Oral 5-ASA was stopped at least three days before study entry. Clinical remission was defined as the absence of visible blood and no more than two bowel movements per day. Randomization was carried out in blocks of three and stratified by center. Total duration of treatment was 12 months with clinical and endoscopic assessments at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Relapse was defined by symptoms and an endoscopic activity score greater than 1 according to <LINK REF="REF-Baron-1964" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baron 1964</LINK>. Histology was assessed by a blinded pathologist according to <LINK REF="REF-Truelove-1956" TYPE="REFERENCE">Truelove 1956</LINK>. One hundred and eleven patients were randomized to receive 500 mg 5-ASA suppositories twice daily (n = 36) or once daily (n = 40), or placebo (n = 35). Twenty subjects dropped out for poor compliance, withdrew for adverse events or were lost to follow up. Cumulative relapse rates at 12 months were 10% for twice daily 5-ASA, 32% for once daily 5-ASA and 47% for placebo (P = 0.035 for comparison of twice daily versus once daily 5-ASA, P = 0.007 for comparison of twice daily 5-ASA versus placebo).

<LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Arienzo-1990" TYPE="STUDY">D'Arienzo 1990</LINK> randomized 30 subjects with proctitis or proctosigmoiditis in "complete" steroid-free remission for at least one month to receive either 400 mg 5-ASA suppositories twice daily or placebo for one year in a double-blind trial. All oral 5-ASA was stopped at enrolment. Subjects completed a daily symptom diary and underwent monthly clinical and endoscopic assessments. Endoscopic appearance was graded according to <LINK REF="REF-Blackstone-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blackstone 1984</LINK> and biopsies were evaluated according to <LINK REF="REF-Friedman-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedman 1986</LINK>. Clinical remission was defined as the absence of blood, diarrhea, abdominal pain or tenesmus. Endoscopic and histologic remission were defined by scores of 0 or 1 on their respective scales. Two patients on 5-ASA and one on placebo withdrew. The cumulative remission rate at 12 months was 92% in the 5-ASA group compared to 21% in the placebo group (P &lt; 0.001). The authors concluded that 800 mg/day of 5-ASA administered as suppositories is safe and effective for maintaining remission of distal UC over one year.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Hanauer-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hanauer 2000</LINK> conducted a randomized double-blind multi-center trial comparing 5-ASA suppositories at a dose of 0.5 g once daily (n = 31) to placebo (n = 34) to maintain clinical and endoscopic remission of ulcerative proctitis for two years. Eligible subjects had ulcerative colitis limited to the rectum and were on no other oral or rectal medication for UC. Outcomes were assessed at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months using the Disease Activity Index (DAI). Clinical and endoscopic remission was defined as a DAI score of 0. Relapse was defined by endoscopic inflammation with rectal bleeding or increased stool frequency for at least one week. At 12 months, 19 subjects on 5-ASA and 4 on placebo remained in remission. At 24 months, 14 subjects on 5-ASA and 3 on placebo remained in remission (P &lt;0.001). The mean time to relapse was longer on 5-ASA (453 versus 158 days, P &lt;0.001). The authors concluded that 5-ASA suppositories are efficacious and safe for long term maintenance of remission in UC .</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Mantazaris-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Mantazaris 1994</LINK> randomized subjects with distal UC in clinical, endoscopic and histologic remission to either 4 g 5-ASA enemas every third night (n = 19) or oral 5-ASA 0.5 g three times per day (n = 19) for two years in an investigator-blind trial. Eligible subjects had not taken steroids for at least two months prior to enrolment. All subjects discontinued oral 5-ASA or SASP at enrolment. Subjects were assessed clinically and endoscopically every two months. Endoscopic disease activity was graded according to <LINK REF="REF-Riley-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riley 1988</LINK> and histology was graded according to <LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Arienzo-1990" TYPE="STUDY">D'Arienzo 1990</LINK>. No subjects were lost to follow-up. Relapse occurred over two years in 5 patients receiving 5-ASA enemas and 13 patients receiving oral 5-ASA. The actuarial relapse rate was 26% in the 5-ASA enema group compared to 68% in the oral 5-ASA group (P &lt;0.001). The authors concluded that intermittent 5-ASA enemas are more effective than oral 5-ASA for maintaining remission of distal UC.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Marteau-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Marteau 1998</LINK> conducted a multicenter trial which randomized 95 subjects with ulcerative proctitis in clinical and endoscopic remission to 1 g 5-ASA suppositories three times per week (n = 48) or placebo (n = 47) for 12 months. In the event of a relapse, the suppository dose was increased to daily. If remission was re-attained, daily dosing was continued. If remission was not re-attained, treatment was considered a failure. Eligible subjects had experienced at least two flares in the previous year and had been in clinical remission for less than two weeks (defined by an endoscopy score of zero or one according to <LINK REF="REF-Ng_x00f4_-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ngô 1992</LINK>, with no bleeding, mucus, diarrhea, pain or tenesmus). Oral 5-ASA was continued at stable dose throughout the study. Subjects were assessed clinically at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months, and endoscopically at 1, 6 and 12 months. The primary outcome measure was time to relapse, with relapse defined as symptoms with a one-point increase in endoscopy score and rectal bleeding at least twice in one day. Mean survival without relapse was 239 days in the 5-ASA group compared to 166 days in the placebo group (P = 0.067). Overall, 25 patients in the 5-ASA group and 18 in the placebo group remained in remission. The relapse rate was significantly lower on 5-ASA at 90 days (19% versus 38%, P = 0.035), 180 days (29% versus 54%, P = 0.017) and 270 days (38% versus 60%, P = 0.031) but not 365 days (48% versus 62%, P = 0.18). Increasing the dose upon relapse achieved remission in 11 of 18 patients on 5-ASA compared to 2 of 26 on placebo. The authors concluded that 5-ASA suppositories given three times per week are effective for preventing relapse of ulcerative proctitis, and that increasing to daily dosing was effective in a high proportion of subjects who relapsed.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Sutherland-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Sutherland 1987</LINK> conducted a randomized multi-center double-blind trial comparing 2 g 5-ASA enemas (n = 15) to 4 g 5-ASA enemas (n = 14) over six months in patients with UC extending no more than 50 cm from the anal verge at sigmoidoscopy. The disease activity index (DAI) was required to be less than or equal to four at enrolment. Oral steroids (i.e. less than 30 mg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and SASP were continued for the first month if taken for at least four weeks at stable dose prior to enrolment. These drugs were then discontinued in most subjects. Relapse was defined as a DAI greater than four. Patients were assessed monthly, with sigmoidoscopy repeated at three and six months. After six months, nine patients in each arm had maintained remission. Four subjects in the 2 g group and two subjects in the 4 g dropped out of the study. The authors concluded that 2 g 5-ASA enemas are as effective as 4 g 5-ASA enemas for maintaining remission of distal UC.</P>

<B>Rectal 5-ASA versus Placebo:</B>
<BR/>Rectal 5-ASA was significantly superior to placebo for maintaining symptomatic remission over a period of 12 months. Sixty-two per cent of patients in the rectal 5-ASA group maintained symptomatic remission compared to 30% of patients in the placebo group (4 studies; 301 patients; RR 2.22, 95% CI 1.26 to 3.90; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 67%; P &lt; 0.01). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence for the primary outcome for the placebo-controlled studies (maintenance of symptomatic remission at study end point) was low due to imprecision (i.e. sparse data 144 events) and inconsistency (i.e. unexplained heterogeneity) (See <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). Rectal 5-ASA was significantly superior to placebo for maintaining endoscopic remission over a period of 12 months. Seventy-five per cent of patients in the rectal 5-ASA group maintained endoscopic remission compared to 15% of patients in the placebo group (1 study; 25 patients; RR 4.88, 95% CI 1.31 to 18.18; P &lt; 0.05).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-10-11 12:45:30 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The results of this systematic review suggest that rectal 5-ASA therapy is effective and safe for maintaining remission of mild to moderately active distal UC. Rectal 5-ASA was significantly superior to placebo for maintaining symptomatic remission in four trials, and endoscopic remission in one trial. However, a GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence for the primary outcome for the placebo-controlled studies (maintenance of symptomatic remission at study end point) was low due to imprecision (i.e. sparse data 144 events) and inconsistency (i.e. unexplained heterogeneity). More research is needed to confirm the efficacy and safety of rectal 5-ASA therapy for maintenance of remission in quiescent UC. Three trials comparing oral with rectal 5-ASA failed to demonstrate a clear advantage for either route of administration. Accordingly, rectal 5-ASA could be considered as an alternative to conventional oral 5-ASA therapy for maintaining remission of UC when the proximal margin of disease is distal to the splenic flexure.</P>
<P>No eligible trials compared rectal 5-ASA to other therapies such as rectal corticosteroids. <LINK REF="REF-Lindgren-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindgren 2002</LINK> has compared budesonide to placebo as maintenance therapy for UC, but showed no significant difference in efficacy or adrenal axis activity. Future trials comparing rectal 5-ASA with rectal budesonide (or other topical corticosteroids) are needed.</P>
<P>For this meta-analysis, data were extracted for endpoints of symptomatic and endoscopic remission using the original authors' definitions of endpoints. In fact, we observed considerable heterogeneity among definitions of these endpoints. Standardized definitions of disease activity have been advocated (<LINK REF="REF-Travis-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Travis 2011</LINK>), to facilitate comparisons of efficacy across trials and to facilitate future quantitative pooling of common outcome measures.</P>
<P>The overall safety of rectal 5ASA appears to be excellent, with no serious adverse effects reported and no significant differences relative to oral therapy. Furthermore, patient acceptance of rectal therapies appears to be good, although this was assessed formally in only one eligible trial. More studies are needed to evaluate patient preference for and compliance with long-term rectally-administered maintenance therapies.</P>
<P>The optimal dosing regimen for rectal 5-ASA maintenance therapy needs to be further investigated. Two trials failed to demonstrate a dose response when comparing different total daily doses of 5-ASA. However, two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Andreoli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Andreoli 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marteau-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Marteau 1998</LINK>) demonstrated the efficacy of intermittent rectal 5-ASA dosing for maintaining remission. Further research is needed to compare dosing regimens that differ by total daily dose, dose frequency and dose formulation (e.g. enema versus foam versus suppository). Furthermore, the duration of studies included in this review ranged from six to twenty four months, but the optimal duration of maintenance therapy after successful induction of remission also remains unclear.</P>
<P>We were unable to compare the efficacy of various rectal 5-ASA regimens across patient subtypes defined by disease severity (e.g. mild versus moderate), prior 5-ASA exposure and response, and proximal disease margin. For induction of remission, rectal 5-ASA has proven to be efficacious and safe for both distal and extensive colitis (<LINK REF="REF-Marteau-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marteau 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2010</LINK>). Additional trials are needed to assess response to rectal 5-ASA therapy in these subgroups.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-10-11 12:16:40 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K Marshall">
<P>Overall, the number of subjects evaluated in clinical trials of rectal 5ASA for maintaining remission of distal UC is small. Well designed randomized trials are needed to establish the optimal dosing regimen for rectal 5-ASA, to compare rectal 5-ASA with rectal corticosteroids and to identify subgroups of patients who are more or less responsive to specific rectal 5-ASA regimens. The combination of oral and rectal 5-ASA appears to be more effective than either oral or rectal monotherapy for induction of remission. The efficacy of combination therapy for maintenance of remission has not been assessed and could be evaluated in future trials.</P>
