<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-11-28 04:28:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Night-time bedwetting is common in childhood, and can cause stigma, stress and inconvenience. Alarms offer the best chance of cure, and desmopressin may be used to reduce or stop wet nights during treatment. Simple behavioural methods such as rewards also help, especially as first line treatment. People often use complementary methods to treat their children, but the review of trials did not provide good evidence to support this. There was no reliable information comparing complementary methods with established effective methods such as alarms and desmopressin. Further research is needed.</P>

<P>We searched PubMed (1950 to June 2010), EMBASE (1980 to June 2010), the Traditional Chinese Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System (TCMLARS) (1984 to June 2010), Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM) (1975 to June 2010), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) (1979 to June 2010), VIP database (1989 to June 2010), and the reference lists of relevant articles, all last searched 26 June 2010.

<P>All randomised or quasi-randomised trials of complementary and other miscellaneous interventions for nocturnal enuresis in children were included except those focused solely on daytime wetting.

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-11-07 11:26:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In 24 randomised controlled trials, 2334 children were studied, of whom 1283 received a complementary intervention. The quality of the trials was poor: 5 trials were quasi-randomised, 5 showed differences at baseline and 17 lacked follow up data.</P>
<P>The outcome was better after hypnosis than imipramine in one trial (relative risk (RR) for failure or relapse after stopping treatment 0.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23 to 0.78). Psychotherapy appeared to be better in terms of fewer children failing or relapsing than both alarm (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.85) and rewards (RR 0.29, 95%CI 0.09 to 0.90) but this depended on data from only one trial. Medicinal herbs had better results than desmopressin in one trial (RR for failure or relapse after stopping treatment 0.35, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.85). Acupuncture had better results than sham control acupuncture (RR for failure or relapse after stopping treatment 0.67, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.94) in a further trial. Active chiropractic adjustment had better results than sham adjustment (RR for failure to improve 0.76, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.95). However, each of these findings came from small single trials, and must be verified in further trials. The findings for diet and faradization were unreliable, and there were no trials including homeopathy or surgery.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-11-07 11:26:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is one of seven reviews of interventions for bedwetting (non-organic nocturnal enuresis). The others focus on: alarms, desmopressin, tricyclics and related drugs, other drugs, simple behavioural training and complex and educational interventions. All seven were originally based on the work of Lister-Sharp and her colleagues at the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination at the University of York, UK (<LINK REF="REF-Lister_x002d_Sharp-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lister-Sharp 1997</LINK>).</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-11-07 11:25:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nocturnal enuresis is the involuntary loss of urine at night, in the absence of organic disease, at an age when a child could reasonably be expected to be dry (by consensus, at a developmental age of five years) (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1992</LINK>). Although bedwetting in itself is pathologically benign and has a high rate of spontaneous remission, it may bring social and emotional stigma, stress and inconvenience to both those with enuresis and their families (<LINK REF="REF-Fitzwater-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fitzwater 1992</LINK>). Children who wet the bed may experience parental disapproval, sibling teasing and repeated treatment failure which may lower self esteem (<LINK REF="REF-Warzak-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warzak 1992</LINK>). The children may also be at increased risk of emotional and physical abuse (<LINK REF="REF-Warzak-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warzak 1992</LINK>). Consequently, it is important that enuresis is properly managed on 'humane grounds' (<LINK REF="REF-Moffatt-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moffatt 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although daytime wetting is a significant problem and is often associated with bedwetting, it is usually considered separately. It has been suggested that there are different aetiologies underlying the two conditions (<LINK REF="REF-Jarvelin-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jarvelin 1989</LINK>). If daytime symptoms are present, investigations to identify physical causes such as urinary tract dysfunction, congenital malformation and neurogenic disorders are usually necessary (<LINK REF="REF-Djurhuus-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Djurhuus 1992</LINK>). An organic cause is more often found in children with daytime wetting; more structural abnormalities and functional disorders of the urinary tract were found in daytime wetters than controls (<LINK REF="REF-Jarvelin-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jarvelin 1990</LINK>). Daytime wetting will be the subject of a separate Cochrane review. </P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Prevalences and causes</HEADING>
<P>Nocturnal enuresis is a complaint that affects many families. Estimating the prevalence of nocturnal enuresis is difficult, however, because there is variation in methods of diagnosis and definitions (<LINK REF="REF-de-Jonge-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Jonge 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Krantz-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krantz 1994</LINK>). In the United Kingdom, the generally quoted prevalence rates are that 15% to 20% of five year olds, 7% of seven year olds, 5% of ten year olds, 2% to 3% of 12 to 14 year olds and 1% to 2% of those aged 15 and over wet the bed on average twice a week (<LINK REF="REF-Blackwell-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blackwell 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rutter-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutter 1973</LINK>). The incidence of nocturnal enuresis is particularly high amongst children in residential care (<LINK REF="REF-Morgan-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morgan 1970</LINK>). About 1% of adults remain enuretic. Without treatment, about 15% of bedwetting children become dry each year (<LINK REF="REF-Forsythe-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forsythe 1974</LINK>).</P>
<P>The causes of nocturnal enuresis are unclear (<LINK REF="REF-Lister_x002d_Sharp-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lister-Sharp 1997</LINK>). Genetic (<LINK REF="REF-Bakwin-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bakwin 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bakwin-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bakwin 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eiberg-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eiberg 1995</LINK>), physiological (<LINK REF="REF-Djurhuus-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Djurhuus 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Norgaard-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norgaard 1993</LINK>) and psychological (<LINK REF="REF-Shaffer-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaffer 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rutter-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutter 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Devlin-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Devlin 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moffatt-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moffatt 1989</LINK>) factors, as well as delay in maturation of the mechanism for bladder control (<LINK REF="REF-Jarvelin-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jarvelin 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koff-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koff 1995</LINK>), have been suggested as possible causes of enuresis. Other factors which may contribute to bedwetting include: constipation; sleep apnoea and upper airway obstructive symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Maizels-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maizels 1993</LINK>); and diet and mild caffeine drinks with diuretic effects (e.g. cola) (<LINK REF="REF-Blackwell-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blackwell 1989</LINK>).</P>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Psychotherapy and counselling</HEADING>
<P>Because psychotherapists consider enuresis to be a symptom rather than a condition in itself, the emphasis of treatment is on the "child's inner emotional disturbance" (<LINK REF="REF-Mishne-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mishne 1993</LINK>). Consequently, the intervention is aimed at the putative psychological causative factors and attempts to modify the environment which produced the symptom (<LINK REF="REF-Mishne-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mishne 1993</LINK>). Psychotherapy may be used in the management of children who have psychological problems in addition to enuresis, to address problems directly related to psychopathology (<LINK REF="REF-Warzak-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warzak 1994</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Hypnosis</HEADING>
<P>Hypnosis is a process involving a hypnotist and a subject who agrees to be hypnotized. Being hypnotized is usually characterized by intense concentration, extreme relaxation, and high suggestibility. It has been used in children with nocturnal enuresis for many years (<LINK REF="REF-Collison-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collison 1970</LINK>). Rapport and trust are first built between the therapist and child. Significant stressors are discussed. The therapist may draw a picture of the child's body featuring the brain and the genitourinary system and discuss the connections between them in an age-appropriate manner. The children are reminded that they are the boss of their own body. Only they can remind their own "gate" to remain shut, and their own "alarm" to sound if the bladder gets too full. Formal hypnosis generally involves trance induction, visualization, relaxation, therapy, and ratification or reflection. Self-hypnosis enables children to achieve their own cure, and reinforces a sense of competency and self-esteem (<LINK REF="REF-Gottsegen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gottsegen 2003</LINK>). However, a major limitation of the existing research is the lack of treatment specification such as using a manual to ensure consistency of delivery (<LINK REF="REF-Milling-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Milling 2000</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Acupuncture</HEADING>
<P>Acupuncture is a procedure in which specific body areas, the meridian points, are pierced with fine needles for therapeutic purposes. Being an integral part of traditional Chinese Medicine, acupuncture involves complex theories of regulation of five elements (fire, earth, metal, water, and wood), Yin and Yang, Qi, blood and body fluids. By stimulating various meridian points, disharmony and dysregulation of organ systems are 'corrected' to relieve symptoms and restore natural internal homeostasis (<LINK REF="REF-Maciocia-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maciocia 1989</LINK>). Acupuncture is claimed to be effective in treating mainly all diseases, including enuresis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Chiropractic</HEADING>
<P>Chiropractic is another widely accepted alternative therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Ernst-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ernst 2001</LINK>). It is a system of therapy in which disease is considered the result of abnormal function of the nervous system, especially the spinal cord and nerves. Chiropractors focus on dysfunctions that can result from irregularities of spinal structure or movement. Hands-on procedures are usually used to determine structural and functional problems. The method of treatment usually involves manipulation of the spinal column and other body structures. Chiropractic "adjustment" is used to promote normal bodily function and correct structural deviations. Chiropractors theorize that some neurological problems relating to bedwetting may be due to a spinal subluxation or misalignment of the lumbosacral spine which affects the bladder and kidneys.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Diet or restricted foods</HEADING>
<P>Restricted diet is advised for patients with certain medical conditions, such as migraine, that are precipitated by specific food. Restricted diet has also been suggested to be helpful in childhood nocturnal enuresis. It has been reported that a low-calcium diet in hypercalciuric enuretic children may improve clinical symptoms by increasing aquaporin 2 excretion (<LINK REF="REF-Valenti-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Valenti 2002</LINK>). In some patients, nocturnal enuresis may be linked to dietary allergies that provoke bladder instability; food allergen avoidance has been suggested for management of these patients.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Faradization</HEADING>
<P>Faradization is the application of faradic current to stimulate muscles and nerves. Its use dates back to the 17 th century (<LINK REF="REF-Oschman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oschman 2000</LINK>). It is claimed to be useful for a wide range of medical conditions including enuresis.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">
<I>Medicinal herbs</I>
</HEADING>
<P>Medicinal herbs form the mainstay of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), as a kind of complementary and alternative medicine. Traditional Chinese Medicine is a 3000-year-old holistic system of medicine combining medicinal herbs, acupuncture, food therapy, massage and therapeutic exercise for both treatment and prevention of disease (<LINK REF="REF-Fulder-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fulder 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kirby-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirby 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Traditional Chinese Medicine has its unique theories for concepts of etiology, systems of diagnosis and treatment , being different from that of western medicine. The theories of TCM include Yin-Yang (representing the opposite principles and balance between positive and negative systems in the body), the five elements (metal, wood, water, fire, and earth), Qi (vital energy) and blood, Zhang-Fu (five viscerae and six bowels), and channels and collaterals (Meridian doctrine) (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cheng-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheng 2000</LINK>). Bianzheng Lunzhi (differentiation of symptoms and prescription of drugs) is the application of these theories. TCM is used for correcting the imbalance of Yin-Yang in the body and maintaining kinetic balance under the movement of five elements.</P>
<P>Medicinal herbs are mainly made from natural plants and usually incorporate one to several herbs as the basic drug(s) to treat the disease. Depending upon the different symptoms or causes, curative herbs are selected, which are then mixed together following a particular method to form the prescription. The different ingredients in each plant will work synergistically to balance the body of patients with enuresis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Homeopathy</HEADING>
<P>Homeopathy is a therapeutic method using substances whose effects when administered to healthy subjects correspond to the manifestations of the disorder in the sick patient. The remedies are thought to retain biologic activity if they are diluted and agitated or shaken between serial dilutions, even if no original molecules remain. Based on the principle of "similars", or "like cures like", homeopathy postulates that small doses of a substance that can cause symptoms in a healthy person can be used to cure similar symptoms of disease in someone who is ill. Homeopathy is another popular form of complementary and alternative therapies worldwide. Nearly 40% of physicians in England refer for homeopathic treatment and more than 60% of the French public use homeopathy (<LINK REF="REF-Ernst-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ernst 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fisher-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fisher 1994</LINK>). The use of homeopathy in the United States has increased 5-fold since 1990 (<LINK REF="REF-Eisenberg-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eisenberg 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Davenas-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davenas 1988</LINK>). Homeopathy is one of the most controversial of the complementary therapies because of the high dilutions of the medicines used, often beyond Avogadro's number (6.022x10<SUP>23</SUP>) (<LINK REF="REF-Eisenberg-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eisenberg 1993</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Identification of trials</HEADING>
<P>The titles and where possible abstracts of all studies located by the searches were checked by two reviewers (TH, XS) to identify those likely to be evaluations of the effects of interventions for nocturnal enuresis. Full papers were then obtained and assessed in duplicate to identify those that met the inclusion criteria. Differences were resolved by discussion.</P>

<LI>level of concealment of random allocation in the trials</LI>
<LI>whether data to assess the comparability of groups at baseline were given, including baseline levels of wetting</LI>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction</HEADING>
<P>The data were extracted independently by two reviewers (TH, XS) using a standard form. Differences were resolved by discussion.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data analysis</HEADING>
<P>Where appropriate, the results were converted to the mean and standard deviation of the number of WET nights per WEEK, or the number of children failing to achieve cure during treatment, defined as 14 consecutive dry nights, or the number who were not cured during treatment plus those who relapsed after stopping active treatment (to allow for possible differences in initial 'success' rates). Where a mean value was reported with no standard deviation, we entered the data into 'Other Data Tables'.</P>
<P>We intended, where possible, to calculate standardised effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals (CI): weighted mean differences (WMD) where outcomes were continuous variables and relative risks (RR) where they were binary. A fixed-effect model was to be used to calculate the pooled estimates and the 95% CIs (<LINK REF="REF-Berlin-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berlin 1989</LINK>), with mean differences weighted by the inverse of the variance, and given as differences in number of wet nights per week. Negative values indicate fewer wet nights in the intervention group at the left-hand side of the graphs. Differences between trials were to be further investigated when it appeared obvious from visual inspection of the results or statistically significant heterogeneity was found at the 10% probability level using the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test or by assessment of the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). If a reason was found then a judgement was to be made as to whether it was reasonable to combine the results. If there was no obvious reason for the heterogeneity, or it persisted despite the removal of outlying trials, a random-effects model could have been used. However, in the event this was not necessary.</P>
<P>In general no assumptions were made about missing data and data were presented as given in the trial reports. However, where there was evidence of differential dropout from the groups which may have been caused by lack of response or adverse effects of the interventions, the data were recalculated as if the dropouts were failures.</P>
<P>Crossover trials have been indicated by a suffix # after the trial ID. The data have been presented as 'Other Data'. Alternatively, data from the first arm only could be used if it was available and appeared unbiased. Continuous data reported without measures of dispersion such as standard deviations (SDs) were presented as 'Other Data'.</P>

In one trial (INSERT REF), the authors commented that one intervention (cognitive treatment) had the fewest children dropping out compared to the other three arms, but the numbers were small. In another, dropout and poor compliance was clearly related to the unacceptability and lack of success of diet treatment, and the data were analysed as if the dropouts were failures (<LINK REF="STD-McKendry-1975" TYPE="STUDY">McKendry 1975</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Hypnosis versus no treatment or placebo or another treatment (Comparison 1)</HEADING>
<P>Three small trials addressed this comparison:</P>
<UL>
<LI>hypnosis versus imipramine in one (<LINK REF="STD-Bannerjee-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Bannerjee 1993</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>hypnosis versus alarm in another (<LINK REF="STD-Seabrook-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Seabrook 2005</LINK>); and</LI>
<LI>hypnosis with or without suggestions or versus an untreated control group in the other (<LINK REF="STD-Edwards-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Edwards 1985</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>Although the number of children cured or improved was similar at the end of treatment in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Bannerjee-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Bannerjee 1993</LINK>), the high relapse rate after stopping imipramine (19 out of 25 children) resulted in a lower combined failure or relapse rate than after hypnosis (8 out of 25 children, RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.78, <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>.1). The trialists attributed this to continuing self-hypnosis in the hypnosis group, but noted that it was less effective in younger children.</P>
<P>In another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Seabrook-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Seabrook 2005</LINK> ), hypnotherapy therapy was less effective than an alarm both during treatment (RR for children failing during treatment 1.80, 95% CI 1.22 to 2.65, <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>.2) and after treatment stopped (RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.90, <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>.2).</P>
<P>In the third trial, failure to provide SDs meant that the data could not be statistically analysed (<LINK REF="STD-Edwards-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Edwards 1985</LINK>). The number of wet nights, both during and after treatment, was highest in the untreated control group and similar in the other three groups (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>), leading the trialists to conjecture that, as suggestions alone were as effective as hypnosis alone or hypnosis combined with suggestions, the difference was due to the suggestions rather than the hypnosis. However, due to data combining and small numbers, this could not be tested statistically.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Psychotherapy or counselling versus placebo treatment or another treatment (Comparison 2)</HEADING>
<P>Six trials used some form of psychotherapy, counselling or cognitive treatment for children with enuresis. The interventions or the comparators in two trials were considered to be so different that the data could not be combined (psychological counselling plus placebo in <LINK REF="STD-Kahan-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kahan 1998</LINK>, and play and supportive psychotherapy in <LINK REF="STD-Khosroshahi-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Khosroshahi 1989</LINK>).

<P>During treatment, the psychological or supportive interventions seemed to result in fewer wet nights (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>) than with desmopressin (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2.</LINK>1 and <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2.</LINK>3: <LINK REF="STD-Kahan-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kahan 1998</LINK>) or untreated controls (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2.</LINK>4: <LINK REF="STD-Ronen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ronen 1992</LINK>). In terms of number of children achieving 14 consecutive dry nights, children were less likely to fail with psychological interventions than with rewards (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>.10, <LINK REF="STD-Ronen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ronen 1992</LINK>) or with piracetam (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>.5, <LINK REF="STD-Khosroshahi-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Khosroshahi 1989</LINK>) in single trials. Psychological or supportive interventions had better results than untreated controls (RR for children failing during treatment 0.69, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.85, <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>.8: <LINK REF="STD-Ronen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ronen 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sacks-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Sacks 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Werry-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Werry 1965</LINK>) but with significant heterogeneity.

The differences became non-significant when a random effects model was used. There was a suggestion that imipramine was more effective than psychotherapy during treatment in the last trial (3 out of 12 improved on imipramine versus 1 out of 9 after three months of psychotherapy, P&lt;0.05, <LINK REF="STD-Ciotti-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Ciotti 1983</LINK>) but follow up data were not given.</P>

<P>There were differences in baseline wetting before starting treatment (active group significantly more often wet in one (<LINK REF="STD-Leboeuf-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Leboeuf 1991</LINK>) and significantly less often wet in the other (<LINK REF="STD-Reed-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Reed 1994</LINK>)).</P>
<P>In one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Leboeuf-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Leboeuf 1991</LINK>), the control period (while the children were on the waiting list) lasted for only two weeks. During this control period, there was little change in the numbers of wet nights per week (from 4.8 to 5). In the children in the active group, however, the number of wet nights decreased from 6 to 5.5 in their first two weeks of treatment, but measures of dispersion (standard deviations, SDs) were not given, ruling out statistical comparison (<LINK REF="CMP-004.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.3.</LINK>1). Thereafter the control group were given chiropractic treatment, precluding further comparisons.</P>
<P>In another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Reed-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Reed 1994</LINK>), in which the group given active chiropractic adjustment were less often wet at baseline, the children given active treatment were more likely to improve during treatment (RR versus sham adjustment 0.76, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.95, <LINK REF="CMP-004.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.2</LINK>.1) and had fewer wet nights after treatment stopped (MD -1.8, 95% CI -2.96 to -0.64, <LINK REF="CMP-004.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.4</LINK>.1).</P>

<P>In the first trial (<LINK REF="STD-Egger-1992-_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">Egger 1992 #</LINK>), a subsample of children whose enuresis appeared to respond to a restricted 'few-foods' diet (see Characteristics of Included Studies Table) were tested in double-blind randomised fashion by re-introducing test foods which were thought to affect enuresis. Relapse occurred in 6/9 children given test foods compared with 0/9 given placebo (non-reactive) foods (<LINK REF="CMP-005.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.2.</LINK>1).

<P>In the other trial (<LINK REF="STD-McKendry-1975" TYPE="STUDY">McKendry 1975</LINK>), only one child became dry on a restricted diet (see Characteristics of Included Studies Table). There was a high drop out rate from this group due to parents finding the diet too difficult to enforce as well as ineffective.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-11-07 11:28:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There were few randomised controlled trials on complementary therapies for nocturnal enuresis in children, and most of the treatment comparisons considered in this review were tested only in single trials. Meta-analyses were rarely possible because of clinical or statistical heterogeneity. Overall the quality of the trials was poor. Of the 24 randomised controlled trials identified, none had a securely concealed method of allocation. Baseline comparability of the treatment and control groups were doubtful in 12 of the 24 trials. In the two crossover trials, a washout period was not reported. Excluding the two cross-over trials, only 9 of the 22 trials provided follow-up information about the enuretic status of the children after the end of the trial treatment.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">SUMMARY OF MAIN RESULTS</HEADING>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Hypnosis</HEADING>
<P>One trial suggested hypnosis was better than imipramine in the treatment of enuresis, although the cure rates reported included improvement (<LINK REF="STD-Bannerjee-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Bannerjee 1993</LINK>). The lack of a placebo or untreated control group also made it difficult to judge the effectiveness of hypnosis. The author attributed the lower relapse rate in the hypnosis group to continuing self-hypnosis in the participants. If this is true, hypnosis had actually been continued for longer and the true "relapse" rate had yet to be seen after completion of all "hypnosis" treatment. Another trial claimed that children receiving trance or suggestions or a combination of trance and suggestions had better outcomes than waiting list controls (<LINK REF="STD-Edwards-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Edwards 1985</LINK>). However, the sample size was small and no statistical tests on between-group comparisons were reported. In addition, the baseline severity of enuresis was somewhat different between the groups; and hence the authors' conclusion is open to question. In the third trial (<LINK REF="STD-Seabrook-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Seabrook 2005</LINK>), hypnotherapy appeared to have a higher failure rate than alarm therapy, as it was a small trial, and lack of a placebo or untreated control group made it also difficult to judge the effectiveness of hypnotherapy.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Psychotherapy</HEADING>
<P>During treatment, psychological or supportive interventions seemed to be better in achieving dry nights compared to untreated controls after combining results across studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ronen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ronen 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sacks-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Sacks 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Werry-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Werry 1965</LINK>). However, there was significant heterogeneity, the positive overall effect depended on only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ronen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ronen 1992</LINK>) and it disappeared when a random effects model was used. It is therefore questionable whether it is appropriate to combine data from the trials or to rely on the findings.</P>
<P>During treatment, imipramine was better than psychotherapy in one small trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ciotti-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Ciotti 1983</LINK>) but follow up data were not provided. Psychological or supportive interventions appeared to have lower failure rate than desmopressin (<LINK REF="STD-Kahan-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kahan 1998</LINK>), rewards (<LINK REF="STD-Ronen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ronen 1992</LINK>) and piracetam (<LINK REF="STD-Khosroshahi-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Khosroshahi 1989</LINK>) in single trials. They also seemed to result in fewer wet nights than with desmopressin (<LINK REF="STD-Kahan-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kahan 1998</LINK>) or untreated controls (<LINK REF="STD-Ronen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ronen 1992</LINK>), and fewer children relapsing than with rewards (<LINK REF="STD-Ronen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ronen 1992</LINK>) or alarms (<LINK REF="STD-Ronen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ronen 1992</LINK>). However, since only single trials with small sample size and questionable quality reported success, evidence on the effectiveness of psychological treatments is not strong.</P>
<P>Psychological or supportive interventions were probably not as good as alarms (<LINK REF="STD-Ronen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ronen 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sacks-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Sacks 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Werry-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Werry 1965</LINK>) although again there were doubts about the statistical reliability of the data.</P>
<P>Finally, there was insufficient evidence to judge whether the apparent benefit of psychological counselling compared with desmopressin persisted after treatment stopped (<LINK REF="STD-Kahan-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kahan 1998</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Acupuncture</HEADING>
<P>Acupuncture seemed superior to a sham procedure in achieving dry nights after treatment in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Mao-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mao 1998</LINK>). However, the quality of the trial was suboptimal in that allocation concealment was unclear, blinding was not possible and duration of follow-up was not given. Two small trials (<LINK REF="STD-Hui-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hui 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Radmayr-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Radmayr 2001</LINK>), which compared acupuncture with imipramine and desmopressin separately, did not have adequate statistical power to demonstrate differences in either cure or relapse rates. In another trial (Pan 2009 NEWa), acupuncture appeared to have a lower failure rate than meclofenoxate, it was a quasi-randomised study which provided weak evidence. In the trial (<LINK REF="STD-Jiang-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Jiang 2000</LINK>), acupuncture also appeared to have a lower failure rate than a combination of drugs (meclofenoxate, oryzanol and thiamine) but the suboptimal quality of the trial and the lack of placebo control group cast doubt on the authors' conclusions.</P>
<P>Two of these drugs, meclofenoxate and oryzanol (see Additional <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>) can be regarded as complementary medicines. However, it was not possible to gauge whether they had any effect as they were given in combination with the B1 vitamin thiamine, and acupuncture seemed to be better (<LINK REF="STD-Jiang-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Jiang 2000</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Chiropractic</HEADING>
<P>One of three RCTs identified on chiropractic therapy provided weak evidence for its effectiveness (<LINK REF="STD-Reed-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Reed 1994</LINK>). The group given active chiropractic adjustment were more likely to improve and had less frequent enuresis post-treatment. However, children in the active treatment group had less severe enuresis at baseline, leading to doubts about adequacy of randomisation and comparability of enuresis severity between the groups, which might bias the results. Another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Leboeuf-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Leboeuf 1991</LINK>), was too small and the duration too short to provide useful information. In another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Feng-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Feng 2008</LINK>), pinching massage seemed to be as good as desmopressin during treatment, but it was a single small trial with no follow up, and needs to be verified in further trials.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Diet</HEADING>
<P>The effects of dietary manipulation is uncertain. In the crossover trial (<LINK REF="STD-Egger-1992-_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">Egger 1992 #</LINK>), a number of children who responded to an oligoantigenic ('low antigen') diet relapsed when test foods were reintroduced but did not relapse with non-reactive (placebo) foods. However, the numbers were too few for reliable comparison. The other trial of restricted diet (<LINK REF="STD-McKendry-1975" TYPE="STUDY">McKendry 1975</LINK>) had a high drop out rate due to difficulty in implementing the diet and being perceived as ineffective by the families, rendering the results unreliable.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Faradization</HEADING>
<P>Only one randomised crossover trial was identified which investigated faradization compared with sham treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Cupalova-1988-_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">Cupalova 1988 #</LINK>). It did not report a statistically significant difference in success rate, albeit with wide confidence intervals.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Medicinal herbs</HEADING>
<P>Five trials used medicinal herbs treatment for children with enuresis. One small trial (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2009</LINK>), of Chinese medicinal herbs appeared to have a lower relapse rate after the end of treatment with herbs than after desmopressin treatment.</P>
<P>In one trial <LINK REF="STD-Hu-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2008</LINK>, medicinal herbs did not appear to be more effective than meclofenoxate but the confidence interval was wide.</P>
<P>In another three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Cheng-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cheng 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feng-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Feng 1999</LINK> ; <LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2005</LINK>), three different preparations of medicinal herbs were compared to imipramine. Although the outcome measures varied, the herbs seemed to be better than imipramine both during and after treatment.</P>
<P>However, all these trials had small sample sizes or were of questionable quality, and none compared medicinal herbs to a placebo or untreated control group. Therefore, the evidence on the effectiveness of medicinal herb treatment for children with enuresis is not strong, and needs to be verified in further trials.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Homeopathy and Surgery</HEADING>
<P>There were no randomised controlled trials of homeopathy or surgery for nocturnal enuresis in children and hence their effectiveness is uncertain.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>Adverse effects identified in eight of the 24 RCTs were generally mild and self-limiting. However, the adverse effects could not be attributed to the trial treatments with certainty. Furthermore, the majority of the trials (15) failed to mention whether or not there were adverse effects.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Other considerations</HEADING>
<P>One factor which makes interpretation of trials of complementary treatment problematic is that it is often difficult to disentangle the effect of time spent with a therapist (ie the placebo or psychological support provided) from the actual treatment being tested. However, treatment of enuresis can provide a robust, objective and measurable endpoint (ie a wet bed) which might make it a uniquely suitable condition for testing complementary therapies. Economic outcome measures should include consideration of the cost of provision of the treatments and evaluation of outcomes using personal and societal costs as well as those to the health service.</P>
<P>One paper included a minority of participants classed as 'young adults' (<LINK REF="STD-Jiang-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Jiang 2000</LINK>). It was not possible to identify their outcomes separately. However, this group with persisting enuresis may have a particularly intractable problem, and might benefit from research specific to their needs.</P>
<P>There was no information available about how often homeopathic or other complementary treatments are used in children. Such age-specific data might help to put in perspective the current use of such treatments and suggest what scope there might be for future trials in children.</P>
<P>In summary, there was not sufficient evidence that any of the complementary treatment modalities included in the current review were clearly effective in treating childhood nocturnal enuresis, but by the same token there was not sufficient evidence to say that they were ineffective. Despite the wide use of many of these alternative therapies, the evidence we have found does not support their use until proper randomised trials have been done to demonstrate their effectiveness. Among the complementary and other therapies, hypnosis, psychotherapy, acupuncture, chiropractic and medicinal herbs look most promising and warrant further research.</P>

<P>There was weak evidence to support the use of hypnosis, psychotherapy, acupuncture, chiropractic and medicinal herbs but it was provided in each case by single small trials of dubious methodological rigour.</P>
<P>The current review did not find sufficient evidence about the use of dietary manipulation or faradization, nor any evidence about homeopathy or surgery for nocturnal enuresis in children. Long-term effects are uncertain. Despite the fact that these treatments are widely used in practice, current evidence does not support their use until proper randomised trials have demonstrated their effectiveness. However, judged on the evidence available adverse effects of these therapies seemed to be generally mild. When standard effective therapies such as enuretic alarms have failed or are contraindicated, these complementary therapies might be considered after careful discussion with parents. Parents should be thoroughly informed of the uncertain effectiveness and possible adverse effects of these alternatives. In addition, these complementary therapies should be administered on a research basis as part of a randomised controlled trial whenever possible, with efficacy and adverse effects carefully monitored.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-11-07 11:26:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>High-quality randomised controlled trials of complementary therapies for nocturnal enuresis are lacking to inform practicing clinicians of the effectiveness of alternative treatments particularly when conventional therapies fail. Future trials of complementary therapies should address the importance of concealment of randomisation, employ placebo or sham controls when possible, try to achieve blinding of therapy for patients and clinicians and outcome assessors, ensure adequate sample size to attain satisfactory statistical power, allow an adequate washout period for crossover trials, and follow up patients for a longer period of time. However, the existence of a robust outcome measure, a wet bed, should facilitate the design of objective trials.</P>

<P>The search methods used for the previous version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2005b</LINK>) are given below:</P>
<P>This review has drawn on the search strategy developed for the Incontinence Review Group. Relevant trials were identified from the Group's Specialised Register of controlled trials which is described, along with the group search strategy, under the Incontinence Group's details in The Cochrane Library (<A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clabout/articles/INCONT/frame.html">For more details please see the &#8216;Specialized Register&#8217; section of the Group&#8217;s module in The Cochrane Library</A>). The Specialised Register contains trials identified from MEDLINE, CINAHL, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings. The Incontinence Group Specialised Register was searched using the Group's own keyword system. The search terms used were:<BR/>({design.cct*} OR {design.rct*})<BR/>AND<BR/>({topic.urine.enuresis*})<BR/>(All searches were of the keyword field of Reference Manager 9.5 N, ISI ResearchSoft).<BR/>Date of the most recent search of the register for this review: 16 November 2006.<BR/>The trials in the Incontinence Group Specialised Register are also contained in CENTRAL.</P>
<P>For this review, extra specific searches were performed. These are detailed below.</P>
<P>The Traditional Chinese Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System (TCMLARS) was searched on 25 June 2004 by one reviewer (DC). The years searched were January 1984 to June 2004 inclusive, using the following keyword search: clinical trial AND nocturnal enuresis.</P>
<P>For a previous systematic review of enuresis treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Lister_x002d_Sharp-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lister-Sharp 1997</LINK>), extra specific searches were performed. The reviewers obtained information from a variety of sources, including organisations, manufacturers and individuals. These sources are listed in the NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination Report (<LINK REF="REF-Lister_x002d_Sharp-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lister-Sharp 1997</LINK>). The reference list resulting from these sources was searched.</P>
<P>We did not impose any language or other limits on any of the searches.</P>
