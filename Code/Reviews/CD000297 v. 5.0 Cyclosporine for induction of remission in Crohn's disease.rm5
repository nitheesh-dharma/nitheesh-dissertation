<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Cyclosporine for treatment of active Crohn's disease</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>The results of this review demonstrate that low dose oral cyclosporine is not effective for treatment of active Crohn's disease. Studies indicate that Crohn's patients treated with low dose (5 mg/kg/day) oral cyclosporine could experience side effects including kidney problems. Therefore the use of this medication for the treatment of chronic active Crohn's disease is not advisable. Higher oral doses and injections of cyclosporine have not been sufficiently evaluated. Larger doses of cyclosporine are not likely to be useful for the long-term management of Crohn's disease due to the risk of kidney damage and the availability of other proven medications. </P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Cyclosporine was first found to be an effective and well-tolerated immunosuppressive agent in organ transplant recipients, and subsequently in several autoimmune diseases. It was reported in open studies that cyclosporine is effective for induction of remission in Crohn's disease. Four randomized controlled trials have been performed to determine whether the results observed in these open studies were valid. This systematic review summarizes the evidence on the use of oral cyclosporine for the induction of remission in Crohn's disease. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate the effectiveness of oral cyclosporine for induction of remission in patients with active Crohn's disease in the presence and absence of concomitant steroid therapy. Secondary objectives were to evaluate clinical response rates and adverse events associated with cyclosporine.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Computer-assisted searches of the on-line bibliographic databases MEDLINE and EMBASE were performed to identify potentially relevant publications between 1980 and June 2008. The MeSH terms "Crohn Disease" or "Inflammatory Bowel disease" and "Cyclosporin" (exploded) were used to perform key word searches of the databases. Manual searches of reference lists from potentially relevant papers were performed in order to identify additional studies that may have been missed. Abstracts from major gastroenterological meetings, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the Cochrane Inflammatory Bowel Disease Group Specialized Trials Register were also searched for relevant studies. Appropriate officials at Sandoz Corporation were contacted to seek information on any unpublished trials.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials of parallel design with treatment duration of a minimum 12 weeks comparing oral cyclosporine therapy with placebo for treatment of patients with active Crohn's disease were eligible for inclusion. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>All data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. Data were extracted from the original research articles and converted into 2x2 tables (cyclosporine vs. placebo). Where available, individual 2x2 tables for strata within studies were also used. Heterogeneity was assessed using the chi-square test (p <U>&lt;</U> 0.10 was regarded as statistically significant). For non-pooled data, p-values were derived using the chi-square test. For pooled data, summary test statistics were derived using the Peto odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals. A fixed effects model was used for pooling of data. For continuous data, summary test statistics were derived using the weighted mean difference and 95% confidence intervals. The definitions of treatment success, remission and clinical improvement were set by the authors of each paper, and the data were combined for analysis only if these definitions were sufficiently similar.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Brynskov 1989a found that patients receiving high dose cyclosporine (median 7.6 mg/kg/day) had statistically significant clinical improvement at 12 weeks compared to placebo patients. None of the other studies found any statistically significant benefit for clinical improvement or induction of remission for low dose cyclosporine treatment (5 mg/kg/day) used by itself or in combination with corticosteroids compared to placebo. Cyclosporine was associated with a significantly higher proportion of adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events relative to placebo. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Brynskov 1989a enrolled a small number of patients and the modified clinical grading scale used in the study has not been validated in other studies. Furthermore, statistically significant clinical improvement does not imply induction of clinical remission. Indeed, Brynskov 1989a found no statistically significant differences in the mean Crohn's Disease Activity Index score at 12 weeks indicating that cyclosporine was no more effective than placebo for induction of remission in Crohn's disease. The results of this review demonstrate that low dose (5 mg/kg/day) oral cyclosporine is not effective for the induction of remission in Crohn's disease. Patients treated with low dose oral cyclosporine are more likely than placebo treated patients to experience adverse events including renal dysfunction. The use of low dose oral cyclosporine for the treatment of chronic active Crohn's disease does not appear to be justified. Oral dosing at higher levels or parenteral administration of cyclosporine have not been adequately evaluated in controlled clinical trials. Higher doses of cyclosporine are not likely to be useful for the long-term management of Crohn's disease because of the risk of nephrotoxicity and the availability of other proven interventions.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-06-18 11:33:09 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Although corticosteroids are effective for the induction of remission in Crohn's disease, approximately 20% of patients exhibit refractoriness to steroid therapy. Other patients are afflicted with steroid-dependent disease, i.e. their disease responds to corticosteroid therapy, but relapses when steroids are withdrawn. Furthermore, the usefulness of corticosteroids is limited by their profile of adverse effects. Other immunosuppressive agents have been used in this disease to achieve clinical remission in patients with chronic or refractory disease and to accomplish withdrawal from corticosteroids or reduction in steroid dose, a "steroid-sparing" effect. Azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine were the agents first employed for this indication in Crohn's disease. Although their efficacy is generally accepted, the frequency of use of these drugs varies widely among practitioners, perhaps because of concern regarding reported adverse effects. </P>
<P>Cyclosporine was first found to be an effective and well-tolerated immunosuppressive agent in organ transplant recipients, and subsequently in several autoimmune diseases. It was reported in open studies that cyclosporine is effective for induction of remission in Crohn's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Allison-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allison 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Allison-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allison 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Baker-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baker 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brynskov-1989b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brynskov 1989b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parrott-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parrott 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stange-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stange 1989</LINK>). Four randomized controlled trials have been performed to determine whether the results observed in these open studies were valid (<LINK REF="STD-Brynskov-1989a" TYPE="STUDY">Brynskov 1989a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feagan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Feagan 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jewell-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Jewell 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stange-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Stange 1995</LINK>).

</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The main objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of oral cyclosporine for induction of remission in patients with active Crohn's disease in the presence and absence of concomitant steroid therapy. Secondary objectives were to evaluate clinical response rates and adverse events associated with cyclosporine.</P>

<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials of parallel design with treatment duration of a minimum 12 weeks were considered to be eligible for inclusion. </P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>The types of participants included patients of any age with Crohn's disease defined by conventional clinical, radiographic and endoscopic criteria which was categorized as active (Crohn's disease activity index &gt;150).</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>The intervention of interest was oral cyclosporine therapy compared with placebo for treatment of patients with active Crohn's disease.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>The primary outcome measure was the number of patients achieving remission as defined by the primary studies, and expressed as a percentage of the patients randomized (intention to treat analysis). Secondary endpoints were clinical response rates as defined by the primary studies and adverse events. </P>
<P>A number of clinical indices of disease activity have been utilized in clinical trials in Crohn's disease. Two of the commonly used indices, the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) and the Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI) share specific variables and values and are convertible (<LINK REF="REF-Harvey-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harvey 1980</LINK>). Where data were not available for one index, conversion to the more generally available index (the CDAI) was made, using a conversion factor prepared by analysis of the Harvey and Bradshaw data set for which both indices were available (<LINK REF="REF-Harvey-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harvey 1980</LINK>).</P>
<P>In many clinical trials in Crohn's disease randomization is stratified according to disease activity, based on observed values for one of these clinical indices e.g. active disease = CDAI &gt;150 or HBI &gt; 4; quiescent disease= CDAI &lt; 150, or HBI &lt; 4. In these cases it was possible to perform analyses separately on values for patients in the active disease stratum. </P>
<P>For the meta-analysis clinical remission was defined by CDAI &lt; 150, HBI &lt; 4, or "significant improvement" in the Present Index at the end of treatment.</P>
</CRIT_OUTCOMES>
</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>Computer-assisted searches of the on-line bibliographic databases MEDLINE and EMBASE were performed to identify potentially relevant publications between 1980 and June 2008. The Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms "Crohn Disease" or "Inflammatory Bowel disease" and "Cyclosporin" (exploded) were used to perform key word searches of the databases. Citations were limited to those in English, French, Spanish, Italian, and German. Manual searches of reference lists from potentially relevant papers were performed in order to identify additional studies that may have been missed using the computer-assisted search strategy. Abstracts from major gastroenterological meetings were searched to identify research submitted in abstract form only. The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the Cochrane Inflammatory Bowel Disease Group Specialized Trials Register were also searched for relevant studies. Finally, appropriate officials at Sandoz Corporation were contacted to seek information on any randomized controlled trials that may have been performed but not published.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Study Selection:<BR/>Each author reviewed potentially relevant studies to determine their eligibility.</P>
<P>Data Collection:<BR/>Each author extracted data independently. Any disagreement among reviewers was resolved by consensus.</P>
<P>Statistical analysis:<BR/>Data were analyzed using Review Manager (RevMan 4.2.7). All data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. Data were extracted from the original research articles and converted into 2x2 tables (cyclosporine vs. placebo). Where available, individual 2x2 tables for strata within studies were also used. Heterogeneity among studies was assessed using the chi-square test with a p-value of 0.10 being regarded as statistically significant. For non-pooled data, p-values were derived using the chi-square test. For pooled data, summary test statistics were derived using the Peto odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals. A fixed effects model was used for pooling of data. For continuous data, summary test statistics were derived using the weighted mean difference and 95% confidence intervals. The definitions of treatment success, remission and clinical improvement were set by the authors of each paper, and the data were combined for analysis only if these definitions were sufficiently similar (determined by consensus).</P>

<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>Four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials that met the inclusion criteria were identified (<LINK REF="STD-Brynskov-1989a" TYPE="STUDY">Brynskov 1989a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Feagan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Feagan 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Jewell-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Jewell 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Stange-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Stange 1995</LINK>). An updated literature search performed in June 2008 did not identify any new trials.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Brynskov-1989a" TYPE="STUDY">Brynskov 1989a</LINK>
<BR/>In this study, 72 patients with confirmed active Crohn's disease were recruited from 6 centers in Denmark, Canada and Italy. All patients met the following inclusion criteria: continuing inflammatory symptoms that did not respond to conventional corticosteroid treatment; the undesirability of surgical intervention and a value for the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) of more than 150. Concurrent use of prednisolone (<U>&lt;</U> 20 mg/day), sulfasalazine and 5-ASA was allowed provided no change was made in dose for two weeks before or during the trial. The use of immunosuppressants such as 6-mercaptopurine was not allowed during or for at least four weeks before the trial. Patients were randomized to oral cyclosporine (5 to 7.5 mg/kg/day in two doses) or placebo for 3 months of treatment. The median final dose of cyclosporine was 7.6 mg/kg/day. The primary outcome variable was a modified clinical grading scale which was assessed at each visit. The modified scale did not rate changes in the doses of steroids as these doses were fixed. The modified scale included: well-being (weight, appetite, and general constitution), symptoms and signs (diarrhea, fever, mass, pain, or tenderness) and complications (fistulas, abscesses, or fissures and extraintestinal complications). Each item was graded from a common starting point of zero as improvement (+1, +2 or +3), zero if no change occurred or worsening (-1, -2, or -3). The end point of the trial was the ratio of patients with improvement to those without improvement at three months. Secondary outcomes included the median CDAI and orosomucoid level. Patients were evaluated after two weeks, one, two and three months of treatment, and three months after completion of treatment. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Feagan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Feagan 1994</LINK>
<BR/>In this study, 305 adult patients (age 18 to 65 years) with confirmed Crohn's disease requiring prednisone or 5-ASA in the past two years were recruited from seven centers in Canada. Treatment with prednisone (maximum 60 mg/day) or sulfasalazine (maximum 8 mg/day) or a 5-aminosalicylate (mesalamine or olsalazine, maximum 4 mg/day) was allowed to control symptoms. The use of hydrocortisone enemas was permitted for Crohn's disease distal to the splenic flexure of the colon. The prednisone dose was reduced with improvement and increased with worsening of disease. Prednisone tapering after disease flares followed an eight week schedule. Treatment with metronidazole, azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine or methotrexate was not allowed. Patients were stratified by CDAI score (active disease, CDAI &gt; 150 versus inactive disease, CDAI <U>&lt;</U> 150 ) and center and randomized to oral cyclosporine (5 mg/kg/day in two doses) or placebo for 18 months of treatment. The mean final dose of cyclosporine was 4.8 mg/kg/day. The primary outcome measure was clinically important worsening of Crohn's disease, defined as a 100 point increase in the CDAI from the patient's base-line value. Secondary outcomes included use of prednisone and 5-ASA drugs, mean CDAI, mean quality of life score and the need for surgery. Patients were assessed every two months or as necessary. For the purposes of this review only the data from patients with active disease (CDAI &gt; 150 at entry) were used.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Jewell-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Jewell 1994</LINK> <BR/>In this study, 146 adult patients (age &gt; 18 to &lt; 70 years) with confirmed chronic active Crohn's disease were recruited from 10 centers in Britain and Ireland. All participants suffered from chronic active Crohn's disease resistant to standard therapy as judged by either a requirement for continuous corticosteroid therapy in a dose equivalent to prednisolone <U>&gt;</U>10 mg/day and or azathioprine treatment to control symptoms, or had relapsed within 4 weeks of finishing one of these treatments. This definition of active disease included some patients who were inactive and receiving steroid treatment. Concomitant therapy with 5-ASA drugs including sulfasalazine was allowed provided the dose had been stable for at least two weeks prior to entry. Azathioprine or other immunosuppressive drugs were not allowed. A standard course of prednisolone treatment was initiated at the start of the trial. The initial dose was 20 mg/day for four weeks, followed by 15 and 10 mg/day for two successive weeks. After six weeks prednisolone withdrawal was attempted within 2 weeks or as quickly as possible. If patients worsened during prednisolone withdrawal treatment was restarted at an increased dose if necessary. Patients were randomized to oral cyclosporine (5 mg/kg/day) or placebo for three months of treatment. Treatment success was defined as freedom from symptoms or clinically significant improvement plus successful withdrawal or reduction of prednisolone to the original or lower dose. Treatment failure included death due to Crohn's disease, surgery for complications, the development of a new fistula or abscess, continued disease activity or obvious deterioration necessitating other treatment or discontinuation of treatment due to side effects. Secondary outcome measures included: median Harvey-Bradshaw activity index, blood count, ESR, C-reactive protein or orosomucoid, serum urea, creatinine, electrolytes, liver function tests, cyclosporine blood concentration and urine protein and glucose levels. Assessments were made at two, four, eight and twelve weeks. After the trial ended patients were followed-up every 4-8 weeks until one year after treatment began. Patients were allowed to continue the test medication for an additional 12 weeks during the follow-up period if there was marked clinical improvement during the first three months. </P>

<LINK REF="STD-Stange-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Stange 1995</LINK>
<BR/>In this study, 182 adult patients (age 18 to 60 years) with confirmed Crohn's disease were recruited from 33 centers in Europe. All patients had been treated with corticosteroids (prednisone, at least 10 mg/day) for at least two months prior to entry. Patients were stratified by disease activity (high disease activity, CDAI &gt; 200 versus low disease activity, CDAI &lt; 200) and randomized to oral cyclosporine (5 mg/kg/day) or placebo for twelve months of treatment. The dose of cyclosporine was kept constant at 5 mg/kg/day in all patients in the cyclosporine group irrespective of blood levels, unless a reduction was necessary because of a serious adverse event. During the first two months corticosteroid use was maintained at the prestudy level in the low activity group. In the high activity group the steroid dose was increased initially to 1 mg/kg/day with subsequent dose reduction. During months 3 and 4 the steroid dose was to be reduced stepwise in both groups down to 5 mg/kg/day by the end of month four, after which the dose was maintained at this level for the remainder of the study. If aminosalicylates were given prior to study entry these were continued at a fixed dose. Metronidazole and antidiarrheals were permitted. Treatment with total parenteral nutrition, enteral nutrition and steroid enemas was not allowed. At four months treatment was classified as complete success (CDAI &lt; 150), partial success (CDAI 150 - 200) or failure (CDAI &gt; 150 or previously withdrawn). Only cases rated as complete or partial success were allowed to continue after month four and were again classified as complete success, partial success or failure at month twelve. Secondary outcomes included: Present score, van Hees Index, Harvey and Bradshaw activity index, ESR, C-reactive protein, orosomucoid, and albumin. Patients were assessed at baseline, and months four, eight and twelve. For the purposes of this review only the data from patients with active disease (CDAI &gt; 200 at entry) were used.<BR/> </P>

<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>Studies were included in which physicians and nurses making clinical evaluations were blinded to treatment allocation, and randomization was performed using one of the following techniques for concealment of allocation:<BR/> 1) randomization by third party at a central location using computer-generated randomization code; cyclosporine or placebo was supplied to patients in identical coded numbered bottles.<BR/> 2) computer-generated randomization code in hospital pharmacy was used to allocate identical coded numbered bottles.<BR/> 3) use of sealed, opaque envelopes containing treatment allocation in hospital pharmacy was used to allocate identical coded numbered bottles.</P>
<P>Each study could be rated as A (satisfactory concealment of allocation - e.g. 1,2 or 3 above), or B (suspicious or unclear concealment of allocation), or C (unsatisfactory concealment of allocation). All four were "A" rated for concealment of the allocation code. </P>

<BR/>Four randomized trials which evaluated the use of cyclosporine versus placebo in Crohn's disease have been completed and published (<LINK REF="STD-Brynskov-1989a" TYPE="STUDY">Brynskov 1989a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feagan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Feagan 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jewell-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Jewell 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stange-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Stange 1995</LINK>). No additional studies were identified. It was agreed that two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Feagan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Feagan 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stange-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Stange 1995</LINK>) measured outcomes in a manner that was sufficiently similar to allow for the pooling of data for analyses. The <LINK REF="STD-Feagan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Feagan 1994</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Stange-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Stange 1995</LINK> studies enrolled patients with active Crohn's disease; used similar doses of cyclosporine and similar validated outcome measures. Although <LINK REF="STD-Jewell-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Jewell 1994</LINK> did not provide CDAI scores a conversion factor (<LINK REF="REF-Harvey-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harvey 1980</LINK>) was used to convert the Harvey Bradshaw Index into CDAI to allow the pooling of data for this comparison. The results of the individual studies which were not pooled for analyses (<LINK REF="STD-Brynskov-1989a" TYPE="STUDY">Brynskov 1989a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jewell-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Jewell 1994</LINK>) are described below. The data analyses were stratified by cyclosporine dose (low dose 5 mg/kg/day versus high dose &gt; 7 mg/kg/day).</P>

After 16 weeks of treatment 25 of 85 patients responded to cyclosporine compared to 16 of 91 for placebo. The pooled Peto odds ratio for response to therapy was 1.96 (95% CI 0.97 - 3.93). </P>

<B>CDAI at 12-14 weeks:<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>Two studies provided extractable CDAI data (<LINK REF="STD-Brynskov-1989a" TYPE="STUDY">Brynskov 1989a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feagan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Feagan 1994</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Jewell-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Jewell 1994</LINK> provided HBI data which was converted to CDAI using a conversion factor obtained from the Harvey and Bradshaw data set (<LINK REF="REF-Harvey-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harvey 1980</LINK>). An analysis of the <LINK REF="STD-Jewell-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Jewell 1994</LINK> data at 12 weeks showed a statistically significant difference in CDAI which favoured the placebo group (placebo mean CDAI 141, cyclosporine mean CDAI 191; WMD=50.00, 95% CI 12.50 - 87.50). An analysis of the <LINK REF="STD-Feagan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Feagan 1994</LINK> data at 14 weeks showed no statistically significant difference in CDAI between the groups. The mean CDAI was 244 among patients receiving cyclosporine compared to 254 among placebo patients (WMD= -10.00, 95% CI -67.65 - 47.65). An analysis of the <LINK REF="STD-Brynskov-1989a" TYPE="STUDY">Brynskov 1989a</LINK> data at 12 weeks showed no statistically significant differences in CDAI between the groups. The median CDAI for cyclosporine patients was 227 compared to 245 for placebo patients (WMD= -18.00, 95% CI -82.30 - 46.30). </P>
<P>The pooled data analysis showed no statistically significant differences in the CDAI at 12-14 weeks between cyclosporine and placebo patients (WMD=22.48, 95% CI -5.76 - 50.72).<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>CDAI at 18 months:<BR/>
</B>After 18 months of treatment there was no statistically significant difference in CDAI between the groups (<LINK REF="STD-Feagan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Feagan 1994</LINK>). The mean CDAI was 232 among cyclosporine patients compared to 238 among placebo patients (WMD= -6.00, 95% CI -71.22 - 59.22). <BR/>
<B>
<BR/>SAFETY</B>
<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>
</B>Four different outcome measures were used to evaluate the safety and clinical utility of cyclosporine relative to placebo: the total number of patients excluded or withdrawn before completion of the study, the number of patients withdrawing due to adverse events, and the number of patients with adverse events and the number of patients who developed renal dysfunction. It was agreed that these outcomes were sufficiently similar to allow the pooling of data for analyses.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Exclusion and withdrawals after entry: <BR/>
</B>A total of 704 patients with active Crohn's disease were enrolled in four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Brynskov-1989a" TYPE="STUDY">Brynskov 1989a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feagan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Feagan 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jewell-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Jewell 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stange-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Stange 1995</LINK>); 349 were randomized to cyclosporine and 355 to placebo. A similar proportion of patients receiving cyclosporine (44%, 153/349) and placebo (38%, 135/355) withdrew or were excluded from the studies before completion (Peto OR=1.36, 95% CI 0.98 - 1.89). An analysis of the <LINK REF="STD-Feagan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Feagan 1994</LINK> data found that patients receiving cyclosporine (58/151) were significantly more likely than patients receiving placebo (41/151) to withdraw from the study before completion (Peto OR=1.71, 95% CI 1.06 - 2.76). </P>
<P>
<B>Withdrawal from study due to adverse events: <BR/>
</B>The pooled Peto odds ratio for patients withdrawn due to adverse events, compiled from the three trials that provided relevant data (<LINK REF="STD-Feagan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Feagan 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Jewell-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Jewell 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Stange-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Stange 1995</LINK>) was 3.92 (95% CI, 2.23 - 6.91) indicating that patients receiving cyclosporine were significantly more likely than placebo patients to withdraw from the studies due to adverse events. </P>
<P>
<B>Development of any adverse side effect: <BR/>
</B>In three trials reporting the number of patients with adverse events (<LINK REF="STD-Brynskov-1989a" TYPE="STUDY">Brynskov 1989a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jewell-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Jewell 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Stange-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Stange 1995</LINK>) the pooled Peto odds ratio was 16.63 (95% CI, 10.65 - 25.95) indicating that patients treated with cyclosporine were significantly more likely to experience an adverse event than placebo treated patients. However, the studies were heterogeneous (p=0.02) and this result should be interpreted with caution. <BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Development of renal dysfunction:</B>
<BR/>Few patients experienced renal dysfunction. <LINK REF="STD-Feagan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Feagan 1994</LINK> reported that two cyclosporine treated patients had to be withdrawn because of persistently elevated serum creatinine levels. <LINK REF="STD-Stange-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Stange 1995</LINK> reported that one patient had to be withdrawn because of elevated serum creatinine. No cyclosporine treated patients were withdrawn from the <LINK REF="STD-Brynskov-1989a" TYPE="STUDY">Brynskov 1989a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Jewell-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Jewell 1994</LINK> studies because of renal dysfunction. No placebo treated patients had to be withdrawn because of renal dysfunction. The pooled Peto odds ratio for renal dysfunction was 7.63 (95% CI 0.79 - 73.60). </P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-06-18 11:33:09 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Brynskov-1989a" TYPE="STUDY">Brynskov 1989a</LINK> found that patients receiving high dose cyclosporine (median 7.6 mg/kg/day) had statistically significant clinical improvement at 12 weeks compared to placebo patients. However this study enrolled a small number of patients and the modified clinical grading scale used in the study has not been validated in other studies and therefore may not be valid. Furthermore, statistically significant clinical improvement does not imply induction of clinical remission. Indeed, <LINK REF="STD-Brynskov-1989a" TYPE="STUDY">Brynskov 1989a</LINK> found no statistically significant differences in the Crohn's Disease Activity Index at 12 weeks indicating that cyclosporine was no more effective than placebo for induction of remission in Crohn's disease. Furthermore, once the medication was withdrawn long-term follow-up showed no statistically significant differences in clinical improvement between cyclosporine and placebo treated patients (<LINK REF="REF-Brynskov-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brynskov 1991</LINK>). </P>
<P>None of the other studies found any statistically significant benefit for clinical improvement or induction of remission for low dose cyclosporine treatment (5 mg/kg/day) used by itself or in combination with corticosteroids compared to placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Feagan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Feagan 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jewell-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Jewell 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stange-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Stange 1995</LINK>). Based on the combined data a non significant difference of 11% in favour of cyclosporine was observed. To determine if this difference is real a larger trial would be required. Assuming a 0.05 level of significance with 80% power and an expected drop out rate of 10% the total sample size required to show a statistically significant difference would be 512. However the value of undertaking such a trial is questionable given the availability of agents with more favourable adverse effect profiles. Analyses of individual patient data including a survival analysis for induction of remission, mean index scores at each assessment, rates of surgery for Crohn's disease, use of corticosteroids, and subgroup analysis by disease site and toxicity were not performed as originally planned as sufficient data were not available. <BR/> <BR/>Cyclosporine was associated with significantly higher rates of adverse events and withdrawal due to adverse events relative to placebo. Nonetheless, a low dose of cyclosporine was used in three studies and most of the adverse events were not severe. Adverse events associated with cyclosporine included: paresthesia, hypertrichosis, dyspepsia, hypertension, rash, vertigo, diarrhea, headaches, mouth ulcers, ocular photosensitivity, nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, tremor, back pain, weight increase, gingival hyperplasia, impaired renal function and increases in serum creatinine level (<LINK REF="STD-Brynskov-1989a" TYPE="STUDY">Brynskov 1989a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feagan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Feagan 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jewell-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Jewell 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stange-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Stange 1995</LINK>). Few cyclosporine treated patients were withdrawn due to impaired renal function (<LINK REF="STD-Feagan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Feagan 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stange-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Stange 1995</LINK>) which was probably due to the low dose of cyclosporine. </P>
<P>The results of this review demonstrate that low dose (5 mg/kg/day) oral cyclosporine is not effective for the induction of remission in Crohn's disease. Given the lack of efficacy and the significant potential for adverse effects the use of low dose oral cyclosporine for the treatment of chronic active Crohn's disease does not appear to be justified. Oral dosing at higher levels or parenteral administration of cyclosporine have not been adequately evaluated in controlled clinical trials. Several uncontrolled trials suggest that higher dose oral and or intravenous cyclosporine may be beneficial (<LINK REF="REF-Hanauer-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanauer 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Santos-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Santos 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gurudu-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurudu 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hermida_x002d_Rodriguez-99" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hermida-Rodriguez 99</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Garcia_x002d_Planella-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia-Planella 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cat-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cat 2003</LINK>). However, the use of higher doses of cyclosporine is unlikely to be a useful strategy for the long-term management of chronic active Crohn's disease because of the risk of nephrotoxicity and the availability of other agents of proven efficacy such as methotrexate, infliximab and natalizumab (<LINK REF="REF-Gordon-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gordon 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Alfadhli-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alfadhli 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Akobeng-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akobeng 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ghosh-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ghosh 2003</LINK>). </P>
