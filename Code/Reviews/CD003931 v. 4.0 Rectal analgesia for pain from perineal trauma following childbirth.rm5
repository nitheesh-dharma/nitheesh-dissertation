<P>Rectal suppositories give short-term pain relief for perineal trauma after childbirth.</P>
<P>Women often suffer pain if their birth involves trauma to the perineum (area between the vagina and the anus). This trauma can result from an episiotomy (surgical cut) or from a tear that requires stitching. There are ways to reduce the possibility of trauma, but for women with pain the review of trials found that rectal suppositories were effective for pain relief up to 24 hours after birth. Longer-term effects have not been investigated. More research is required to assess the longer-term outcomes and effects, if any, on breast milk, mother-baby bonding and sexual functioning.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Perineal pain from a tear and/or surgical cut (episiotomy) is a common problem following vaginal birth. Strategies to reduce perineal trauma and the appropriate repair of any perineal damage sustained are important for avoiding and alleviating pain. Where pain is present, numerous treatments are used in clinical practice, such as local anaesthetics, oral analgesics, therapeutic ultrasound, antiseptics and non-pharmacological applications such as ice packs and baths. This review assesses the evidence for using rectal analgesia for pain relief following perineal trauma.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effectiveness of analgesic rectal suppositories for pain from perineal trauma following childbirth.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (July 2002), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2002), CINAHL (May 2002) and MIDIRS (May 2002).</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials comparing analgesic rectal suppositories with placebo or alternative treatment for the relief of perineal pain.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers assessed trial quality and extracted data independently. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Three trials involving 249 women met the inclusion criteria. Only two of the trials identified for inclusion in this review had data that could be entered in a meta-analysis, with the third not providing data in a useable format. Women were less likely to experience pain at or close to 24 hours after birth if they received non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) suppositories compared with placebo (relative risk (RR) 0.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.10 to 1.38, 2 trials, 150 women). Women in the NSAID suppositories group compared with women in the placebo group required less additional analgesia in the first 24 hours after birth (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.54, 1 trial, 89 women) and this effect was still evident at 48 hours postpartum (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.89, 1 trial, 89 women). No information was available on pain experienced more than 72 hours after birth or other outcomes of importance to women such as the impact on daily activities, resumption of sexual intercourse and the impact on the mother-baby relationship. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>NSAID rectal suppositories are associated with less pain up to 24 hours after birth, and less additional analgesia is required. More research is required regarding long-term effects and maternal satisfaction with the treatment. </P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-09-22 11:46:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Perineal pain from a tear and/or surgical cut (episiotomy) is a common problem following vaginal birth. In resource-rich countries at least 65% of women undergoing vaginal birth experience perineal pain (<LINK REF="REF-Albers-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Albers 1999</LINK>) and scarce data from under-resourced countries suggest that 35 to 45% of women who give birth in a hospital experience an episiotomy (<LINK REF="REF-Maduma_x002d_Butshe-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maduma-Butshe 1998</LINK>). Not only does perineal pain negatively impact on the physical and mental functioning of the woman, but it may decrease the success for the mother to breastfeed, reduce her ability to care for her new baby (<LINK REF="REF-Sleep-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sleep 1991</LINK>) and may impair the establishment of a good quality mother-baby interaction. Physical factors associated with perineal pain such as reduced mobility, urinary and faecal incontinence, perineal discomfort whilst sitting and sexual dysfunction can lead to mental exhaustion and may be detrimental to the experiences of motherhood.</P>
<P>Perineal pain is reported to be most severe in the immediate postnatal period; however, discomfort continues for up to two weeks postpartum in 20 to 25% of women (<LINK REF="REF-Sleep-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sleep 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Albers-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Albers 1999</LINK>). For up to 10% of women, pain continues for at least three months (<LINK REF="REF-Sleep-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sleep 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glazener-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Avoiding damage to the perineum and appropriate repair of perineal damage are the best primary methods for pain avoidance and alleviation. Practices for avoiding damage to the perineum include massage and guarding the perineum with the birth attendant's hands during contractions (<LINK REF="REF-Enkin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Enkin 2002</LINK>). Two Cochrane reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Kettle-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kettle 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kettle-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kettle 2002b</LINK>) have examined the effectiveness of different repair methods and materials. However, pain relief is important where pain is present (<LINK REF="REF-Sleep-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sleep 1989</LINK>). Numerous treatments are common in clinical practice including topical anaesthetics, oral analgesics, therapeutic ultrasound, local antiseptics, simple and narcotic analgesics and non-pharmacological applications in the form of sprays, gels, creams, ice packs and baths (<LINK REF="REF-Sleep-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sleep 1989</LINK>). Evaluation of some of these treatments has suggested a positive treatment effect and further research has been recommended (<LINK REF="REF-Sleep-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sleep 1989</LINK>). Some of these treatments are the subject of existing Cochrane reviews or new reviews, for example 'Therapeutic ultrasound for postpartum perineal pain and dyspareunia' (<LINK REF="REF-Hay_x002d_Smith-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hay-Smith 2002</LINK>) and 'Localised cooling treatment for perineal wounds following childbirth' (<LINK REF="REF-Steen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steen 2002</LINK>). The protocol for 'Topically applied local anaesthetic for the treatment of perineal pain after childbirth' has been published (<LINK REF="REF-Hedayati-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hedayati 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Where perineal pain is mild, paracetamol is the most common analgesic used (<LINK REF="REF-Sleep-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sleep 1989</LINK>). As pain increases to moderate and severe levels, a variety of drugs have been used but very few of these are free of side effects (<LINK REF="REF-Sleep-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sleep 1989</LINK>). This includes the use of opioid, non-opioid and a combination of both opioid and non-opioid analgesics. Opioid analgesics such as morphine and codeine act centrally on the nervous system (<LINK REF="REF-Jacobson-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobson 1987</LINK>) and are more widely used for severe pain where other measures are not responsive (<LINK REF="REF-MIMS-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">MIMS 2000</LINK>). Non-opioid analgesics include the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as indomethacin, ibuprofen and diclofenac, which are widely used for their analgesic and anti-pyretic properties. Prostaglandins play a major role in pain, and NSAIDs work as potent prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors. This inhibition sensitises afferent nerves, which may lower prostaglandins in peripheral tissues and in turn reduce pain (<LINK REF="REF-MIMS-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">MIMS 2000</LINK>). Unfortunately, NSAIDs are not free of risk and areas of concern include gastric irritation, haematological effects and renal failure (<LINK REF="REF-Pavy-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pavy 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-RCA-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCA 1998</LINK>). </P>
<P>An important issue associated with postpartum analgesic use is the potential passage into breast milk. Some analgesics such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and codeine are usually compatible with breastfeeding but drugs such as aspirin have been linked to significant effects on the infant such as metabolic acidosis and hence are contraindicated (<LINK REF="REF-AAP-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 1994</LINK>). However, dosage is important, with minimal use of certain analgesics (once or twice daily) understood to result in only low levels of drug circulation and passage into breast milk (<LINK REF="REF-Windle-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Windle 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>In general medical care, the rectal route of analgesic administration may be used when oral therapy is inappropriate (<LINK REF="REF-Nissen-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nissen 1992</LINK>) such as when oral preparations cause gastric upset (<LINK REF="REF-Sleep-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sleep 1989</LINK>), nausea and vomiting (<LINK REF="REF-Insel-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Insel 1990</LINK>), or when the patient is unconscious (<LINK REF="REF-Insel-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Insel 1990</LINK>). Patient attitudes towards the route of administration are also very important. A survey of this has shown that although patients choose oral over rectal treatment, if the rectal route is more appropriate, patients prefer to be informed and give verbal consent prior to administration (<LINK REF="REF-Vyvyan-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vyvyan 1995</LINK>). Rectal administration is advantageous in that about 50% of the drug absorbed by the rectum will bypass the liver and therefore not be metabolised, compared with a higher proportion of hepatic first-pass metabolism with oral ingestion (<LINK REF="REF-Gilman-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilman 1990</LINK>). This suggests that the rectal route may result in faster pain relief and be more effective upon local action. Studies assessing the efficacy of rectal analgesia for other types of pain such as post-operative pain have shown rectal analgesia to significantly reduce pain levels (<LINK REF="REF-Nissen-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nissen 1992</LINK>) and in some reports there has been less usage of additional analgesia (<LINK REF="REF-Sims-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sims 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scott-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 1997</LINK>). This suggests that rectal analgesia may be effective for perineal pain.</P>
<P>The aim of this review is to systematically evaluate available evidence from randomised controlled trials that investigate pain relief, maternal satisfaction and costs of using rectal analgesia for relief from perineal pain following childbirth. </P>

<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>All studies identified by the search strategy outlined above were considered for inclusion. Trials included were evaluated for appropriateness and methodological quality without consideration of their results. Two reviewers independently assessed trials for inclusion. Any differences of opinion were resolved by discussion. Reasons for excluding trials were recorded and reported in the review. </P>
<P>The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the criteria described in Section six of the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2002</LINK>). Quality scores for allocation concealment were assigned to each trial, where A = adequate, B = unclear, C = clearly inadequate. Studies rated as a C were eliminated. </P>
<P>Studies were assessed for completeness of follow up:<BR/>(a) fewer than 3% of participants excluded;<BR/>(b) 3% to 9.9% of participants excluded;<BR/>(c) 10% to 19.9% of participants excluded;<BR/>(d) 20% or more excluded;<BR/>(e) unclear.<BR/>Studies rated as a D were eliminated.</P>
<P>Where appropriate, studies were also assessed for blinding:<BR/>(a) Double blind: neither investigator nor participant knew or were likely to guess the allocated treatment.<BR/>(b) Single blind: either the investigator or the participant knew the allocation, or side effects of one or other treatment mean that it is likely that the allocation could be correctly identified in a significant proportion (more than 20%) of participants.<BR/>(c) No blinding: both investigator and participant knew or were likely to guess the allocated treatment.<BR/>(d) Unclear.<BR/>Studies that were not blinded due to the nature of the interventions were included in the review. <BR/> <BR/>Studies were not excluded on the use of a placebo due to the nature of the possible comparisons (i.e. alternative treatment rather than placebo).</P>
<P>Where feasible, the following subgroup analyses were planned to be undertaken:<BR/>(a) type of rectal analgesia used;<BR/>(b) spontaneous vaginal birth versus operative vaginal birth;<BR/>(c) episiotomy compared with perineal tear;<BR/>(d) primiparous women compared with multiparous women.<BR/>None of these subgroup analyses were undertaken due to the limited data available from the trials.</P>
<P>Two reviewers independently extracted and double entered data. There was no blinding of authorship. Whenever necessary, unpublished data were sought from investigators. Statistical analyses were performed using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2000</LINK>). Included trial data were processed as described in the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Categorical data were compared using relative risks and 95% confidence intervals using a fixed effects model. Statistical heterogeneity between trials was assessed using the chi square test and, where present, a random effects model was used.</P>
<P>All eligible trials were included in the initial analysis and sensitivity analyses carried out to evaluate the effect of trial quality. This was done by excluding trials given a B rating for quality for allocation concealment, then E and C for completeness of follow up, then C and D for blinding (where appropriate).</P>

<I>See</I> table of 'Characteristics of Included Studies'.</P>
<P>Two of the three included trials compared diclofenac with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Yoong-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Yoong 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Searles-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Searles 1998</LINK>) and the third study compared indomethacin with placebo for pain from perineal trauma (<LINK REF="STD-Odigie-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Odigie 1988</LINK>).</P>
<P>The three included trials were all single centred, with two of them located in the United Kingdom (UK) (<LINK REF="STD-Yoong-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Yoong 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Searles-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Searles 1998</LINK>) and the third in Saudi Arabia (<LINK REF="STD-Odigie-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Odigie 1988</LINK>). Both of the UK studies looked at diclofenac suppositories compared with placebo whilst the third trial investigated indomethacin in comparison with placebo.</P>
<P>All trials administered 100 mg suppositories. One trial administered a single dose (<LINK REF="STD-Yoong-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Yoong 1997</LINK>) while the other two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Odigie-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Odigie 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Searles-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Searles 1998</LINK>) administered two suppositories (total 200 mg suppositories). The Odigie trial (<LINK REF="STD-Odigie-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Odigie 1988</LINK>) administered both suppositories (200 mgs) after suturing whereas the other (<LINK REF="STD-Searles-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Searles 1998</LINK>) gave one immediately after suturing and the second 12 hours after the first suppository. </P>
<P>All three studies included women who had an episiotomy, and one trial also included women with a second-degree tear (<LINK REF="STD-Searles-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Searles 1998</LINK>) . </P>

The earlier trial (<LINK REF="STD-Odigie-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Odigie 1988</LINK>) focussed on pain 15 to 90 minutes after birth. In all studies, the women themselves, using a variety of measures including numerical scales and visual analogue scales, assessed pain. </P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>Searles (<LINK REF="STD-Searles-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Searles 1998</LINK>) explicitly reported the methods of randomisation and the concealment of treatment allocation was judged to be adequate. Random number tables using a block containing equal proportions of odd and even numbers were used to code the suppositories where the last digit was coded for either the diclofenac or placebo suppositories. The method of randomisation was unclear in the other two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Odigie-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Odigie 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yoong-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Yoong 1997</LINK>). Yoong (<LINK REF="STD-Yoong-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Yoong 1997</LINK>) performed random allocation after birth by drawing a coded sealed envelope. No further information was given so it was unclear as to the randomisation method and how well treatment allocation was concealed. <LINK REF="STD-Odigie-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Odigie 1988</LINK> reported that there was random allocation to the two groups. They provided no further information regarding concealment of treatment allocation. Clarification has been sought from the authors.</P>
<P>The studies were all placebo-controlled. The placebo was not specified in each trial but in all studies they were said to be identical in colour and similarly shaped.</P>
<P>All trials stated that they were double-blinded. However, only Searles (<LINK REF="STD-Searles-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Searles 1998</LINK>) explicitly reported how blinding was achieved. In this trial the pharmacy department supplied the treatment packs and the participant and the outcome assessor were blinded. The pharmacy prepared identical foil wrapped packages that were further placed in a sealed container and identified by a number 1 to 100. <LINK REF="STD-Yoong-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Yoong 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Odigie-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Odigie 1988</LINK> made no mention of who was blinded or how it was achieved.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Odigie-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Odigie 1988</LINK> reported no losses to follow up. In Searles (<LINK REF="STD-Searles-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Searles 1998</LINK>) 11 out of 100 (11%) were lost to follow up, and 10 out of 120 (8%) in <LINK REF="STD-Yoong-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Yoong 1997</LINK> were lost to follow up.</P>

<P>Three trials that involved 249 women met the inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Odigie-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Odigie 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yoong-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Yoong 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Searles-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Searles 1998</LINK>). Two studies were excluded from the review; one as it included two other types of postnatal pain as well as perineal pain (<LINK REF="STD-Ray-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ray 1993</LINK>); and one as it had a loss to follow up more than 20% (<LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Pas-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Pas 1984</LINK>).</P>
<P>Only two of the trials identified for inclusion in this review had data that could be entered in meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Odigie-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Odigie 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Searles-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Searles 1998</LINK>). The third did not provide data in a useable format (<LINK REF="STD-Yoong-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Yoong 1997</LINK>). The authors of this study have been contacted in an attempt to acquire further data. Most of the outcomes pre-specified in this review were not measured in the trials. Only eight pre-specified outcomes were measured in the included studies.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Presence of pain</HEADING>
<P>Any pain experienced up to 24 hours after birth:</P>
<P>Pain was measured at 90 minutes in the <LINK REF="STD-Odigie-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Odigie 1988</LINK> trial and at 24 hours in the <LINK REF="STD-Searles-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Searles 1998</LINK> trial. A random effects model was used here as statistical heterogeneity was present between the studies. However, this model produced a summary measure with less precision than the individual studies. The random effects model resulted in very wide confidence intervals that crossed one around the summary estimate (relative risk (RR) 0.37, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.10 to 1.38, 2 trials, 150 women), despite the individual studies both having relative risks favouring the treatment group.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Any pain experienced between 24 hours and 72 hours after birth</HEADING>
<P>There was no difference found for pain between 24 and 72 hours after birth in the one trial that measured this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Searles-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Searles 1998</LINK>); (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.02, one trial, 99 women).</P>

<P>Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Yoong-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Yoong 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Searles-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Searles 1998</LINK>) reported on the severity of pain (mild, moderate and severe) at different times after birth. Heterogeneity was found with one category in this analysis, thus a random effects model was used for all three categories.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Mild pain experienced up to 24 hours after birth</HEADING>
<P>There was no difference between the treatment groups for mild pain less than or equal to 24 hours after administration (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.80, 2 trials,149 women).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Moderate pain up to 24 hours after birth</HEADING>
<P>Women receiving non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) suppositories compared with placebo had less moderate pain 24 hours after birth compared with placebo (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.76, 2 trials, 149 women).</P>

<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Yoong-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Yoong 1997</LINK> study measured pain using pain scores and visual analogue scales (VAS) in 110 women. The data were reported as medians and thus could not be included in the meta-analysis. According to the pain scores of the study, women experienced less pain in the NSAID suppositories group at 24 hours (diclofenac: median 1, range 0 to 2.5; placebo: median 1, range 0 to 3; p &lt; 0.05 using Mann-Whitney U test) but no statistically significant difference was seen after the time period between 24 hours and 72 hours after birth (diclofenac: median 1, range 0 to 3; placebo: median 1, range 0 to 4, p value not reported).</P>

<P>Only one of the included trials, with 89 women (<LINK REF="STD-Searles-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Searles 1998</LINK>) presented appropriate data for inclusion in the meta-analysis regarding additional analgesia use for perineal pain up to 72 hours postpartum. Women in the NSAID suppositories group required less additional analgesia up to 24 hours (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.54, 1 trial, 89 women) and this effect was still evident at 48 hours postpartum (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.89, 1 trial, 89 women). No difference was seen for additional analgesia use for perineal pain 72 hours postpartum.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Yoong-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Yoong 1997</LINK> study provided data on use of additional analgesia but not in a format suitable to include in the meta-analysis. They reported on the amount of extra paracetamol (in grams) used by the 110 women in the study, and found women in the NSAID suppositories group used less paracetamol in the first 24 hours after birth and this was maintained up to 48 hours after birth (diclofenac; mean 0.6g, standard deviation (sd) 0.53, placebo mean 1.11g, sd 0.57, P &lt; 0.05, compared using two-sample t-test). The need for, type and timing of additional analgesia were not measured beyond 48 hours.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The methodological quality of the studies varied. Treatment allocation was only adequate in the <LINK REF="STD-Searles-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Searles 1998</LINK> trial and unclear in the other trials (<LINK REF="STD-Odigie-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Odigie 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yoong-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Yoong 1997</LINK>). There were no losses to follow up in the <LINK REF="STD-Odigie-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Odigie 1988</LINK> study, but a loss to follow up exceeded 10% for <LINK REF="STD-Searles-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Searles 1998</LINK> and was 8% for <LINK REF="STD-Yoong-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Yoong 1997</LINK>. All the studies were placebo-controlled. </P>
<P>Given these limitations, rectal analgesia appears effective for reducing moderate pain from perineal trauma following childbirth in the short term (within 24 hours) and results in less additional analgesia use compared with placebo up to 48 hours after birth. No side effects with the use of the rectal analgesia have been reported in these trials. Side effects did not appear to be a pre-specified study outcome in any of the trials since the lack of side effects were only mentioned in the discussion.</P>
<P>Although there was statistical heterogeneity between the studies for some of the primary outcomes, independently the studies favoured rectal analgesia. This heterogeneity is possibly explained by the different time points used for pain measurement in the studies. No information is available on pain experienced more than 3 days after birth. Similarly no information is reported on other outcomes important to women such as the impact on daily activities, resumption of sexual intercourse and the impact on the mother-baby relationship. </P>
<P>Acceptability of the rectal route of administration is an important issue and if postpartum women are not comfortable with taking pain relief in the form of a suppository, the effectiveness of the drug becomes irrelevant. This outcome was not addressed in any of the three trials included in this review. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>This review shows that rectal analgesia can reduce pain from perineal trauma following childbirth experienced by women and the intensity of any pain within the first 24 hours after birth. Women use less additional analgesia within the first 48 hours after birth when analgesic rectal suppositories are used. The effect, if any, on longer-term pain relief and analgesia use is not known.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further research should assess the duration of the pain relief experienced and the effects of different timing of treatments, different dosages, different lengths of treatment and comparison of the different analgesic drugs available as suppositories or other modalities, as well as the impact these regimens have on the passage of the drug into breast milk.</P>
<P>The limited controlled evaluations on the long-term impact of rectal analgesia for perineal pain suggests that further research is necessary. More research is required to assess impact on activities of daily living, longer-term pain, resumption of sexual intercourse and mother-baby relationships. Adequate allocation concealment, follow up and the measurement of relevant outcomes should be key components of any future randomised controlled trials. </P>

<INCLUDED_CHAR STUDY_ID="STD-Searles-1998">
<CHAR_METHODS>
<P>Single centre: York. <BR/>A random number table used to code the suppositories using a block containing odd and even numbers in equal proportions. The last digit coded for either active drug or placebo and the suppositories were issued in sealed containers numbered 1-100. Codes available 24 hours a day but not broken during trial.<BR/>Outcome assessment was double blind.<BR/>No intention to treat analysis.<BR/>No information available regarding concealment of treatment allocation.</P>
</CHAR_METHODS>
<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>100 women randomised, 89 analysed (treatment = 45, placebo = 44) having a spontaneous vaginal delivery at term with either an episiotomy or a second degree tear were enrolled in study.<BR/>Mean age - 25.3 yrs in placebo group and 25.2 yrs in diclofenac group.</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>One 100 mg diclofenac or placebo suppository inserted at the end of suturing and the second administered 12 hours later by midwifery staff. Identical placebo suppositories.</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>Women rated pain at 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours using a six point numerical system.<BR/>Use of additional analgesia at 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours.<BR/>Significant incidence of side effects was measured but not reported. Same applies to the method of analgesia being acceptable to women.</P>
</CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<CHAR_NOTES>
<P>Operative vaginal deliveries, first degree tears and labial grazes were excluded. Also excluded were those with a history of peptic ulceration, inflammatory bowel disease, asthma or a history of aspirin allergy.<BR/>Women entered in trial were not offered other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents until at least 12 hours after the administration of the second suppository.</P>

<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>120 women randomised, 110 women analysed with uncomplicated medio-lateral episiotomies to aid normal vaginal delivery without epidural analgesia (treatment = 56, placebo = 54).<BR/>All repaired with same technique and suture material.</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Treatment = 1 x 100 mg diclofenac suppositories.<BR/>Placebo suppositories.<BR/>Suppositories inserted during rectal examination that followed episiotomy repair.<BR/>Placebo was similarly shaped.</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>Pain analysed at 24 and 48 hours by women using a visual analogue scale and additional paracetamol recorded.<BR/>Side effects, and patient acceptability were also measured but not reported.</P>
</CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<CHAR_NOTES>
<P>Women excluded were those with extension of episiotomy or significant labial or vaginal lacerations. Those with asthma, porphyria, salicylate hypersensitivity, peptic ulceration and significant cardiac, renal or hepatic disease. Finally those requesting a 6-hour discharge.

<P>Study was for three types of post partum pain - uterine cramps and oedema as well as episiotomy - and the results could not be separated. The authors were contacted to get the appropriate results but no response was received.</P>

<CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION>
<P>Methodology was poor, with only 61/108 women included in follow up for primary outcome (pain). According to pre-specified methodology, studies with more than 20% of participants lost to follow up are excluded. Moreover, the study does not explain how pain was measured.</P>
