<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-03-15 04:01:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>At the time of birth, the infant is still attached to the mother via the umbilical cord, which is part of the placenta. The infant is usually separated from the placenta by clamping the cord. This clamping is one part of the third stage of labour (the time from birth of the baby until delivery of the placenta) and the timing can vary according to clinical policy and practice. Although early cord clamping has been thought to reduce the risk of bleeding after birth (postpartum haemorrhage), this review of 15 randomised trials involving a total of 3911 women and infant pairs showed no significant difference in postpartum haemorrhage rates when early and late cord clamping (generally between one and three minutes) were compared. There were, however, some potentially important advantages of delayed cord clamping in healthy term infants, such as higher birthweight, early haemoglobin concentration, and increased iron reserves up to six months after birth. These need to be balanced against a small additional risk of jaundice in newborns that requires phototherapy.</P>

<P>Policies for timing of cord clamping vary, with early cord clamping generally carried out in the first 60 seconds after birth, whereas later cord clamping usually involves clamping the umbilical cord more than one minute after the birth or when cord pulsation has ceased.

<P>We included 15 trials involving a total of 3911 women and infant pairs. We judged the trials to have an overall moderate risk of bias.</P>
<P>
<B>Maternal outcomes</B>: No studies in this review reported on maternal death or on severe maternal morbidity. There were no significant differences between early versus late cord clamping groups for the primary outcome of severe postpartum haemorrhage (risk ratio (RR) 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 1.65; five trials with data for 2066 women with a late clamping event rate (LCER) of ~3.5%, I<SUP>2 </SUP>0%) or for postpartum haemorrhage of 500 mL or more (RR 1.17 95% CI 0.94 to 1.44; five trials, 2260 women with a LCER of ~12%, I<SUP>2 </SUP>0%). There were no significant differences between subgroups depending on the use of uterotonic drugs. Mean blood loss was reported in only two trials with data for 1345 women, with no significant differences seen between groups; or for maternal haemoglobin values (mean difference (MD) -0.12 g/dL; 95% CI -0.30 to 0.06, I<SUP>2 </SUP>0%) at 24 to 72 hours after the birth in three trials.</P>
<P>
<B>Neonatal outcomes</B>: There were no significant differences between early and late clamping for the primary outcome of neonatal mortality (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.41, two trials, 381 infants with a LCER of ~1%), or for most other neonatal morbidity outcomes, such as Apgar score less than seven at five minutes or admission to the special care nursery or neonatal intensive care unit. Mean birthweight was significantly higher in the late, compared with early, cord clamping (101 g increase 95% CI 45 to 157, random-effects model, 12 trials, 3139 infants, I<SUP>2</SUP> 62%). Fewer infants in the early cord clamping group required phototherapy for jaundice than in the late cord clamping group (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.96, data from seven trials, 2324 infants with a LCER of 4.36%, I<SUP>2</SUP> 0%). Haemoglobin concentration in infants at 24 to 48 hours was significantly lower in the early cord clamping group (MD -1.49 g/dL, 95% CI -1.78 to -1.21; 884 infants, I<SUP>2</SUP> 59%). This difference in haemoglobin concentration was not seen at subsequent assessments. However, improvement in iron stores appeared to persist, with infants in the early cord clamping over twice as likely to be iron deficient at three to six months compared with infants whose cord clamping was delayed (RR 2.65 95% CI 1.04 to 6.73, five trials, 1152 infants, I<SUP>2</SUP> 82%). In the only trial to report longer-term neurodevelopmental outcomes so far, no overall differences between early and late clamping were seen for Ages and Stages Questionnaire scores.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-03-28 10:49:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A more liberal approach to delaying clamping of the umbilical cord in healthy term infants appears to be warranted, particularly in light of growing evidence that delayed cord clamping increases early haemoglobin concentrations and iron stores in infants.

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-10-09 13:15:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>At the time of birth, the infant is still attached to the mother via the umbilical cord, which is part of the placenta. The infant is usually separated from the placenta by clamping the cord with two clamps. One clamp is placed close to the infant's navel and the second is placed further along the umbilical cord; then the cord is cut between the two clamps. This task takes place during the third stage of labour, which is the period of time from the birth of the infant to the delivery of the placenta.</P>

<P>
<B>Active management and expectant management of the third stage of labour</B>
</P>
<P>There are two contrasting approaches to managing the third stage of labour: active management and expectant or physiological management. A comparison of these approaches is the subject of a separate Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Begley-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begley 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Expectant management is a non-interventionist approach to care in the third stage of labour that involves waiting for signs of placental separation and allowing the placenta to deliver spontaneously or aided by gravity, maternal effort or nipple stimulation. In many high-resource settings, and in some low-resource settings, this approach has frequently been replaced by more interventionist packages of care (active management), although variation in practice remains widespread.</P>
<P>Active management of the third stage of labour has been described in a recent World Health Organization (WHO) report as the "cornerstone" of obstetric and midwifery practice during the latter part of the 20th century (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2012b</LINK>). Active management has involved the clinician intervening in the process through three interrelated processes: the administration of a prophylactic uterotonic drug; cord clamping and cutting; and controlled traction of the umbilical cord. An injection of an uterotonic drug, an agent that stimulates the uterus to contract, is given as a precautionary measure, aimed at reducing the risk of postpartum haemorrhage (PPH). The timing of when prophylactic uterotonic drugs are administered has varied over time and in practice from administration with crowning of the baby's head; to at the time of birth of the anterior of the baby; to shortly after complete birth of the baby. There are also several different types of uterotonic drugs that may be given and the relative advantages and disadvantages of these different drugs are the subject of separate reviews (see <LINK REF="REF-Cotter-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cotter 2001</LINK> (oxytocin); <LINK REF="REF-G_x00fc_lmezoglu-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gülmezoglu 2007</LINK> (prostaglandins and misoprostol); <LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2007</LINK> (ergometrine-oxytocin and oxytocin)). In earlier descriptions of an active management strategy the umbilical cord was usually clamped within 60 seconds following birth of the infant, although there can be substantial variation in the application of policies for active management often related to the setting within which the policy is being applied. The <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2012b</LINK> recommendation is for clamping of the cord to be performed between one to three minutes after the birth unless the baby is asphyxiated and requires resuscitation.<BR/>
</P>
<P>A major reason for practising active management is its association with reduced risk of PPH, the major complication of the third stage of labour (<LINK REF="REF-Prendiville-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prendiville 2000</LINK>). The usual definition of PPH is that given by the WHO: blood loss of equal to or more than 500 mL from the genital tract during the first 24 hours postpartum (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2012b</LINK>). Stricter definitions of 600 mL (<LINK REF="REF-Beischer-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beischer 1986</LINK>) and 1000 mL (<LINK REF="REF-Burchell-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burchell 1980</LINK>) have been suggested although the assessment of blood loss is often significantly underestimated and is based on clinical estimation (<LINK REF="REF-Kwast-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kwast 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1998a</LINK>). The 500 mL limit is intended to be a warning and blood loss up to 1000 mL in healthy women may be well tolerated in some birth settings where there is access to adequate resuscitation measures if required. In other settings, particularly in low-income countries, where the prevalence of severe anaemia is high, this amount of blood loss would be life threatening for many women (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1996</LINK>). Assessment of women with blood loss should always also take into account physical appearance and physiological observations such as pulse rate, blood pressure and conscious state. PPH is the most common fatal complication of pregnancy and childbirth in the world (<LINK REF="REF-UN-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">UN 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-UNICEF-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNICEF 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2012</LINK>) and is a major contributor to the conservatively estimated 287,000 maternal deaths occurring throughout the world annually (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2012</LINK>). Whilst the majority of maternal deaths (99%) occur in low-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2002</LINK>), the risk of PPH should not be underestimated for any birth (<LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2003</LINK>). Effects on maternal morbidity are less well documented, but are likely to include interrelated outcomes such as anaemia and fatigue (<LINK REF="REF-Patterson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patterson 1994</LINK>). Complications that can arise from major blood loss include shock, the widespread formation of blood clots in the microcirculation, renal failure, liver failure and adult respiratory distress syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Bonnar-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bonnar 2000</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Although active management leads to reduced risk of PPH, it is important to establish whether individual components of the strategy lead to this reduced risk or whether it requires the full 'package' of strategies to be administered. Furthermore, It can be difficult to adhere to an active management strategy. Over time the type of uterotonic drug and the timing of its administration has been reported as being with crowning of the head of the baby, birth of the anterior shoulder of the infant after the birth of the baby or after the clamping of the cord. Variations in practice may be related to practical considerations such the number of staff available in the room at the time of birth, unexpected occurrences such as malpresentation (for example, a breech presentation) or shoulder dystocia (difficulty in delivering the infant's shoulders), local policy, or birth setting context. Some women also have preferences for expectant management (<LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2003</LINK>). Thus, it is important to examine the relative importance of each component of an active management strategy.</P>
<P>
<B>Early cord clamping as part of active management</B>
</P>
<P>In the past, as part of an active management strategy, the umbilical cord has usually been clamped shortly following birth of the infant. This was generally advised to be carried out in the first 30 seconds after birth, regardless of whether the cord pulsation has ceased (<LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2003</LINK>). As part of this strategy the infant may have been placed on the mother's abdomen, put to the breast or have been more closely examined on a warmed cot if resuscitation was required. Once the placenta was felt to have separated from the wall of the uterus, downward traction may have been applied to the remaining length of the umbilical cord to assist delivery of the placenta. Controlled cord traction is believed to reduce blood loss, shorten the third stage of labour and therefore minimise the time during which the mother is at risk from haemorrhage (<LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2003</LINK>). However, more recent guidelines for management of the third stage of labour no longer recommend immediate cord clamping, and cord traction is regarded as optional and is only suggested when skilled staff are in attendance (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2012b</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>Delayed cord clamping</B>
</P>
<P>Definitions of what constitutes early and late cord clamping vary (<LINK REF="REF-Prendiville-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prendiville 1989</LINK>). In practice, clamping the umbilical cord often takes place once cord pulsation has ceased or at least beyond the first minute of so following the birth of the baby.</P>

<P>
<B>Possible beneficial and adverse effects</B>
</P>
<P>Delayed clamping allows time for a transfer of the fetal blood in the placenta to the infant at the time of birth. This placental transfusion can provide the infant with an additional 30% more blood volume and up to 60% more red blood cells (<LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mercer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mercer 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mercer-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mercer 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Palethorpe-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palethorpe 2010</LINK>). The amount of blood returned to the infant depends on when the cord is clamped and at what level the infant is held (above or below the mother's abdomen) prior to clamping (<LINK REF="REF-Yao-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yao 1974</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Palethorpe-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palethorpe 2010</LINK> and colleagues sought to evaluate studies related to the effects for mother and baby of alternative positions for the baby between birth and cord clamping to assess the influence of gravity on placental transfusion. However, no randomised controlled trials were identified for comparison and they concluded there was a need for large, well designed randomised controlled trials to be undertaken to ascertain what effect gravity may have on placental transfusion at vaginal and caesarean births related to short- and longer-term outcomes for mothers and babies.<BR/>
</P>
<P>The suggested neonatal benefits associated with this increased placental transfusion include higher haemoglobin concentrations (<LINK REF="REF-Prendiville-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prendiville 1989</LINK>), additional iron stores and less anaemia later in infancy (<LINK REF="STD-Chaparro-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Chaparro 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1998b</LINK>), higher red blood cell flow to vital organs, better cardiopulmonary adaptation, and increased duration of early breastfeeding (<LINK REF="REF-Mercer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mercer 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mercer-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mercer 2006</LINK>). There is growing evidence that delaying cord clamping confers improved iron status in infants up to six months post birth (<LINK REF="STD-Chaparro-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Chaparro 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mercer-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mercer 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Rheenen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Rheenen 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Arguments against early cord clamping include the reduction in the amount of placental transfusion and any associated benefits of extra blood volume. Early cord clamping may increase the likelihood of feto-maternal transfusion (the amount of blood that is forced back across the placental barrier into the maternal circulation), as a larger volume of blood remains in the placenta. This would have been considered a potential issue prior to the introduction of Rh D immunoglobulin prophylaxis, since early clamping of the cord was considered to increase the risk. However, little work appears to have been undertaken since findings from small non-randomised studies (<LINK REF="REF-Lapido-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lapido 1972</LINK>) suggested there may be a reduction in feto-maternal transfusion if cord clamping was delayed (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2006</LINK>). Early clamping has also been thought to be associated with higher risks for the preterm infant. This topic is the subject of a Cochrane systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Rabe-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rabe 2012</LINK>), which has recently been updated.</P>
<P>Delayed cord clamping has been linked to an increase in the incidence of jaundice (<LINK REF="REF-Prendiville-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prendiville 1989</LINK>) which, in severe cases, could have longer term effects on the health and development of the infant. In addition, early cord clamping has been associated with a reduction in the length of the third stage of labour. One of the aims of active management is to reduce the length of the third stage because the longer the placenta remains undelivered, the greater is the likelihood of maternal bleeding (<LINK REF="REF-Inch-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Inch 1985</LINK>). A delay in time before clamping the umbilical cord in healthy term infants appears be less crucial as the cord ceases pulsation within the first two minutes of birth in the majority of cases (<LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2003</LINK>).</P>

<B>Why this review is important</B>
</P>
<P>Active management, including early cord clamping is still widely practised in high-income countries, although relative timing of each individual component of the strategy varies. Most maternity units in Australia and the United Kingdom administer the uterotonic prior to placental delivery, whereas some units in the United States (<LINK REF="REF-Brucker-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brucker 2001</LINK>) and Canada (<LINK REF="REF-Baskett-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baskett 1992</LINK>) advocate withholding uterotonic administration until after the placenta is delivered. A survey of active management policies in Europe showed considerable differences, including the timing of cord clamping, with eight countries clamping the cord immediately in 66% to 90% of units, and five countries mostly waiting until the cord stopped pulsating (<LINK REF="REF-Winter-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winter 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>WHO recently updated its guidelines on preventing PPH (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2012b</LINK>). The International Confederation of Midwives and the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics also updated its statement on PPH in 2006 (<LINK REF="REF-ICM_x002f_FIGO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICM/FIGO 2006</LINK>). Both statements refer to benefits of delaying cord clamping, and WHO recommend cord clamping one to three minutes after the birth although the quality of the evidence underpinning this recommendation was described as moderate. This review seeks to explore this issue further. Since evidence suggests that the effects of early versus late cord clamping may differ in preterm and term infants, these are the subjects of a separate review (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="REF-Rabe-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rabe 2012</LINK>). This review will concentrate on the effect of early versus late cord clamping on maternal and neonatal outcomes in term infants.</P>

In future versions, if any such trials are identified and assessed as eligible for inclusion, we will adjust their sample sizes using the methods described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), or from another source. If ICCs from other sources are used, we will note this and carried out sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in ICC.

<P>For included studies, we noted levels of attrition in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> tables.</P>
<P>We analysed data on all participants with available data in the group to which they were allocated, regardless of whether or not they received the allocated intervention. If in the original reports participants were not analysed in the group to which they were randomised, and there was sufficient information in the trial report, we attempted to restore them to the correct group.</P>
<P>For all outcomes, we carried out analyses, as far as possible, on an intention-to-treat basis, i.e. we attempted to include all participants randomised to each group in the analyses. For all primary outcomes the denominator for each outcome in each trial is the number of women randomised.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of heterogeneity  </HEADING>
<P>We used the I² and T² statistics to quantify heterogeneity along with the Chi² test for heterogeneity. If we identified substantial heterogeneity (I² greater than 30%), we have drawn attention to this in the text and have advised readers to interpret results with caution. For primary outcomes where moderate or high levels of heterogeneity were identified we also planned to calculate the 95% prediction interval which gives the range of effects expected across different settings; in this version of the review we did not identify high levels of heterogeneity for primary outcomes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of reporting biases  </HEADING>
<P>For primary outcomes, provided sufficient studies contributed data, we planned to generate funnel plots. In this version of the review insufficient studies contributed data for any of our primary outcomes. In future updates, if further data are added, we will visually examine plots to see whether there is any evidence of asymmetry suggesting different treatment effects in smaller studies, which may indicate publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Harbord-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harbord 2006</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data synthesis  </HEADING>
<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>). We used fixed-effect analysis for combining data in the absence of significant heterogeneity and when trials were sufficiently similar. If heterogeneity was found, this was explored by sensitivity analysis followed by random-effects analysis if required. Random-effects meta-analysis estimates the average treatment effect and this may not always be clinically meaningful. Further, where there is high heterogeneity the applicability of the overall effect estimate is likely to vary in different settings and we therefore advise caution in the interpretation of results.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity  </HEADING>
<P>We planned to carry out the following subgroup analyses:</P>
<OL>
<LI>whether or not uterotonics (oxytocic drugs used to stimulate the uterus to contract) were used as part of the third stage management;</LI>
<LI>whether or not the infant was held above or below the abdomen prior to cord clamping;</LI>
<LI>the extent of control for selection bias.</LI>
</OL>
<P>The uterotonic subgroup was presented as part of the analysis structure.</P>
<P>There was insufficient information or variation to present subgroup analyses by placement of infant (however, this was noted in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> tables), or selection bias. </P>
<P>We only used primary outcomes in subgroup analysis.</P>
<P>We visually examined the forest plots of subgroup analyses to look at whether there was overlap between 95% CIs for the effects in different groups; with non-overlapping CIs suggesting a difference between subgroups. We also conducted formal statistical analyses to examine any possible differences between subgroups classifying whole trials by interaction tests as described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) and available in <LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>, We reported the results of interaction tests in the text.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analysis  </HEADING>
<P>We planned sensitivity analysis for primary outcomes by risk of bias; we did this by dividing the studies into subgroups according to whether they were at low risk of bias as opposed to unclear or high risk of bias for allocation concealment to see what impact this would have on the treatment effect. In this version of the review, all studies reporting on our primary outcomes were at low risk of bias for allocation concealment.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-McDonald-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McDonald 1996</LINK> used a factorial design with four arms, randomising not only by early and late cord clamping but also by whether uterotonics were administered early or late. Early uterotonic administration involved administration at the time of birth of the anterior shoulder of the baby. Late uterotonic administration was after the birth of the baby (literally) and if the cord clamping allocation was early, then it was allocated to be after the cord was clamped (i.e. not within 30 seconds). The uterotonic used was intramuscular oxytocin 10 IU.</P>

<P>Blinding women and the staff providing care is not possible when assessing the management of third stage of labour and the impact of lack of blinding on outcomes is difficult to assess. It may be feasible to blind staff collecting data for some outcomes. However, the assessment of many outcomes, particularly blood loss, could, in theory, have been unconsciously affected by people's beliefs. Having chosen maternal haemoglobin less than 9 g/dL as a hard outcome relating to blood loss at the protocol stage, we have now also included the mean postnatal haemoglobin values to help in understanding the blood loss estimations. Haemoglobin assessment would usually be performed by a technician who would be blind to the trial allocation. Seven of the studies reported that an attempt was made to blind the collection of at least some of the outcome data to reduce detection bias (<LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Tawil-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Tawil 2012</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Andersson-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Andersson 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cernadas-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cernadas 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McDonald-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McDonald 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oxford-Midwives-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Oxford Midwives 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Rheenen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">van Rheenen 2007</LINK>).

<P>Even low loss to follow-up may cause serious risk of bias for rare outcomes.

<P>We identified few other obvious sources of bias; study groups appeared comparable at baseline. In three studies there was very little information about study methods and therefore, we assessed these studies as unclear for other bias (<LINK REF="STD-Jahazi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Jahazi 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saigal-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Saigal 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spears-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Spears 1966</LINK>). It is possible that if staff carrying out interventions were deviating from 'routine' this may have introduced bias; for example, in <LINK REF="STD-Andersson-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Andersson 2011</LINK> early clamping was routine before the trial, and staff may have had views about late clamping which may have affected the way the intervention was delivered for the late clamping group. In the <LINK REF="STD-Oxford-Midwives-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Oxford Midwives 1991</LINK> trial, it was unclear whether pilot data were included in the main trial data and whether or not data were collected in the same way.</P>
<P>In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Cernadas-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cernadas 2006</LINK>, more than a quarter of the women included had caesarean births. This may mean data from this study are affected by neonatal clinicians attending the delivery. In the past, babies delivered by caesarean were routinely admitted to special, or neonatal intensive care. In this study, the number of caesarean births was balanced in the intervention and control groups so the impact of including data for these women is not clear.</P>

<P>Five trials with 1152 infants reported data on infant iron deficiency at three to six months in a way that allowed us to include results in meta-analysis.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-05-13 17:25:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this updated version of the review we have included 15 trials (involving a total of 3911 women and infant pairs) carried out in a number of countries over a long timeframe.</P>
<P>There were no significant differences seen between early and late cord clamping groups for the primary maternal outcome of severe postpartum haemorrhage or for the secondary outcomes of postpartum haemorrhage of 500 mL or more or mean blood loss. No included trials reported on maternal death or severe maternal morbidity. Maternal haemoglobin values were not significantly different between women in the early and late cord clamping groups in the days after giving birth.</P>
<P>No significant difference between early and late cord clamping was seen for the primary outcome of neonatal mortality or for most other neonatal morbidity outcomes. There was a significant (101 g mean) birthweight increase seen with late, compared with early, cord clamping. However, significantly fewer infants in the early cord clamping group required phototherapy for jaundice than in the late cord clamping group. Haemoglobin concentration in infants at 24 to 48 hours was increased in the late cord clamping group. This difference in haemoglobin concentration was not seen at subsequent assessments. However, improvement in iron stores was significant (with infants in the early cord clamping over twice as likely (risk ratio (RR) 2.65 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04,6.75) to be iron deficient at three to six months compared with infants whose cord clamping was delayed. In the only trial to report longer-term neurodevelopmental outcomes so far, no overall differences between early and late clamping were identified at four months.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-05-22 16:22:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although reviews such as <LINK REF="REF-Hutton-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hutton 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-van-Rheenen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Rheenen 2006</LINK> have highlighted beneficial effects from delayed cord clamping compared with early cord clamping, maternal wellbeing has not been a major focus for reviews or trials of cord clamping. This is an important gap as women experiencing ill health postpartum may be less able to mother as effectively which ultimately reflects on the health and wellbeing of the newborn infant and family life in general.</P>
<P>The ability of the review to reach conclusive findings and evidence to guide future practice was limited by differences in variables such as the lengths of timing for both early and late cord clamping, as well as the inconsistent coverage of outcomes between trials. In addition, the use of prophylactic uterotonics was not always well described in the trials.</P>
<P>The benefits and harms seen for delayed cord clamping are compatible with the same mechanism of an increased amount of red blood cells for the infant. Additional red blood cells can improve the infant's iron stores, but this also has the potential to overload the newborn's metabolism, leading to increased levels of bilirubin and in very severe cases, severe jaundice and later kernicterus (<LINK REF="REF-AAP-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 2004</LINK>). The potential for harm would need to be weighed up by clinicians in context with the settings in which they work. For instance, if treatment for moderate to severe jaundice was not easily accessible and there was a risk of causing further complications for the infant, late cord clamping may be less optimal. On the other hand, increasing iron stores in infants through delayed cord clamping may be particularly beneficial in resource-poor settings where severe anaemia is common (<LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>The World Health Organization has recently recommended that "the cord should not be clamped earlier than is necessary" and notes that this would normally take around three minutes. They have graded this recommendation as a "weak recommendation, low quality evidence" (<LINK REF="REF-Baker-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baker 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stolzfus-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stolzfus 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2012b</LINK>. This recommendation is compatible with the evidence although this update of the review contains some additional data not considered by <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2012b</LINK>, which increases the level of confidence in recommending later cord clamping.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-05-13 17:26:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The overall methodological quality of the trials contributing data to the review was moderate or high. While none of the studies was assessed as being at high risk of bias for most domains, several trials did not provide clear information on methods. Nine of the 15 included trials used methods to conceal allocation at the point of randomisation that we assessed as low risk of bias. Lack of blinding was a problem in all of the included studies; blinding women and clinical staff to randomised group is not feasible with this type of intervention. The impact of lack of blinding is difficult to judge. Knowledge of allocation could have affected other aspects of care and the assessment of many outcomes, particularly blood loss, could, in theory, have been unconsciously affected by people's beliefs. Haemoglobin assessment would usually be performed by a technician who would be blind to the trial allocation. Seven of the studies reported that an attempt was made to blind the collection of at least some of the outcome data to reduce detection bias (<LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Tawil-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Tawil 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Andersson-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Andersson 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cernadas-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cernadas 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McDonald-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McDonald 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oxford-Midwives-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Oxford Midwives 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Rheenen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">van Rheenen 2007</LINK>). Although loss to follow-up was not always described, most of the outcomes related to the time close to birth when attrition was likely to have been low.</P>
<P>For most of the outcomes reported in the review, data were limited. For some outcomes event rates were low and even where we pooled data from several studies there was insufficient power to detect possible differences between groups. For some outcomes only a small number of studies contributed data, and this again, led to reduced confidence in the effect estimates. An added problem was the lack of consistency in the outcomes reported and the way outcomes were measured in different studies. For example, for infant anaemia and iron status, studies examined different outcomes, used different definitions or cut-off points, measured outcomes in different ways or at different time points. These differences meant that pooled estimates could not be obtained.</P>
<P>Some important outcomes were not reported in any of the included studies and so far, only one of the included studies has reported infant neurological outcomes or longer-term neurological development.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-03-15 03:18:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We are aware that there is the potential to introduce bias at every stage in the review process and we took steps to minimise bias. At least two review authors independently assessed each study for possible inclusion, and carried out data extraction and assessment of study quality for included studies. Assessing risk of bias is a matter of judgment rather than an exact science and it is possible that a different review team may have made different decisions.</P>
<P>One of the review team was an author on one of the included trials (<LINK REF="STD-McDonald-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McDonald 1996</LINK>) and was not involved in carrying out data extraction or assessing risk of bias for this trial.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2013-05-13 17:26:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A recent review of active management of the third stage of labour (including early cord clamping), showed a reduction in postpartum haemorrhage greater than 1000 mL although the outcomes for infants were less clear, and the authors recommended that the individual components of third-stage management should be examined separately (<LINK REF="REF-Begley-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begley 2011</LINK>). Recent WHO guidelines recommend cord clamping between one to three minutes after the birth (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2012b</LINK>). While this review concentrated on term babies, it is of interest that a recently updated Cochrane review of early versus later cord clamping in preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Rabe-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rabe 2012</LINK>) also suggested that there may be benefits to the infant associated with later clamping. The conclusions of that review were that delaying clamping reduces the need for blood transfusion, risk of intraventricular haemorrhage and necrotising enterocolitis in this preterm population although effects on the mother and other important infant outcomes were not clear.</P>

<P>A more liberal approach to delaying clamping of the umbilical cord in healthy term infants appears to be warranted, particularly in light of growing evidence that delayed cord clamping may be of benefit in the longer term in promoting better iron stores in infants, as long as access to treatment for jaundice requiring phototherapy is easily accessible. Clinical implications for improvement in iron stores would be enhanced if follow-up data were available for child development.</P>

<P>Future studies should have adequate power to be able to detect the true advantages and disadvantages of cord clamping on outcomes; they should also report fully details of methods to allow assessment of risk of bias. Future studies should compare maternal outcomes such as PPH, longer term (six to 12 months) postpartum follow-up on iron status, physical and psychological health, as well as short- and longer-term neonatal and infant outcomes such as neurodevelopment.</P>

<P>Since the publication of the protocol for this review, we have broadened the criteria to include caesarean births and to widen the definition of early cord clamping from less than 30 seconds to less than 60 seconds since two trials specified early clamping as under one minute. We have added several outcomes that measure biochemical parameters in infants such as haemoglobin and ferritin. We added the outcome of polycythaemia because we considered that information regarding polycythaemia would be of clinical interest.</P>
<P>In 2013 the review includes restructured primary and secondary outcome criteria and we have now included birthweight and symptoms of infection in infants as secondary outcomes.</P>

<P>Sample size: the initial sample size calculation was based on an anticipation that the PPH rate from a uterotonic choice trial (<LINK REF="STD-McDonald-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McDonald 1996</LINK>) would be around 10%. It was calculated that a sample size of 3000 women would be required to have an 80% chance of detecting a 50% reduction in PPH at the 5% level of statistical significance. However, review during the trial by a Data Monitoring Committee determined that the PPH rate was greater than the 10% rate predicted, the actual recorded PPH rate being around 16%; this reduced the required sample size to ~1,100 women.<BR/>
<BR/>Blood loss assessment: "the major endpoint of the study was PPH ascertained by measurement of collected blood spillage where possible and all other blood loss estimated by visual estimation. The trial could not be 'blind' at this point; the clinician carrying out the intervention was also attempting to assess the blood loss. The authors attempted to obtain objective indices of blood loss in the form of 1. postpartum haemoglobin, 2. calculation of the difference between antepartum and postpartum haemoglobin. Although these measures may not be reliable measures of the amount of blood loss by an individual, they are objective, independent of observer bias and were carried out on women in the trial without knowledge of which intervention was used".</P>
<P>Jaundice assessment: Clinicians assessing jaundice are not likely to have been aware of the allocation to early and late clamping groups.<BR/>

<P>The trial could not be 'blind' as the clinician carrying out the intervention was also attempting to assess the blood loss. The authors attempted to obtain objective indices of blood loss in the form of 1. postpartum haemoglobin, 2. calculation of the difference between antepartum and postpartum haemoglobin. Although these measures may not be reliable measures of the amount of blood loss by an individual, they are objective, independent of observer bias and were carried out on women in the trial without knowledge of which intervention was used".</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY MODIFIED="2012-09-04 15:33:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>First we would like to thank Susan J McDonald and Philippa Middleton on completion of the huge task of reviewing all of the literature on delayed cord clamping in term infants. This is a daunting task and they are to be commended.</P>
<P>However, we do have two serious concerns that we feel significantly weaken this Cochrane review. Our first concern is that the evidence for an increase in 'jaundice requiring phototherapy' is based upon one 12 year old unpublished trial done by the lead author of this Cochrane Review (McDonald) in Australia.  When that one trial is removed from data (offered in <LINK REF="CMP-001.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.14</LINK> ) the variable of 'jaundice requiring phototherapy' does not reach significance. A recent meta-analysis found in JAMA did not agree with the outcome that delayed cord clamping (DCC) leads to 'jaundice requiring phototherapy' (Hutton and Hassan, 2007). We question the emphasis given to the outcome drawn from this one study.</P>
<P>There are several reasons in this Cochrane Review why 'jaundice needing phototherapy' (associated with DCC) may be misleading.  First, no information is offered to tell the reader if the providers ordering the phototherapy in the McDonald trial were blinded to the infants grouping. Secondly, guidelines to treat jaundice have changed over time and no mention is given of what the guidelines were in Australia 12 years ago. How high were the bilirubin levels? What was the age of the infants at the time that phototherapy was indicated? Did any of the infants require further treatment such as exchange transfusions? What were the feeding policies at the time and how many mothers were breastfeeding and bottle feeding? What was the racial mix and was metabolic screening to rule out G6PD, galactosemia and other conditions considered? These questions suggest competing factors and other potential influences rather than DCC only on the incidence of jaundice needing phototherapy in McDonald's 12 year old unpublished controlled trial.</P>
<P>Our second main concern is that harm to infants from DCC is inferred but not demonstrated in this review. The use of the word 'severe' in the Plain Language Summary is particularly misleading. Was there 'harm' to any of the infants in the McDonald study or simply more infants receiving phototherapy? What were peak bilirubin levels? The use of phototherapy does not necessarily imply 'severe' jaundice.  Maisals (2006) recommends that the term severe be used when the total serum bilirubin level is 20 mg/dL (340 umol/L) or higher. The issue of hyperbilirubinemia is extremely complex (AAP, Technical Report 7/04). Recent information on bilirubin tells us that it is an anti-oxidant and that the elevations seen after birth especially in breastfed infants may be initially protective (Hammerman C et al, 2002). It does everyone an injustice to infer 'harm' in the face of the evidence from the two large randomized controlled trials published in 2006. These trials indicate less anemia and better iron stores at 6 months of age in infants with DCC at birth (Cernadas et al, 2006; Chaparro et al, 2006). </P>
<P>In analysis 1.16 'Clinical Jaundice' did not result in significant differences between the delayed group and the immediate clamped group even though the 90 infants who were clamped at 3 minutes in the Cernadas study (2006) with no increase in jaundice are left out and the McDonald study results are included here as well. </P>
<P>It is important to blind pediatric providers when one is using a management decision as an outcome variable. Strauss (2008) recently published findings on 105 preterm neonates randomized to immediate clamping or a one minute delay in cord clamping. Use of phototherapy was an outcome variable and the providers caring for the infants were not blinded to the infants grouping. He reported that even though there were "no differences in serum bilirubin values prompting therapy or in intensity of therapy required", more infants with the delay in cord clamping group received phototherapy (Strauss, 2008).   This information concerning treatment when neonatologists are unblinded to an infant's grouping suggests that the belief that DCC causes jaundice effects clinical practice. It demonstrates the need for pediatric providers to be blinded in trials using jaundice requiring phototherapy as an outcome variable. Fortunately, Strauss balanced his variables and reported that there were no differences in initial bilirubin levels at decision to treat or in the extent of phototherapy used.</P>
<P>In order to prevent regional biases, we suggest that the Cochrane Collaboration recommend groups of authors representing more than one country, one continent, and one specialty. This is imperative to offer balance for such an important review. </P>
<P>Other points are:</P>
<OL>
<LI>The abstract offers that both benefits and harm are shown for late cord clamping. The evidence of harm in this review is much too weak (based on one unpublished study's findings) to be stated so definitively.</LI>
<LI>Under 'Significant increase in infants needing jaundice', five trials are listed but only one trial gives any weight to this finding and that is a 12 year old unpublished study. </LI>
<LI>Under Authors' Comments, the authors state "One definition of active management [of third stage labor]" but do not refer to the current definition as offered by WHO, ICM, and FIGO. It is imperative that such documents use and refer to the most current definitions.</LI>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Emphasis</HEADING>
<P>Debra Erickson-Owens and Judith Mercer question the emphasis we have placed in the review on this outcome. We believe that our presentation of jaundice requiring phototherapy accurately reflects an increase in jaundice. The authors recognise that interpretation of the clinical relevance of this for infants may vary. As the largest trial, the McDonald study (appropriately) contributes the most data, so it is not surprising that its removal from the analysis also removes the statistical significance. Three of the other four trials contributing data to this outcome are small. The fourth trial of 556 babies (<LINK REF="STD-Oxford-Midwives-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Oxford Midwives 1991</LINK>) shows a risk difference of approximately similar magnitude to <LINK REF="STD-McDonald-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McDonald 1996</LINK> (2.5% versus 3.1%). </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Blinding</HEADING>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-McDonald-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McDonald 1996</LINK> trial, while it is possible that lack of blinding may have had an influence, we think that it is unlikely since women were not explicitly informed of their allocation at the time of birth. In the period that most of these trials were conducted, in many units, the midwives at the birth would not be the midwives providing postnatal care. In the McDonald study, midwives and other clinicians providing postnatal care were not aware of allocations to groups, or even that a particular infant had participated in the study. Furthermore, the decision to place a baby under phototherapy has many objective elements and criteria. We did include a brief mention of blinding of outcome assessment in the text of the review, but have added extra detail in the Characteristics of Included studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Guidelines for treating jaundice</HEADING>
<P>We agree with the statement that these guidelines have changed over time. In the case of the <LINK REF="STD-McDonald-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McDonald 1996</LINK> trial, the level of jaundice requiring phototherapy depended on the age and weight of the infants (all were under four days). Approximately 90% of babies were breastfed at discharge (89% in the delayed clamping group and 91% in the early clamping group).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Other factors</HEADING>
<P>The other factors mentioned would have been distributed between the two groups of the <LINK REF="STD-McDonald-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McDonald 1996</LINK> study, as it was a securely randomised trial with adequate allocation concealment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Ignoring results from Cernadas</HEADING>
<P>All infants from the Cernadas study (including the 90 infants clamped at three minutes) have been included in the clinical jaundice outcome. We feel that we have given appropriate weight to the favourable results for six-month anaemia and iron levels, pointing this out in the Results, Discussion, Authors' conclusions and Abstract. </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Potential risks from delayed cord clamping</HEADING>
<P>We think there is a slight misinterpretation about the Plain language Summary saying that the jaundice was severe - our actual words were &#8220;a possible additional risk of jaundice severe enough to require phototherapy&#8221;. However, we can see that this wording could be easily misinterpreted and we will change it and also the applicable wording in the Authors' conclusions.</P>
<P>We feel it would be irresponsible to ignore or downplay potential harms and, in fact, to do so would be contrary to The Cochrane Collaboration&#8217;s guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Loke-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loke 2008</LINK>). We believe we have appropriately pointed out a potential risk (albeit one which is preventable through phototherapy), noting that this risk would be minimal in facilities that have the equipment to test for and treat jaundice. Although <LINK REF="REF-Moerschel-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moerschel 2008</LINK> have recently stated, &#8220;every hospital that cares for newborns should be able to provide intensive phototherapy&#8221;, we recognise that this is not always the case.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Clinical jaundice</HEADING>
<P>Thank you for picking up that we missed reporting the third arm of Cernadas for clinical jaundice. The addition of these data change the total RR from 0.83, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.06 to 0.84, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.07. We have made this change in the review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Current definitions of active management</HEADING>
<P>The point of our comment in the conclusions in the Abstract was to highlight that active management takes a number of forms, as evidenced by the <LINK REF="REF-Winter-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winter 2007</LINK> survey that we cite in the background. Part of this variation will always exist, as conditions at birth sometimes mean that components of intended active management or expectant management cannot be carried out. We will refer to the current definitions in the review and add the appropriate reference when we update the review.</P>

<P>'Delayed clamping' of the umbilical cord at birth appears to be regarded as a novel alternative to a longstanding protocol for immediate disconnection of an infant from placental circulation within seconds of birth.<BR/>
<BR/>How many prospective parents are aware of the protocol for clamping the umbilical cord immediately at birth? How many prospective parents are fully informed about randomized controlled trials before assenting to random assignment to one group or another?<BR/>
<BR/>The infant does not gain 30 per cent more blood volume when the cord is left intact until pulsations cease. On the contrary the infant loses 30 per cent of its blood volume if placental circulation is clamped off immediately at birth.<BR/>
<BR/>The placenta is the respiratory organ of the child until its blood is transferred to the capillaries surrounding the alveoli and the lungs become fully functional. Pulsations in the cord are from the infant's heart continuing to make use of fetal circulation back to the placenta until the foramen ovale, ductus arteriosus, and pulmonary bypass circulation have closed. Clamping a pulsating umbilical cord arbitrarily terminates postnatal placental circulation. Redistribution of blood to the lungs, the brain, the gut will be variable from infant to infant.<BR/>
<BR/>Randomized controlled trials show that most healthy newborn babies somehow adjust, but findings like increased bilirubin levels are insufficient justification for promoting continued use of the obstetric clamp.<BR/>
<BR/>Oxygen insufficiency is the greatest danger of disrupted umbilical blood-flow, prenatally, during labor, when the cord is wrapped around the neck, and after birth. Bilirubin is only a danger if the blood-brain-barrier is disrupted, as demonstrated by research like that of Lucey et al (1964) and Lou et al (1977). Why is evidence of this kind, obtained in experiments with animals overlooked in favor of randomized controlled experiments with human children?<BR/>

<BR/>1. Lucey JF, Hibbard E, Behrman RE, Esquival FO, Windle WF. Kernicterus in asphyxiated newborn monkeys. Exp Neurol 1964 Jan; 9(1):43-58.<BR/>Lucey et al induced hyperbiliruninemia in fourteen newborn monkeys by injecting a solution of bilirubin into the bloodstream every six hours. Bilirubin levels of 20 to 35 mg were maintained for up to 96 hours. Then, "Six healthy full-term monkeys were asphyxiated at birth. A rubber bag filled with saline solution was placed over the fetal head as it was delivered from the uterus before the first breath. The umbilical cord was then clamped and asphyxiation carried out for 10 or 12 minutes" [p45]. Hyperbilirubinemia was then induced in the asphyxiated monkeys as in the fourteen control animals.<BR/>Lucey et al described the monkeys made hyperbilirubinemic as showing marked yellow coloration of skin and mucous membranes. Those not asphyxiated became slightly lethargic but none developed signs of neurological impairment. Monkeys subjected to asphyxia before induction of hyperbilirubinemia developed tremors, seizures, and prolonged periods of opisthotonus (a postural state with arched back and neck).<BR/>"Hyperbilirubinemia alone did not result in selective staining of nuclei in the brain, such as is associated with human kernicterus - the brains had a diffuse, faint to moderate, yellow color, but no extravascular bilirubin was seen" [p50].<BR/>Bilirubin is not directly toxic to the brain. Asphyxia appears to break down the blood-brain barrier, which then allows bilirubin to get into neural cells. As Zimmerman and Yannet noted in 1933, 'any intravital dye will localize in zones of injury and will leave unstained tissues which are not damaged.' [4, p757]</P>
<P>2. Lou HC, Tweed WA, Johnson G, Jones M, Lassen NA. Breakdown of blood/brain barrier in kernicterus. Lancet. 1977 May 14;1(8020):1062-3.<BR/>Lou et al (1977) addressed what appeared to be the primary concern over "delayed" cord clamping allowing placental transfusion [5]. Citing the paper by Lucey et al (1964) they stated:<BR/>"Asphyxiated infants are especially susceptible to kernicterus, even if their plasma-bilirubin levels are low. Furthermore, it is very difficult to produce clinical and pathological signs of kernicterus by injection of bilirubin intravenously in normal infant monkeys, while kernicterus was readily produced in previously asphyxiated monkeys." [p1062] Mossakowski et al (1968) used Evans blue dye to investigate the blood-brain barrier in newborn monkeys subjected to asphyxia by clamping the umbilical cord and obstructing the airway [6]. Lou et al also used Evans blue dye in fetal lambs subjected to oxygen insufficiency for 1-2 hours:<BR/>"The fetuses were asphyxiated by partially inflating a cuff around the umbilical cord.<BR/>Asphyxia developed over a period of 1-2 h (pH about 690)." [p1062] The initial response of the fetal lambs was a slowing of heart rate and increased blood pressure during the first half- to one-hour period of umbilical cord blood flow restriction. After that the blood pressure declined and remained low. Twinning is frequent in lambs, and Lou et al used the twin as a control for the fate of Evans blue dye, and reported:<BR/>"We have found, in experimental asphyxia lasting 1-2 h, a striking discoloration throughout cortex and basal ganglia after intravenous injection of 3 ml/kg of a 2% solution of Evans blue in eight non-exteriorised fetal lambs, in contrast to the uncoloured brain tissue in non-asphyxiated twins acting as controls." [p1062] In conclusion they commented:<BR/>"We suggest that the breakdown of the fetal blood/brain barrier to albumin is due to a combination of the initial moderate hypertension and severe vasodilation during asphyxia. The permeability of the blood/brain barrier to albumin in asphyxiated babies would facilitate the transport of bilirubin from plasma to neurones and thus explain the increased susceptibility to kernicterus." [p1063] If a baby does not breathe right away at birth, should the umbilical cord be clamped off right away? Respiratory depression in infants born alive is a current concern and topic for research [7, 8]. If an infant is born alive, it has been receiving oxygen through the umbilical cord up to the time of birth. Shouldn't that lifeline be left intact until the lungs become functional?<BR/>Breakdown of the blood brain barrier by asphyxia has been shown to allow bilirubin and other substances in the circulation to enter the brain. High levels of bilirubin won't affect the brain if the blood-brain barrier has not been breached. Immediate clamping has been too long defended as a means to avoid circulatory overload and hyperbilirubinemia.<BR/>Lou et al (1979) reported results of more research on the vulnerability of the blood-brain barrier to circulatory insufficiency in fetal lambs [3].<BR/>

<BR/>4. Zimmerman HM, Yannet H. Kernicterus: jaundice of the nuclear masses of the brain. American Journal of Diseases of Children 1933 Apr; 45:740-759.<BR/>Before discovery of Rh factor sensitivity, Zimmerman and Yannet in 1933 summarized a large number of case reports of kernicterus. They concluded that kernicterus was caused by bilirubin staining of subcortical nuclei already injured by sepsis or oxygen deprivation. They further commented, "This differs in no way from the well known fact that any intravital dye will localize in zones of injury and will leave unstained tissues which are not damaged," [p757].<BR/>Fear of elevated bilirubin levels became a prime reason 40 years later for advocating immediate clamping of the umbilical cord at birth to minimize placental transfusion [4].<BR/>
<BR/>5. Saigal S, O'Neill A, Surainder Y, Chua LB, Usher R. Placental transfusion and hyperbilirubinemia in the premature. Pediatrics. 1972 Mar;49(3):406-19.<BR/>Is it safe to allow a placental transfusion? By the 1970s the practice of clamping the cord was so widespread, at least in obstetric practice associated with academic institutions, that whether a placental transfusion should be allowed became a major topic for research. Thus the opening comment of this highly influential report states:<BR/>"In full-term infants placental transfusion increases the blood volume of the newborn by 40% to 60% within 5 minutes of birth. Most of the excess blood volume is eliminated within 4 hours by an extravasation of plasma from the circulation. For the remainder of the neonatal period, such infants retain a 50% larger red cell volume dispersed through a slightly enlarged blood volume, with higher hematocrit values than are found in infants whose umbilical cords are clamped immediately at birth." [p406] "If delayed cord clamping is adopted as a means to reduce the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome in premature births, there will be accompanying augmentation of hyperbilirubinemia to deal with." [p418] This paper, with its single focus on bilirubin danger, has been one of the most influential in adopting immediate clamping of the umbilical cord at birth as a standard protocol.<BR/>

<P>Many of the comments in Simon&#8217;s feedback are outside the scope of this Cochrane review. However, responses to some specific issues follow:</P>
<P>
<B>Delayed clamping regarded as novel</B>
</P>
<P>Cochrane reviews are often done when there is variation in practice, as is the case here. For example, in the Background of the review we cite such documented variation which indicates widespread use of both delayed and immediate cord clamping, and we make no judgement about the novelty or otherwise of either technique.</P>
<P>
<B>Infant loses 30% of blood volume, does not gain 30%</B>
</P>
<P>Our phrasing in the background is about transfer of fetal blood. In order to clarify further, we have added &#8220;compared with immediate cord clamping&#8221; after &#8220;This placental transfusion can provide the infant with an additional 30% more blood volume and up to 60% more red blood cells&#8221;.</P>
<P>
<B>Increased bilirubin levels are insufficient justification for promoting continued use of the obstetric clamp</B>
</P>
<P>Firstly our review does not promote the continued use of clamping; in fact, it is more the reverse. However, we do note that increased levels of jaundice may be associated with delayed cord clamping, which is the responsible course of action.</P>
<P>
<B>Evidence from animal studies should suffice</B>
</P>
<P>This is not the place for a detailed discussion of the pros and cons of using data from animal studies, except to say that most clinicians and researchers would be very cautious about extrapolating to humans, especially human infants.  </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Saigal-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Saigal 1972</LINK>
<B> influenced adopting immediate cord clamping as a standard protocol </B>
</P>
<P>This may well be so, but the Saigal study did not contribute data to the outcome of jaundice in this review (as they reported only the biochemical outcome of bilirubin levels and not jaundice). The fundamental purpose of systematic reviews is to show the consolidated evidence of benefits and harms of particular actions, not to rely on single studies or opinion.</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY MODIFIED="2009-05-08 11:01:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>I am very concerned about one of the studies used for this conclusion: Following birth, there was a significant increase in infants needing phototherapy for jaundice (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.92; five trials of 1762 infants) in the late compared with early clamping group. </P>
<P>This finding (analysis 1.15) is significantly influenced by results from the Oxford Midwives study (<LINK REF="STD-Oxford-Midwives-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Oxford Midwives 1991</LINK>), which is quoted here as showing jaundice requiring phototherapy amongst 3/256 immediate cord-clamped (ICC ) babies and 11/296 delayed cord clamped (DCC) babies.</P>
<P>However, a close reading of this paper shows a significant disparity in these groups in relation to exposure to synthetic oxytocin in labour: 33/256 (12.9%) in ICC group and 72/296 (24.3%) in the DCC group: <I>see</I> table 1.</P>
<P>Study authors note this (and the association between exposure to synthetic oxytocin in labour and jaundice), and, in table 6 of this paper, reanalyze the groups in relation to oxytocin exposure, finding 5/70 DCC versus 2/33 ICC babies exposed to oxytocin required phototherapy for jaundice, and  6/222 DCC versus 1/218 ICC unexposed to oxytocin. In this analysis, the confidence intervals were wide and the differences between ICC and DCC babies were not significant in either group.</P>
<P>I am concerned that the reviewers have not adjusted for this confounding factor, which is very salient to the findings and to the overall review conclusions, and would welcome a reanalysis of table 1.15.</P>
<P>There were some other worrying elements in this study:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Lack of blinding to allocation, leaving the possibility that clinicians may have referred more jaundiced DCC babies for phototherapy because of their own beliefs.</LI>
<LI>A sizeable unexplained disparity in numbers randomized to each arm: 296 DCC versus 256 ICC.</LI>
<LI>A large number of protocol deviations in the DCC arm (32 versus 3 ICC).</LI>
</UL>
<P>I also note the small numbers of events used in analysis 1.15.</P>
<P>I (and many others interested in this area) would also welcome access to detail from the unpublished study (McDonald 96) that seems to have influenced this finding.</P>

<P>The actual influence of infants exposed to synthetic oxytocins in the Oxford Midwives study is minimal; a re-analysis omitting these infants changes the overall risk ratio (of the pooled studies) from 0.59 95% CI to 0.38 to 0.92; to 0.59 95% CI 0.37 to 0.95.</P>
<P>While it is possible that lack of blinding may have had an influence, we think that it is unlikely, since women were not explicitly informed of their allocation at the time of the birth. In the period that most of these trials were conducted, midwives present at the birth would not be the midwives providing postnatal care. In the McDonald Study, postnatal ward staff were not aware of allocations to groups, or even that a particular infant had participated in the study. Furthermore, the decision to place a baby under phototherapy has many objective elements and criteria.</P>
<P>We agree that the study authors did not explain the reasonably large discrepancy in numbers randomised to delayed and immediate cord clamping (296 versus 256) but do not have the information to assess any impact of this on the trial&#8217;s reported results.</P>
<P>Some protocol deviations are to be expected with the nature of these interventions; particularly for delayed cord clamping where immediate cord clamping may have to be carried out in some cases. The study authors analysed these deviations correctly (in the groups to which the mothers were originally randomised). However, an additional &#8216;as treated&#8217; analysis would have been informative.</P>
<P>Small numbers of events usually are associated with less precision, so it is interesting to see that the pooled result reached statistical significance with these small numbers.</P>
<P>The McDonald trial is a thesis, available from the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group or from Professor McDonald. A journal manuscript is being prepared.</P>

A preliminary assessment of the available data reveals no statistically significant difference between the late and early cord clamping arms</P>

<P>Feedback: I am really interested in the data and have reviewed some of the original trials, as well as taking an active ongoing interest in the issue.</P>
<P>I remain unconvinced that DCC ought to be adopted widely in iron replete areas.</P>
<P>But my feedback is: Why is infant weight not reported? </P>
<P>Justification: If the size of the transfusion is anywhere near as big as many suggest, then it must be the case that a difference in weight can be shown as so many women have been randomised.  If no such weight effect is shown, then either the transfusion is smaller than is suggested, randomisation is in some way ineffective, or there is still inadequate power for these RCTs to show us the size of the transfusion.  It seems unlikely that the latter is true.</P>
<P>Many who write on this subject are increasingly keen on DCC. This is obviously fine, but for those of us who are not yet practising it, or who are planning further work, the actual size of the transfusion is relevant; particularly when there is a suite of trials and a way to answer the question. I do know of some who are suspicious as to why the weight data are as yet unpublished.</P>
<P>As birthweight will undoubtedly have been recorded in the trials, lets report it here!</P>

<P>My concern about this review is the conclusion that "<I>Delayed cord clamping is likely to be beneficial as long as access to treatment for jaundice requiring phototherapy is available</I>." This conclusion came from the finding that "<I>Fewer infants in the early cord clamping group required phototherapy for jaundice than in the late cord clamping group (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.96, data from seven trials, 2324 infants with a LCER of 4.36%, I2 0%).</I>"</P>
<P>Data on phototherapy for jaundice comes largely from McDonald 1996, the full report of which is unpublished. Some parts of this trial are published, but the full report is available only through the Pregnancy and Childbirth Group Editorial Office in Liverpool. It is notable that an earlier systematic review[1], which did not include McDonald 1996, did not find any clear increase in the need for phototherapy. The conclusion of the current Cochrane review is extremely important because many units are still carrying out routine early cord clamping because of the fear of not having sufficient resources for phototherapy.</P>
<P>The increased need for phototherapy for non-haemolytic hyperbilirubinaemia is frequently given as a barrier to the introduction of delayed cord clamping. However the evidence for this increased need is not consistent. At one end of the scale there is one subgroup of McDonald 1996 combined with Oxford Midwives 1991 reporting a relative risk (RR) of needing phototherapy to be 0.59 (95% CI 0.32 to 1.11) for early clamping compared with delayed clamping, and the second subgroup of McDonald 1996 study reporting a RR of 0.47 (0.22 to 0.97). On the other hand Andersson 2011 and Emhamed 2004 had very few babies needing phototherapy, and the trend was in the opposite direction to that in McDonald 1996 and Oxford Midwives 1991, with slightly more babies receiving phototherapy after early cord clamping. There was no clear difference in the mean bilirubin level between the two groups. The two other studies Nelson 1980 and van Rheenen 2007 also had small numbers of babies receiving phototherapy. The two studies which strongly influence the conclusion that late cord clamping is associated with an increased need for phototherapy were both carried out in the 1990&#8217;s. As has been pointed out<SUP>2</SUP>, there was no consistent threshold of bilirubin for deciding when to use phototherapy and the clinicians were not blinded, so bias was possible. Has the use of phototherapy been modified since the 1990&#8217;s, and does this explain the marked difference? In the three studies carried out before 2000 the use of phototherapy was 6% while in the three studies after 2000 it was only 0.9%. McDonald 1996 reported the greatest number of babies receiving phototherapy, and this has the greatest influence on the conclusion of this review. Although there was no statistically significant difference between groups for the diagnosis of clinical jaundice, there was a difference for receiving phototherapy. This may have been because of bias in deciding phototherapy was needed, or at lack of consistency in the bilirubin threshold for intervention.</P>
<P>Intention-to-treat analysis (ITT) is used in the Cochrane Reviews. This is important as it reduces bias if participants do not receive the allocated intervention and or if there is loss to follow-up. For cord clamping trials the protocol should be designed so that maximal adherence is assured, as a large number of protocol violations related to compliance with the allocated intervention may invalidate the results. The perceived need for neonatal resuscitation is clearly a reason why babies allocated to delayed cord clamping may have early cord clamping. McDonald 1996 did not specifically exclude babies requiring resuscitation, although this was clearly going to result in non-compliance. In the unpublished full report (table 6.1) the largest number of participants who did not have the intervention as allocated was in the late cord clamping group, when the babies needed active resuscitation. 38 babies in the late cord clamping group did not have the allocated intervention compared with only one in the early cord clamping group. In Andersson 2011 there were 12.5% protocol violations equally distributed between early and late cord clamping. For this trial, analyses for the main and secondary outcomes, including cases of protocol breach at inclusion as well as per protocol (n=334), did not alter the overall result. In the report of their trial these authors noted there have been &#8220;<I>inconsistent results on the possible association between delayed cord clamping and neonatal jaundice, and the Cochrane review that reported a significant increase in infants needing phototherapy for jaundice relied heavily on unpublished data</I>.&#8221;</P>
<P>In McDonald 1996 38 women were allocated delayed cord clamping, but received early cord clamping. As the study had a factorial design these women were either allocated early oxytocic and late cord clamping, or late oxytocic and late cord clamping. It is possible that the non-compliance was in the timing of the oxytocic but this seems unlikely since early rather than delayed cord clamping is generally agreed as an indication for resuscitation. Although a tight nuchal cord is mentioned as a cause for non-compliance with delayed cord clamping it is not specifically listed in table 6.1. A tight nuchal cord managed by clamping and cutting is a significant risk for hypoxia and ischaemia. Feedback on this review comments<SUP>2</SUP> &#8220;<I>In particular difficulty was experienced in the trial arms where late cord clamping was intended but only occurred in 50% of cases within the allocated time frame. The reasons listed mainly related to umbilical cord being tightly wound around the baby&#8217;s neck, presence of meconium liquor or requirement for some form of active resuscitation that necessitated premature cord clamping</I>.&#8221; Thus 122 of 244 women allocated to delayed cord clamping actually received delayed clamping. 38 babies born to women allocated to delayed cord clamping had a need for resuscitation and therefore had early cord clamping.</P>
<P>Analysis by intention to treat becomes meaningless when there is a 50% protocol violation. So analysis by actual allocation can be considered. However it would be more appropriate to remove the study from the Cochrane Review.</P>
<P>It should also be noted that the primary focus of McDonald 1996 was the effect of timing of cord clamping on maternal postpartum haemorrhage. The need for phototherapy was not prespecified as a primary or secondary outcome, so it was not appropriate to use this in the systematic review.</P>
