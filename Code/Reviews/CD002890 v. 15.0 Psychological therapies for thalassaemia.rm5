<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Using psychological treatments to help people manage thalassaemia</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Thalassaemia is a group of genetic blood disorders. Blood transfusion is needed to treat severe forms of the condition, but this results in a high level of iron in the body. This excess iron is usually removed by drugs through 'chelation therapy'. Other less usual treatments are bone marrow transplantation, which is restricted by age, and hydroxyurea, a drug designed to raise the level of foetal haemoglobin and reduce anaemia. Psychological support would seem suitable to manage thalassaemia which is a chronic disease with a considerable role for self-management. We were not able to find any trials to include in this review. There are some reports that teaching people about their condition improves adherence to chelation therapy. However, from the information currently available, we can not recommend the use of specific psychological therapies in thalassaemia. We believe there is a need for large trials to assess the value of psychological therapies for thalassaemia. </P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Thalassaemia is a group of genetic blood disorders characterised by the absence or reduction in the production of haemoglobin. Severity is variable from less severe anaemia, through thalassaemia intermedia, to profound severe anaemia (thalassaemia major). In thalassaemia major other complications include growth retardation, bone deformation, and enlarged spleen. Blood transfusion is required to treat severe forms of thalassaemia, but this results in excessive accumulation of iron in the body (iron overload), removed mostly by a drug called desferrioxamine through 'chelation therapy'. Non-routine treatments are bone marrow transplantation (which is age restricted), and possibly hydroxyurea, designed to raise foetal haemoglobin level, thus reducing anaemia. In addition, psychological therapies seem appropriate to improving outcome and adherence to medical treatment.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To examine the evidence that in people with thalassaemia, psychological treatments improve the ability to cope with the condition, and improve both medical and psychosocial outcomes. </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-11-13 15:23:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-12-01 16:55:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Thalassaemia syndromes are a family of genetic blood disorders characterised by an imbalance in the synthesis of globin chains, which may result in the absence or reduction of the production of adult haemoglobin. The major component found in adult red blood cells is haemoglobin A, which consists of two alpha and two beta protein 'globin' chains (&#945;<SUP>2</SUP>&#946;<SUP>2</SUP>) combined with 'haem' containing iron. The minor haemoglobin is A<SUB>2</SUB>, which consists of two alpha and two delta globin chains (&#945;<SUP>2</SUP>&#948;<SUP>2</SUP>). Foetal haemoglobin (which declines after birth) is also present and consists of two alpha and two gamma globin chains (&#945;<SUP>2</SUP>&#947;<SUP>2</SUP>). Several hundreds of different mutations or deletions of globin genes have been found, that may give rise to different forms of thalassaemia. Alpha thalassaemia and beta thalassaemia are the most common and clinically relevant.</P>
<P>Alpha thalassaemia is the loss of alpha globin chains. Alpha genes are duplicated and usually depicted as (&#945;&#945;/&#945;&#945;). Loss of both genes is called &#945;<SUP>0</SUP> thalassaemia, represented as (--/&#945;&#945;), and loss of one gene is called &#945;<SUP>+</SUP> thalassaemia i.e. (-&#945;/&#945;&#945;). Usually these alpha genes are lost by deletion, less commonly by mutation. Foetal haemoglobin and adult haemoglobin have alpha globin chains, therefore the condition is found in both foetal and adult life. In addition to the reduced haemoglobin formation caused by decreased production of alpha globin chains, there is an excess of gamma globin and beta globin chains leading to haemoglobin Bart's (gamma globin tetramers) and haemoglobin H (beta globin tetramers). Severity varies according to the type of defect.</P>
<P>By contrast, beta thalassaemia results from different mutations of beta globin genes leading to the absence of beta globin chains (&#946;<SUP>0</SUP> thalassaemia) or their reduced synthesis (&#946;<SUP>+</SUP> thalassaemia), with an excess of alpha globin chains. Severity is also variable from mild anaemia, through intermediate forms, to severe anaemia. In severe cases of beta thalassaemia (known as thalassaemia major) other complications include bone deformation, enlarged spleen, and growth retardation (<LINK REF="REF-Weatherall-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weatherall 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Thalassaemia is found across the world. Affected population estimated rates are: Europe 0.9%; Asia 4.1%; Africa 13.3%; Oceania (including Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and Fiji) 1.3%; and the Americas 2% (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1994</LINK>). In many populations where thalassaemia is common, the genes for haemoglobin variants such as the sickle haemoglobin S, or haemoglobin C and E are also prevalent. Therefore, some people inherit a gene for beta thalassaemia from one parent and a gene for haemoglobin variant from the other. The most important diseases of this type are sickle beta thalassaemia and haemoglobin E beta thalassaemia. Over 4.5% of the global population carry a haemoglobin variant gene. However, almost three-quarters of affected births are in Africa (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Phenotype classification of thalassaemia is based on severity of anaemia and need for transfusion therapy. Carriers with only one abnormal gene have thalassaemia minor (mild anaemia with minor haematological changes). People with two or more abnormal genes may inherit thalassaemia intermedia (moderate anaemia with typical body alterations (e.g. bone deformation, growth retardation) or thalassaemia major (severe transfusion-dependent anaemia). Life-long and regular blood transfusion is required to treat thalassaemia major. This results in excessive accumulation of iron in the body (iron overload), which in the long term leads to severe clinical complications, such as heart and liver failure, diabetes and hypogonadism (<LINK REF="REF-Weatherall-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weatherall 1997</LINK>). Iron overload may be prevented and treated by daily removal (iron chelation therapy), which involves overnight infusions of desferrioxamine (Desferal<SUP>®</SUP>). Poor compliance with this treatment is the most common clinical problem in thalassaemia major (<LINK REF="REF-Brittenham-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brittenham 1994</LINK>). Alternative chelating agents, including oral deferiprone, are under study and may be less safe and effective (<LINK REF="REF-Olivieri-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olivieri 1995</LINK>). Due to advances in transfusion regimens, chelation therapy, and the treatment of the complications of thalassaemia, many people with thalassaemia can lead active lives and have increased survival (<LINK REF="REF-Modell-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Modell 2000</LINK>). Many of these people are now treated as outpatients and in peripheral centres. Other treatments are bone marrow transplantation, which is limited to those with a sibling of the same tissue type (<LINK REF="REF-Lucarelli-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucarelli 1993</LINK>), and hydroxyurea (which is currently under study), a drug which may raise foetal haemoglobin level in a small proportion of cases (<LINK REF="REF-Arruda-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arruda 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Psychosocial problems associated with thalassaemia include feelings of distress; poor social functioning, such as integration into school and work (<LINK REF="REF-Masera-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Masera 1990</LINK>); and expression of guilt, denial and over-protectiveness of families (<LINK REF="REF-Massaglia-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Massaglia 1985</LINK>). A descriptive study suggests that psychosocial burden is associated with clinical severity (<LINK REF="REF-Ratip-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ratip 1995</LINK>). Adherence to iron chelation therapy is a major issue (especially in adolescents with thalassaemia), such that some behavioural interventions focus on the self-management of chelation.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-05-14 11:01:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>The object of psychological therapies are to help people with thalassaemia cope better, fulfil roles, and to achieve better quality of life. These interventions are age-appropriate, and usually available in both hospital and community based settings.</P>
<P>Psychological therapies for managing thalassaemia include patient education, cognitive therapy, behavioural therapy and psychodynamic psychotherapy. Specific examples of each of these are given below in '<LINK TAG="CRIT_INTERVENTIONS" TYPE="SECTION">Types of interventions</LINK>'.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2008-05-14 11:03:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Psychological interventions, if effective, will lead to acquisition or improvement of effective coping strategies to alleviate symptoms and emotional difficulties. Individuals will see a reduction in emotional distress, have more positive moods, better adhere to medical treatment (including iron chelation), and show an improved quality of life.</P>

<P>No randomised controlled trials employing psychological therapies as described in '<LINK TAG="CRIT_INTERVENTIONS" TYPE="SECTION">Types of interventions</LINK>' were identified by the literature searches undertaken for this review. Also, no trials, where quasi-randomisation methods such as alternation are used, were found. We plan to analyse these trials separately, but only if there is sufficient evidence that the treatment and non-treatment groups are comparable in terms of clinical features.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Suitable trials were not found in the literature for our objectives to be achieved at present. We cannot, at this time, draw any conclusions on the efficacy of psychological therapies for people with thalassaemia to help them adjust and manage their condition. Nonetheless, the literature indicates that patient educational intervention improves adherence to chelation therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Treadwell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Treadwell 2001</LINK>).</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>No conclusions can be drawn at the present time about the effectiveness of psychological therapies for managing thalassaemia.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There seems no reason to justify the absence of randomised controlled trials of psychological therapies for thalassaemia, since the need for psychological interventions is indicated in the literature. Also, psychological trials of this nature have been conducted in similar conditions such as sickle cell disease. Research is needed using a structured approach to the assessment of psychological therapies for thalassaemia, which take into account both demographic and clinical variables. Well-designed, adequately-powered trials should incorporate treatment manuals in identifying the most important components of psychological interventions, relevant to different thalassaemia populations, and in testing the efficacy of different therapy formats, e.g. individual versus group. Similar outcome measures should also be used, both within and between different thalassaemia patient groups. For this purpose, multicentre collaboration, perhaps international, may be needed. </P>
<P>An appropriate review will be possible, if data are reported in the publications describing trials in the future.</P>
