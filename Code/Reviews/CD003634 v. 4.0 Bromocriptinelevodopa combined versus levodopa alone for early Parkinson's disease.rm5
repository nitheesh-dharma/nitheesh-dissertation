<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Parkinson's disease is a disabling condition characterised by slowness of movement, trembling (tremors) and stiffness. Currently, the best treatment is levodopa. However, according to the number of levodopa treatment years, new disabling fluctuations of movement occur. To overcome this problem, bromocriptine has been tried in combination with levodopa. This review of relevant published trials found no evidence that early use of combined bromocriptine/levodopa prevents or delays such fluctuations of movement in patients with Parkinson's disease. </P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Drugs that mimic dopamine, such as bromocriptine (BR), were introduced as monotherapy or in combination with levodopa (LD) in the hope that this approach would prevent or delay the onset of motor complications in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, hitherto, the role of BR has remained controversial. We present a systematic review of all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of BR/LD combination therapy compared with LD monotherapy in PD. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the efficacy and safety of BR/LD combination therapy in delaying the onset of motor complications associated with LD monotherapy in patients with PD.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Movement Disorders Group trials register which includes MEDLINE and EMBASE; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library); handsearched appropriate neurology journals, symposia reports, PD handbooks and reference lists of reviews found by the search-strategy. We also contacted Sandoz -now Novartis- (manufacturer of BR) and PPD Pharmaco and contacted colleagues who had co-ordinated trials on BR.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>RCTs were eligible for inclusion if they evaluated the efficacy of BR/LD combination therapy for delaying the onset of motor complications compared with LD monotherapy in patients with PD. Outcome measures evaluated included the occurrence and severity of motor complications, impairment and disability scores, side effects and dropouts.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>To determine the feasibility of a quantitative systematic review two independent reviewers evaluated the methodological quality of identified trials and extracted data from the trials.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>The methodological quality of seven trials showed important shortcomings. All studies failed adequately to describe randomisation procedures. Only three were carried out according to a double-blind design. Differences were found between studies concerning the mean age of the participants, the BR titration phase, the maximum achieved daily dose of LD (62.5 to 1000 mg) and BR (5 to 50 mg), and the applied outcomes. Our results show no evidence of consistent differences between treatment groups concerning the occurrence and severity of motor complications, scores of impairment and disability, or the occurrence of side effects.<BR/> </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>This systematic review revealed no evidence to support the use of early BR/LD combination therapy as a strategy to prevent or delay the onset of motor complications in the treatment of PD.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder that produces a slowly progressive disability. The main features of PD are trembling (tremor), increased muscle tone (rigidity), slowness of movement (bradykinesia) and disturbance of posture and balance. These features are caused by a depletion of the neurotransmitter dopamine due to the progressive loss of nigral neurons in the brain (<LINK REF="REF-Bernheimer-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernheimer 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hornykiewicz-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hornykiewicz 1966</LINK>). The general approach to the treatment of patients with PD is the administration of drugs to alleviate symptoms. This may be achieved by the restoration of dopamine by administering its precursor levodopa (LD). LD provides immediate and satisfactory control of most symptoms. However, after two to five years of stable response to LD treatment, approximately half of these patients develop motor complications (<LINK REF="REF-Marsden-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marsden 1982</LINK>), some of which are thought to be highly correlated with prolonged LD exposure (<LINK REF="REF-Lees-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lees 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marsden-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marsden 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shaw-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaw 1980</LINK>). </P>
<P>Because of the aforementioned limitations of LD therapy new therapeutic approaches have been explored. In 1974 bromocriptine (BR), a dopamine agonist, was first introduced as an adjunct to conventional LD therapy in PD patients with motor complications (<LINK REF="REF-Calne-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Calne 1974</LINK>). Dopamine agonists bypass the degenerating nigral neurons and stimulate the dopamine receptors directly (<LINK REF="REF-Corrodi-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corrodi 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goldstein-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldstein 1983</LINK>). Attention then focused on the possibility of using BR monotherapy or a combination of LD and BR as a first line treatment in early PD. These treatment strategies would allow either a later start (BR monotherapy) or a lower dose of LD (BR/LD combination therapy), thus potentially preventing or delaying the onset of the late complications of LD therapy.</P>
<P>We present a systematic review of all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of BR/LD combination therapy compared with LD monotherapy in PD. A separate review covers the effect of BR monotherapy versus LD monotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Ramaker-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramaker 2004</LINK>).</P>

<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>We included studies with PD patients who suffered from idiopathic PD (diagnosed by the enrolling investigators) who had never used BR and did not have motor fluctuations, and also those who had used LD for a short period (generally less than 6 months), peripheral decarboxylase inhibition, anticholinergic co-medication, or amantadine.</P>

<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>1. We based the review on the search strategy for PD of the Cochrane Movement Disorders Group (including trials published between 1974 and April 2007), including computerised searches of MEDLINE and EMBASE, handsearching of appropriate neurology journals, and also the following more general search strategy:<BR/>a) Bromocriptine OR Parlodel<BR/>b) Parkinson OR Parkinson's disease OR Parkinsonism<BR/>c) #a AND #b </P>
<P>Further details are available from the Group's module on the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.<BR/>2. We also searched The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) for relevant trials. <BR/>3. We searched the reference lists of located trials and of other BR reviews. <BR/>4. Additional assistance was provided by the drug manufacturer Sandoz (now Novartis) and PPD Pharmaco.<BR/>5. We searched symposia reports and PD handbooks.<BR/>6. We contacted colleagues who had co-ordinated trials on BR for information on unpublished studies. </P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers independently reviewed the identified trials using a two-step review process. First, they reviewed the abstracts for eligibility. Thereafter, they reviewed eligible study reports of studies. Discrepancies were registered and resolved by consensus with a third reviewer. Data was independently extracted from the eligible trials by two reviewers, with any discrepancies resolved by consensus.</P>
<P>To determine the feasibility of performing a quantitative systematic review of BR/LD combination therapy in PD patients, we addressed the following issues for each of the eligible studies:<BR/>1. Application of general principles of trial methodology.<BR/>2. Participant baseline characteristics, including LD dosage and duration of LD use, when applicable.<BR/>3. Titration schedules.<BR/>4. Assessment procedures and outcome measures.</P>
<P>If the information on the aforementioned issues (1-4) was insufficiently reported, we attempted to contact the trialists to obtain additional clarifying data.</P>

<P>
<B>Number of trials identified<BR/>
</B>In the search period 1974 to April 2007, we identified 23 published reports of RCTs that met our selection criteria. We excluded 10 reports that were interim analyses (<LINK REF="STD-Kowa-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kowa 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Montastruc-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montastruc 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Montastruc-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montastruc 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nakanishi-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Nakanishi 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nakanishi-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Nakanishi 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nakanishi-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Nakanishi 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nakanishi-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Nakanishi 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nakanishi-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Nakanishi 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tashiro-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Tashiro 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yanagisawa-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Yanagisawa 1994</LINK>) and two reports that were practically identical to an included trial (<LINK REF="STD-Fischer-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Fischer 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Montastruc-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Montastruc 1990</LINK>). One study was published only as a conference proceeding in abstract form (<LINK REF="STD-Presthus-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Presthus 1977</LINK>) and one other as a progress note (<LINK REF="STD-Kuno-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kuno 1993</LINK>). In spite of recalculations made by the investigators, one study had to be excluded because patients suffering motor complications before entering the trial were included (<LINK REF="STD-Ogawa-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ogawa 1997</LINK>). Montastruc had to be excluded after revealing that an alternated randomisation procedure was used (<LINK REF="STD-Montastruc-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Montastruc 1994</LINK>). The remaining seven trials randomised over 1100 patients to a LD or a BR/LD combination regimen. </P>
<P>
<B>Participant characteristics<BR/>
</B>Not all of the included trial reports adequately described the characteristics of included patients. Reasons for inclusion were sometimes vague, suggesting that both patients with PD and other causes of parkinsonism were included. The mean age of all the participants ranged from 56.7 (<LINK REF="STD-Bakheit-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bakheit 1990</LINK>) to 67.5 years (<LINK REF="STD-Herskovits-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Herskovits 1988</LINK>). The mean disease duration ranged from 7.4 months (<LINK REF="STD-Gim_x00e9_nez-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Giménez 1997</LINK>) to 4.1 years (<LINK REF="STD-Alarc_x00f3_n-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Alarcón 1998</LINK>). Three trials excluded patients who had been previously treated with LD (<LINK REF="STD-Alarc_x00f3_n-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Alarcón 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Herskovits-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Herskovits 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weiner-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Weiner 1993</LINK>). Bakheit and Olsson allowed LD treatment for less than two years (<LINK REF="STD-Bakheit-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bakheit 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olsson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Olsson 1990</LINK>) and Przuntek and Giménez for less than six months (<LINK REF="STD-Gim_x00e9_nez-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Giménez 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Przuntek-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Przuntek 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Titration schedules</B>
<BR/>For all trials, the duration of the titration phase remained unclear. BR was introduced at a dose of 1.25 mg or 2.5 mg every day. Dose increments varied between 1.25 mg every two weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Alarc_x00f3_n-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Alarcón 1998</LINK>) to 2.5 mg every week (<LINK REF="STD-Gim_x00e9_nez-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Giménez 1997</LINK>). Maximum BR daily doses were reported for four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Alarc_x00f3_n-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Alarcón 1998</LINK> (30 mg); <LINK REF="STD-Bakheit-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bakheit 1990</LINK> (30 mg); <LINK REF="STD-Gim_x00e9_nez-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Giménez 1997</LINK> (45 mg); <LINK REF="STD-Olsson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Olsson 1990</LINK> (30 mg)). In the trials of Alarcón and Giménez, the patients used BR twice daily and three times daily (<LINK REF="STD-Alarc_x00f3_n-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Alarcón 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gim_x00e9_nez-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Giménez 1997</LINK>), respectively while Bakheit and Olsson used BR both twice and three times daily (<LINK REF="STD-Bakheit-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bakheit 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olsson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Olsson 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>Przuntek started with three months of LD monotherapy for both groups followed by gradual substitution of the LD (up to 40%) by BR between the third and the sixth study month in half of the patients (<LINK REF="STD-Przuntek-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Przuntek 1996</LINK>). </P>
<P>One study introduced LD (in the LD group) at a dose of 50 mg per day (<LINK REF="STD-Weiner-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Weiner 1993</LINK>). Herskovits and Alarcón started with 125 mg LD per day (<LINK REF="STD-Alarc_x00f3_n-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Alarcón 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Herskovits-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Herskovits 1988</LINK>). Giménez, whose patients were already on LD, attempted to reduce the LD dosage by 20% to 30% (<LINK REF="STD-Gim_x00e9_nez-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Giménez 1997</LINK>). Bakheit also reduced the LD each week, so that at week 10 the LD dose was 40% that of the prestudy LD dose (maximum 750 mg per day) (<LINK REF="STD-Bakheit-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bakheit 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>One study used benserazide as the peripheral dopa decarboxylase inhibitor (DDI) in an LD/DDI ratio of 4:1 (<LINK REF="STD-Przuntek-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Przuntek 1996</LINK>). Carbidopa was used by Alarcón and by Weiner in a LD/DDI ratio of 4:1 (<LINK REF="STD-Alarc_x00f3_n-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Alarcón 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weiner-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Weiner 1993</LINK>) and by Herskovits in a ratio of 10:1(<LINK REF="STD-Herskovits-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Herskovits 1988</LINK>). In the trials by Giménez and by Olsson both carbidopa and benserazide were used, but no information on the LD/DDI ratio was recorded (<LINK REF="STD-Gim_x00e9_nez-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Giménez 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olsson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Olsson 1990</LINK>). In the trial by Bakheit, LD was always given with a DDI but no information on the LD/DDI ratio was provided (<LINK REF="STD-Bakheit-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bakheit 1990</LINK>). The LD dose increment varied or remained unclear.</P>
<P>
<B>Assessment procedures and outcome measures</B>
<BR/>Five out of the seven trials reported motor complications, but definitions of outcomes were not clearly given in individual trials (<LINK REF="STD-Alarc_x00f3_n-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Alarcón 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gim_x00e9_nez-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Giménez 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Herskovits-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Herskovits 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Przuntek-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Przuntek 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weiner-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Weiner 1993</LINK>). The five trials evaluated the occurrence of dyskinesias and dystonia separately, although in the Przuntek study dystonia and chorea were evaluated as dyskinesias (<LINK REF="STD-Przuntek-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Przuntek 1996</LINK>). Changes in the occurrence of wearing-off were evaluated by two (<LINK REF="STD-Alarc_x00f3_n-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Alarcón 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gim_x00e9_nez-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Giménez 1997</LINK>) and on-off motor complications by three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Alarc_x00f3_n-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Alarcón 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gim_x00e9_nez-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Giménez 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Przuntek-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Przuntek 1996</LINK>). Alarcón defined the endpoint of the study as the moment when the first motor complications occurred (<LINK REF="STD-Alarc_x00f3_n-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Alarcón 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>The severity of motor complications was evaluated by two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Przuntek-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Przuntek 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weiner-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Weiner 1993</LINK>). </P>

One study evaluated patients when they exhibited optimal responses to medication (<LINK REF="STD-Gim_x00e9_nez-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Giménez 1997</LINK>). None of the other included RCTs reported if impairment and disability scores referred to the on- or the off-phase. </P>

</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>All studies showed shortcomings in the reported information on relevant methodological issues. We therefore attempted to approach all trialists to obtain additional clarifying data. One trialist was deceased and thus the requested information could not be retrieved (<LINK REF="STD-Herskovits-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Herskovits 1988</LINK>). </P>
<P>
<B>Trial design</B>
<BR/>Four trials used a parallel LD group (<LINK REF="STD-Alarc_x00f3_n-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Alarcón 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Herskovits-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Herskovits 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olsson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Olsson 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Przuntek-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Przuntek 1996</LINK>), two had a placebo/LD combination arm (<LINK REF="STD-Bakheit-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bakheit 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weiner-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Weiner 1993</LINK>) and one trial consisted of a double-blind, placebo-controlled initial stage (eight months) followed by an open-label stage (<LINK REF="STD-Gim_x00e9_nez-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Giménez 1997</LINK>). Two studies were three-arm trials that also randomised patients to a BR monotherapy group (<LINK REF="STD-Herskovits-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Herskovits 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weiner-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Weiner 1993</LINK>).<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Study duration </B>
<BR/>The studies varied in length of follow up between 18 months (<LINK REF="STD-Herskovits-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Herskovits 1988</LINK>) and 4.5 years (<LINK REF="STD-Alarc_x00f3_n-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Alarcón 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Przuntek-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Przuntek 1996</LINK>). Herskovits' follow up period varied between 18 and 45 months (<LINK REF="STD-Herskovits-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Herskovits 1988</LINK>) and in Weiner's study this ranged from 36 to 48 months (<LINK REF="STD-Weiner-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Weiner 1993</LINK>). The Bakheit and Olsson trials reported follow up after 12 months but planned to follow patients for five years (<LINK REF="STD-Bakheit-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bakheit 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olsson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Olsson 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Assessors and centres</B>
<BR/>Most trials were unclear about the number of assessors that participated in a study. The patients were evaluated by 128 assessors in the trial performed by Przuntek (<LINK REF="STD-Przuntek-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Przuntek 1996</LINK>). The number of participating centres was reported in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Alarc_x00f3_n-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Alarcón 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gim_x00e9_nez-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Giménez 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Przuntek-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Przuntek 1996</LINK>); this varied between one (<LINK REF="STD-Alarc_x00f3_n-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Alarcón 1998</LINK>) and 27 (<LINK REF="STD-Przuntek-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Przuntek 1996</LINK>).<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Randomisation</B>
<BR/>None of the studies described the allocation procedure. Additionally obtained information showed that four trials adequately randomised their patients according to tables of random numbers (<LINK REF="STD-Alarc_x00f3_n-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Alarcón 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gim_x00e9_nez-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Giménez 1997</LINK>) or by a computerised random allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Przuntek-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Przuntek 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weiner-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Weiner 1993</LINK>). According to the study authors randomisation by random number tables was blinded, thus ensuring concealment of treatment allocation (grade A in Table 'Characteristics of included studies'). <BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Trial performance</B>
<BR/>Only the Weiner and Bakheit trials were performed according to a double-blind design (<LINK REF="STD-Bakheit-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bakheit 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weiner-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Weiner 1993</LINK>). One trial consisted of a double-blind, placebo-controlled initial stage (eight months) followed by an open-label stage (<LINK REF="STD-Gim_x00e9_nez-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Giménez 1997</LINK>). The Alarcón study was a single open design, probably with a blinded rater (<LINK REF="STD-Alarc_x00f3_n-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Alarcón 1998</LINK>) and the studies by Przuntek and Olsson were open (<LINK REF="STD-Olsson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Olsson 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Przuntek-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Przuntek 1996</LINK>). In one study this aspect remained unclear (<LINK REF="STD-Herskovits-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Herskovits 1988</LINK>).<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Sample size calculations.</B>
<BR/>The Przuntek study reported sample size estimation (<LINK REF="STD-Przuntek-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Przuntek 1996</LINK>). The powering of this study was based on the expected difference in motor adverse effects (30%). Although no information was available on the expected effect size for the Giménez trial, additionally obtained information revealed a required sample size of 35 patients (<LINK REF="STD-Gim_x00e9_nez-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Giménez 1997</LINK>). </P>

</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>Major differences were found between studies concerning the baseline characteristics, the BR titration phase, and the applied outcomes. The 16 patients in Weiner's study had a variable follow up period of 36 to 48 months (<LINK REF="STD-Weiner-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Weiner 1993</LINK>). Hence, for this review the data were evaluated for the first three years only. Data for all assessments were available for two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Przuntek-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Przuntek 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weiner-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Weiner 1993</LINK>), and at follow up periods of 8, 20, 32 and 44 months for one other trial (<LINK REF="STD-Gim_x00e9_nez-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Giménez 1997</LINK>). For two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bakheit-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bakheit 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olsson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Olsson 1990</LINK>) treatments were compared over a five-year period but results were presented for those patients completing one year of treatment. For the remaining two trials, data were available only at baseline and at the end of the trial (<LINK REF="STD-Alarc_x00f3_n-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Alarcón 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Herskovits-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Herskovits 1988</LINK>). After randomisation a number of patients were not included in the analyses: nine in the Alarcón trial (<LINK REF="STD-Alarc_x00f3_n-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Alarcón 1998</LINK>), three in the Giménez trial (<LINK REF="STD-Gim_x00e9_nez-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Giménez 1997</LINK>), four in the Herskovits trial (<LINK REF="STD-Herskovits-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Herskovits 1988</LINK>), 56 in the Przuntek trial (<LINK REF="STD-Przuntek-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Przuntek 1996</LINK>), and one in Weiner trial (<LINK REF="STD-Weiner-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Weiner 1993</LINK>). Although four and 30 patients withdrew during the first 12 months from the Bakheit and Olsson studies respectively, it was not clear if data on these patients contributed to any of the analyses (<LINK REF="STD-Bakheit-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bakheit 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olsson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Olsson 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>Because of the aforementioned methodological problems and incomparability of studies we could not pool the results from the different trials. Available data from individual studies was re-analysed with Cochrane MetaView software and trials were evaluated for potential sources of methodological heterogeneity (differences in study design) and clinical heterogeneity (differences between studies in participants' characteristics, interventions or outcome measures).</P>

Additionally, Herskovits reported two patients with dystonia in the combination arm (<LINK REF="STD-Herskovits-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Herskovits 1988</LINK>).

<B>Impairment (reported by six trials) and disability (reported by five trials)</B>
<BR/>Alarcón reported a statistically significant difference in the change from baseline in favour of the combination arm for the Webster Scale, the CURS, the UPDRS motor section and the NUDS (<LINK REF="STD-Alarc_x00f3_n-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Alarcón 1998</LINK>). The Bakheit trial reported a statistically significant difference in favour of the combination group for the NUDS scores (<LINK REF="STD-Bakheit-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bakheit 1990</LINK>). In the Giménez trial, the UPDRS (total score and motor subscore) improved significantly at all visits in favour of the combination arm (<LINK REF="STD-Gim_x00e9_nez-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Giménez 1997</LINK>). In this trial the scores of the DLAS (<LINK REF="REF-England-1956" TYPE="REFERENCE">England 1956</LINK>) showed a statistically significant difference in favour of the LD arm only at eight months follow up (<LINK REF="STD-Gim_x00e9_nez-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Giménez 1997</LINK>). Herskovits used a Webster Scale and found no significant differences between both groups at the final assessment (<LINK REF="STD-Herskovits-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Herskovits 1988</LINK>). The Olsson trial showed that, after one year, when using the Webster Scale, the combination group was better than the LD-only group and this was almost statistically significant (<LINK REF="STD-Olsson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Olsson 1990</LINK>). However, when using the NUDS scores, there was no significant difference (<LINK REF="STD-Olsson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Olsson 1990</LINK>). In the re-analysis of the Przuntek data we found no significant difference between the treatment groups concerning the yearly sum scores on the Webster Rating Scale, and the use of Motorische Leitungsserie (<LINK REF="STD-Przuntek-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Przuntek 1996</LINK>).

<BR/>Alarcón reported three withdrawals in the LD and two in the combination arm (<LINK REF="STD-Alarc_x00f3_n-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Alarcón 1998</LINK>). One patient died from an unrelated cause, one had a history of psychosis and three had poor compliance. In the Bakheit trial there were three withdrawals in the combination group, all due to adverse events and one in the LD-only group due to non-compliance (<LINK REF="STD-Bakheit-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bakheit 1990</LINK>). In the Giménez trial, none of the early withdrawals were related to adverse effects of therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Gim_x00e9_nez-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Giménez 1997</LINK>). One patient on LD monotherapy died for reasons unrelated to the study. The cause of withdrawal in all other patients was non-compliance. Herskovits reported only one withdrawal in the LD-group due to gastric intolerance (<LINK REF="STD-Herskovits-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Herskovits 1988</LINK>). Olsson reported 16 withdrawals from the combination group and 14 from the LD group, with the numbers of patients withdrawing because of side effects being 11 and three respectively (<LINK REF="STD-Olsson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Olsson 1990</LINK>). In the Weiner study, one patient on LD dropped out because of elevated liver enzymes levels (at 15 months) (<LINK REF="STD-Weiner-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Weiner 1993</LINK>). In the combination arm, one patient dropped out because of loss of efficacy (at 21 months) and one patient because of hospitalisation secondary to depression (at 30 months).</P>
<P>A re-analysis of the data from the Przuntek study revealed a large number of withdrawals in both groups, occurring significantly more frequently among patients on LD monotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Przuntek-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Przuntek 1996</LINK>). Withdrawal in this LD-group was due to inadequate compliance (n = 45), lack of efficacy (n = 32), concomitant diseases (n = 23), death from an unrelated cause (n = 15), side effects (n = 14), and protocol violations (n = 7). Side effects (n = 36) and inadequate compliance (n = 33) were the major reasons for withdrawal in the combination arm, followed by concomitant diseases (n = 18), lack of efficacy (n = 7), death from an unrelated cause (n = 7), and protocol violations (n = 6). </P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This systematic review included seven eligible trials that compared BR/LD combination therapy with LD monotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Alarc_x00f3_n-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Alarcón 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bakheit-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bakheit 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gim_x00e9_nez-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Giménez 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Herskovits-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Herskovits 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olsson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Olsson 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Przuntek-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Przuntek 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weiner-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Weiner 1993</LINK>). Two excluded studies were multiple publications of one other trial (<LINK REF="STD-Fischer-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Fischer 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Montastruc-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Montastruc 1990</LINK>).

Additionally, two trials were excluded because they did not fulfil our inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Montastruc-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Montastruc 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ogawa-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ogawa 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>All trials had problems regarding general and PD-related trial methodology. In general, they all used a small number of patients. Only two trials supplied information on the power (<LINK REF="STD-Gim_x00e9_nez-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Giménez 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Przuntek-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Przuntek 1996</LINK>). Inadequate power could explain why many findings failed to reach a statistically significant level. None of the published studies provided information on type and concealment of the randomisation procedure. Additional information revealed that this essential element of trial methodology was carried out adequately in four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Alarc_x00f3_n-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Alarcón 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gim_x00e9_nez-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Giménez 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Przuntek-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Przuntek 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weiner-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Weiner 1993</LINK>). Except for two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bakheit-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bakheit 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weiner-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Weiner 1993</LINK>), all were performed in an open manner, which generally renders a study more susceptible to false positive results in favour of a new treatment. None of the authors analysed their data according to an intention-to-treat principle. Furthermore, large numbers of patients excluded from analysis after randomisation invalidates the results. <BR/> <BR/>The mean duration of the trials ranged widely between 18 months and 4.5 years. In view of the aim of BR/LD combination therapy in delaying the onset of motor complications, short trials (less than one year) are of limited value. Relevant differences between the trials emerged concerning participants' mean age (57.6 to 67.5 years), the rate by which BR was introduced in the titration phase and the maximum achieved daily dose of LD (62.5 to 1000 mg) and BR (5 to 50 mg). Such differences are likely to influence the performance of trials, the occurrence of adverse events and, consequently, the withdrawal rate. Moreover, the included studies used a wide range of methods to assess the various aspects of motor complications and applied different impairment and disability scales. Definitions of outcomes (e.g. motor complications) were not clearly stated for all trials. Some of the differences in outcome frequencies are probably due to varying definitions. Only one of the included trials reported whether scores of impairment and disability levels referred to the on or the off phase.</P>
<P>In view of the methodological differences between the studies it was impossible to perform a quantitative meta-analysis. We therefore evaluated the studies for possible sources of methodological (differences in study design) and clinical heterogeneity (differences between studies in participants characteristics, interventions or outcome measures). </P>
<P>During LD treatment of patients with PD, wearing-off is the first and most frequent off-related motor complication to occur. Surprisingly, only two trials evaluated this and found no consistent difference between the two arms (<LINK REF="STD-Alarc_x00f3_n-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Alarcón 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gim_x00e9_nez-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Giménez 1997</LINK>). Of three trials that evaluated on-off fluctuations (<LINK REF="STD-Alarc_x00f3_n-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Alarcón 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gim_x00e9_nez-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Giménez 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Przuntek-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Przuntek 1996</LINK>), only one showed a significant difference in favour of the combination arm at two-years follow up (<LINK REF="STD-Przuntek-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Przuntek 1996</LINK>). At this stage of the study, the patients in the combination therapy group required about 50% of the dosage of LD used in the monotherapy arm. Subsequently, the difference in the daily doses of LD between the arms decreased as the study continued. Two studies that evaluated the severity of motor complications found no significant difference between the two arms (<LINK REF="STD-Przuntek-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Przuntek 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weiner-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Weiner 1993</LINK>). Only one out of five trials found a statistically significant lower occurrence of dyskinesias in the combination therapy arm (<LINK REF="STD-Gim_x00e9_nez-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Giménez 1997</LINK>). Although differences in trial design and titration schedules might have resulted in this finding, a more likely explanation is the difference between both arms concerning the amount of LD used. Compared with the remaining four trials, the LD group in the first study used much more LD (more than 200 mg) than the combination arm (<LINK REF="STD-Gim_x00e9_nez-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Giménez 1997</LINK>). Dystonia, evaluated in four trials, showed no difference between both arms (<LINK REF="STD-Alarc_x00f3_n-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Alarcón 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gim_x00e9_nez-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Giménez 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Herskovits-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Herskovits 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weiner-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Weiner 1993</LINK>). </P>
<P>Overall, six trials evaluated the elementary motor features of PD, with 3 reporting a statistically significant difference in favour of the BR/LD combination arm (<LINK REF="STD-Alarc_x00f3_n-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Alarcón 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gim_x00e9_nez-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Giménez 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olsson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Olsson 1990</LINK>). Of five trials that evaluated disability, only two reported a statistically significant difference in favour of the combination arm (<LINK REF="STD-Alarc_x00f3_n-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Alarcón 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bakheit-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bakheit 1990</LINK>). </P>
<P>All studies reported the incidence of side effects and found no significant differences. A few withdrawals occurred because of an inadequate therapeutic response or intolerable side effects; there were no differences between groups. The difference in the daily dose of LD between trial arms varied considerably. Although in three trials BR was LD sparing (<LINK REF="STD-Bakheit-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bakheit 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gim_x00e9_nez-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Giménez 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Przuntek-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Przuntek 1996</LINK>), in three others there was little difference or, indeed, more LD was given in the BR/LD arm.</P>
<P>Numerous reviews have been published discussing the role of BR as an approach to delaying or preventing the onset of motor complications in PD, but this issue has remained controversial (<LINK REF="REF-Ahlskog-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahlskog 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Factor-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Factor 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goetz-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goetz 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hoehn-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoehn 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lieberman-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lieberman 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ogawa-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ogawa 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Watts-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watts 1997</LINK>). This systematic review identified important sources of heterogeneity in the seven eligible trials as well as methodological deficits that may have hampered the detection of possible differences between the two treatment arms. On the other hand, most of the studies used an open design, which could have contributed to results in favour of the early combination therapy, which we did not find. Thus, the current data show no evidence of consistent differences concerning the occurrence and severity of motor complications, scores of impairment and disability, and side effects between treatment groups. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>On searching the literature from 1974 to April 2007, seven RCTs were identified that evaluated the efficacy of BR/LD combination therapy for delaying the onset of motor complications associated with LD therapy in patients with PD. </P>
<P>Methodological problems and incomparability of studies precluded the pooling of data in a meta-analysis. Nevertheless,the results of re-analyses of the available data are limited and conflicting, and as yet there is no convincing evidence to support or refute the widespread use of combined BR/LD therapy early in the disease. A possible explanation for the failure of this strategy could be found in the fact that the majority of the trials did not aim at a reduction of LD dose. Moreover, because in the majority of the identified trials only a small difference in the dose of LD used was found between the two arms, the additional costs associated with a combination therapy argue against this strategy. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>This review emphasises methodological shortcomings in the seven identified BR/LD combination trials. The issues arising from this review have a significant bearing on the conduct of future dopamine agonist trials in this type of patient. There is a clear requirement to apply a uniform general and PD-related trial methodology. With respect to the former, our findings underscore the application of the guidelines suggested by the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT, <LINK REF="REF-Begg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begg 1996</LINK>) and in our previous review on BR as adjunctive therapy in late PD (<LINK REF="REF-Ramaker-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramaker 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Hilten-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Hilten 2000</LINK>).</P>

<REFERENCE NOTES="&lt;p&gt;JAPANESE STUDY - Cochrane Randomized controlled trial - early PD - RCT - BR vs LD - 88242641 Department of Neurology, Tsukuba University, Japan enf Switzerland Two prospective projects were started in May 1985 to evaluate the long-term effects of bromocriptine in patients with Parkinson's disease. One of the projects is to see if combination therapy with levodopa and bromocriptine is superior to levodopa alone with regard to the prevention of late side effects of levodopa therapy. The other is to see the long-term effects of bromocriptine monotherapy. Patients with Parkinson's disease were allocated randomly to either combination or levodopa group in the first project. Parkinsonian symptoms, disabilities of daily life and severity of late side effects of long-term levodopa therapy were evaluated by a semiquantitative rating scale. This communication represents the first interim report. Methods of the studies and synopsis of the results at the end of the 12th month are described. A total of 702 patients was enrolled in the study (combination therapy, n = 216; levodopa therapy, n = 200, bromocriptine monotherapy, n = 286). At the end of the 12th month, the numbers of patients who dropped out from the study were 19, 16 and 55 in the three groups, respectively. It appears to be too early to make any definite conclusion with regard to which mode of treatment is superior, however, some evidence suggesting a superiority of the combination therapy over levodopa alone was noted in managing wearing-off phenomenon and dyskinesia. As many patients are sticking to the originally intended mode of treatment, it appears to be possible to obtain more meaningful data in several years 0 (Levodopa) 25614-03-3 (Bromocriptine) 0014-3022 Clinical Trial Journal Article Randomized Controlled Trial English 8809&lt;/p&gt;" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">

It has been suggested that treatment with this regimen would prevent or delay the onset of motor fluctuations and dyskinesia. Thus, some have recommended it as a standard of care. This recommendation is based on the theory that LD may accelerate the progression of PD and clinical experience using Br monotherapy in early Parkinson's disease, which suggested that Br causes fewer late complications. This article reviews these arguments and shows that the theories are unproven. A single, uncontrolled trial is often referred to as evidence for efficacy of early combination therapy. We critically review this and five other studies which have evaluated the treatment strategy. We show that the literature is often misleading and that these trials do not support the efficacy of early combination therapy. We conclude that there is no justifiable reason to use a combination of Br and LD in early parkinsonian patients&lt;/p&gt;" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">

The semisynthetic ergoline, pergolide, the partial ergoline, LY 141865 and the 8-alpha-aminoergoline, CU 32-085 were found to be effective antitremor agents in monkeys with ventromedial tegmental lesions. The administration of pergolide or LY 141865 results in a relief of tremor with a concomitant occurrence of severe abnormal involuntary movements, while the administration of CU 32-085 results in a relief of tremor with the occurrence of only minor abnormal involuntary movements. Clinical studies have revealed that pergolide is an effective drug in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, and it reduces the &amp;quot;on-off&amp;quot; phenomena. The possible regulation of dopamine neurotransmission by the norepinephrine neuronal systems was reviewed. Preliminary data suggest that clonidine may interact with presynaptic dopamine receptors.

Phases of immobility and incapacity associated with depression alternate with jubilant thaws. Both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors are involved in its pathogenesis, but evidence is presented to indicate that the importance of levodopa handling has been underestimated and that progressive reduction in the storage capacity of surviving nigrostriatal dopamine terminals is not a critical factor. Re- distribution of levodopa dosage which may mean smaller, more frequent doses, or larger less frequent increments, may be helpful in controlling oscillations in some patients. Dietary protein restriction, the use of selegiline hydrochloride and bromocriptine may also temporarily improve motor fluctuations. New approaches to management include the use of subcutaneous apomorphine, controlled-release preparations of levodopa with a peripheral dopa decarboxylase inhibitor and the continuous intra-duodenal administration of levodopa&lt;/p&gt;" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">

One hundred and twenty-five patients showed an initial improvement of their individual total disability scores exceeding 25 per cent, but after six years of sustained treatment only 37 patients still obtained similar benefit. By 1978 only five patients had maintained their initial improvement compared to 69 patients after two years therapy; however, 47 patients were still better than before treatment. The overall mortality ratio--the ratio of observed to expected death rate--for all the patients was 1.45:1. In those patients who unable to tolerate levodopa for longer than two years the ratio was 2.38:1; in those who were able to tolerate sustained medication, life expectancy was normal (ratio of 0.91:1 for males and 1.14:1 for females). Involuntary movements were the commonest complication of treatment. Three main types were distinguished. Peak dose dyskinesias, beginning 20 to 90 minutes after an oral dose and most severe midway through the inter-dose period, affected 80 per cent of patients. Early morning and end-of-dose dystonia occurred in 20 per cent of patients and biphasic dyskinesia--two distinct episodes of involuntary movements within each inter-dose period--was the least common pattern affecting 3 per cent of patients. Involuntary movements increased in frequency and severity as treatment continued. End-of-dose deterioration ('wearing- off' effect of individual doses) occurred in 65 per cent of patients: unpredictable oscillations in motor performance (the 'on-off' phenomenon) unrelated to the time and dosage of levodopa, occurred in 10 per cent. Psychiatric side effects included toxic confusional states, visual pseudohallucinations and paranoid psychoses and constituted the most frequent reason for stopping medication. Forty (22 per cent) of the patients had suffered severe depression before the onset of disease and levodopa had no sustained antidepressant effect in this group. After six years of treatment with levodopa, 32 per cent of the patients had unequivocal dementia. PMID- 0007465763&lt;/p&gt;" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">
